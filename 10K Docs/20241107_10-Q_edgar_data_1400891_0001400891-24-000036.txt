 Economic Conditions 
 The Company's advertising revenue, cash flows, and cost of capital are impacted by changes in economic conditions. Higher interest rates and inflation have contributed to a challenging macroeconomic environment since 2022. This challenging environment has led to broader market uncertainty which has impacted the Company's revenues and cash flows. The current market uncertainty and macroeconomic conditions, a recession, or a downturn in the U.S. economy could have a significant impact on the Company's ability to generate revenue and cash flows. 
 The challenging environment has resulted in lower advertising spending by businesses and has delayed our expected recovery. In addition, this economic uncertainty has had a significant impact on the trading values of the Company's debt and equity securities for a sustained period. The Company therefore performed an interim impairment test as of June 30, 2024 on the goodwill recorded in its reporting units, as well as its indefinite-lived Federal Communication Commission ("FCC") licenses. The June 30, 2024 testing resulted in non-cash impairment charges of million and million to reduce the goodwill and FCC license balances, respectively. The Company performs its annual impairment test on goodwill and indefinite-lived FCC licenses, as of July 1 of each year. impairment was required in the third quarter as part of the 2024 annual impairment testing. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents, and the million senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility entered into on May 17, 2022 (the "ABL Facility") had a facility size of million, outstanding borrowings and million of outstanding letters of credit, resulting in million of borrowing base availability. The Company's total available liquidity as of September 30, 2024 was million. Based on current available liquidity, the Company expects to be able to meet its obligations as they become due over the coming year.

 of our broadcast tower sites and related assets for million and entered into operating leases for the use of space on of the broadcast tower sites and related assets sold. The Company realized a net loss of million on the sale, which was recorded in Other Operating Expense, net in the Statement of Comprehensive Loss. The leases are for an initial term of and include optional renewal periods. In connection with the transaction, the Company recorded ROU assets and lease liabilities with aggregate values of million related to these leases. 
 The Company tests for impairment of assets whenever events and circumstances indicate that such assets might be impaired. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized non-cash impairment charges of million due to changes in sublease assumptions for ROU assets related to certain operating leases for which management has made proactive decisions to abandon and sublease in connection with strategic actions to streamline the Company s real estate footprint. There were lease impairments recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2024. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized non-cash impairment charges of million and million, respectively, due to changes in sublease assumptions for ROU assets. 
 The implicit rate within the Company's lease agreements is generally not determinable. As such, the Company uses the incremental borrowing rate ("IBR") to determine the present value of lease payments at the commencement of the lease. The IBR, as defined in ASC 842, is "the rate of interest that a lessee would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment."

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 Format of Presentation 
 Management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations MD A should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related footnotes contained in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q of iHeartMedia, Inc. (the "Company," "iHeartMedia," "we," "our," or "us"). 
 We report based on three reporting segments: 
 the Multiplatform Group, which includes our Broadcast radio, Networks and Sponsorships and Events businesses; 
 the Digital Audio Group, which includes our Digital businesses, including Podcasting; and 
 the Audio Media Services Group, which includes Katz Media Group Katz Media ), our full-service media representation business, and RCS Sound Software ("RCS"), a provider of scheduling and broadcast software and services. 
 These reporting segments reflect how senior management operates the Company. This structure provides visibility into the underlying performance, results, and margin profiles of our distinct businesses and enables senior management to monitor trends at the operational level and address opportunities or issues as they arise via regular review of segment-level results and forecasts with operational leaders. 
 
 Our segment profitability metric is Segment Adjusted EBITDA, which is reported to the Company's Chief Operating Decision Maker for purposes of making decisions about allocation of resources to, and assessing performance of, each reportable segment. Segment Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as Revenue less operating expenses, excluding Restructuring expenses (as defined below) and share-based compensation expenses. 
 
 We believe the presentation of our results by segment provides insight into our broadcast radio business and our digital business. We believe that our ability to generate cash flow from operations from our businesses and our current cash on hand will provide sufficient resources to fund and operate our business, fund capital expenditures and other obligations and make interest payments on our long-term debt for at least the next twelve months. 
 Description of our Business 
 Our strategy centers on delivering entertaining and informative content where our listeners want to find us across our various platforms. 
 Multiplatform Group 
 
 The primary source of revenue for our Multiplatform Group is from selling local and national advertising time on our radio stations, with contracts typically less than one year in duration. The programming formats of our radio stations are designed to reach audiences with targeted demographic characteristics. We work closely with our advertising and marketing partners to develop tools and leverage data to enable advertisers to effectively reach their desired audiences. Our Multiplatform Group also generates revenue from network syndication, nationally recognized events and other miscellaneous transactions. 
 
 Management looks at our Multiplatform Group's operations overall revenue as well as the revenue from each revenue stream including Broadcast Radio, Networks, and Sponsorship and Events. We periodically review and refine our selling structures in all regions and markets in an effort to maximize the value of our offering to advertisers and, therefore, our revenue. 
 
 Management also looks at Multiplatform Group's revenue by region and market size. Typically, larger markets can reach larger audiences with wider demographics than smaller markets. Additionally, management reviews our share of audio advertising revenues in markets where such information is available, as well as our share of target demographics listening in an average quarter hour. This metric gauges how well our formats are attracting and retaining listeners. 
 
 Management also monitors revenue generated through our programmatic ad-buying platform, and our data analytics advertising product, to measure the success of our enhanced marketing optimization tools. We have made significant 
 22 

investments so we can provide the same ad-buying experience that once was only available from digital-only companies and enable our clients to better understand how our assets can successfully reach their target audiences. 
 
 Management monitors average advertising rates and cost per mille, the cost of every 1,000 advertisement impressions, which are principally based on the length of the spot and how many people in a targeted audience listen to our stations, as measured by an independent ratings service. In addition, our advertising rates are influenced by the time of day the advertisement airs, with morning and evening drive-time hours typically priced the highest. Our price and yield information systems enable our station managers and sales teams to adjust commercial inventory and pricing based on local market demand, as well as to manage and monitor different commercial durations in order to provide more effective advertising for our customers at what we believe are optimal prices given market conditions. Yield is measured by management in a variety of ways, including revenue earned divided by minutes of advertising sold. 
 
 A portion of our Multiplatform Group segment s expenses vary in connection with changes in revenue. These variable expenses primarily relate to costs in our programming and sales departments, including profit sharing fees, and commissions. 
 
 Digital Audio Group 
 
 The primary source of revenue in the Digital Audio Group segment is the sale of advertising on our podcast network, iHeartRadio mobile application and website, and station websites. Revenues for digital advertising are recognized over time based on impressions delivered or time elapsed, depending upon the terms of the contract. Digital Audio Group s contracts with advertisers are typically a year or less in duration and are generally billed monthly upon satisfaction of the performance obligations. 
 
 Through our Digital Audio Group, we continue to expand the choices for listeners. We derive revenue in this segment by developing and delivering our content and selling advertising across multiple digital distribution channels, including via our iHeartRadio mobile application, our station websites and other digital platforms that reach national, regional and local audiences. 
 
 Our strategy has enabled us to extend our leadership in the growing podcasting sector, and iHeartMedia is the number one podcast publisher in America. Our reach now extends across more than 500 platforms and thousands of different connected devices, and our digital business is comprised of podcasting, streaming, subscription, display advertisements, and other content that is disseminated over digital platforms. 
 
 A portion of our Digital Audio Group segment s expenses vary in connection with changes in revenue. These variable expenses primarily relate to our content costs including profit sharing fees and third-party content costs, as well as sales commissions. Certain of our content costs, including digital music performance royalties, vary with the volume of listening hours on our digital platforms. 
 
 Audio Media Services Group 
 
 Audio Media Services Group revenue is generated by services provided to broadcast industry participants through our Katz Media and RCS businesses. As a media representation firm, Katz Media generates revenue via commissions on media sold on behalf of the radio and television stations that it represents, while RCS generates revenue by providing broadcast software and media streaming, along with research services for radio stations, broadcast television stations, cable channels, record labels, ad agencies and Internet stations worldwide. 
 
 Economic Conditions 
 
 Our advertising revenue, cash flows, and cost of capital are impacted by changes in economic conditions. Higher interest rates and inflation have contributed to a challenging macroeconomic environment since 2022. This challenging environment has led to broader market uncertainty which has impacted our revenues and cash flows. The current market uncertainty and macroeconomic conditions, a recession, or a downturn in the U.S. economy could have a significant impact on our ability to generate revenue and cash flows. 
 
 Cost Savings Initiatives 
 In the first three quarters of 2024, we implemented operating expense savings initiatives to change and streamline our organization, increase automation and use of technology, examine our sourcing strategies, and leverage our scale to drive 
 23 

greater efficiency. We have incurred certain costs in connection with executing on these initiatives and we continue to explore opportunities for further efficiencies. 
 
 Impairment Charges 
 
 Economic uncertainty due to inflation and higher interest rates since 2022 has resulted in, among other things, lower advertising spending by businesses. This economic uncertainty has delayed our expected recovery and has had an adverse impact on the Company's revenues, cash flows, and the trading values of the Company's debt and equity securities for a sustained period. This challenging environment could continue to have a significant impact on our financial results. We therefore performed interim impairment tests as of June 30, 2024 on our indefinite-lived Federal Communication Commission ("FCC") licenses and goodwill. The June 30, 2024 testing resulted in non-cash impairment charges of 304.1 million and 616.1 million to reduce the FCC license and goodwill balances, respectively. 
 
 We perform our annual impairment test on goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including FCC licenses, as of July 1 of each year. No impairment was required as part of the 2024 or 2023 annual impairment testing. 
 
 24

Consolidated results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the consolidated results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 were as follows: 
 Revenue 
 Consolidated revenue increased 55.1 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023 primarily due to increases in Digital Audio Group revenue and political revenue as 2024 is a presidential election year. Multiplatform Group revenue decreased 6.8 million, or 1.1 , primarily resulting from a decrease in broadcast advertising in connection with continued uncertain market conditions, partially offset by increases in political revenues and non-cash trade revenues. Digital Audio Group revenue increased 33.8 million, or 12.7 , driven primarily by continuing increases in demand for digital advertising. Audio Media Services revenue increased 28.1 million, or 45.3 , primarily as a result of higher political revenue and an increase in digital revenue. 
 Consolidated revenue increased 52.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023. Multiplatform Group revenue decreased 62.4 million, or 3.6 , primarily resulting from a decrease in broadcast advertising in connection with continued uncertain market conditions, partially offset by increases in political revenues as 2024 is a presidential election year, and non-cash trade revenues. Digital Audio Group revenue increased 74.2 million, or 9.9 , driven primarily by continuing increases in demand for digital advertising, including podcast. Audio Media Services revenue increased 40.2 million, or 21.2 , primarily as a result of higher political revenue, as well as digital revenue and contract termination fees earned by Katz Media. 
 Direct Operating Expenses 
 Consolidated direct operating expenses increased 29.7 million, or 7.8 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023. The increase was primarily driven by higher variable content costs, including higher third-party digital costs and podcast profit sharing expenses related to the increase in digital revenues. 
 Consolidated direct operating expenses increased 53.5 million, or 5.0 , during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023. The increase was primarily driven by higher variable content costs, including higher podcast profit sharing expenses and third-party digital costs related to the increase in digital revenues. 
 Selling, General and Administrative SG A Expenses 
 Consolidated SG A expenses increased 25.2 million, or 6.4 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023. The increase was driven primarily by higher non-cash trade expense related to the 2024 Summer Olympics and the 2024 iHeartRadio Music Festival and an increase in costs incurred in connection with executing on our cost savings initiatives. 
 Consolidated SG A expenses increased 45.4 million, or 3.8 , during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023. The increase was driven primarily by higher non-cash trade expense related to the 2024 iHeartRadio Music Awards, the 2024 Summer Olympics, and the 2024 iHeartRadio Music Festival, as well as an increase in certain costs incurred in connection with executing on our cost savings initiatives, partially offset by lower bonus expense based on results and lower bad debt expense. 
 Depreciation and Amortization 
 Depreciation and amortization decreased 5.1 million and 12.2 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods of 2023, respectively, primarily as a result of a lower fixed asset base due to lower levels of capital expenditures. 
 
 27 

Impairment Charges 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded non-cash impairment charges of 922.1 million and 965.1 million, respectively, primarily to reduce the carrying values of our indefinite-lived FCC licenses and our goodwill to their estimated fair values as a result of the interim impairment assessments performed in the second quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively. The impairment charges resulted from the economic uncertainty due to inflation and higher interest rates that has had an adverse impact on our results and has resulted in a significant decrease in the trading values of our debt and equity securities for a sustained period. 
 We perform our annual impairment test on our goodwill and FCC licenses as of July 1 of each year. No impairment was required as part of the 2024 or 2023 annual impairment tests for our goodwill or FCC licenses. 
 Interest Expense, net 
 Interest expense decreased 3.8 million and 6.9 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods of 2023 primarily as a result of the lower outstanding aggregate principal of iHeartCommunications, Inc.'s 8.375 Senior Unsecured Notes due 2027 due to the repurchases of 204.0 million of the notes for 147.3 million in cash during 2023. 
 Gain (Loss) on Investments, Net 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a gain on investments, net of 91.5 million, primarily due to the 101.4 million gain recognized on the sale of our investment in Broadcast Music, Inc. ("BMI") in the first quarter of 2024, partially offset by declines in the value of certain investments. 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recogn ized a loss on in vestments, net of 7.4 million and 19.9 million, respectively, related to declines in the value of certain investments. 
 Gain on Extinguishment of Debt 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized a gain on extinguishment of debt of 23.9 million in connection with the open market repurchases of 89.1 million aggregate principal amount of iHeartCommunications, Inc.'s 8.375 Senior Unsecured Notes due 2027 for 65.2 million in cash. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized a gain on extinguishment of debt of 51.5 million in connection with the open market repurchases of 189.0 million aggregate principal amount of iHeartCommunications, Inc.'s 8.375 Senior Unsecured Notes due 2027 for 137.5 million in cash. There were no repurchases during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Income Tax Benefit (Expense) 
 The effective tax rates for the Company for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were (101.7) and 2.2 , respectively. The three month effective tax rate was primarily impacted by changes in the forecasted increase in valuation allowances recorded against certain deferred tax assets, related primarily to disallowed interest expense carryforwards due to uncertainty regarding the Company s ability to utilize those assets in future periods. The nine month effective tax rate was primarily impacted by impairment charges to non-deductible goodwill recorded during the second quarter of 2024, as discussed in Note 4, Property, Plant and Equipment, Intangible Assets and Goodwill . 
 The effective tax rates for the Company for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 were 50.8 and 2.6 , respectively. The three month effective tax rate was primarily impacted by the forecasted increase in valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets, related primarily to disallowed interest expense carryforwards, due to uncertainty regarding the Company's ability to utilize those assets in future periods. The nine month effective tax rate was primarily impacted by impairment charges to non-deductible goodwill recorded in the second quarter of 2023. 
 28 

Net Loss Attributable to the Company 
 Net loss attributable to the Company of 41.3 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 reflected an increase of 32.2 million compared to Net loss attributable to the Company of 9.1 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to changes in the valuation allowances recorded against certain deferred tax assets as discussed above. 
 Net loss attributable to the Company of 1,041.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 reflected an improvement of 74.4 million compared to Net loss attributable to the Company of 1,115.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the 101.4 million gain recognized on the sale of our investment in BMI in the first quarter of 2024.

 204,585 203,782 459,409 488,386 
 (1) We define Adjusted EBITDA as consolidated Operating income (loss) adjusted to exclude restructuring expenses included within Direct operating expenses and SG A expenses, and share-based compensation expenses included within SG A expenses, as well as the following line items presented in our Statements of Operations: Depreciation and amortization, Impairment charges and Other operating expense. Alternatively, Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as Net loss, adjusted to exclude Income tax (benefit) expense, Interest expense, net, Depreciation and amortization, (Gain) loss on investments, net, Gain on extinguishment of debt, Other (income) expense, net, Equity in loss of nonconsolidated affiliates, Impairment charges, Other operating expense, Share-based compensation expense, and restructuring expenses. Restructuring expenses primarily include expenses incurred in connection with cost-saving initiatives, as well as certain expenses, which, in the view of management, are outside the ordinary course of business or otherwise not representative of the Company's operations during a normal business cycle. We use Adjusted EBITDA, among other measures, to evaluate the Company s operating performance. This measure is among the primary measures used by management for the planning 
 31 

and forecasting of future periods, as well as for measuring performance for compensation of executives and other members of management. We believe this measure is an important indicator of our operational strength and performance of our business because it provides a link between operational performance and operating income. It is also a primary measure used by management in evaluating companies as potential acquisition targets. We believe the presentation of this measure is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by management. We believe it helps improve investors ability to understand our operating performance and makes it easier to compare our results with other companies that have different capital structures or tax rates. In addition, we believe this measure is also among the primary measures used externally by our investors, analysts and peers in our industry for purposes of valuation and comparing our operating performance to other companies in our industry. Since Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, it should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, operating loss or net loss as an indicator of operating performance and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA is not necessarily a measure of our ability to fund our cash needs. Because it excludes certain financial information compared with operating income and compared with consolidated net income (loss), the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, users of this financial information should consider the types of events and transactions which are excluded.

 73,345 67,651 (1,957) (31,498) 
 (1) We define Free cash flow ("Free Cash Flow") as Cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures, which is disclosed as Purchases of property, plant and equipment in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. We use Free Cash Flow, among other measures, to evaluate the Company s liquidity and its ability to generate cash flow. We believe that Free Cash Flow is meaningful to investors because we review cash flows generated from operations after taking into consideration capital expenditures due to the fact that these expenditures are considered to be a necessary component of ongoing operations. In addition, we believe that Free Cash Flow helps improve investors' ability to compare our liquidity with other companies. Since Free Cash Flow is not a measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, it should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, Cash provided by (used for) operating activities and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. Free Cash Flow is not necessarily a measure of our ability to fund our cash needs. 
 Share-Based Compensation Expense 
 On April 21, 2021, our 2021 Long-Term Incentive Award Plan (the "2021 Plan") was approved by stockholders and replaced the prior plan. On February 23, 2023, our Board adopted an amendment to the 2021 Plan, which provided for an increase to the shares authorized for issuance under the 2021 Plan. At our 2023 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, the amendment was approved. Pursuant to our 2021 Plan, we may grant restricted stock units and options to purchase shares of the Company's Class A common stock to certain key individuals. 
 
 Share-based compensation expenses are recorded in SG A expenses and were 8.3 million and 8.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Share-based compensation expenses were 24.0 million and 27.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, there was 38.1 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested share-based compensation arrangements with vesting based solely on service conditions. This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 1.6 years and assumes Performance RSUs will be fully earned at target. See Note 8 , Stockholders' Deficit , for more information.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Cash Flows 
 The following discussion highlights cash flow activities during the periods presented: 
 (In thousands) Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Cash provided by (used for): Operating activities 70,217 58,958 Investing activities 23,517 (39,991) Financing activities (8,443) (141,957) Free Cash Flow (1) 
 (1,957) (31,498) 
 (1) For a definition of Free Cash Flow and a reconciliation to Cash provided by operating activities, the most closely comparable GAAP measure, please see Reconciliation of Cash provided by operating activities to Free Cash Flow in this MD A. 
 Operating Activities 
 Cash provided by operating activities was 70.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 59.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to an improvement in the timing of receivable collections and timing of payable payments, largely offset by a decrease in revenue from our Multiplatform Group, and an increase in cash bonus payments in 2024 compared to 2023. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 Cash provided by investing activities of 23.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily reflects 101.4 million of proceeds received from the sale of our investment in BMI, partially offset by 72.2 million in cash used for capital expenditures. For capital expenditures during the period, we spent 38.2 million in our Multiplatform Group segment primarily related to our IT infrastructure and real estate optimization initiatives, 17.0 million in our Digital Audio Group segment primarily related to IT infrastructure, 5.8 million in our Audio Media Services Group segment, primarily related to software, and 11.1 million in Corporate primarily related to equipment and software purchases. 
 
 Cash used for investing activities of 40.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily reflects 90.4 million in cash used for capital expenditures. For capital expenditures during the period, we spent 52.1 million in our Multiplatform Group segment primarily related to our real estate optimization initiatives, 17.3 million in our Digital Audio Group segment primarily related to IT infrastructure, 6.3 million in our Audio Media Services Group segment, primarily related to software, and 14.7 million in Corporate primarily related to equipment and software purchases. This was partially offset by the proceeds from the disposal of assets, which mainly consisted of 45.3 million related to the sale of broadcast tower sites and related assets. We are leasing back space on the broadcast towers and related assets under long-term operating leases. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 Cash used for financing activities totaled 8.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to distributions to noncontrolling interest holders . 
 
 Cash used for financing activities totaled 142.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to the repurchases of 189.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 8.375 Senior Unsecured Notes due 2027 for 137.5 million in cash, reflecting a discounted purchase price from the face value of the notes. 
 
 33 

Sources of Liquidity and Anticipated Cash Requirements 
 Our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, which consisted of cash and cash equivalents of 431.8 million as of September 30, 2024, cash flows from operations and borrowing capacity under our 450.0 million senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility entered into on May 17, 2022 (as amended from time to time, the "ABL Facility"). As of September 30, 2024, iHeartCommunications had no amounts outstanding under the ABL Facility, a facility size of 450.0 million and 23.7 million in outstanding letters of credit, resulting in 426.3 million of borrowing base availability. Our total available liquidity 1 as of September 30, 2024 was 858.1 million. 
 
 In September 2023, we sold 122 of our broadcast tower sites and related assets for net proceeds of 45.3 million. We simultaneously leased back space on 121 of the broadcast towers and related assets under long-term operating leases. 
 
 We regularly evaluate the impact of economic conditions on our business. A challenging macroeconomic environment has led to market uncertainty which has continued to negatively impact 2024 revenues and cash flows. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our consolidated revenues increased compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to revenue growth in our Digital Audio Group, as well as political revenue, partially offset by lower revenue in our Multiplatform Group, among other factors discussed in the Results of Operations section of the MD A. Although we cannot predict future economic conditions or the impact of any potential contraction of economic growth on our business, we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to continue to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months. 
 
 We are a party to many contractual obligations involving commitments to make payments to third parties. These obligations impact our short-term and long-term liquidity and capital resource needs. Certain contractual obligations are reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2024, while others are considered future commitments. Our contractual obligations primarily consist of long-term debt and related interest payments, commitments under non-cancelable operating lease agreements, and employment and talent contracts. In addition to our contractual obligations, we expect that our primary anticipated uses of liquidity in 2024 will be to fund our working capital and maintain operations, make interest and tax payments, fund capital expenditures, make voluntary debt repayments and pursue other strategic opportunities. 
 
 Assuming the current level of borrowings and interest rates in effect at September 30, 2024, we anticipate that we will have approximately 85.4 million of cash interest payments in the remainder of 2024 compared to 88.5 million of cash interest payments during the same period in 2023, primarily due to lower interest rates on our floating rate. Future increases in interest rates could have a significant impact on our cash interest payments. 
 
 We acknowledge the challenges posed by the market uncertainty as a result of global economic and geopolitical conditions, current levels of interest rates, the continuing impact of inflation on consumer spending and in turn, advertising spend, and other macroeconomic trends. However, we remain confident in our business, our employees and our strategy. Further, we believe our available liquidity will allow us to fund capital expenditures and other obligations and make interest payments on our long-term debt. If these sources of liquidity need to be augmented, additional cash requirements would likely be financed through the issuance of debt or equity securities; however, there can be no assurances that we will be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on acceptable terms or at all in the future. 
 
 We frequently evaluate strategic opportunities. We expect from time to time to pursue other strategic opportunities such as acquisitions or disposals of certain businesses, which may or may not be material. 
 
 Transaction Support Agreement and Exchange Offer 
 
 On November 6, 2024, we entered into a Transaction Support Agreement (the TSA with certain lenders and holders (or their managers, advisors, or sub-advisors) of iHeartCommunications' outstanding notes and term loans (collectively, the Supporting Holders ). The Supporting Holders represent approximately 77 of the aggregate principal amount of iHeartCommunications outstanding senior secured notes due 2026, 79 of the aggregate principal amount of our outstanding senior secured notes due 2027, 38 of the aggregate principal amount of our outstanding senior secured notes due 2028, 71 of the aggregate principal amount of our outstanding senior unsecured notes due 2027, and 92 of the aggregate principal amount of our outstanding term loans (collectively, the Existing Debt ). 
 
 We and the Supporting Holders have agreed to the terms of, and to support, (i) exchange offer transactions that will be offered to all holders of the Existing Debt, consisting of two alternative exchange transaction structures, each of which will extend the maturity of the Existing Debt tendered in the exchange offer transactions by three years, and (ii) concurrent consent solicitations to amend certain provisions in the indentures and credit agreement governing the Existing Debt. In the first 
 
 1 Total available liquidity is defined as cash and cash equivalents plus available borrowings under the ABL Facility. We use total available liquidity to evaluate our capacity to access cash to meet obligations and fund operations. 
 34 

transaction structure, if certain thresholds of holder participation are met, iHeartCommunications will issue new secured debt in exchange for the Existing Debt held by participating holders. Alternatively, if certain thresholds of holder participation are not met, newly-formed subsidiaries of the Company holding certain transferred assets and an intercompany note (to be issued by iHeartMedia + Entertainment, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of iHeartCommunications) will issue new secured debt in exchange for the Existing Debt held by participating holders. Completion of either exchange transaction will result in a strengthened financial position, providing us with additional flexibility to execute on our strategy and business initiatives. 
 
 The TSA may be terminated under various circumstances, including if the exchange offer transactions are not consummated on or before December 31, 2024, unless such date is extended pursuant to the terms of the TSA. 
 
 Concurrently with entry into the TSA, we also entered into an amendment to our ABL Facility (the ABL Amendment to, among other things, permit both exchange transaction alternatives and other transactions related to the exchange, amend certain of the covenants, default provisions contained therein, and increase the interest rate on the ABL Facility by (a) if the first transaction is consummated, 0.50 , and (b) if the alternative transaction is consummated, 1.00 . The amendments contained in the ABL Amendment will become effective upon the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions, including the consummation of one of the transactions contemplated by the TSA. We anticipate commencing the exchange offer in the near term. 
 
 The amount of anticipated cash payments will vary depending on the transaction structure and level of participation and will include partial cash consideration, accrued interest on participating debt, and transaction fees and expenses. We estimate total cash payments to range from 250 million to 295 million.

Summary Debt Capital Structure 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had the following debt outstanding, net of cash and cash equivalents: 
 (In thousands) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Term Loan Facility due 2026 1,864,032 1,864,032 Incremental Term Loan Facility due 2026 401,220 401,220 Asset-based Revolving Credit Facility due 2027 6.375 Senior Secured Notes due 2026 800,000 800,000 5.25 Senior Secured Notes due 2027 750,000 750,000 4.75 Senior Secured Notes due 2028 500,000 500,000 Other Secured Subsidiary Debt 3,076 3,367 Total Secured Debt 4,318,328 4,318,619 8.375 Senior Unsecured Notes due 2027 916,357 916,357 Other Subsidiary Debt 2,191 Original issue discount (5,213) (7,558) Long-term debt fees (9,816) (12,268) Total Debt 5,221,847 5,215,150 Less: Cash and cash equivalents 431,764 346,382 Net Debt 1

 1 Net Debt is a non-GAAP financial metric that is used by management and investors to assess our ability to meet financial obligations, including our ability to service our long-term debt obligations. We define Net Debt as Total Debt less Cash and cash equivalents. 
 
 Our ABL Facility contains a springing fixed charge coverage ratio that is effective if certain triggering events related to borrowing capacity under the ABL Facility occur. As of September 30, 2024, no triggering event had occurred and, as a result, we were not required to comply with any fixed charge coverage ratio as of or for the period ended September 30, 2024. Other than our ABL Facility, none of our long-term debt includes maintenance covenants that could trigger early repayment. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all covenants related to our debt agreements. For additional information regarding our debt, refer to Note 5, Long-Term Debt . 
 Our subsidiaries have from time to time repurchased certain debt obligations of iHeartCommunications, and may in the future, as part of various financing and investment strategies, purchase additional outstanding indebtedness of iHeartCommunications or its subsidiaries or our outstanding equity securities, in tender offers, open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. We or our subsidiaries may also sell certain assets, securities, or properties. These purchases or sales, if any, could have a material positive or negative impact on our liquidity available to repay outstanding debt obligations or on our consolidated results of operations. These transactions could also require or result in amendments to the agreements governing outstanding debt obligations or changes in our leverage or other financial ratios, which could have a material positive or negative impact on our ability to comply with the covenants contained in iHeartCommunications debt agreements. These transactions, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material. 
 
 Supplemental Financial Information under Debt Agreements 
 Pursuant to iHeartCommunications' material debt agreements, iHeartMedia Capital I, LLC ("Capital I"), the parent guarantor and a subsidiary of iHeartMedia, is permitted to satisfy its reporting obligations under such agreements by furnishing iHeartMedia s consolidated financial information and an explanation of the material differences between iHeartMedia s consolidated financial information, on the one hand, and the financial information of Capital I and its consolidated restricted subsidiaries, on the other hand. Because neither iHeartMedia nor iHeartMedia Capital II, LLC, a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of iHeartMedia and the parent of Capital I, have any operations or material assets or liabilities, there are no material differences between iHeartMedia s consolidated financial information for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and Capital I s and its consolidated restricted subsidiaries financial information for the same period. Further, as of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all covenants related to our debt agreements.

Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees 
 We are currently involved in certain legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business and, as required, have accrued our estimate of the probable costs for resolution of those claims for which the occurrence of loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. These estimates have been developed in consultation with counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. It is possible, however, that future results of operations for any particular period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings. Please refer to Legal Proceedings in Part II, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Certain agreements relating to acquisitions provide for purchase price adjustments and other future contingent payments based on the financial performance of the acquired companies generally over a one to five-year period. The aggregate of these contingent payments, if performance targets are met, would not significantly impact our financial position or results of operations. 
 We have future cash obligations under various types of contracts. We lease office space, certain broadcast facilities and equipment. Some of our lease agreements contain renewal options and annual rental escalation clauses (generally tied to the consumer price index), as well as provisions for our payment of utilities and maintenance. We also have non-cancellable contracts in our radio broadcasting operations related to program rights and music license fees. In the normal course of business, our broadcasting operations have minimum future payments associated with employee and talent contracts. These contracts typically contain cancellation provisions that allow us to cancel the contract with good cause. 
 
 SEASONALITY 
 Typically, our businesses experience their lowest financial performance in the first quarter of the calendar year. We expect this trend to continue in the future. Due to this seasonality and certain other factors, the results for the interim periods may not be indicative of results for the full year. In addition, we are impacted by political cycles and generally experience higher revenues in congressional election years, and particularly in presidential election years. This may affect the comparability of results between years. 

MARKET RISK 
 We are exposed to market risks arising from changes in market rates and prices, including movements in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and inflation. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 A significant amount of our long-term debt bears interest at variable rates. Additionally, certain assumptions used within management's estimates are impacted by changes in interest rates. Accordingly, our earnings will be affected by changes in interest rates. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 43 of our aggregate principal amount of long-term debt bore interest at floating rates. Assuming the current level of borrowings and assuming a 100 bps change in floating interest rates, it is estimated that our interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 would have changed by 17.2 million. 
 In the event of an adverse change in interest rates, management may take actions to mitigate our exposure. However, due to the uncertainty of the actions that would be taken and their possible effects, the preceding interest rate sensitivity analysis assumes no such actions. Further, the analysis does not consider the effects of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment. 
 Inflation 
 Inflation is a factor in our business, and we continue to seek ways to mitigate its effect. Inflation has affected our performance in terms of higher costs for employee compensation, equipment and third party services. Although we are unable to determine the exact impact of inflation, we believe the impact will continue to be immaterial considering the actions we may take in response to these higher costs that may arise as a result of inflation. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates that are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The result of these evaluations forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying 
 37 

values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such difference could be material. Other than the following, there have been no significant changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates disclosed in Critical Accounting Estimates of Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Economic uncertainty due to higher interest rates since 2022 has resulted in, among other things, lower advertising spending by businesses. This challenging environment has led to broader market uncertainty, and has delayed our expected recovery and has had an adverse impact on our revenue and cash flows. This challenging environment has impacted and could further have a significant impact on our financial results. In addition, the economic uncertainty has had a significant impact on the trading values of our debt and equity securities for a sustained period. As a result, we performed an impairment test as of June 30, 2024 on our indefinite-lived FCC licenses and goodwill. 
 
 Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets 
 
 Indefinite-lived intangible assets, such as our FCC licenses, are reviewed for impairment using the direct valuation method as prescribed in ASC 805-20-S99. Under the direct valuation method, the estimated fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets was calculated at the market level as prescribed by ASC 350-30-35. Under the direct valuation method, it is assumed that rather than acquiring indefinite-lived intangible assets as a part of a going concern business, the buyer hypothetically obtains indefinite-lived intangible assets and builds a new operation with similar attributes from scratch. Thus, the buyer incurs start-up costs during the build-up phase which are normally associated with going concern value. Initial capital costs are deducted from the discounted cash flows model, which results in value that is directly attributable to the indefinite-lived intangible assets. 
 
 Our key assumptions using the direct valuation method are market revenue growth rates, profit margin, and the risk-adjusted discount rate as well as other assumptions including market share, duration and profile of the build-up period, estimated start-up costs and capital expenditures. This data is populated using industry normalized information representing an average asset within a market. 
 
 On June 30, 2024, we performed an interim impairment test in accordance with ASC 350-30-35 and we concluded that a 304.1 million impairment of the indefinite-lived intangible assets was required. In determining the fair value of our FCC licenses, the following key assumptions were used: 
 
 Revenue forecasts published by BIA Financial Network, Inc. BIA ), varying by market, and revenue growth projections made by industry analysts were used for the initial five-year period; 
 2.0 over-the-air revenue growth and 3.0 digital revenue growth was assumed beyond the initial five-year period and 1.0 revenue growth was assumed in the terminal period; 
 Revenue was grown proportionally over a build-up period, reaching market revenue forecast by year 3; 
 Operating margins of 8.0 in the first year gradually climb to the industry average margin in year 3 of up to 16.3 , depending on market size; and 
 Assumed discount rates of 9.5 for large markets and 10.0 for small markets. 
 
 While we believe we have made reasonable estimates and utilized appropriate assumptions to calculate the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets, it is possible a material change could occur. If future results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates, we may be exposed to impairment charges in the future. The following table shows the decrease in the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets that would result from a 100 basis point decline in our discrete and terminal period revenue growth rate and profit margin assumptions and a 100 basis point increase in our discount rate assumption: 
 
 Impact on the Fair Value of our FCC Licenses due to 100 bps Change in: Revenue Growth Rate Profit Margin Discount Rate (in thousands) 123,114 120,132 142,164 
 
 At June 30, 2024, the carrying value of our FCC licenses was 809.9 million after the impairment of 304.1 million . An increase in discount rates, a decrease in revenue growth rates or profit margins, or a decrease in BIA revenue forecasts could result in additional impairment to our FCC licenses. 
 38 

Goodwill 
 
 We test goodwill at interim dates if events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired. The fair value of our reporting units is used to apply value to the net assets of each reporting unit. To the extent that the carrying amount of net assets would exceed the fair value, an impairment charge may be required to be recorded. The impairment testing performed as of June 30, 2024 has resulted in a decrease in the fair values of our reporting units. The carrying values of our Multiplatform and RCS reporting units exceeded their fair values. The fair values of our Digital and Katz reporting units exceeded their carrying values. 
 
 The valuation methodology we use for valuing goodwill involves considering the implied fair values of our reporting units based on market factors including the trading prices of our debt and equity securities, and estimating future cash flows expected to be generated from the related assets, discounted to their present values using a risk-adjusted discount rate. Terminal values are also estimated and discounted to their present values. 
 
 On June 30, 2024, we performed our interim impairment test in accordance with ASC 350-30-35, resulting in a 616.1 million impairment of goodwill. In determining the fair value of our reporting units, we considered industry and market factors including trading multiples of similar businesses and the trading prices of our debt and equity securities. For purposes of assessing the discounted future cash flows of our reporting units, we used the following assumptions: 
 
 Expected cash flows underlying our business plans for the periods 2024 through 2028. Our cash flow assumptions are based on detailed, multi-year forecasts performed by each of our operating reporting units and reflect the current advertising outlook across our businesses. 
 Revenues beyond 2028 are projected to grow at a perpetual growth rate, which we estimated at 1.0 for our Multiplatform Reporting unit (beyond 2033), 3.0 for our Digital Audio Reporting unit (beyond 2032), and 2.0 for our RCS and Katz Media Reporting units. 
 Profit margins beyond 2028 utilize the 2028 margin implied in the multi-year forecasts. 
 In order to risk adjust the cash flow projections in determining fair value, we utilized discounts rates between 17 and 20 for each of our reporting units. 
 
 While we believe we have made reasonable estimates and utilized appropriate assumptions to calculate the estimated fair value of our reporting units, it is possible a material change could occur. If future results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates, we may be exposed to additional impairment charges in the future. The following table shows the decline in the fair value of each of our reporting units that would result from a 100 basis point decline in our discrete and terminal period revenue growth rate and profit margin assumptions and a 100 basis point increase in our discount rate assumption: 
 
 (In thousands) Impact on the Fair Value of our Goodwill due to 100bps Change in: Reporting Unit Revenue Growth Rate Profit Margin Discount Rate Multiplatform 127,528 98,208 114,259 Digital 61,541 61,790 58,055 Katz Media 10,342 8,189 9,614 RCS 8,342 4,356 6,684 
 
 An increase in discount rates or a decrease in revenue growth rates or profit margins could result in additional impairment charges being required to be recorded for one or more of our reporting units.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 
 In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2024. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2024. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II -- OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 We are involved in a variety of legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business and a large portion of our litigation arises in the following contexts: commercial/contract disputes; defamation matters; employment and benefits related claims; intellectual property claims; real estate matters; governmental investigations; and tax disputes. As required, we have accrued an estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of those claims for which the occurrence of loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. These estimates have been developed in consultation with counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. It is possible, however, that future results of operations for any particular period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings. Additionally, due to the inherent uncertainty of litigation, there can be no assurance that the resolution of any particular claim or proceeding would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 Other than the below, there have been no material changes in our risk factors from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Our substantial indebtedness may adversely affect our financial health and operating flexibility. If we are unable to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Support Agreement, our financial condition and future operations may be adversely affected. 
 
 We currently have a 450.0 million undrawn senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility that matures in 2027, 4.3 billion in principal amount of secured debt, 3.1 billion of which matures in 2026, and 916.4 million in principal amount of unsecured debt that matures in 2027. This substantial amount of indebtedness could have important consequences to us, including: 
 
 increasing our vulnerability to adverse general economic, industry, or competitive developments; 
 requiring us to dedicate a more substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flows to fund working capital, investments, acquisitions, capital expenditures, and other general corporate purposes; 
 limiting our ability to make required payments under our existing contractual commitments, including our existing long-term indebtedness; 
 requiring us to sell certain assets; 
 restricting us from making strategic investments, including acquisitions, or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures; 
 limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; 
 placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; 
 causing us to incur substantial fees from time to time in connection with debt amendments or refinancings; 
 increasing our exposure to rising interest rates because a substantial portion of our borrowings is at variable interest rates; and 
 limiting our ability to borrow additional funds or to borrow on terms that are satisfactory to us. 
 
 On November 6, 2024, we entered into a Transaction Support Agreement (the TSA with certain lenders and holders (or their managers, advisors, or sub-advisors) of iHeartCommunications' outstanding notes and term loans (collectively, the Supporting Holders ). The Supporting Holders represent approximately 80 of the aggregate principal amount of iHeartCommunications outstanding notes and term loans (collectively, the Existing Debt ). 
 
 We and the Supporting Holders have agreed to the terms of, and to support, (i) exchange offer transactions that will be offered to all holders of the Existing Debt, consisting of two alternative exchange transaction structures, each of which will extend the maturity of the Existing Debt tendered in the exchange offer transactions by three years and (ii) concurrent consent solicitations to amend certain provisions in the indentures and credit agreement governing the Existing Debt. In the first transaction structure, if certain thresholds of holder participation are met, iHeartCommunications will issue new secured debt in 
 42 

exchange for the Existing Debt held by participating holders. Alternatively, if certain thresholds of holder participation are not met, newly-formed subsidiaries of the Company holding certain transferred assets and an intercompany note (to be issued by iHeartMedia + Entertainment, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of iHeartCommunications) will issue new secured debt in exchange for the Existing Debt held by participating holders. 
 
 There can be no assurance that we will complete the transactions contemplated by the TSA and if we do, whether we will obtain the benefits we expect therefrom. If we are unable to consummate the transactions contemplated by the TSA or otherwise generate sufficient cash flow to repay or refinance our debt on favorable terms, it could significantly and adversely affect our financial condition and the value of our outstanding debt. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. 
 
 The agreements governing the secured notes and term loans contemplated under the TSA will contain covenants restricting our or our subsidiaries ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, create liens on assets, engage in mergers, consolidations, liquidations and dissolutions, sell assets, pay dividends and distributions, make investments, loans, or advances, prepay certain junior indebtedness, engage in certain transactions with affiliates, amend material agreements governing certain junior indebtedness, and change lines of business. Although the covenants in our financing agreements are subject to various exceptions, these covenants are more restrictive than under our current financing agreements and we cannot assure you that these covenants will not adversely affect our ability to finance future operations, capital needs, or to engage in other activities that may be in our best interest. In addition, in certain circumstances, our long-term debt may require us to maintain specified financial ratios, which may require that we take action to reduce our debt or to act in a manner contrary to our business objectives. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our financing agreements. 
 
 In addition, we may be able to incur additional indebtedness in the future. To the extent we incur additional indebtedness, the risks associated with our leverage described above would increase. 
 
 The transactions contemplated by the TSA may not be consummated as scheduled or at all, and even if such transactions are consummated, we may not achieve their anticipated benefits. 
 We expect that the completion of the transactions contemplated by the TSA, if consummated, will result in a strengthened financial position, providing us with additional flexibility to execute on our strategy and business initiatives. However, transactions contemplated by the TSA are subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions and the TSA may be terminated under certain circumstances, including, among others, (i) a material breach by us or our subsidiaries party thereto of any of our representations, warranties, covenants or obligations set forth in the TSA that remains uncured within five business days after receipt of written notice; (ii) the occurrence and continuation, beyond any grace or cure period, of any events of default under our existing indentures and credit agreement; (iii) the occurrence of any event or condition (other than relating to the transactions or as contemplated under the TSA) that has had or would be reasonably expected to have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, assets or liabilities; or (iv) the issuance by any governmental authority of any final, unappealable ruling or order making illegal or otherwise permanently enjoining, preventing or prohibiting the consummation of a material portion of the transactions. In addition, if the closing date of the transactions contemplated by the TSA does not occur prior to December 31, 2024, unless such date is extended in accordance with the terms of the TSA, the TSA will automatically terminate. 
 As a result, any or all of the transactions may not be consummated as originally scheduled or at all. Accordingly, we may not be able to realize the expected benefits from these transactions on a timely basis or at all. Even if we are successful in completing the transactions contemplated by the TSA, we may not realize some or all of the expected benefits from such transactions. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant costs, expenses and fees for professional services and other transaction costs in connection with the transactions contemplated by the TSA, and these fees and costs are payable by us regardless of whether such transactions are consummated.

 (iv) Company agrees that Employee is not required to seek other employment or to attempt in any way to reduce any amounts payable to Employee by Company and that if Employee becomes eligible to participate in other health and or welfare plans, such eligibility alone shall not affect Employee s and Employee s eligible dependents entitlement to continued participation in any group health, dental and vision insurance plans in which Employee and Employee s eligible dependents are then enrolled. Except as hereinafter provided in Section 8(e)(v), the amount of any payment or benefit provided for in this Agreement shall not be reduced by any compensation earned by Employee as the result of employment through self-employment or by another employer, by retirement benefits, by unemployment compensation, by offset against any amount claimed to be owed by Employee to Company, or otherwise. 
 (e) Termination By Company Without Cause Termination By Employee with Good Reason in connection with a Change in Control. 
 (i) If Company terminates employment without Cause or as of the end of the Employment Period following Company issuing a written notice of non-renewal of this Agreement pursuant to Section 1, or if Employee terminates employment with Good Reason, during the ninety (90) days prior or twelve (12) months following a Change in Control (as defined in the iHeartMedia, Inc. 2021 Long-Term Incentive Award Plan) (or otherwise prior to a Change in Control but after the execution of a definitive agreement which results in a Change in Control) (each, a CIC Termination ), Company will pay the

 (iii) Payment of the CIC Severance Payment and the Additional Vesting, if applicable, shall be subject to and conditioned upon Employee s execution and non-revocation of the Release, which shall be provided by Company to Employee no later than five (5) business days following Employee s termination. Company will pay Employee the CIC Severance Payments in a lump sum on Company s first regularly scheduled payroll date following the Release Effective Date (as defined in the Release) or if later, the closing of the Change in Control. 
 (iv) Company agrees that Employee is not required to seek other employment or to attempt in any way to reduce any amounts payable to Employee by Company and that if Employee becomes eligible to participate in other health and or welfare plans, such eligibility alone shall not affect Employee s and Employee s eligible dependents entitlement to continued participation in any group health, dental and vision insurance plans in which Employee and Employee s eligible dependents are then enrolled. Except as hereinafter provided in Section 8(e)(v), the amount of any payment or benefit provided for in this Agreement shall not be reduced by any compensation earned by Employee as the result of employment through self-employment or by another employer, by retirement benefits, by unemployment compensation, by offset against any amount claimed to be owed by Employee to Company, or otherwise. 
 (v) To the extent that Employee terminates employment pursuant to Section 8(d), and subsequently becomes eligible for payments under this Section 8(e), the amount payable pursuant to this Section 8(e) shall be reduced by any payments previously made pursuant to Section 8(d), and, if a Release had been executed previously, Employee shall not be required to execute any additional Release.

 (f) For purposes of calculating severance payments under Sections 8(d) and 8(e) of this Agreement, the Base Salary and Target Annual Bonus shall not take into account any reductions which would constitute Good Reason or which were made in the prior six (6) month period.

Payment, as applicable. Employee acknowledges the Severance Payment or the CIC Severance Payment, as applicable, and the Additional Vesting are adequate and independent consideration to support Employee s General Release of claims referenced in Section 8(d), as it is something of value to which Employee would not have otherwise been entitled at termination had Employee not executed a General Release of claims.

 15. DISPUTE RESOLUTION 

(a) Arbitration. This Agreement is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. 1 et seq. and evidences a transaction involving commerce. This Dispute Resolution Provision applies to any dispute arising out of or related to Employee's employment with Company or termination of employment and shall apply to the Release. Nothing contained in this Provision shall be construed to prevent or excuse Employee from using Company s existing internal procedures for resolution of complaints, and this Provision is not intended to be a substitute for the use of such procedures. Except as it otherwise provides, this Provision is intended to apply to the resolution of disputes that otherwise would be resolved in a court of law, and therefore this Provision requires all such disputes to be resolved only by an arbitrator through final and binding arbitration and not by way of court or jury trial. Such disputes include without limitation disputes arising out of or relating to interpretation or application of this Agreement, including the enforceability, revocability or validity of the Agreement or any portion of the Agreement. The Provision also applies, without limitation, to disputes regarding the employment relationship, trade secrets, unfair competition, compensation, breaks and rest periods, termination, or harassment and claims arising under the Uniform Trade Secrets Act, Civil Rights Act of 1964, Americans With Disabilities Act, Age Discrimination in Employment Act, Family Medical Leave Act, Fair Labor Standards Act, and state statutes, if any, addressing the same or similar subject matters, and all other state statutory and common law claims. 
 (b) The following claims are excluded from this Provision workers compensation, state disability insurance, unemployment insurance claims, and claims for benefits under employee benefit plans covered by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act that contain an appeal procedure or other exclusive and or binding dispute resolution procedure in the respective plan. Disputes that may not be subject to pre-dispute arbitration agreements as provided by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Public Law 111-203) are also excluded from the coverage of this Provision. Nothing in this Provision prevents Employee from making a report to or filing a claim or charge with a government agency, including without limitation the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, U.S. Department of Labor, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, National Labor Relations Board, or Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs. Nothing in this Provision prevents the investigation by a government agency of any report, claim or charge otherwise covered by this Agreement. This Provision also does not prevent federal administrative agencies from adjudicating claims and awarding remedies based on those claims, even if the claims would otherwise be covered by this Provision. Nothing in this Provision shall be deemed to preclude or excuse a party from bringing an administrative claim before any agency in order to fulfill the party's obligation to exhaust administrative remedies before making a claim in arbitration. Company will not retaliate against Employee for filing a claim with an administrative agency or for exercising rights (individually or in concert with others) under Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act. 
 (c) The Arbitrator shall be selected by mutual agreement of Company and Employee. Unless Employee and Company mutually agree otherwise, the Arbitrator shall be an attorney licensed to practice in the location where the arbitration proceeding will be conducted or a retired federal or state judicial officer who presided in the jurisdiction where the arbitration will be conducted. If for any reason the parties cannot agree to an Arbitrator, either party may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction with authority over the location where the arbitration will be conducted for appointment of a neutral Arbitrator. The court shall then appoint an Arbitrator, who shall act under this Provision with the same force and effect as if the parties had selected the Arbitrator by mutual agreement. The location of the arbitration proceeding shall be no more than 45 miles from the place where Employee last worked for Company, unless each party to the arbitration agrees in writing otherwise. 

(d) A demand for arbitration must be in writing and delivered by hand or first- class mail to the other party within the applicable statute of limitations period. Any demand for arbitration made to Company shall be provided to Company's Legal Department, 20880 Stone Oak Parkway, San Antonio, Texas 78258. The Arbitrator shall resolve all disputes regarding the timeliness or propriety of the demand for arbitration. 
 (e) In arbitration, the parties will have the right to conduct adequate civil discovery, bring dispositive motions, and present witnesses and evidence as needed to present their cases and defenses, and any disputes in this regard shall be resolved by the Arbitrator. The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure shall govern any depositions or discovery efforts, and the arbitrator shall apply the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure when resolving any discovery disputes. 
 (f) Class Action Waiver. In the event of any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of employment with, or otherwise relating to Employee s relationship with Company, claims may only be brought by Employee or by Company in Employee s individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, collective, or other joint proceeding. In that regard, Employee specifically agrees not to file, initiate directly or indirectly, join or participate in any class, collective, or other representative proceeding against Company and its respective directors, officers, agents, representatives and employees. If a class, collective, or other representative proceeding is filed purporting to include Employee, Employee shall promptly take all steps to refrain from opting in or to opt-out and will otherwise exclude him herself from the proceeding, as applicable. Claims covered by this waiver may not be joined or consolidated with claims of other individuals without the consent of both Company and Employee. Notwithstanding any other clause contained in this Agreement, the preceding Class Action Waiver shall not be severable from this Provision in any case in which the dispute to be arbitrated is brought as a class, collective or representative action. Although an Employee will not be retaliated against, disciplined or threatened with discipline as a result of Employee s exercising his or her rights under Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act by the filing of or participation in a class, collective or representative action in any forum, Company may lawfully seek enforcement of this Provision and the Class Action Waiver under the Federal Arbitration Act and seek dismissal of such class, collective or representative actions or claims. Notwithstanding any other clause contained in this Provision, any claim that all or part of the Class Action Waiver is unenforceable, unconscionable, void or voidable may be determined only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. 
 (g) Each party will pay the fees for his, her or its own attorneys, subject to any remedies to which that party may later be entitled under applicable law. However, in all cases where required by law, Company will pay the Arbitrator s and arbitration fees. If under applicable law Company is not required to pay all of the Arbitrator s and or arbitration fees, such fee(s) will be apportioned between the parties by the Arbitrator in accordance with applicable law. 
 (h) Within thirty (30) days of the close of the arbitration hearing, any party will have the right to prepare, serve on the other party and file with the Arbitrator a brief. The Arbitrator may award any party any remedy to which that party is entitled under applicable law, but such remedies shall be limited to those that would be available to a party in a court of law for the claims presented to and decided by the Arbitrator. The Arbitrator will issue a decision or award in writing, stating the essential findings of fact and conclusions of law. Except as may be permitted or required by law, neither a party nor an Arbitrator may disclose the existence, content, or results of any arbitration hereunder without the prior written consent of all parties. A court of competent jurisdiction shall have the authority to enter a judgment upon the award made pursuant to the arbitration. 

(i) Injunctive Relief. A party may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for temporary or preliminary injunctive relief in connection with an arbitrable controversy, but only upon the ground that the award to which that party may be entitled may be rendered ineffectual without such provisional relief. 
 (j) This Section 15 is the full and complete agreement relating to the formal resolution of employment-related disputes. In the event any portion of this Section 15 is deemed unenforceable and except as set forth in Section 15(f), the remainder of this Agreement will be enforceable. 
 (k) This Section 15 shall survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason.

(b) For purposes of determining whether and the extent to which the Total Payments will be subject to the Excise Tax, (i) no portion of the Total Payments the receipt or enjoyment of which Employee shall have waived at such time and in such manner as not to constitute a payment within the meaning of Section 280G(b) of the Code shall be taken into account (ii) no portion of the Total Payments shall be taken into account which, in the written opinion of an independent, nationally recognized accounting firm and or tax counsel appointed or engaged by Company with Employee s prior written consent prior to any change in ownership or control (within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.280G-1, Q&As 27 - 29) (the Independent Advisors ), does not constitute a parachute payment within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code (including by reason of Section 280G(b)(4)(A) of the Code) and, in calculating the Excise Tax, no portion of such Total Payments shall be taken into account which, in the written opinion of Independent Advisors, constitutes reasonable compensation for services actually rendered (or for holding oneself out as available to perform services and refraining from performing services (such as under a covenant not to compete)), in excess of the base amount (as defined in Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code) allocable to such reasonable compensation and (iii) the value of any non-cash benefit or any deferred payment or benefit included in the Total Payments shall be determined by the Independent Advisors in accordance with the principles of Sections 280G of the Code. In the event that the Independent Advisors are serving as accountants, auditors or counsel for the individual, entity or group effecting the change in ownership or control (within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.280G-1, Q&As 27 - 29), Company shall appoint another nationally recognized accounting firm and or tax counsel to make the determinations hereunder, subject to the written consent of Employee which shall not be unreasonably withheld (which firm(s) shall then be referred to as the Independent Advisors hereunder). All determinations hereunder shall be made by the Independent Advisors, who shall provide detailed supporting calculations both to Company and Employee at such time as it is requested by Company or Employee. The determination of the Independent Advisors shall be final and binding upon Company and Employee, absent manifest error. Company shall be responsible for all charges for the Independent Advisors. Company and Employee shall promptly deliver to each other copies of any written communications, and summaries of any verbal communications, with any taxing authority regarding the Excise Tax covered by this Section 17. 
 (c) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement or any other agreement between the Employee and the Company or any of its subsidiaries to the contrary, the Employee and the Company shall in good faith attempt to agree on steps to ensure that no payments to which the Employee would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to this Agreement or any such other plan, arrangement or agreement will be parachute payments as defined in Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code and shall cooperate with each other to mitigate the impact of the Excise Tax and any potential reduction to payments or benefits provided under this Agreement, any other plan, arrangement or agreement or otherwise. 
 
 18. SECTION 409A COMPLIANCE 
 Payments under this Agreement (the Payments are intended to be designed and operated in such a manner that they are either exempt from the application of, or comply with, the requirements of Section 409A, the Regulations, applicable case law and administrative guidance. In the event that the parties determine that the payments and benefits under this Agreement are not in compliance with or exempt from Section 409A, the parties shall in good faith attempt to modify this Agreement to comply with Section 409A while endeavoring to maintain the intended economic benefits hereunder. All Payments shall be deemed to come from an unfunded plan. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement, all Payments subject to Section 409A will not be accelerated in time or schedule. Employee and Company will not be able to change the designated time or form of any Payments subject to Section 

409A. To the extent that the period of time during which Employee may execute the Release spans two calendar years, the Severance Payment or CIC Severance Payment, as applicable shall be delayed until the second calendar year. In addition, to the extent the Severance Payment or the CIC Severance payment is deferred compensation and subject to Section 409A, it will only be payable upon a separation from service (as that term is defined at Section 1.409A-1(h) of the Treasury Regulations) from Company and from all other corporations and trades or businesses, if any, that would be treated as a single service recipient with Company under Section 1.409A-1(h)(3). All payments hereunder shall be treated as separate payments for purposes of Section 409A. All references in this Agreement to a termination of employment and correlative terms shall be construed to require a separation from service. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, to the extent that a Payment is subject to, and not exempt from, Section 409A, if Employee is a specified employee as such term is defined under Section 409A, payment of the Severance Payment or the CIC Severance Payment, as applicable shall be delayed for a period of six (6) months following Employee s separation of employment to the extent and up to an amount necessary to ensure such payments are not subject to penalties and interest under Section 409A. If the payments are delayed as a result of the previous sentence, then on the first business day following the end of such six (6) month period (or such earlier date upon which such amount can be paid under Section 409A without resulting in a prohibited distribution, such as Employee s death), Company shall pay Employee a lump sum amount equal to the cumulative amount that would have otherwise been payable to Employee during such period. 
 
 19. MISCELLANEOUS 
 (a) Withholding . Company shall withhold from any amounts to be paid or benefits provided to Employee hereunder any federal, state, local, or foreign withholding or other taxes or charges which it is from time to time required to withhold. 
 (b) Entire Agreement. This Agreement contains the entire understanding of the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof for the period defined and, upon its Effective Date, supersedes and nullifies all prior or contemporaneous conversations, negotiations, or agreements (oral or written) regarding the subject matter of this Agreement, including without limitation that certain Employment Agreement by and between Employee and Company effective as of April 1, 2022. To the extent this Agreement has been executed prior to its Effective Date and other agreements are in place as of the date of execution, such other agreements remain in place until the Effective Date has been reached, and the terms of this Agreement shall not be in effect unless and until the Effective Date has been reached. 
 (c) Amendments. This Agreement may not be modified or amended except in writing signed by Employee and Company and approved by a representative of Company s Legal Department. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, a counterpart transmitted via electronic means, and all executed counterparts, when taken together, shall constitute sufficient proof of the parties entry into this Agreement. 
 (d) Full Performance. The parties agree to execute any further or future documents which may be necessary to allow the full performance of this Agreement. The failure of a party to require performance of any provision of this Agreement shall not affect the right of such party to later enforce any provision. A waiver of the breach of any term or condition of this Agreement shall not be deemed a waiver of any subsequent breach of the same or any other term or condition. 
 (e) Blue Pencil Injunctive Relief. If any provision of this Agreement shall, for any reason, be held unenforceable, such unenforceability shall not affect the remaining provisions hereof, except as 

specifically noted in this Agreement, or the application of such provisions to other persons or circumstances, all of which shall be enforced to the greatest extent permitted by law. Company and Employee agree that the restrictions contained in Section 4, 5, 6, and 10, are material terms of this Agreement, reasonable in scope and duration and are necessary to protect Company s Confidential Information, goodwill, specialized training expertise, and legitimate business interests. If any restrictive covenant is held to be unenforceable because of the scope, duration or geographic area, the parties agree that the court or arbitrator may reduce the scope, duration, or geographic area, and in its reduced form, such provision shall be enforceable. Should Employee violate the provisions of Sections 5, or 6, then in addition to all other remedies available to Company, the duration of these covenants shall be extended for the period of time when Employee began such violation until Employee permanently ceases such violation. Employee agrees that no bond will be required if an injunction is sought to enforce any of the covenants previously set forth herein. 
 (f) Expiration of Employment Period. In the event that Employee s employment continues for any period of time following the end of the Employment Period, unless and until agreed to in a new executed agreement, such employment or continuation thereof is at-will and may be terminated at any time by either party. 
 (g) Construction . The headings in this Agreement are inserted for convenience of reference only and shall not control the meaning of any provision hereof. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to control or modify which entity (among Company s family of entities) is Employee s legal employer for purposes of any laws or regulations governing the employment relationship. 
 (h) Company Policies. Employee acknowledges receipt of the iHeartMedia Employee Guide Employee Guide ), Code of Conduct and other Company policies (available on Company s intranet website) and agrees to review and abide by their terms, which along with any other policy referenced in this Agreement may be amended from time to time at Company s discretion. Employee understands that Company policies do not constitute a contract between Employee and Company. Any conflict between such policies and this Agreement shall be resolved in favor of this Agreement. 
 (i) Effective Date . Upon full execution by all parties, this Agreement shall be effective on the Effective Date in Section 1.
