 As part of ACC s ongoing monitoring process, management determined that the decrease in gross unrealized losses on its Available-for-Sale securities for which an allowance for credit losses has not been recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily attributable to the impact of lower interest rates. As of September 30, 2024, ACC did not recognize these unrealized losses in earnings because it was determined that such losses were due to non-credit factors. ACC does not intend to sell these securities and does not believe that it is more likely than not that ACC will be required to sell these securities before the anticipated recovery of the remaining amortized cost basis. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, approximately 96 and 97 , respectively, of the total of Available-for-Sale securities with gross unrealized losses were considered investment grade. 
 During the three months ended June 30, 2024, the Company established an allowance for credit losses of 4.2 million related to one commercial mortgage backed security with a recent downgrade. As of September 30, 2024, the allowance for this security was reduced to 3.7 million. There were no amounts recognized in the allowance for credit losses on Available-for-Sale securities during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 The change in net unrealized gains (losses) on securities in other comprehensive income (loss) OCI ), includes two components, net of tax (i) unrealized gains (losses) that arose from changes in the fair value of securities that were held during the period and (ii) (gains) losses that were previously unrealized, but have been recognized in current period net income due to sales of Available-for-Sale securities and due to the reclassification of noncredit losses to credit losses.

 Purchases and Sales 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, ACC purchased nil and 19.6 million, respectively, of syndicated loans, and sold 0.7 million and 0.4 million, respectively, of syndicated loans. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, ACC purchased 4.2 million and 20.0 million, respectively, of syndicated loans, and sold 4.0 million and 3.6 million, respectively, of syndicated loans. 
 ACC has not acquired any loans with deteriorated credit quality as of the acquisition date. 
 Credit Quality Information 
 Nonperforming loans were nil and 1.1 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. All other loans were considered to be performing. 
 Commercial Loans 
 Commercial Mortgage Loans 
 ACC reviews the credit worthiness of the borrower and the performance of the underlying properties in order to determine the risk of loss on commercial mortgage loans. Loan-to-value ratio is the primary credit quality indicator included in this review. 
 Based on this review, the commercial mortgage loans are assigned an internal risk rating, which management updates when credit risk changes. There were no commercial mortgage loans which management has assigned its highest risk rating as of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Loans with the highest risk rating represent distressed loans which ACC has identified as impaired or expects to become delinquent or enter into foreclosure within the next six months. There were no commercial mortgage loans past due as of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

 Certificate Loans 
 Certificate loans do not exceed the cash surrender value at origination. As there is minimal risk of loss related to certificate loans, ACC does not record an allowance for credit losses. 
 Modifications with Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty 
 Modifications of financing receivables with borrowers experiencing financial difficulty by ACC were not material for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 5. Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities 
 GAAP defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date that is, an exit price. The exit price assumes the asset or liability is not exchanged subject to a forced liquidation or distressed sale. 
 Valuation Hierarchy 
 ACC categorizes its fair value measurements according to a three-level hierarchy. The hierarchy prioritizes the inputs used by ACC s valuation techniques. A level is assigned to each fair value measurement based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. 
 The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are defined as follows 
 Level 1 Unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date. 
 Level 2 Prices or valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. 
 Level 3 Prices or valuations that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable.

 Securities transferred from Level 3 primarily represent securities with fair values that are now obtained from a third-party pricing service with observable inputs. Securities transferred to Level 3 represent securities with fair values that are now based on a single non-binding broker quote. 
 The following tables provide a summary of the significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurements developed by ACC or reasonably available to ACC of Level 3 assets 
 September 30, 2024 
 Fair Value Valuation Technique Unobservable Input Range Weighted Average (in thousands) Corporate debt securities (private placements) 12,188 Discounted cash flow Yield spread to U.S. Treasuries 1.1 1.1 
 December 31, 2023 
 Fair Value Valuation Technique Unobservable Input Range Weighted Average (in thousands) Corporate debt securities (private placements) 17,851 Discounted cash flow Yield spread to U.S. Treasuries 1.0 - 1.1 1.0 
 The weighted average for the yield spread to U.S. Treasuries for corporate debt securities (private placements) is weighted based on the security s market value as a percentage of the aggregate market value of the securities. 
 Level 3 measurements not included in the tables above are obtained from non-binding broker quotes where unobservable inputs utilized in the fair value calculation are not reasonably available to ACC. 
 Uncertainty of Fair Value Measurements 
 Significant increases (decreases) in the yield spread to U.S. Treasuries used in the fair value measurement of Level 3 corporate debt securities in isolation would have resulted in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement. 
 Determination of Fair Value 
 ACC uses valuation techniques consistent with the market and income approaches to measure the fair value of its assets and liabilities. ACC s market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. ACC s income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future projected cash flows to a single discounted present value amount. When applying either approach, ACC maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs. 
 The following is a description of the valuation techniques used to measure fair value and the general classification of these instruments pursuant to the fair value hierarchy. 
 16 

Index 
 AMERIPRISE CERTIFICATE COMPANY 
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) (continued) 

 Assets 
 Cash Equivalents 
 Cash equivalents include time deposits and other highly liquid investments with original or remaining maturities at the time of purchase of 90 days or less. ACC s cash equivalents are classified as Level 2 and measured at amortized cost, which is a reasonable estimate of fair value because of the short time between the purchase of the instrument and its expected realization. 
 Available-for-Sale Securities 
 When available, the fair value of securities is based on quoted prices in active markets. If quoted prices are not available, fair values are obtained from third-party pricing services, non-binding broker quotes, or other model-based valuation techniques. 
 Level 1 securities include U.S. Treasuries. 
 Level 2 securities include corporate bonds, residential mortgage backed securities, commercial mortgage backed securities, asset backed securities, and state and municipal obligations. The fair value of these Level 2 securities is based on a market approach with prices obtained from third-party pricing services. Observable inputs used to value these securities can include, but are not limited to, reported trades, benchmark yields, issuer spreads and non-binding broker quotes. 
 Level 3 securities include certain corporate bonds and asset backed securities with fair value typically based on a single non-binding broker quote. The underlying inputs used for some of the non-binding broker quotes are not readily available to ACC. ACC s privately placed corporate bonds are typically based on a single non-binding broker quote. 
 Management is responsible for the fair values recorded on the financial statements. Prices received from third-party pricing services are subjected to exception reporting that identifies investments with significant daily price movements as well as no movements. ACC reviews the exception reporting and resolves the exceptions through reaffirmation of the price or recording an appropriate fair value estimate. ACC also performs subsequent transaction testing. ACC performs annual due diligence of third-party pricing services. ACC s due diligence procedures include assessing the vendor s valuation qualifications, control environment, analysis of asset-class specific valuation methodologies, and understanding of sources of market observable assumptions and unobservable assumptions, if any, employed in the valuation methodology. ACC also considers the results of its exception reporting controls and any resulting price challenges that arise. 
 Derivatives 
 Derivatives that are measured using quoted prices in active markets, such as derivatives that are exchange-traded, are classified as Level 1 measurements. The variation margin on futures contracts is also classified as Level 1. The fair value of derivatives that are traded in less active over-the-counter OTC markets is generally measured using pricing models with market observable inputs such as interest rates and equity index levels. These measurements are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy and include options. The counterparties nonperformance risk associated with uncollateralized derivative assets was immaterial as of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. See Note 6 and Note 7 for further information on the credit risk of derivative instruments and related collateral. 
 Liabilities 
 Stock Market Certificate Embedded Derivatives 
 ACC uses Black-Scholes models to determine the fair value of the embedded derivative liability associated with the provisions of its stock market certificates SMC ). The inputs to these calculations are primarily market observable and include interest rates, volatilities and equity index levels. As a result, these measurements are classified as Level 2.

 6. Offsetting Assets and Liabilities 
 Certain derivative instruments are eligible for offset in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. ACC s derivative instruments are subject to master netting and collateral arrangements and qualify for offset. A master netting arrangement with a counterparty creates a right of offset for amounts due to and from that same counterparty that is enforceable in the event of a default or bankruptcy. ACC s policy is to recognize amounts subject to master netting arrangements on a gross basis in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 The following tables present the gross and net information about ACC s assets subject to master netting arrangements

 In the tables above, the amount of assets or liabilities presented are offset first by financial instruments that have the right of offset under master netting or similar arrangements, then any remaining amount is reduced by the amount of cash collateral. The actual collateral may be greater than amounts presented in the tables. 
 When the fair value of collateral accepted by ACC is less than the amount due to ACC, there is a risk of loss if the counterparty fails to perform or provide additional collateral. To mitigate this risk, ACC monitors collateral values regularly and requires additional collateral when necessary. When the value of collateral pledged by ACC declines, it may be required to post additional collateral. 
 Freestanding derivative instruments are reflected in Derivative assets and Derivative liabilities. Cash collateral accepted by ACC is reflected in Other liabilities. See Note 7 for additional disclosures related to ACC s derivative instruments. 
 
 7. Derivatives and Hedging Activities 
 Derivative instruments enable ACC to manage its exposure to various market risks. The value of such instruments is derived from an underlying variable or multiple variables, including equity and interest rate indices or prices. ACC primarily enters into derivative agreements for risk management purposes related to ACC s products. 
 ACC uses derivatives as economic hedges of equity risk related to SMC. ACC does not designate any derivatives for hedge accounting. The following table presents the notional value and the gross fair value of derivative instruments, including embedded derivatives

 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, investment securities with a fair value of 395 thousand and 446 thousand, respectively, were pledged to meet contractual obligations under derivative contracts. 
 The following table presents a summary of the impact of derivatives not designated as hedging instruments, including embedded derivatives, on the Consolidated Statements of Operations

 Ameriprise SMC offer a return based upon the relative change in a major stock market index between the beginning and end of the certificate s term. The SMC product contains an embedded derivative. The equity based return of the certificate must be separated from the host contract and accounted for as a derivative instrument. As a result of fluctuations in equity markets and the corresponding changes in value of the embedded derivative, the amount of expenses incurred by ACC related to the SMC product will positively or negatively impact reported earnings. As a means of hedging its obligations under the provisions for these certificates, ACC purchases and writes call options on the S&P 500 Index. ACC views this strategy as a prudent management of equity market sensitivity, such that earnings are not exposed to undue risk presented by changes in equity market levels. ACC also purchases futures on the S&P 500 Index to economically hedge its obligations. The futures are marked-to-market daily and exchange traded, exposing ACC to minimal counterparty risk. 
 Credit Risk 
 Credit risk associated with ACC s derivatives is the risk that a derivative counterparty will not perform in accordance with the terms of the applicable derivative contract. To mitigate such risk, ACC has established guidelines and oversight of credit risk through a comprehensive enterprise risk management program that includes members of senior management. Key components of this program are to require preapproval of counterparties and the use of master netting and collateral arrangements whenever practical. See Note 6 for additional information on ACC s credit exposure related to derivative assets. 
 
 8. Contingencies 
 The level of regulatory activity and inquiry in the financial services industry remains elevated. From time to time, ACC receives requests for information from, and or has been subject to examination by, both the SEC and the Minnesota Department of Commerce concerning its business activities and practices. 
 ACC may in the normal course of business be a party to legal, regulatory or arbitration proceedings concerning matters arising in connection with the conduct of its business activities. The outcome of any such proceeding cannot be predicted with any certainty. ACC believes that it is not a party to, nor are any of its properties the subject of, any pending legal, regulatory or arbitration proceedings that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on ACC s results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is possible that the outcome of any such legal, arbitration or regulatory proceedings could have a material impact on ACC s results of operations, financial condition or liquidity in any particular reporting period as the proceedings are resolved. 
 
 9. Shareholder s Equity 
 ACC did not receive cash contributions from Ameriprise Financial during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. ACC received cash contributions of nil and 103.0 million from Ameriprise Financial during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. ACC received these contributions to maintain compliance with capital requirements and these contributions were outside of the Capital Support Agreement between Ameriprise Financial and ACC. See additional discussion on the Capital Support Agreement in ACC s 2023 10-K. 
 ACC paid dividends to Ameriprise Financial of 63.0 million and 155.0 million, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. ACC did not pay any dividends to Ameriprise Financial during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 ACC did not return any contributed capital to Ameriprise Financial during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. ACC continued to maintain compliance with the capital requirements of the SEC and the Minnesota Department of Commerce during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.

 10. Income Taxes 
 ACC s effective tax rate was 19.3 and 25.1 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. ACC s effective tax rate was 21.4 and 25.3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was lower than the statutory rate primarily as a result of a decrease in unrecognized tax benefits, partially offset by state income taxes, net of federal benefit. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was higher than the statutory rate primarily as a result of an increase in state income taxes, net of federal benefit, partially offset by unrecognized tax benefits. 
 The effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was higher than the statutory rate primarily as a result of state income taxes, net of federal benefit. 
 The lower effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily the result of a decrease in unrecognized tax benefits. 
 ACC is required to establish a valuation allowance for any portion of its deferred tax assets that management believes will not be realized. Significant judgment is required in determining if a valuation allowance should be established and the amount of such allowance if required. Factors used in making this determination include estimates relating to the performance of the business. Consideration is given to, among other things in making this determination (i) future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards (ii) future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences (iii) taxable income in prior carryback years and (iv) tax planning strategies. Based on analysis of ACC s tax position, management believes it is more likely than not that ACC s results of future operations and implementation of tax planning strategies will generate sufficient taxable income to enable ACC to utilize all of the deferred tax assets. Accordingly, no valuation allowance for deferred tax assets has been established as of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, ACC had 3.4 million and 5.5 million, respectively, of gross unrecognized tax benefits. If recognized, approximately 2.7 million and 4.4 million, net of federal tax benefits, of unrecognized tax benefits as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, would affect the effective tax rate. 
 It is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will change in the next 12 months. ACC estimates that the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits may decrease by approximately 224 thousand in the next 12 months primarily due to state statutes of limitations expirations. 
 ACC recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of the income tax provision. ACC recognized a net decrease of 455 thousand and 519 thousand in interest and penalties for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. ACC recognized a net increase of 89 thousand and 233 thousand in interest and penalties for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, ACC had a payable of 509 thousand and 1.0 million, respectively, related to accrued interest and penalties. 
 ACC files income tax returns as part of its inclusion in the consolidated federal income tax return of Ameriprise Financial in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state jurisdictions. The Internal Revenue Service IRS is currently auditing Ameriprise Financial s U.S. income tax returns for 2019 and 2020. The state income tax returns of Ameriprise Financial or its subsidiaries, including ACC, are currently under examination by various jurisdictions for years ranging from 2017 through 2021.

 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S NARRATIVE ANALYSIS 
 The following information should be read in conjunction with Ameriprise Certificate Company s ACC s Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes presented in Part I, Item 1. The following discussion may contain forward-looking statements that reflect ACC s plans, estimates and beliefs. Actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed below under Forward-Looking Statements. ACC believes it is useful to read its management s narrative analysis in conjunction with its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC on February 22, 2024 2023 10-K ), as well as its quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and any current reports on Form 8-K. 
 ACC is a wholly owned subsidiary of Ameriprise Financial, Inc. Ameriprise Financial ). ACC is registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and is in the business of issuing face-amount investment certificates. Face-amount investment certificates issued by ACC entitle the certificate owner to receive at maturity a stated amount of money and interest or credits declared from time to time by ACC, at its discretion. The certificates issued by ACC are not insured by any government agency. ACC s certificates are sold primarily by Ameriprise Financial Services, LLC AFS ), an affiliate of ACC. AFS is registered as a broker-dealer in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. ACC s investment portfolio is managed by Columbia Management Investment Advisers, LLC CMIA ), a wholly owned subsidiary of Ameriprise Financial. 
 Management s narrative analysis of the results of operations is presented in lieu of Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, pursuant to General Instructions H(2)(a) of Form 10-Q. 
 Macroeconomic Environment 
 ACC operates its business in the broader context of the macroeconomic forces around it, including the global and U.S. economies, changes in interest and inflation rates, financial market volatility, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, geopolitical strain, pandemics, the competitive environment, client and customer activities and preferences, and the various regulatory and legislative developments. Financial markets and macroeconomic conditions have had and will continue to have a significant impact on ACC s operating and performance results. ACC s success may be affected by the factors discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors in ACC s 2023 10-K and other factors as discussed herein. 
 
 Significant Accounting Policies 
 ACC s significant accounting policies are discussed in detail in Management s Narrative Analysis Recent Accounting Pronouncements and Significant Accounting Policies in ACC s 2023 10-K. 
 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 For information regarding recent accounting pronouncements and their expected impact on ACC s future results of operations or financial condition, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 Results of Operations for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 ACC s net income is derived primarily from the after-tax yield on investments and realized investment gains (losses), less investment expenses and interest credited on certificate reserve liabilities. Net income trends occur largely due to changes in returns on ACC s investment portfolio, from realization of investment gains (losses) and from changes in interest credited to certificate products. ACC follows U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP ). 
 Net income decreased 0.5 million, or 1 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period primarily due to higher net provision for certificate reserves along with higher net realized losses on investments, partially offset by higher investment income and lower income taxes. Client deposits decreased 0.6 billion from the prior year period to 12.0 billion. After a period of strong growth during a rising interest rate environment, ACC has experienced net outflows during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Investment income increased 110.5 million, or 24 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period reflecting an increase in the average invested asset yield, driven by higher average short-term interest rates, and higher average investment balances. 
 Investment expenses increased 2.0 million, or 5 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period primarily due to volume-driven increases in distribution expenses and investment advisory fees. 
 Net provision for certificate reserves increased 111.3 million, or 35 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period primarily due to higher average client crediting rates, as well as higher average certificate balances. 
 Net realized losses on investments before income taxes increased 3.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period primarily due to an allowance for credit losses related to a commercial mortgage backed security with a recent downgrade.

Index 
 AMERIPRISE CERTIFICATE COMPANY 

 ACC s effective tax rate was 21.4 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 25.3 for the prior year period. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily the result of a decrease in unrecognized tax benefits. See Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion on income taxes. 
 
 Fair Value Measurements 
 ACC reports certain assets and liabilities at fair value specifically, derivatives, embedded derivatives, and most investments and cash equivalents. Fair value assumes the exchange of assets or liabilities occurs in orderly transactions and is not the result of a forced liquidation or distressed sale. ACC includes actual market prices, or observable inputs, in its fair value measurements to the extent available. Broker quotes are obtained when quotes from pricing services are not available. ACC validates prices obtained from third parties through a variety of means such as price variance analysis, subsequent sales testing, stale price review, price comparison across pricing vendors and due diligence reviews of vendors. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding ACC s fair value measurements.

 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 ACC maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be reported in the Exchange Act filings is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in and pursuant to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC regulations, including controls and procedures designed to ensure that this information is accumulated and communicated to ACC s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding the required disclosure. It should be noted that, because of inherent limitations, ACC s disclosure controls and procedures, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. 
 ACC s management, under the supervision and with the participation of its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of ACC s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, ACC s principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that ACC s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable level of assurance as of September 30, 2024. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There have not been any changes in ACC s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the third fiscal quarter of the year to which this report relates that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, ACC s internal control over financial reporting.
