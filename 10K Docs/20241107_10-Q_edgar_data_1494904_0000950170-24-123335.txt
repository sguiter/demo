million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively. 
 The following is a description, by asset type, of the methodology and significant inputs that the Company used to measure the amount of credit loss recognized in earnings, if any: U.S. treasuries As of September 30, 2024, gross unrealized losses related to U.S. treasuries were million . To assess whether the decline in fair value below amortized cost has resulted from a credit loss or other factors, macroeconomic and market analysis is conducted in evaluating these securities. Consideration is given to the interest rate environment, duration and yield curve management of the portfolio, sector allocation and security selection. Based on the analysis performed, the Company did not recognize a credit loss on U.S. treasuries during the period. Obligations of states and political subdivisions As of September 30, 2024, gross unrealized losses related to obligations of states and political subdivisions were million . To assess whether the decline in fair value below amortized cost has resulted from a credit loss or other factors, elements that may influence the performance of the municipal bond market are considered in evaluating these securities such as investor expectations, supply and demand patterns, and current versus historical yield and spread relationships. The analysis relies on the output of fixed income credit analysts, as well as dedicated municipal bond analysts who perform extensive in-house fundamental analysis on each issuer, regardless of their rating by the major agencies. Based on the analysis performed, the Company did not recognize a credit loss on obligations of states and political subdivisions during the period.

million . To assess whether the decline in fair value below amortized cost has resulted from a credit loss or other factors, mortgage-backed securities are modeled to project principal losses under downside, base, and upside scenarios for the economy and home prices. The primary assumption that drives the security and loan level modeling is the Home Price Index HPI projection. These forecasts incorporate not just national macro-economic trends, but also regional impacts to arrive at the most granular and accurate projections. These assumptions are incorporated into the model as a basis to generate delinquency probabilities, default curves, loss severity curves, and voluntary prepayment curves at the loan level within each deal. The model utilizes HPI-adjusted current loan to value, payment history, loan terms, loan modification history, and borrower characteristics as inputs to generate expected cash flows and principal loss for each bond under various scenarios. Based on the analysis performed, the Company did not recognize a credit loss on mortgage-backed securities during the period. Asset backed securities ABS - As of September 30, 2024, gross unrealized losses related to asset backed securities were million . The weighted average credit enhancement for the Company s asset backed portfolio is . This represents the percentage of pool losses that can occur before an asset backed security will incur its first dollar of principal losses. To assess whether the decline in fair value below amortized cost has resulted from a credit loss or other factors, every ABS transaction is analyzed on a stand-alone basis. This analysis involves a thorough review of the collateral, prepayment, and structural risk in each transaction. Additionally, the analysis includes an in-depth credit analysis of the originator and servicer of the collateral. The analysis projects an expected loss for a deal given a set of assumptions specific to the asset type. These assumptions are used to calculate at what level of losses the deal will incur its first dollar of principal loss. The major assumptions used to calculate this ratio are loss severities, recovery lags, and no advances on principal and interest. Based on the analysis performed, the Company did not recognize a credit loss on asset backed securities during the period. Commercial mortgage-backed securities CMBS - As of September 30, 2024, gross unrealized losses related to the CMBS portfolio were million . The weighted average credit enhancement for the Company s CMBS portfolio is . This represents the percentage of pool losses that can occur before a commercial mortgage-backed security will incur its first dollar of principal loss. To assess whether the decline in fair value below amortized cost has resulted from a credit loss or other factors, a loan level analysis is utilized where every underlying CMBS loan is re-underwritten based on a set of assumptions reflecting expectations for the future path of the economy. Each loan is analyzed over time using a series of tests to determine if a credit event will occur during the life of the loan. Inherent in this process are several economic scenarios and their corresponding rent/vacancy and capital market states. The five primary credit events that frame the analysis include loan modifications, term default, balloon default, extension, and ability to pay off the balloon. The resulting output is the expected loss adjusted cash flows for each bond under the base case and distressed scenarios. Based on the analysis performed, the Company did not recognize a credit loss on commercial mortgage-backed securities during the period. Corporate bonds - As of September 30, 2024, gross unrealized losses related to corporate bonds were million . To assess whether the decline in fair value below amortized cost has resulted from a credit loss or other factors, analysis for this asset class includes maintaining detailed financial models that include a projection of each issuer s future financial performance, including prospective debt servicing capabilities, capital structure composition, and the value of the collateral. The analysis incorporates the macroeconomic environment, industry conditions in which the issuer operates, the issuer s current competitive position, its vulnerability to changes in the competitive and regulatory environment, issuer liquidity, issuer commitment to bondholders, issuer creditworthiness, and asset protection. Part of the process also includes running downside scenarios to evaluate the expected likelihood of default as well as potential losses in the event of default. Based on the analysis performed, the Company did not recognize a credit loss on corporate bonds during the period. Foreign bonds As of September 30, 2024, gross unrealized losses related to foreign bonds were million . To assess whether the decline in fair value below amortized cost has resulted from a credit loss or other factors, detailed financial models are maintained that include a projection of each issuer s future financial performance, including prospective debt servicing capabilities, capital structure composition, and the value of the collateral. The analysis incorporates the macroeconomic environment, industry conditions in which the issuer operates, the issuer s current competitive position, its vulnerability to changes in the competitive and regulatory environment, issuer liquidity, issuer commitment to bondholders, issuer creditworthiness, and asset protection. Part of the process also includes running downside scenarios to evaluate the expected likelihood of default as well as potential losses in the event of default.

Results of Operations 
 
 The Company's net income was 12.8 million and 7.7 million during the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 34.2 million and 19.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Net investment income increased by 2.3 million and 6.9 million during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same periods in 2023. This increase in net investment income was primarily due to strategies employed by the Company to take advantage of rising interest rates which resulted in a 15 increase in book yield on the fixed maturities portfolio to 4.6 at September 30, 2024 from 4.0 at September 30, 2023. The weighted average duration of the fixed maturities portfolio was 0.8 years as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 The Company generated underwriting income of 5.8 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compared to 0.7 million for the same period in 2023 and generated underwriting income of 14.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 3.9 million for the same period in 2023. This increase in underwriting income is driven by strong underwriting results within the Company's Penn-America segment due to growth in gross written premiums and improved current accident year combined ratios compared to the same period in 2023. Penn-America s gross written premiums increased 18.7 for the quarter and 7.4 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

(1) Gross written premiums represent the amount received or to be received for insurance policies written without reduction for reinsurance costs, ceded premiums or other deductions. 

(2) Net written premiums equal gross written premiums less ceded written premiums. 

Gross written premiums increased by 0.9 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. Penn-America s growth of 18.7 driven by its Wholesale Commercial, InsurTech, and Assumed Reinsurance divisions more than offset the decline in premiums resulting from its Non-Core segment. 
 
 Gross written premiums decreased by 11.5 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. Penn-America s growth of 7.4 driven by its Wholesale Commerical, InsurTech and Assumed Reinsurance divisions partially offset the decline in premiums resulting from its Non-Core segment. 
 
 In aggregate, Penn-America's Wholesale Commercial, InsurTech, and Assumed Reinsurance divisions grew by 23.3 for the quarter and 13.5 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same periods in 2023. The growth in Wholesale Commercial and InsurTech is driven by premium rate increases, new agency appointments, organic growth of existing agents, and new products. The growth in Assumed Reinsurance is primarily due to new treaties entered into during 2023 and 2024 and increased participation or organic growth from existing treaties. 
 
 The decline in premiums in Non-Core Operations is due to lines of business that have been de-emphasized or no longer written. 
 
 Net Retention 
 The ratio of net written premiums to gross written premiums is referred to as the Company s net premium retention. 
 The Company's net premium retention increased 0.7 points to 97.4 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 from 96.7 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023 and increased 2.0 points to 97.6 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 
 33 

from 95.6 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to the termination of two quota share agreements and lower cost on the Company's catastrophe reinsurance treaty. 
 Net Earned Premiums 
 
 Net earned premiums within the Penn-America segment increased by 12.6 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to continued premium growth in Penn-America's Wholesale Commercial, InsurTech, and Assumed Reinsurance divisions. Property net earned premiums were 43.0 million and 33.7 million for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Casualty net earned premiums were 50.9 million and 49.7 million for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Net earned premiums within the Penn-America segment increased by 2.1 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. The premium growth in Penn-America's Wholesale Commercial, InsurTech, and Assumed Reinsurance divisions was partially offset by a reduction in premiums written for Specialty Products as a result of underwriting actions taken in 2023 to improve underwriting profitability. Property net earned premiums were 122.1 million and 106.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Casualty net earned premiums were 150.4 million and 160.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Net earned premiums within the Non-Core Operations segment decreased by 94.9 and 89.2 for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2023 primarily due to the non-renewal of a casualty treaty and a reduction in earned premiums due to the sale of Farm, Ranch Stable renewal rights on August 8, 2022. There were no property earned premiums for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Property earned premiums were 0.9 million and 14.1 million for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Casualty net earned premiums were 1.5 million and 27.3 million for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 12.4 million and 100.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Reserves 
 
 Amounts recorded for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses represent management s best estimate at September 30, 2024. Management s best estimate is as of a particular point in time and is based upon known facts, the Company s actuarial analyses, current law, and the Company s judgment. This resulted in carried gross and net reserves of 840.2 million and 769.3 million, respectively, as of September 30, 2024. A breakout of the Company s gross and net reserves, as of September 30, 2024, is as follows:

(1) Losses incurred but not reported, including the expected future emergence of case reserves. 

(2) Does not include reinsurance receivables on paid losses. 

Each reserve category has an implicit frequency and severity for each accident year as a result of the various assumptions made. If the actual levels of loss frequency and severity are higher or lower than expected, the ultimate losses will be different than management s best estimate. For most of its reserve categories, the Company believes that frequency can be predicted with greater accuracy than severity. Therefore, the Company believes management s best estimate is more likely influenced by changes in severity than frequency. The following table, which the Company believes reflects a reasonable range of variability around its best estimate based on historical loss experience and management s judgment, reflects the 
 34 

impact of changes (which could be favorable or unfavorable) in frequency and severity on the Company s current accident year net loss estimate of 159.6 million for claims occurring during the nine months ended September 30, 2024:

Reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures and ratios 
 The table below reconciles the non-GAAP measures or ratios, which excludes the impact of prior accident year adjustments, to its most directly comparable GAAP measure or ratio. The Company believes the non-GAAP measures or ratios are useful to investors when evaluating the Company's underwriting performance as trends within Non-Core Operations may be obscured by prior accident year adjustments. These non-GAAP measures or ratios should not be considered as a substitute for its most directly comparable GAAP measure or ratio and does not reflect the overall underwriting profitability of the Company.

(1) Excludes realized gains and losses 

Net investment income increased by 16.1 and 17.5 for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2023. This increase in net investment income was primarily due to strategies employed by the Company to take advantage of rising interest rates which resulted in a 15 increase in book yield on the fixed maturities portfolio to 4.6 at September 30, 2024 from 4.0 at September 30, 2023. 
 At September 30, 2024, the Company held asset-backed, mortgage-backed, commercial mortgage-backed and collateralized mortgage obligations with a market value of 279.4 million. Excluding the asset-backed, mortgage-backed, commercial mortgage-backed and collateralized mortgage obligations, the average duration of the Company s fixed maturities portfolio was 0.6 years as of September 30, 2024, compared with 1.0 years as of September 30, 2023. Changes in interest rates can cause principal payments on certain investments to extend or shorten which can impact duration. The Company s embedded book yield on its fixed maturities, not including cash, was 4.6 as of September 30, 2024, compared to 4.0 as of September 30, 2023. The embedded book yield on the 17.2 million of taxable municipal bonds in the Company s portfolio was 2.8 at September 30, 2024, compared to an embedded book yield of 3.0 on the Company s taxable municipal bonds of 26.2 million at September 30, 2023. 
 Net Realized Investment Gains (Losses) 
 
 The components of net realized investment gains (losses) for the quarters and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows:

 Corporate and Other Operating Expenses 
 
 Corporate and other operating expenses consist of outside legal fees, other professional fees, directors fees, management fees and advisory fees, and salaries and benefits for holding company personnel. Corporate and other operating expenses were 5.9 million and 5.3 million during the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 18.7 million and 16.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in corporate and other operating expenses was primarily due to an increase in professional fees. 
 42 

Income Tax Expense 
 
 Income tax expense was 3.1 million and 1.8 million for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 8.6 million and 4.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in income tax expense is primarily due to higher taxable income during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same periods in 2023. 
 
 See Note 6 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in Item 1 of Part I of this report for a comparison of income tax between periods. 
 Net Income 
 The factors described above resulted in net income of 12.8 million and 7.7 million for the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and net income of 34.2 million and 19.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies 
 
 The Company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with GAAP, which require it to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. 
 
 The most critical accounting policies involve significant estimates and include those used in determining the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, recoverability of reinsurance receivables, investments, fair value measurements, goodwill and intangible assets, deferred acquisition costs, and taxation. For a detailed discussion on each of these policies, please see the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. There have been no significant changes to any of these policies or underlying methodologies during the current year. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Sources and Uses of Funds 
 
 Global Indemnity Group, LLC is a holding company. Its principal asset is its ownership of the shares of its direct and indirect subsidiaries, including those of its insurance companies: United National Insurance Company, Diamond State Insurance Company, Penn-America Insurance Company, Penn-Star Insurance Company, and Penn-Patriot Insurance Company. 
 
 Global Indemnity Group, LLC s current short term and long term liquidity needs include but are not limited to the payment of corporate expenses, distributions to shareholders, and share repurchases. The Company also has commitments in the form of operating leases, commitments to fund limited liability investments, and unpaid losses and loss expense obligations. In order to meet its current short term and long term needs, Global Indemnity Group, LLC s principal sources of cash includes investment income, dividends from subsidiaries, other permitted disbursements from its direct and indirect subsidiaries, reimbursement for equity awards granted to employees and intercompany borrowings. The principal sources of funds at these direct and indirect subsidiaries include underwriting operations, investment income, proceeds from sales and redemptions of investments, capital contributions, intercompany borrowings, and dividends from subsidiaries. Funds are used principally by these operating subsidiaries to pay claims and operating expenses, to make intercompany debt payments, to purchase investments, and to make distribution payments. In addition, the Company periodically reviews opportunities related to business acquisitions, and as a result, liquidity may be needed in the future. 
 GBLI Holdings, LLC is a holding company which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Penn-Patriot Insurance Company. GBLI Holdings, LLC s principal asset is its ownership of the shares of its direct and indirect subsidiaries which include United National Insurance Company, Diamond State Insurance Company, Penn-America Insurance Company, and Penn-Star Insurance Company. GBLI Holdings, LLC is dependent on dividends from its subsidiaries as well as reimbursements from its subsidiaries for utilization of net operating losses and other tax attributes in order to meet its corporate expense obligations and intercompany financing obligations. 
 
 43 

As of September 30, 2024, the Company also had future funding commitments of 14.2 million related to one of the Company's investments in a limited partnership. Since the investment period has concluded, the Company does not expect any capital calls will be made prospectively. 
 
 The future liquidity of Global Indemnity Group, LLC is dependent on the ability of its subsidiaries to generate income to pay dividends and to pay intercompany debt due to Global Indemnity Group, LLC. The future liquidity of GBLI Holdings, LLC is dependent on the ability of its subsidiaries to generate income to pay dividends as well as receiving reimbursements from its subsidiaries for utilization of net operating losses. Global Indemnity Group, LLC and GBLI Holdings, LLC s insurance companies are restricted by statute as to the amount of dividends that they may pay without the prior approval of regulatory authorities. The dividend limitations imposed by state laws are based on the statutory financial results of each insurance company that are determined by using statutory accounting practices that differ in various respects from accounting principles used in financial statements prepared in conformity with GAAP. See Regulation - Statutory Accounting Principles in Item 1 of Part I of the Company s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Key differences relate to, among other items, deferred acquisition costs, limitations on deferred income taxes, reserve calculation assumptions and surplus notes. See Note 21 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of Part II of the Company s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on dividend limitations related to the Insurance Companies. There were no dividends declared or paid by the Company's insurance subsidiaries during the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Cash Flows 
 
 Sources of operating funds consist primarily of net written premiums and investment income. Funds are used primarily to pay claims and operating expenses and to purchase investments. As a result of the distribution policy, funds may also be used to pay distributions to shareholders of the Company. 
 
 The Company s reconciliation of net income to net cash provided by operations is generally influenced by the following: 
 the fact that the Company collects premiums, net of commissions, in advance of losses paid; 

the timing of the Company s settlements with its reinsurers; and 

the timing of the Company s loss payments. 

Net cash provided by operating activities was 52.3 million and 36.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in operating cash flows of approximately 15.5 million from the prior year was primarily a net result of the following items:

 Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company s reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. The Company s management, with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based upon that evaluation, and subject to the foregoing, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to accomplish their objectives at the reasonable assurance level. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

 46 

PART II-OTHER INFORMATION 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 The Company is, from time to time, involved in various legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business. The Company maintains insurance and reinsurance coverage for risks in amounts that it considers adequate. However, there can be no assurance that the insurance and reinsurance coverage that the Company maintains is sufficient or will be available in adequate amounts or at a reasonable cost. The Company does not believe that the resolution of any currently pending legal proceedings, either individually or taken as a whole, will have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition. 
 There is a greater potential for disputes with reinsurers who are in runoff.
