 Certain statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (the Quarterly Report that reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance, business strategies, expectations for our business and any other statements of a future or forward-looking nature, constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We intend such forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). All statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this Quarterly Report may be forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include statements about the anticipated benefits of the Business Combination (as defined below) and our financial condition, results of operations, earnings outlook and prospects. Forward-looking statements appear in a number of places in this Quarterly Report including, without limitation, in the sections titled Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of Pinstripes Holdings . 
 In addition, any statements that refer to projections, forecasts or other characterizations of future events or circumstances, including any underlying assumptions, are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are typically identified by words such as plan, believe, expect, anticipate, intend, outlook, estimate, forecast, project, continue, could, may, might, possible, potential, predict, should, would and other similar words and expressions, but the absence of these words does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. The forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report are based on our current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effects on us. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. We cannot assure you that future developments affecting the Company will be those that we have anticipated. These forward-looking statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties (some of which are beyond our control) or other assumptions that may cause actual results or performance to be materially different from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should any of our assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary in material respects from those projected in these forward-looking statements. Some factors that could cause actual results to differ include, but are not limited to:

If the Private Warrants are held by someone other than the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees, the Private Warrants will be redeemable by the Company in all Public Warrant redemption scenarios described above, on the same basis as the Public Warrants. 
 In connection with the Reverse Recapitalization, the Company entered into a loan agreement with Oaktree (see Note 5). In connection with the closing of the Oaktree Tranche 1 Loan, Oaktree was granted fully detachable warrants exercisable for an aggregate shares of Class A Common Stock, at an exercise price of per share Oaktree Tranche 1 Warrant s ). In the event that the volume-weighted average price VWAP per share of the Company s Class A Common Stock during the period commencing on the 91 st day after the closing of the Business Combination and ending 90 days thereafter is less than per share, the Company shall grant to Oaktree a warrant to purchase Common Stock for shares of Class A Common Stock, at an exercise price of per share Additional Oaktree Tranche 1 Warrants ). If the VWAP is less than during the same period, the Company shall instead grant to Oaktree a warrant to purchase common stock for shares of Class A Common Stock, at an exercise price of per share Additional Oaktree Tranche 1 Warrants ). Therefore, the Additional Oaktree Tranche 1 Warrants are considered contingently issuable and the contingency is satisfied when the Class A Common Stock meets the contingency requirements above. During the period commencing on the 91st day after the closing of the Business Combination and ending 90 days thereafter, the VWAP was less than and as such, the Company legally issued the Additional Oaktree Tranche 1 Warrants for shares of Class A Common Stock on June 27, 2024 at an exercise price of per share. As the Additional Oaktree Tranche 1 Warrants were considered issued and outstanding for accounting purposes on December 29, 2023 when the Senior Notes were issued, there is no accounting recognition at the legal issuance date when the issuance contingency was resolved. 
 In the event the Oaktree Tranche 2 Loan is funded, Oaktree will be granted additional warrants exercisable for an aggregate amount of shares of Class A Common Stock, at an exercise price of per share Oaktree Tranche 2 Warrants (collectively, the Oaktree Tranche 1 Warrants, Additional Oaktree Tranche 1 Warrants and Tranche 2 Warrants are referred to as the Oaktree Warrants ). In the event that the VWAP per share of Class A Common Stock during the period commencing the 91 st day after the closing of the Oaktree Tranche 2 Loan and ending 90 days thereafter is less than per share, Oaktree will instead be granted Oaktree Tranche 2 Warrants exercisable for an aggregate of shares of Class A Common Stock, at an exercise price of per share. The Oaktree Warrants will be exercisable on a cashless basis and the Company has agreed to register for the resale of the shares of Class A Common Stock underling the Oaktree Warrants. 
 With the closing of the Oaktree First Amendment (see Note 5), the Company is obligated to grant Additional Oaktree Tranche 2 Warrants on any closing of a Oaktree Tranche 2 Loan equal to the product of warrants incremental to the original warrants) multiplied by the quotient of (A) the total amount funded on such Tranche 2 Loan closing date by (B) (rather than a single additional warrant exercisable for shares), and the Company shall issue any Additional Oaktree Tranche 2 Warrant in a form consistent with the Oaktree Warrant Amendment described below. In connection with the Oaktree First Amendment (see Note 5), the Company and Oaktree entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Class A Common Stock Purchase Warrants (the Oaktree Warrant Amendment ), which eliminates the one-year lock-up restriction (subject to limited exceptions) that had existed in respect of the shares of the Company s Class A Common Stock issuable upon exercise of warrants (Oaktree Tranche 1 Warrants) issued by the Company to Oaktree in connection with the funding of the original Oaktree Tranche 1 Loan under the Oaktree Loan Agreement (as well as the same restriction that had been applicable to the transfer of the warrants themselves). 
 The Company determined the Oaktree Tranche 1 Warrants meet the equity classification guidance. Upon surrender of these equity-classified warrants, the holder is entitled to purchase one share of Class A Common Stock at per share. The equity classified warrants expire on the -year anniversary of the Reverse Recapitalization.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 Unless the context otherwise requires, any reference in this section to the Company, we, us, our, or Pinstripes refers to Pinstripes, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries prior to the consummation of the Business Combination and to Pinstripes Holdings, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries after the consummation of the Business Combination. You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this filing. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this filing including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should review the Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors sections in this filing for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. 
 We have a 52- or 53- week fiscal year ending on the last Sunday of April. All references to fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024 reflect the results of the 52-week fiscal year ended April 27, 2025 and April 28, 2024, respectively. The first and second quarters of fiscal 2025 reflect the results of the twelve weeks ended July 21, 2024 and October 13, 2024. Our first three fiscal quarters are comprised of twelve weeks each, and the fourth fiscal quarter contains sixteen weeks, except for fiscal years consisting of 53 weeks for which the fourth fiscal quarter will consist of seventeen weeks, and end on the twelfth Sunday of each quarter (sixteenth Sunday of the fourth fiscal quarter, and, when applicable, the seventeenth Sunday of the fourth fiscal quarter). 
 
 Overview 
 Pinstripes is an experiential dining and entertainment concept combining exceptional Italian-American cuisine with bowling, bocce and private events. Our large-format community venues offer a winning combination of sophisticated fun for the consumer longing for human connectedness across generations and we deliver a broad range of experiences, from a 300-person wedding in one of our many event spaces, to an intimate date night for two in one of our dining rooms, to a birthday party on our bowling lanes or bocce courts. This ability to offer curated and engaging experiences across a broad range of occasions enables us to generate revenue from numerous sources, including dining, bowling, bocce and private events and off-site events and catering. 
 As of October 13, 2024, we have 17 restaurants in ten states and Washington D.C., and approximately 1,700 employees (who we refer to as PinMembers ). We are highly disciplined in our site selection process and we design and construct large-format locations that are each 26,000 to 38,000 square feet of interior space, plus additional outdoor patio space that includes outdoor dining, bocce courts, fire-pits and decorative fountains. Each location can host over 900 guests at a time, with dining capacity of approximately 300 guests, bar capacity of 75 guests, 11 to 20 bowling lanes, 6 to 12 indoor/outdoor bocce courts and multiple private event spaces that can accommodate groups of 20 to 1,000 guests. Our locations generated average unit volumes AUV ), as further defined below, of 8.6 million for the fiscal year ended April 28, 2024, demonstrating the scale of our operating model and ability to tailor our space in bespoke ways. Our revenue growth is expected to be primarily driven by revenues from new location openings and increases in same store sales in the future. 
 
 Factors Affecting Our Business 
 Expanding Footprint 
 We have developed a disciplined new venue growth strategy in both new and existing markets, and target certain initial sales, profitability and payback period goals for each new venue opening. We employ a sophisticated, data-based site selection strategy that is highly collaborative with our real estate development partners and network of brokers around the country and focuses on markets with high income and education levels, population density and strong co-tenants. We expect to benefit from a powerful density effect as we continue to open new venues in existing markets, which increases market awareness and generates staffing synergies. 
 Macroeconomic Conditions 
 Consumer spending on food and entertainment outside the home fluctuates with macroeconomic conditions. Consumers tend to allocate higher spending to food outside the home when macroeconomic conditions are stronger and rationalize spending on food outside the home during weaker economies. While we have been able to partially offset inflation and other increases, such as wage increases, in the costs of core operating resources by gradually increasing menu prices, coupled with more efficient purchasing practices, productivity improvements and greater economies of scale, there

 can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to do so in the future. In particular, macroeconomic conditions could make additional menu price increases imprudent. There can be no assurance that future cost increases can be offset by increased menu prices or that increased menu prices will be fully absorbed by our customers without any resulting change to their visit frequencies or purchasing patterns. 
 Fiscal Calendar and Seasonality 
 We operate on a 52-week or 53-week fiscal year that ends on the last Sunday in April. In a 52-week fiscal year, the first, second and third fiscal quarters each contain twelve weeks and the fourth fiscal quarter contains sixteen weeks. In a 53-week fiscal year, the first, second and third fiscal quarters each contain twelve weeks and the fourth fiscal quarter contains seventeen weeks. 
 Our revenues are influenced by seasonal shifts in consumer spending. Typically, our average sales per location are highest during the holiday season (specifically the period from the last week of November to the second week of January) and summer, and lowest in the winter and the fall (other than during the holiday season). This seasonality is due to increases in spending and private events during the holiday season, followed by continued increased activity as the weather improves in the spring and summer. The fall and winter are our lowest sales seasons due to the fact that the weather is typically deteriorating and children are returning to school. Additionally, holidays, changes in the economy, severe weather and similar conditions may impact sales volumes seasonally in some operating regions. 
 As a result of these factors and the differences among our fiscal quarters, our quarterly operating results and comparable restaurant sales, as well as our key performance measures, may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and our results for any one quarter are not indicative of any other quarter. 
 
 The Business Combination 
 Pinstripes, Banyan, and Panther Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Banyan Merger Sub ), entered into the Second Amended and Restated Business Combination Agreement on November 22, 2023. Upon consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement (the BCA or Business Combination ), on December 29, 2023, Pinstripes merged with and into Merger Sub, with Pinstripes surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Banyan. In connection with the closing of the Business Combination, Banyan was renamed Pinstripes Holdings, Inc. 
 In connection with Banyan s initial public offering, Banyan issued (i) 12,075,000 Public Warrant sand 11,910,000 Private Warrants. On December 29, 2023, in connection with the Business Combination, Pinstripes effectively issued an aggregate of 23,985,000 warrants to purchase an equal number of shares of Class A Common Stock, representing the 12,075,000 Public Warrants and 11,910,000 Private Warrants. The Public Warrants and Private Warrants remained unexercised and were issued and outstanding as of October 13, 2024. 
 The Business Combination is accounted for as a reverse recapitalization in accordance with GAAP (the Reverse Recapitalization ). Under this method of accounting, Banyan is treated as the acquired company and Pinstripes is treated as the acquirer for financial reporting purposes. Accordingly, for accounting purposes, the financial statements of Pinstripes Holdings, Inc. represent a continuation of the financial statements of Pinstripes, Inc., with the Business Combination treated as the equivalent of Pinstripes issuing stock for the historical net assets of Banyan, accompanied by a recapitalization. The net assets of Banyan were stated at fair value, which approximated historical cost, with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded. Operations prior to the Business Combination are those of Pinstripes. 
 As a consequence of the Business Combination, Pinstripes, Inc. became a subsidiary of a SEC- registered and NYSE-listed company, which will require us to hire additional personnel and implement procedures and processes to address public company regulatory requirements. We expect to incur additional annual expenses as a public company for, among other things, directors and officers liability insurance, director fees and additional internal and external accounting and legal and administrative resources, including increased audit, consulting and legal fees. 
 
 Key Performance Metrics 
 We track the following key business metrics to evaluate our performance, identify trends, formulate financial projections, and make strategic decisions. We believe that these key business metrics provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our results of operations in the same manner as our management team. These key business metrics are presented for supplemental informational purposes only and may be different from similarly titled metrics or measures presented by other companies.

Table of Contents 

 Selected Metrics: 
 Average Unit Volumes (AUV) 
 Fiscal Year Ended (dollar amounts in millions) April 28, 2024 April 30, 2023 Total Locations 13 13 AUV 8.6 8.6 
 Average unit volume AUV is the total revenue generated by operating Pinstripes locations for the entire fiscal year, divided by the number of operating Pinstripes locations open for the entire fiscal year. This measurement allows us to assess, and our investors to understand, changes in guest spending patterns of our restaurants and the overall performance of our existing locations. An increase or decrease in AUV is the result of changes in guest traffic and average guest checks. We gather daily sales data and regularly analyze the restaurant traffic counts and the mix of menu items sold to aid in developing menu pricing, product offerings and promotional strategies designed to produce sustainable AUV. When opening locations in new markets, we typically generate significant revenues in the first year of operation as a result of guests wanting to experience a new concept open in the market, and typically continue to generate significant revenues in the second year and years thereafter as our overall brand awareness increases in the surrounding areas, coupled with an increase in many types of private events that are booked months, or years, in advance (i.e., weddings, bar mitzvahs, graduation parties, and others). 
 Store Labor and Benefits Percentage 
 Twelve Weeks Ended (dollar amounts in thousands) October 13, 2024 October 15, 2023 Percentage Change Store labor and benefits 10,308 9,337 10.4 As a percentage of total revenue 38.9 37.9 
 Store Labor and Benefits Percentage is store labor and benefits costs measured under GAAP divided by total revenue. 
 Same Store Sales Growth 
 Twelve Weeks Ended October 13, 2024 October 15, 2023 Same Store Sales Growth (9.4) 1.9 Store Base 13 13 
 Twenty-Four Weeks Ended October 13, 2024 October 15, 2023 Same Store Sales Growth (5.8) 2.5 Store Base 13 13 
 Same store sales growth refers to the change in year-over-year sales for the comparable store base. We include stores in the comparable store base that have been in operation for at least 12 full months prior to the accounting period presented. 
 Since opening new stores will be a significant component of our sales growth, comparable restaurant sales growth is only one measure of how we evaluate our performance. 
 Number of Store Openings 
 The number of store openings reflects the number of stores opened during a particular reporting period. Before we open new stores, we incur pre-opening expenses. The number and timing of store openings has had, and is expected to continue to have, an impact on our results of operations. During the twelve and twenty-four weeks ended October 13, 2024, there were no store openings.

 Components of Results of Operations 
 Revenue 
 We recognize food and beverage revenue, net of discounts and incentives, when payment is tendered at the point of sale as the performance obligation has been satisfied. Food and beverage revenue includes the sale of food and beverage products. Recreation revenue includes bowling and bocce sales. Revenues are recognized net of discounts and taxes. Event deposits received from guests are deferred and recognized as revenue when the event is held. Events sales consisting of charges for bowling or bocce play are recognized as recreation revenue, while all other event sales are recognized as food and beverage revenue. 
 We sell gift cards, which do not have expiration dates and do not deduct non-usage fees from outstanding gift card balances. We record gift card sales as a liability and recognize as revenue upon redemption by the customer. For unredeemed gift cards that we expect to be entitled to breakage and for which there is no legal obligation to remit the unredeemed gift card balances to the relevant jurisdictions, we recognize expected breakage as revenue in proportion to the pattern of redemption by the customers. The determination of the gift card breakage is based on our specific historical redemption patterns. 
 Revenues are reported net of sales tax collected from customers. Sales tax collected is included in other accrued liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets until the taxes are remitted to the appropriate taxing authorities. 
 Cost of food and beverage 
 The components of food and beverage costs are variable in nature, increase as sales volumes increase and are influenced by sales mix, commodity costs and inflation.

 The following table summarizes our results of operations: 
 Twenty-Four Weeks Ended Dollar Change Percentage Change (dollar amounts in thousands) October 13, 2024 October 15, 2023 Food and beverage revenues 44,927 39,952 4,975 12.5 Recreation revenues 12,150 10,412 1,738 16.7 Total revenue 57,077 50,364 6,713 13.3 Cost of food and beverage 10,173 8,715 1,458 16.7 Store labor and benefits 21,966 18,634 3,332 17.9 Store occupancy costs, excluding depreciation 11,487 5,590 5,897 105.5 Other store operating expenses, excluding depreciation 10,714 9,556 1,158 12.1 General and administrative expenses 10,584 7,302 3,282 44.9 Depreciation expense 5,065 3,341 1,724 51.6 Pre-opening expenses 2,574 5,304 (2,730) (51.5) Operating loss (15,486) (8,078) (7,408) 91.7 Interest expense, net (9,892) (3,601) (6,291) 174.7 Gain on change in fair value of warrant liabilities and other 6,248 1,350 4,898 362.8 Other expense (48) (48) 100.0 Loss before income taxes (19,178) (10,329) (8,849) 85.7 Income tax expense (benefit) 138 138 100.0 Net loss (19,316) (10,329) (8,987) 87.0 
 Revenue 
 The increase in revenue for the twenty-four weeks ended October 13, 2024 compared to the twenty-four weeks ended October 15, 2023 was primarily due to having four new stores open in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 that were open for the full period compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2024, partially offset by modest decreases in volume at locations open greater than 24 months Mature Venues ). 
 Cost of food and beverage 
 Twenty-Four Weeks Ended (dollar amounts in thousands) October 13, 2024 October 15, 2023 Percentage Change Cost of food and beverage 10,173 8,715 16.7 As a percentage of total revenue 17.8 17.3 
 The increase in food and beverage costs for the twenty-four weeks ended October 13, 2024 compared to the twenty-four weeks ended October 15, 2023 was due to an increase in food and beverage sales and more costs associated with the less efficient ramp up of our four new locations. 
 As a percentage of revenue, the increase in food and beverage costs for the twenty-four weeks ended October 13, 2024 compared to the twenty-four weeks ended October 15, 2023 was primarily due to inefficiencies resulting from an increase in relatively higher cost open play sales (vs. private event sales) from the four new locations open for the entire twenty-four weeks ended October 13, 2024 compared to the twenty-four weeks ended October 15, 2023.

 The increase in store labor and benefits expenses for the twenty-four weeks ended October 13, 2024 compared to the twenty-four weeks ended October 15, 2023 was primarily due to the addition of four new stores that were open for the full period that contributed to higher store labor and benefits costs. Excluding the addition of four new stores, store labor and benefits costs were down 20 basis points. 
 Store occupancy costs, excluding depreciation 
 Twenty-Four Weeks Ended (dollar amounts in thousands) October 13, 2024 October 15, 2023 Percentage Change Store occupancy costs, excluding depreciation 11,487 5,590 105.5 As a percentage of total revenue 20.1 11.1 
 The increase in store occupancy costs, excluding depreciation, including as a percentage of revenue, for the twenty-four weeks ended October 13, 2024 compared to the twenty-four weeks ended October 15, 2023 was primarily due to the impact of the amendment of our lease agreement entered in June 2023 for our Georgetown location, resulting in a reduction of occupancy cost in the first fiscal quarter of 2024 of 3,281, offset in part by four new locations open for the entire twenty-four weeks ended October 13, 2024 compared to the twenty-four weeks ended October 15, 2023. 
 Other store operating expenses, excluding depreciation 
 Twenty-Four Weeks Ended (dollar amounts in thousands) October 13, 2024 October 15, 2023 Percentage Change Other store operating expenses, excluding depreciation 10,714 9,556 12.1 As a percentage of total revenue 18.8 19.0 
 The increase in other store operating expenses, excluding depreciation for the twenty-four weeks ended October 13, 2024 compared to the twenty-four weeks ended October 15, 2023 was primarily due to four new locations open for the entire twenty-four weeks ended October 13, 2024 compared to the twenty-four weeks ended October 15, 2023. 
 As a percentage of revenue, the decrease in other store operating expenses, excluding depreciation, for the twenty-four weeks ended October 13, 2024 compared to the twenty-four weeks ended October 15, 2023 was primarily due to a decrease in credit card fees in the twenty-four weeks ended October 13, 2024 compared to the twenty-four weeks ended October 15, 2023.

 Depreciation expense 
 Twenty-Four Weeks Ended (dollar amounts in thousands) October 13, 2024 October 15, 2023 Percentage Change Depreciation expense 5,065 3,341 51.6 As a percentage of total revenue 8.9 6.6 
 The increase in depreciation expense for the twenty-four weeks ended October 13, 2024 compared to the twenty-four weeks ended October 15, 2023 was primarily due to assets being put into service for four new store locations that were open for the entire twenty-four weeks ended October 13, 2024 compared to the twenty-four weeks ended October 15, 2023.

 The increase in gain on change in fair value of warrant liabilities and other is primarily due to the transfer of the Public Warrants and Private Warrants in connection with the consummation of the Business Combination on December 29, 2023, the reclassification from equity to liability for the Oaktree Tranche 2 Warrants (see Note 10) and the decrease in our stock price and its impact on the fair value of our outstanding Public Warrants and Private Warrants and Oaktree Tranche 2 Warrants as of the second quarter of fiscal 2025. The increase is offset by a loss on the change in fair value of warrant liabilities and other related to the Oaktree Tranche 2 Written Option.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 To date, we have funded our operations through proceeds received from previous common stock and preferred stock issuances, through borrowings under various lending commitments and through cash flow from operations. As of October 13, 2024 and April 28, 2024, we had 3.2 million and 13.2 million in cash and cash equivalents, respectively. Since the end of fiscal 2024, we have utilized cash of approximately 15.7 million and accordingly, as of November 25, 2024, we had approximately 2.5 million in cash and cash equivalents. In fiscal 2023, we borrowed 22.5 million under a term loan facility (the Silverview Facility with Silverview Credit Partners LP Silverview and had access to second tranche in the amount of 12.5 million through the Silverview Facility. In fiscal 2023, we borrowed 11.5 million under an equipment loan facility (the Granite Creek Facility with Granite Creek Capital Partners LLC Granite Creek ). In fiscal 2024, we borrowed an additional 12.5 million under the Silverview Facility and an additional 5.0 million under the Granite Creek Facility. On December 29, 2023, we entered into a term loan agreement with Oaktree Fund Administration, LLC Oaktree ), as agent, under which we borrowed an additional 50.0 million (see Note 5). On September 3, 2024, we borrowed an additional 3.0 million and 2.0 million under the Oaktree Tranche 2 Loan and the Silverview Tranche 3 Loan, respectively. If we are unable to generate positive operating cash flows, additional debt and equity financings may be necessary to sustain future operations, and there can be no assurance that such financing will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. 
 Historically, our primary liquidity and capital requirements have been for new location development, initiatives to improve the customer experience in our locations, working capital and general corporate needs. Landlords have provided substantial tenant improvement allowances for construction, customers generally pay using cash or credit and debit cards and, as a result, our operations do not generate significant receivables. We have benefited from tenant improvement allowances. Additionally, our operations do not require significant inventories due, in part, to our use of numerous fresh ingredients, and we are able to sell most of our inventory items before payment is due to the supplier of such items. There has been an increase in costs from delays in construction and the time needed to recoup these costs from operations of the new locations. As a result, we have obtained additional capital (see above and note 5).

 In the first twenty-four weeks of fiscal 2024, we completed the closing of 19.8 million of Series I Convertible Preferred Stock, representing the sale of an aggregate of 850,648 shares of our Series I Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock at a purchase price of 25.00 per share. In connection with Reverse Recapitalization, the shares of Series I Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock were automatically cancelled and extinguished and converted into the right to receive shares of Pinstripes Class A Common Stock. 
 Another potential source of cash is proceeds from any exercises of Public Warrants or Private Warrants for cash (which have an aggregate exercise price of 275,827,500). However, the exercise price of each of the Public Warrants and Private Warrants is 11.50 per share, which exceeds the closing price of the Pinstripes Class A Common Stock on November 22, 2024, which was 0.85 per share, and we believe that, for so long as the Public Warrants and Private Warrants are out of the money, the holders thereof are not likely to exercise the Public Warrants or the Private Warrants. Any cash proceeds associated with the exercise of the Public Warrants and the Private Warrants are dependent on our stock price. Accordingly, we have not included the net proceeds from any exercise of the Public Warrants or Private Warrants in our assessment of our liquidity and our ability to fund operations on a prospective basis. 
 The Company believes that its current earnings projections, which include full year results for the stores that opened during the fiscal year ended April 28, 2024 and new store openings, raise substantial doubt on the Company s ability to continue as a going concern and the Company s ability to meet its current obligations, including for capital expenditures, lease obligations and continued operations as they become due within one year from the financial statement issuance date. To alleviate the conditions that raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern, management is exploring additional financing and a capital raise by the end of the fiscal third quarter. Due to the uncertainties associated with these plans, management concluded that substantial doubt exists with respect to the Company's ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the financial statement issuance date. See Note 5. 
 
 Cash Flows 
 The following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated: 
 Twenty-Four Weeks Ended (dollar amounts in thousands) October 13, 2024 October 15, 2023 Net cash (used in) operating activities (10,140) (15,924) Net cash (used in) investing activities (2,810) (9,793) Net cash provided by financing activities 3,023 25,272 Net change in cash and cash equivalents (9,927) (445) 
 Operating Activities 
 Net cash used in operating activities was (10.1) million for the twenty-four weeks ended October 13, 2024 compared to (15.9) million for the twenty-four weeks ended October 15, 2023. The decrease in net cash used in operating activities was due to lower accrued occupancy costs and other long-term assets as well as the gain on modification of operating leases that did not reoccur in the twenty-four weeks ended October 13, 2024. The decrease was off set by a higher operating loss driven by cost of food and beverage, store labor and benefits, store occupancy costs, excluding depreciation, and other store operating expenses, excluding depreciation, plus the four new store locations open for the entire twenty-four weeks ended October 13, 2024 as compared to the twenty-four weeks ended October 15, 2023. 
 Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities was (2.8) million for the twenty-four weeks ended October 13, 2024 compared to (9.8) million for the twenty-four weeks ended October 15, 2023. Our purchase of property and equipment of (2.8) million decreased in the twenty-four weeks ended October 13, 2024 from (9.8) million in the twenty-four weeks ended October 15, 2023 as there were less purchases that were offset by an increase in accumulated depreciation during the twenty-four weeks ended October 13, 2024 compared to the twenty-four weeks ended October 13, 2024. There was more depreciation during the twenty-four weeks ended October 13, 2024 as all four new locations had a full quarter of depreciation. 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash provided by financing activities was 3.0 million for the twenty-four weeks ended October 13, 2024 compared to net cash provided by financing activities of 25.3 million for the twenty-four weeks ended October 15, 2023. 
 41 

Table of Contents 

 The primary components of net cash provided by financing activities for the twenty-four weeks ended October 15, 2023 were proceeds from the issuance of the Series I Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock of 19.9 million. These proceeds were offset by proceeds from long-term notes payable of 7.5 million. The cash provided by financing activities for the twenty-four weeks ended October 13, 2024 consists of 4.8 million of additional debt financing obtained from Oaktree and Silverview, net of debt discount, offset by principal payments of long-term notes payable of 1.9 million. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 As of the date of this report, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the balance sheet date, as well as reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Our most significant estimates and judgments involve difficult, subjective or complex judgements made by management. Actual results may differ from these estimates. To the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be affected. We believe that the accounting policies described below involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations. For further information, see Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in the 2024 Annual Report. 
 Leases 
 We have made an accounting policy election applicable to all asset classes not to record leases with an initial term of twelve months or less on the balance sheet as allowed under ASC 842. We lease all of our locations from third parties. For leases with an initial term greater than twelve months, a related lease liability is recorded on the balance sheet at the present value of future fixed payments discounted at our estimated fully collateralized borrowing rate corresponding with the lease term (i.e. incremental borrowing rate). In addition, a right-of-use asset is recorded as the initial amount of the lease liability, plus any initial direct costs incurred and lease prepayment, less any tenant improvement allowance incentives received. Most of our leases include one or more options to renew, with terms that can extend from five to ten years. To determine the expected lease term, we excluded all options to renew as it is not reasonably certain we would exercise these options. 
 Lease payments include fixed payments and variable payments for common area maintenance costs, real estate taxes, insurance related to leases or additional rent based upon sales volume (variable lease cost). Variable lease costs are expensed as incurred whereas fixed lease costs are recorded on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease. We do not separate lease and non-lease components (e.g. common area maintenance), which is a policy maintained for all asset classes. Leases do not contain any material residual value guarantee or material restrictive covenants. 
 The discount rate used to determine the amount of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities is the interest rate implicit in the lease, when known. If the rate is not implicit in the lease, we use our incremental borrowing rate, which is derived based on available information at the commencement date. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. 
 Impairment of Long-lived Assets 
 We review long-lived assets, such as property and equipment, and operating lease right-of-use assets with definitive lives, for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. We perform our long-lived asset impairment analysis by grouping assets and liabilities at the individual store level, since this is the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities and evaluate the asset group against the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows. 
 In determining the undiscounted future cash flows, we consider historical cash flows and other relevant factors and circumstances, including the maturity of the store, changes in the economic environment, unfavorable changes in business climate and future operating plans. The significant inputs used in determining our estimate of the projected undiscounted future cash flows include future revenue growth, changes in store labor and operating costs, future lease payments and projected operating margins as well as the estimate of the remaining useful life of the assets. We believe our assumptions are reasonable based on available information. Changes in assumptions and estimates used in the impairment analysis, or future results that vary from assumptions used in the analysis, could affect the estimated fair value of long-lived intangible assets and could result in impairment charges in a future period.

 Warrants 
 We account for warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the warrant s specific terms and applicable authoritative guidance in Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity ASC 480 ), and ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging ASC 815 ). The assessment considers whether the warrants are freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, whether they meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the warrants meet all of the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the warrants are indexed to the Company s own common stock and whether the warrant holders could potentially require net cash settlement in a circumstance outside of the Company s control, among other conditions for equity classification. This assessment, which requires the use of professional judgment, is conducted at the time of warrant issuance and as of each subsequent quarterly period end date while the warrants are outstanding. 
 For issued or modified warrants that meet all of the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded as a component of equity at the time of issuance. For issued or modified warrants that do not meet all the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded as liabilities at their initial fair value on the date of issuance, and each balance sheet date thereafter. Changes in the estimated fair value of the warrants are recognized as a non-cash gain or loss on the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
 The Public Warrants and Private Warrants meet the definition of a derivative instrument, requiring liability classification, and are measured at fair value on a recurring basis with the change in fair value recognized in the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. The fair value of the Public Warrants is measured by the Company s publicly traded warrant price. In determining the fair value of the Private Warrants, the Company utilizes the Cox-Rubenstein-Ross binomial lattice model using Level 3 inputs consisting of the fair value of the Public Warrants as of the measurement and implied equity volatility. See Note 10. 
 The Company determined the Oaktree Tranche 1 Warrants meet the equity classification guidance and were measured at fair value upon issuance. Under the Oaktree loan agreement, the Company is contractually obligated to issue a specified number of warrants to Oaktree based on the scenarios described in Note 10. Therefore, the Additional Oaktree Tranche 1 Warrants and Oaktree Tranche 2 Warrants (as defined in Note 10) are considered contingently issuable and the contingency is satisfied when Oaktree exercises its written option on the Oaktree Tranche 2 Loan and the Class A Common Stock meets the contingency requirements described in Note 10. When the contingently issuable warrants contingency is satisfied, the respective shares underlying these warrants will be considered indexed to the Class A Common Stock and qualify for equity classification under the derivative scope exception provided by ASC 815 (see Note 10). The contingency was satisfied on the Additional Oaktree Tranche 1 Warrants when the Class A Common Stock met the contingency requirements described in Note 10. Additionally, when 3.0 million was funded under the Oaktree Tranche 2 Written Option, 174,750 warrants were issued and the contingency was satisfied (see Note 10). As such, these awards were reclassified from equity to liability. We believe our assumptions are reasonable based on available information. Changes in assumptions and estimates used in the warrants valuation, or future results that vary from assumptions used in the analysis, could affect the estimated fair value of warrant liabilities and could result in material charges in a future period. 
 Revenue Recognition 
 We recognize food and beverage revenues and recreation revenue when payment is tendered at the point of sale as the performance obligation has been satisfied. Food and beverage revenues include the sale of food and beverage products. Recreation revenue includes bowling and bocce sales. We recognize revenues net of discounts and taxes. We defer event deposits received from guests and recognized such deposits as revenue when the event is held. Event deposits received from customers in advance are included in amounts due to customers, and we recognize revenues from events when the event takes place. 
 We sell gift cards, which do not have expiration dates and do not deduct non-usage fees from outstanding gift card balances. We record gift card sales as a liability and recognized as revenue upon redemption by the customer. For unredeemed gift cards that we expect to be entitled to breakage and for which there is no legal obligation to remit the unredeemed gift card balances to the relevant jurisdictions, we recognize expected breakage as revenue in proportion to the pattern of redemption by the customers. The determination of the gift card breakage is based on our specific historical redemption patterns. The contract liability related to our gift cards is included in amounts due to customers in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. We report revenues net of sales tax collected from customers. We include sales tax collected in other accrued liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets until the taxes are remitted to the appropriate taxing authorities. We believe our assumptions are reasonable based on available information. Changes in assumptions and estimates used in the gift card breakage calculation, or future results that vary from assumptions used in 
 43

 the analysis, could affect the estimated revenue recognized from gift card breakage and could result in material changes in a future period. 
 
 Classification of Instruments as Liabilities or Equity 
 We have applied ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity , to classify as a liability or equity certain redeemable and/or convertible instruments, including our preferred stock. We determine the liability classification if the financial instrument is mandatory redeemable for cash or by issuing a variable number of equity shares. 
 If we determine that a financial instrument should not be classified as a liability, we then determine whether the financial instrument should be presented between the liability section and the equity section of the balance sheet as temporary equity. We determine financial instruments as temporary equity if the redemption of the preferred stock or other financial instrument is outside of our control. Otherwise, we account for the financial instrument as permanent equity. 
 
 Emerging Growth Company 
 The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, relax certain reporting requirements for qualifying public companies for up to five years or until we are no longer an emerging growth company. We qualify as an emerging growth company and under the JOBS Act are allowed to comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements based on the effective date for private (not publicly traded) companies. We have elected not to opt out of such extended transition period, and as a result, we may not comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. As a result, the condensed consolidated financial statements may not be comparable to those of companies that comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 This item is not applicable as the Company is a smaller reporting company. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Prior to the Business Combination, Legacy Pinstripes was not required to certify effective disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting. Upon consummation of the Business Combination, management is required to certify financial and other information in our quarterly and annual reports and provide an annual management report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. 
 Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Our management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report (under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO ). Based on that assessment, our CEO and CFO have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were not effective due to material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting, as described below. Management s assessment of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures is expressed at a level of reasonable assurance because management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives. 
 Material Weakness in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As of April 28, 2024, we identified material weaknesses in relation to (i) our financial statement close process, (ii) our lease accounting processes and (iii) the maintenance and accuracy of our outstanding equity information and accounting for stock-based compensation. The material weakness related to our financial statement close process resulted from a lack of adequate policies, procedures, controls and sufficient technical accounting personnel to appropriately analyze, record and disclose accounting matters for routine and non-routine

 transactions timely and accurately. This material weakness contributed to the material weakness related to our lease accounting process, which related to the design of the controls relating to the identification and assessment of lease agreement terms and conditions, assessment of lease modifications and related accounting treatment, as well as to the material weakness related to the design of controls in respect of issuing, tracking and maintaining accurate ledgers as to authorized, issued and outstanding shares and calculations of stock based compensation. This resulted in prior period errors in our accounting records related to our lease obligations, occupancy costs, right of use assets and related financial statement disclosures, along with errors in share capital amounts and stock based compensation, all of which were corrected in connection with the issuance of the audited consolidated financial statements of Pinstripes as of and for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2023. 
 These material weaknesses did not result in any identified material misstatements to the financial statements, but based on these material weaknesses, management concluded that at April 28, 2024 and October 13, 2024, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective. 
 Management s Remediation Plan 
 In response to the material weaknesses discussed above, we plan to continue efforts already underway to improve internal control over financial reporting, which include creating formal policies and procedures governing our financial statement close process, and control in the preparation, documentation and review of journal entries and account reconciliations. 
 We have taken measures to address the material weakness related to stock-based compensation identified in the 2024 Annual Report and enhance our internal control over financial reporting. Based on our remediation efforts and related testing, during the twelve weeks ended July 21, 2024 and the sixteen weeks ended April 28, 2024, we concluded that the material weakness related to stock compensation has been remediated. We have: 
 hired additional accounting and financial reporting personnel with U.S. GAAP and SEC reporting experience to facilitate second level reviews, and financial reporting oversight; 
 engaged a third-party equity plan administrator to account for our employee equity plan and transactions, which now tracks grants and cancellations as well as provides disclosure reports; and 
 implemented protocols and controls around stock grants and personnel termination processes and ensured proper communication and training around the implemented changes. 
 We are currently in the process of implementing measures to address the underlying causes of the remaining material weaknesses and the control deficiencies which include: 
 hiring additional accounting and financial reporting personnel with U.S. GAAP, and SEC reporting experience to facilitate second level reviews, and financial reporting oversight; 
 developing, communicating and implementing an accounting policy manual for our accounting and financial reporting personnel for recurring transactions and period-end closing processes; 
 establishing effective monitoring and oversight controls for non-recurring and complex transactions to ensure the accuracy and completeness of our financial statements and related disclosures; 
 reviewing and enhancing of IT general controls over information systems relevant to financial reporting, including privileged access and segregation of duties; and 
 realignment of existing personnel and the addition of both internal and external personnel to strengthen management s review and documentation over internal control over financial reporting. 
 We will continue to review and improve our internal control over financial reporting to address the underlying causes of the remaining material weaknesses and control deficiencies. We cannot be certain that the steps we are taking will be sufficient to remediate the control deficiencies that led to these material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting or prevent future material weaknesses or control deficiencies from occurring. In addition, we cannot be certain that we have identified all material weaknesses and control deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting or that in the future we will not have additional material weaknesses or control deficiencies in its internal control over financial reporting. Further, we continue to review our internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures to provide reasonable assurance as to the ability to comply with reporting requirements following the completion of the Business Combination.

 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 Except for the remediation of the material weakness related to stock-based compensation and the efforts to remediate the other material weaknesses described above, there were no changes during the twenty-four weeks ended October 13, 2024 in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to material affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Inherent Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls 
 Our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our Company have been detected. 
 These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies and procedures.

 Part II - Other Information 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 For discussion of legal proceedings, see Note 12 to our condensed consolidated financial statements under Part 1, Item 1. Financial Information and under Commitments and Contingencies of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in the Risk Factors section contained in the 2024 Annual Report, together with the cautionary statement under the caption Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors contained in our 2024 Annual Report. These described risks are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. 
 There can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with the continued listing standards of the NYSE, which could result in the delisting of our securities, limit investors ability to make transactions in our securities and subject us to additional trading restrictions. 
 The Class A Common Stock and the warrants sold as part of the units in the IPO, whether they were purchased in the IPO or thereafter in the open market (the Public Warrants ), are currently listed on the NYSE under the symbol PNST and the PNST WS, respectively. 
 If we were to fail to meet the continued listing requirements of the NYSE or another national stock exchange, we and our stockholders could face significant material adverse consequences, including: 
 a limited availability of market quotations for our securities; 
 reduced liquidity for our securities; 
 a determination that the Class A Common Stock is a penny stock, which would require brokers trading in the Class A Common Stock to adhere to more stringent rules and possibly result in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our securities; 
 a limited amount of news and analyst coverage; and 
 a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future. 
 On October 16, 2024, we were notified by the NYSE that we were not in compliance with Section 802.01B and Section 802.01C of the NYSE Listed Company Manual because the Company's average market capitalization was less than 50 million over a consecutive 30 trading-day period and, at the same time, the average closing price of the Company s common stock was less than 1.00 over a consecutive 30 trading-day period. The notice does not result in the immediate delisting of the Company s Class A Common Stock from the NYSE. 
 We plan to submit a plan to the NYSE on or before November 30, 2024, that is intended to cure the market capitalization and stock price deficiencies and to return the Company to compliance with the NYSE continued listing standards. The Company can regain compliance at any time within the six-month period with respect of the minimum average share price deficiency if following receipt of the NYSE notice if on the last trading day of any calendar month during the cure period the Company has a closing share price of at least 1.00 and an average closing share price of at least 1.00 over the 30 trading-day period ending on the last trading day of that month. 
 The NYSE will have 45 days after the receipt of the plan to review and determine whether the Company has made a reasonable demonstration of its ability to regain compliance with the minimum average market capitalization standard within the 18-month cure period. The NYSE will either accept the plan, at which time we would be subject to ongoing monitoring for compliance with the plan, or the NYSE will not accept the plan, and the Company would be subject to suspension and delisting procedures. If the NYSE accepts the plan and the Company satisfies the minimum average market capitalization standard, the Company s Class A Common Stock will continue to be listed and traded on the NYSE during the 18-month cure period, subject to the Company s compliance with other continued listing standards, including the minimum average share price standard, and the Company will be subject to quarterly monitoring by the NYSE for compliance with the plan. 
 47 

Table of Contents 

 Under the NYSE s rules, if the Company determines that, if necessary, it will cure the market capitalization and stock price deficiencies by taking an action that will require stockholder approval, it must so inform the NYSE in the above referenced notification and the market capitalization and price condition will be deemed cured if the market capitalization and price promptly exceeds 50 million and 1.00 per share, respectively, and the price remains above those levels for at least the following 30 trading days. The Company intends to consider available alternatives, including but not limited to a reverse stock split, that are subject to shareholder approval. 
 Substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
 There is substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern and the Company s ability to meet its current obligations, including for capital expenditures, lease obligations and continued operations as they become due within one year from the issuance date of the financial statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The principal conditions leading to this conclusion are our current earnings projections, which include full year results for the stores that opened during the fiscal year ended April 28, 2024 and new store openings. In order to alleviate these conditions, management is exploring additional financing and a capital raise by the end of the fiscal third quarter. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will have the ability to raise additional capital when needed. There can be no assurance that these plans will be successfully implemented or that they will mitigate the conditions that raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The inability to raise sufficient additional capital would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and likely cause the price of the Company s common stock to decline. 
 
 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 None. 
 
 Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities 
 None. 
 
 Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures 
 Not Applicable. 
 
 Item 5. Other Information 
 (a) Securities Trading Plans of Directors and Executive Officers 
 During the fiscal quarter ended October 13, 2024, none of our directors or executive officers into, modified or , contracts, instructions or written plans for the sale or purchase of our securities that were intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1 or that constituted non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangements (as defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K).
