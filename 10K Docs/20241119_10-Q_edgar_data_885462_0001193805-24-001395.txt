In the last twenty years, to the Company s
knowledge, there were no government regulations requiring bromine manufacturers to obtain land use and planning approval document. As
such, the Company believes most of the bromine manufacturers in Shouguang City do not have land use and planning approval documents and
lease their land parcels from the village associations. They are facing the same issues in connection with land use and planning as the
Company. To the Company s knowledge, the local government has submitted its plan to solve the issues to higher authority and are
waiting for approval from the higher authority. 

The Company is in the process of resolving the
issues in connection with SCHC s land use and planning diligently. The Company has been in discussions closely with the local government
authorities with the help from Shouguang City Bromine Association to seek reliefs and, based on verbal confirmation by local government
authorities, believes the administrative penalties imposed by the Bureau according to the Written Decisions are being re-assessed by local
government authorities and may be revoked. Pursuant to a Written Application dated October 28, 2019 addressed to the Court by the Bureau,
the Bureau withdrew its application for the enforcement proceedings regarding the administrative penalty imposed on Factory No. 7, Factory
No. 8 and Factory No. 10. Pursuant to a written decisions of administrative ruling captioned (2019) Lu 0783 Xing Shen No. 389 Zhi Yi,
dated November 25, 2020, the Court orders to terminate the enforcement of the case captioned (2019) Lu 0783 Xing Shen No. 389. Production
of Factory No. 7 was allowed to resume in April 2019. The Company received a notification from the Shouguang City Government in February
2019 informing the Company that Factory No. 1, No. 4, No. 7 and No. 9 have passed inspection and were approved to resume operation 

In addition, on August 28, 2019, the People s
Government of Shandong Province, issued a regulation titled Investment Project Management Requirements of Chemical Companies in
Shandong Province permitting the construction of facilities on existing sites or infrastructure of bromine manufacturing and other
chemical industry-related types of projects (clause 11 of section 3). The Company believes that the goal of the government is to standardize
and regulate the industry and not to demolish the facilities or penalize the manufacturers. As of the date of this report, the Company
has not been notified by the local government that it will take any measure to enforce the administrative penalties. Based on information
known to date, the Company believes that it is remote that the Written Decisions or Court Rulings will be enforced within the expected
timeframe and a material penalty or costs and expenses against the Company will result. However, there can be no assurance that there
will not be any further enforcement action, the occurrence of which may result in further liabilities, penalties and operational disruption. 

In view of the above facts and circumstances,
the Company believes that it is not necessary to accrue for any estimated losses or impairment as of September 30, 2024.

Overview 

We are a Nevada holding
company which conducts operations through our wholly-owned China-based subsidiaries. Our business is conducted and reported in four segments,
namely, bromine, crude salt, chemical products and natural gas. 

Through our wholly-owned
subsidiary, SCHC, we produce and trade bromine and crude salt. We are one of the largest producers of bromine in China, as measured
by production output. Elemental bromine is used to manufacture a wide variety of bromine compounds used in industry and agriculture. Bromine
also is used to form intermediary chemical compounds such as Tetramethylbenzidine. Bromine is commonly used in brominated flame
retardants, fumigants, water purification compounds, dyes, medicines and disinfectants. Crude salt is the principal material
in alkali production as well as chlorine alkali production and is widely used in the chemical, food and beverage, and other industries. 

Through our wholly-owned
subsidiary, SYCI, we manufacture and sell chemical products used in oil and gas field exploration, oil and gas distribution, oil field
drilling, papermaking chemical agents, inorganic chemicals and materials that are used for human and animal antibiotics. 

Our wholly-owned subsidiary,
DCHC, was established to explore and develop natural gas and brine resources (including bromine and crude salt) in Sichuan Province, China. 

As disclosed in the Company s
Current Report on Form 8-K filed on September 8, 2017, the Company received, on September 1, 2017, letters from the Yangkou County, Shouguang
City government addressed to each of its subsidiaries, SCHC and SYCI, which stated that in an effort to improve the safety and environmental
protection management level of chemical enterprises, the plants are requested to immediately stop production and perform rectification
and improvements in accordance with the country s new safety and environmental protection requirements. In the Company s press
release of August 11, 2017 and on its conference call of August 14, 2017, the Company addressed concerns that increased government enforcement
of stringent environmental rules that were adopted in early 2017 to insure corporations bring their facilities up to necessary standards
so that pollution and other negative environmental issues are limited and remediated, could have an impact on our business in both the
short and long-term. The Company also expressed that although it believed its facilities were fully compliant at the time, the Company
did not know how its facilities would fare under the new rules. Teams of inspectors from the government were sent to many provinces to
inspect all mining and manufacturing facilities. The local government requested that facilities be closed, so that the facilities could
undergo the inspection and analysis in the most efficient manner by inspectors team. As a result, our facilities were closed on
September 1, 2017. 

The Company believes
that this is another step by the government to improve the environment. It further believes the goal of the government is not to close
all plants, but rather to codify the regulations related to project approval, land use, planning approval and environmental protection
assessment approval so that illegal plants are not able to open in the future and so that plants close to population centers do not cause
serious environmental damage. In addition, the Company believes that the Shandong provincial government wants to assure that each of its
regional and county governments has applied the Notice in a consistent manner. 

The Shouguang City Bromine
Association, on behalf of all the bromine plants in Shouguang, started discussions with the local government agencies. The local governmental
agencies confirmed the facts that their initial requirements for the bromine industry did not include the project approval, the planning
approval and the land use rights approval and that those three additional approvals were new requirements of the provincial government.
The Company understood from the local government that it has been coordinating with several government agencies to solve these three outstanding
approval issues in a timely manner and that all the affected bromine plants willnot be allowed to commence production prior to obtaining
those approvals. 

In February 2019, the Company received a notification
from the local government of Yangkou County that its Factory No. 1, No. 4, No. 7 and No. 9 had passed inspection and could resume operations.
In April 2019, Factory No. 1 and No. 7 resumed operations. 

On February 28, 2020,
the Company announced that it received an approval from the government to resume bromine production after winter temporary closure. Subsequently,
it received another approval from the Shouguang Yangkou People s Government dated on March 5, 2020 to resume production at its bromine
factories No. 1, No. 4, No. 7 and No. 9 in order to meet the needs of bromide products for epidemic prevention and control. With these
two approvals, the Company was allowed to resume production at all four bromine factories. 

17 

The Company received
an oral notification from the government for its Factory No. 8, which permitted Factory No.8 to resume production in August 2022. Factory
No.8 started to contribute revenue in the fourth quarter 2022. 

Pursuant to the notification
from the government of Shouguang City, all bromine facilities in Shouguang City were temporarily closed from December 10, 2022 until February
1, 2023. To comply with such notification, the Company had temporarily stopped production at its bromine facilities during the aforesaid
period and reopened the operating bromine and crude salt factories in February, 2023. 

The Company is still
waiting for governmental approval for factories No. 2 and No. 10. To its knowledge, the government is currently completing its planning
process for all mining areas including that for prevention of flood. As a result, the Company may be required to make some modifications
to our current wells and aqueducts prior to commencement of operations of these factories in order to satisfy the local government's requirements. 

On November 24, 2017, Gulf Resources received a letter from the People s
Government of Yangkou County, Shouguang City notifying the Company that due to the new standards and regulations relating to safety production
and environmental pollution, from certain local governmental departments, such as the municipal environmental protection department, the
security supervision department and the fire department, its chemical enterprises would have to be relocated to a new industrial park
called Bohai Marine Fine Chemical Industry Park. Although our chemical companies were in compliance with regulations, they
were also close to a residential area. As a result, the government determined we should relocate to the Bohai park. Chemical companies
that are not being asked to move into the park are being permanently closed. Since our factories closed, the Company has secured
from the government the land use rights for its chemical plant. On January 6, 2020, the Company received the environmental protection
approval by the government of Shouguang City, Shandong Province for the proposed Yuxin Chemical factory. The Company began the construction
on its new chemical facilities located at Bohai Marine Fine Chemical Industrial Park in June 2020. The construction was expected to take
approximately one year and an additional six months to complete the equipment installation and testing, however due to the COVID epidemic
and electrical restrictions, the opening of the chemical factory has been delayed. The Company has received the refrigeration and
air compressor units. On July 26, 2023, the Company announced that the delivery of the remaining equipment for its Yuxin chemical factory
has been temporarily delayed and the Company will re-evaluate its chemical products strategy. 

In January 2017, the
Company completed the first brine water and natural gas well field construction in Daying located in Sichuan Province and commenced trial
production in January 2019. On May 29, 2019, the Company received a verbal notice from the government of Tianbao Town ,Daying County,
Sichuan Province, whereby the Company is required to obtain project approval for its well located in Daying, including the whole natural
gas and brine water project, and approvals for safety production inspection, environmental protection assessment, and to solve the related
land issue. Until these approvals have been received, the Company has to temporarily halt trial production at its natural gas well in
Daying. In compliance with the Chinese government new policies, the Company is also required to obtain an exploration license and a mining
license for bromine and natural gas, respectively. Pursuant to the Opinions of the Ministry of Natural Resources on Several Issues in
Promoting the Reform of Mineral Resources Management (Trial) promulgated by the Ministry of Natural Resources of PRC on January 9, 2020,
which came into effect on May 1, 2020, privately owned enterprises are allowed to participate in the natural gas production. The Company
plans to proceed with its applications for the natural gas and brine project approvals with related government departments until after
the governmental planning has been finalized the land and resource planning for Sichuan Province. 

In April 2022, Shouguang Hengde Salt Industry
Co. Ltd SHSI ,
our subsidiary, was incorporated in Shandong Province, China, for crude salt production and trading. 

On January 28, 2020 we completed a 1-for-5 reverse
stock split of our common stock, such that for each five shares outstanding prior to the stock split there was one share outstanding after
the reverse stock split. All shares of common stock referenced in this report have been adjusted to reflect the stock split
figures.

by operating activities of approximately 9.9 million was mainly due to a non-cash adjustment for depreciation and amortization expense
of 15.4 million and offset by a net loss of 3.02 million and an increase in prepayments and deposits of 3.95 million. 

Accounts receivable 

Cash collections on our accounts receivable had
a major impact on our overall liquidity. The following table presents the aging analysis of our accounts receivable as of September 30,
2024 and December 31, 2023.

are made to customers with an appropriate credit history. We perform ongoing credit evaluation on the financial condition of our customers.
No allowance for doubtful accounts for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 is required.

Raw materials decreased by 3,007 as of September

Our finished goods decreased by 146,383 as of
September 30, 2024 as compared to December 31, 2023. 

Net Cash Used in Investing Activities 

During the six months ended September 30, 2024,
we used approximately 60.5 million to acquire property, plant and equipment, which primarily included the cost of bromine wells and the
installation of high and low voltage lines for these bromine wells, as well as the purchase of salt plants. 

For the nine-month period ended September 30,
2023, we used approximately 15.2 million to the flood prevention project aiming to prevent flooding that could harm the wells, aqueducts
and crude salt pans at our plant. 

Net Cash Used in Financing Activities 

For the nine-month period ended September 30,
2024 and 2023, we used 0.3 million to repay finance lease obligations. 

We believe that our available funds and cash flows
generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated ongoing operating needs and our obligations as they full due in the
next twelve (12) months. 

We had available cash of approximately 11.24
million at September 30, 2024, all of which is in highly liquid current deposits earning no or little interest. We do not anticipate paying
cash dividends in the foreseeable future. 

We intend to continue to focus our efforts on the activities of SCHC,
SYCI, SHSI and DCHC as these segments continue to expand within the Chinese market. 

We may not be able to identify, successfully integrate
or profitably manage any businesses or business segment we may acquire, or any expansion of our business. An expansion may involve a number
of risks, including possible adverse effects on our operating results, diversion of management s attention, inability to retain
key personnel, risks associated with unanticipated events, risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and the financial statement effect
of potential impairment of acquired intangible assets, any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our condition and results of
operations. In addition, if competition for acquisition candidates or operations were to increase, the cost of acquiring businesses could
increase materially. We may effect an acquisition with a target business which may be financially unstable, under-managed, or in its early
stages of development or growth. Our inability to implement and manage our expansion strategy successfully may have a material adverse
effect on our business and future prospects. 

Contractual Obligations and Commitments 

 We have no significant contractual obligations
not fully recorded on our consolidated balance sheets or fully disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. Additional
information regarding our contractual obligations and commitments at September 30, 2023 is provided in the notes to our consolidated financial
statements. See Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 17 Capital Commitment and Operating Lease Commitments . 

Material Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We do not currently have any off balance sheet
arrangements falling within the definition of Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Our consolidated financial statements have been
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and this requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We base its estimates on historical experience and on various
other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Accordingly, actual results may differ significantly from
these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We have identified the following critical accounting policies and estimates
used by us in the preparation of our financial statements: accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts, leases, property,
plant and equipment, recoverability of long lived assets, revenue recognition, income taxes, loss contingencies, and stock-based compensation.
These policies and estimates are described in the Company s 2023 Form 10-K. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

Pursuant to Item 305(e) of Regulation S-K 229.305(e)), the
Company is not required to provide the information required by this Item as it is a smaller reporting company, as defined
by Rule 229.10(f)(1). 

27 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures
(as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed
in our reports filed pursuant to the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in
the SEC s rules, regulations and related forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including
our Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO ), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. 

Under the supervision and with the participation
of our management, including our CEO and CFO, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on this evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that our
disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q. 

(b) Changes in internal controls 

There were no changes in our internal control
over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during our most recently completed fiscal
quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 

On or about August 3, 2018, written decisions
of administration penalty captioned Shou Guo Tu Zi Fa Gao Zi [2018] No. 291, Shou Guo Tu Zi Fa Gao Zi [2018] No. 292, Shou Guo Tu Zi Fa
Gao Zi [2018] No. 293, Shou Guo Tu Zi Fa Gao Zi [2018] No. 294, Shou Guo Tu Zi Fa Gao Zi [2018] No. 295 and Shou Guo Tu Zi Fa Gao Zi [2018]
No. 296 (together, the Written Decisions were served on Shouguang City Haoyuan Chemical Company Limited SCHC by Shouguang City Natural Resources and Planning Bureau (the Bureau ), naming SCHC as respondent respectively thereof. The
Decisions challenged the land use of Factory nos. 2, 9, 7, 4, 8 and 10, respectively, and alleged, among other things, that SCHC had illegally
occupied and used the land in the total area of approximately 52,674 square meters, on which Factory nos. 2, 9, 7, 4, 8 and 10 were built,
respectively. The Written Decisions ordered SCHC, among other things, to return the land subject to the Written Decisions to its respective
legal owner, restore the land to its original state, and demolish or confiscate all the buildings and facilities thereon and pay monetary
penalty of approximately RMB 1.3 million 184,000) in the aggregate. Each of the Written Decisions shall be executed within 15 days upon
serving on SCHC. Additional interest penalty shall be imposed at a daily rate of 3 in the event that SCHC does not make the monetary
penalty payment in a timely manner. Subsequently, the Bureau filed enforcement actions to the People s Court of Shouguang City,
Shandong Province (the Court ), naming SCHC as enforcement respondent and alleged, among other things, that SCHC failed to
perform its obligations under each of the Written Decisions within the specified timeframe. The enforcement proceedings sought court orders
to enforce the Written Decisions. On May 5, 2019, written decisions of administrative ruling captioned (2019) Lu 0783 Xing Shen No. 384,
(2019) Lu 0783 Xing Shen No. 385, (2019) Lu 0783 Xing Shen No. 389, (2019) Lu 0783 Xing Shen No. 390, (2019) Lu 0783 Xing Shen No. 393,
and (2019) Lu 0783 Xing Shen No. 394, respectively (together, the Court Rulings were made by the Court in favor of the
Bureau. The Court orders, among other relief, to enforce each of the Written Decisions, to return each subject land to its legal owner
and demolish or confiscate the buildings and facilities thereon and restore the land to its original state within 10 days from the service
of the Court Rulings on SCHC. The Court Rulings became enforceable immediately upon service on SCHC on May 5, 2019. 

In the last twenty years, to the Company s
knowledge, there were no government regulations requiring bromine manufacturers to obtain land use and planning approval document. As
such, the Company believes most of the bromine manufacturers in Shouguang City do not have land use and planning approval documents and
lease their land parcels from the village associations. They are facing the same issues in connection with land use and planning as the
Company. 

The Company is in the process of resolving the issues in connection
with SCHC s land use and planning diligently. The Company has been in discussions regularly with the local government authorities
with the help from Shouguang City Bromine Association to seek reliefs and, based on verbal confirmation by local government authorities,
believes the administrative penalties imposed by the Bureau according to the Written Decisions are being re-assessed by local government
authorities and may be revoked. Pursuant to a Written Application dated October 28, 2019 addressed to the Court by the Bureau, the Bureau
withdrew its application for the enforcement proceedings regarding the administrative penalty imposed on Factory No. 7, Factory No. 8
and Factory No.10. Pursuant to a written decisions of administrative ruling captioned (2019) Lu 0783 Xing Shen No. 389 Zhi Yi, dated November
25, 2020, the Court orders to terminate the enforcement of the case captioned (2019) Lu 0783 Xing Shen No. 389. Production of Factory
No. 7 was allowed to resume in April 2019. The Company received a notification from the Shouguang City Government in February 2019 informing
the Company that Factory No. 1, No. 4, No. 7 and No. 9 have passed inspection and were approved to resume operation. 

In addition, on August 28, 2019, the People s
Government of Shandong Province, issued a regulation titled Investment Project Management Requirements of Chemical Companies in
Shandong Province permitting the construction of facilities on existing sites or infrastructure of bromine manufacturing and other
chemical industry-related types of projects (clause 11 of section 3). The Company believes that the goal of the government is to standardize
and regulate the industry and not to demolish the facilities or penalize the manufacturers. As of the date of this report, the Company
has not been notified by the local government that it will take any measure to enforce the administrative penalties. Based on information
known to date, the Company believes that it is remote that the Written Decisions or Court Rulings will be enforced within the expected
timeframe and a material penalty or costs and expenses against the Company will result. However, there can be no assurance that there
will not be any further enforcement action, the occurrence of which may result in further liabilities, penalties and operational disruption.

Item 1A. Risk Factors 

Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Before
you invest you should carefully review our Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
set forth in Item 2 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our consolidated financial statements and related notes included
in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our consolidated financial statements and related notes, as well as our
Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the other information in our Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. Readers should carefully review risks described in other documents we file from
time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

We are currently not in compliance with the Nasdaq continued
listing requirements. If we are unable to regain compliance with Nasdaq s listing requirements, our securities could be delisted,
which could affect our common stock s market price and liquidity and reduce our ability to raise capital. 

On November 5, 2024, the Company received a notice in the form of a
letter Price Deficiency Letter from Nasdaq stating that the Company was not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(a)(1)
because the bid price for the Company s common stock had closed below 1.00 per share for the previous 34 consecutive business days
(the Minimum Bid Price Requirement ). In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), the Company has been given 180
calendar days, or until May 5, 2025, to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. If at any time before May 5, 2025, the
bid price of the Company s common stock closes at 1.00 per share or more for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days, the Staff
will provide written confirmation that the Company has achieved compliance. In the event the Company does not regain compliance, the Company
may be eligible for additional time. To qualify for the additional compliance period, the Company will be required to (i) submit, no later
than the expiration date, an on-line Transfer Application, (ii) submit a non-refundable 5,000 application fee, (iii) meet the continued
listing requirement for the market value of its publicly held shares and all other continued listing standards for The Nasdaq Stock Market,
with the exception of the bid price requirement, and (iv) will need to provide written notice of its intention to cure the deficiency
during the second compliance period, by effecting a reverse stock split if necessary. As part of its review process, the Staff will make
a determination of whether they believe the Company will be able to cure this deficiency. Should the Staff conclude that the Company will
not be able to cure the deficiency, or should the Company determine not to submit a transfer application or make the required representation,
the Staff will provide notice that the Company s securities will be subject to delisting. 

The Nasdaq Price Deficiency Letter has no immediate impact on the listing
of the Company s common stock, which will continue to be listed and traded on The Nasdaq Global Select Market, subject to the Company s
compliance with the other continued listing requirements of The Nasdaq Stock Market. 

We cannot assure you that we will be able to regain compliance with
Nasdaq listing standards. Our failure to continue to meet these requirements would result in our common stock being delisted from Nasdaq,
and if our common stock is delisted, our warrants will also be delisted. We and holders of our securities could be materially adversely
impacted if our securities are delisted from Nasdaq. In particular: 

we may be unable to raise equity capital on acceptable terms or at all; 

we may lose the confidence of our customers, which would jeopardize our ability to continue our business as currently conducted; 

the price of our common stock will likely decrease as a result of the loss of market efficiencies associated with Nasdaq and the loss of federal preemption of state securities laws; 

holders may be unable to sell or purchase our securities when they wish to do so; 

we may become subject to stockholder litigation; 

we may lose the interest of institutional investors in our common stock; 

we may lose media and analyst coverage; 

our common stock could be considered a penny stock, which would likely limit the level of trading activity in the secondary market for our common stock; and 

we would likely lose any active trading market for our common stock, as it may only be traded on one of the over-the-counter markets, if at all. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sale of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 

None. 

Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities 

None. 

Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures 

Not applicable.

Item 5. Other Information 

During our fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024, of our directors

arrangement as those terms are defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K
