 Overview 
 Bowlero Corp. is one of the world s premier operators of location-based entertainment. The Company operates traditional bowling locations and more upscale entertainment concepts with lounge seating, arcades, enhanced food and beverage offerings, and more robust customer service for individuals and group events, as well as hosting and overseeing professional and non-professional bowling tournaments and related broadcasting. The Company also operates other forms of location-based entertainment, such as Octane Raceway and Raging Waves water park. 
 The Company remains focused on creating long-term shareholder value through continued organic growth, the conversion and upgrading of locations to more upscale entertainment concepts offering a broader range of offerings, the opening of new locations and acquisitions. 
 
 Recent Developments 
 Bowlero s results for the three months ended September 29, 2024 exhibited the expected total revenue growth and shift of focus to internal initiatives while also increasing liquidity in anticipation of what we believe will be an increased acquisition environment during the 2025 fiscal year to further diversify our location based entertainment offerings. To highlight the Company s recent activity during the three months ended September 29, 2024: 
 We reported total revenue growth of 14 , which was propelled by our successful Summer Pass promotion. 
 We rolled out our enhanced food and beverage menus across our traditional locations all the way up to our premier locations. 
 We increased our revolver commitment to 335,000 from 285,000. 
 We continued progress on new build-outs with four in prime markets expected to open during the second quarter. 
 
 Trends 
 There are a number of factors that could materially affect our future profitability, including changing economic conditions with the resulting impact on our sales, profitability, and capital spending, changes in our debt levels and applicable interest rates, and increasing prices of labor and inventory, which includes food and beverage costs. Additionally, sales and results of operations could be impacted by acquisitions and restructuring projects. Restructuring can include various projects, including closure of locations not performing well, cost reductions through staffing reductions, and optimizing and allocating resources to improve profitability. 
 Our operating results fluctuate seasonally. We typically generate our highest sales volumes during the third quarter of each fiscal year due to the timing of leagues, holidays and changing weather conditions. School operating schedules, holidays and weather conditions may also affect our sales volumes in some operating regions differently than others. Because of the seasonality of our business, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for our full fiscal year.

Revenues: For the quarter ended September 29, 2024, revenues totaled 260,195 and represented an increase of 32,790, or 14 , over the same period of last fiscal year. The increase in revenues is primarily attributable to revenue from newly acquired or leased locations and a slight increase in revenues on a same-store basis, which was slightly offset by a decrease in service fee revenue. 
 The following table summarizes our revenues on a same-store-basis for the quarter ended September 29, 2024 as compared to the corresponding period last fiscal year: 
 Three Months Ended (in thousands) September 29, 2024 October 1, 2023 Change Change Revenues on a same-store basis (1) 
 217,523 216,588 935 Revenues for media, new and closed locations 42,022 9,196 32,826 357 Service fee revenue (2) 
 650 1,621 (971) (60) Total revenues 260,195 227,405 32,790 14 
 (1) Revenues from 327 locations are included in the same-store comparable location base for the comparison in the above table. In our previously filed 10-Q for the three months ended October 1, 2023, revenues from 312 locations were included in the same-store revenue. 
 (2) Service fee revenue is a mandatory gratuity passed through to the employee, which is a non-contributor to earnings and is being phased out across our locations. 
 Same-store revenues includes revenue from locations that are open in periods presented (open in both the current period and the prior period being reported) and excludes revenues from locations that are not open in periods presented such as acquired new locations or locations closed for upgrades, renovations or other such reasons, as well as media revenues and service fee revenues. The slight increase in same-store revenues during the quarter ended September 29, 2024 was primarily attributable to the strong consumer response to our Summer Pass offering, which also contributed to increased Food beverage and Amusement other revenue. 
 Location operating costs: Location operating costs primarily consist of rent, utilities, insurance, repairs maintenance, property taxes, supplies, marketing, and other costs associated with Company locations. Location operating costs include both fixed and variable components and therefore do not directly correlate with revenue. 
 Location operating costs increased 12,855, or 18 . Increases in costs were in most areas and include supplies, repairs maintenance, rent, property taxes, and utilities. The increase in costs was mainly attributable to location count growth from acquisitions and lease agreements since late first quarter of fiscal 2024. For instance, the increase in rent primarily reflects the added operating leases from the Lucky Strike acquisition, which was a late first quarter of fiscal 2024 acquisition. Additionally, amusement costs increased as a result of a higher volume of redemption merchandise payouts as part of our effort to improve customer satisfaction. Location operating costs as a percent of revenues increased from 32 during the first quarter of fiscal 2024 to 33 during the first quarter of fiscal 2025, mainly due to the aforementioned costs increasing at a faster rate than revenues. 
 Location payroll and benefit costs: Location payroll and benefits costs consist of employee costs that directly support location operations. Location payroll and benefits costs increased 4,382, or 7 . The increase in location payroll and benefits reflects the additional staffing to support our added locations since late first quarter of fiscal 2024. Location payroll and benefits as a percent of revenues decreased from 28 during the first quarter of fiscal 2024 to 26 during the first quarter of fiscal 2025 due to efforts to optimize staffing levels at locations. 
 Location food beverage costs: Location food beverage costs increased 3,845, or 23 . The increase in location food beverage costs is mainly attributable to increased sales volume. Location food beverage costs as a percent of revenues increased from 7 during the first quarter of fiscal 2024 to 8 during the first quarter of fiscal 2025, due to the rollout of our new premium food and beverage options at our locations and an overall increase in food prices due to inflation. 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses SG A ): SG A expenses decreased 3,313 or 9 . The decrease is mainly attributable to a decrease in professional fees, which was partially offset by an increase in share-based compensation expense. The decrease in professional fees is mainly attributable to less acquisition activity as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2024. The increase in share-based compensation expense is mainly attributable to less forfeiture activity as compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2024 coupled with other stock-based awards granted during the first quarter of fiscal 2025. 
 Depreciation and amortization: Depreciation and amortization increased 5,631 or 18 . The increase in depreciation and amortization reflects the added depreciable assets, finite-lived intangible assets, and finance leases through acquisitions and capital expenditures since the first quarter of fiscal 2024. 
 25 

Table of Contents 
 Index to Notes 

Interest expense, net: Interest expense primarily relates to interest on debt, finance leases, and financing obligations. Interest expense increased 11,221, or 30 , to 48,670. The higher interest expense is primarily the result of an added financing obligation since the first quarter of fiscal 2024. 
 Change in fair value of earnouts: The impact on the statement of operations during the quarter ended September 29, 2024 is due to the decrease in the fair value of the earnouts, which mainly reflects the decrease in the Company s stock price in the current quarter. 
 Income Taxes: Income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management s assessment of the Company s tax position. The effective tax rate of 75 for the quarter ended September 29, 2024 was primarily attributed to the change in fair value of the earnout liability, permanent differences, and other discrete tax items. 
 
 Non-GAAP measure 
 Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that is not in accordance with, or an alternative to, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company believes certain financial measures which meet the definition of non-GAAP financial measures provide important supplemental information. The Company considers Adjusted EBITDA as an important financial measure because it provides a financial measure of the quality of the Company s earnings. Other companies may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, which might limit its usefulness as a comparative measure. Adjusted EBITDA is used by management in addition to and in conjunction with the results presented in accordance with GAAP. We have presented Adjusted EBITDA solely as a supplemental disclosure because we believe it allows for a more complete analysis of results of operations and assists investors and analysts in comparing our operating performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance, such as Interest Expense, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization, Impairment Charges, Share-based Compensation, EBITDA from Closed Locations, Foreign Currency Exchange Loss (Gain), Asset Disposition Loss (Gain), Transactional and other advisory costs, Changes in the value of earnouts, and Other. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. 
 Refer to notes below for additional details concerning the respective items for Adjusted EBITDA. 
 The following table provides a reconciliation from net income to Adjusted EBITDA for each reporting period: 
 Three Months Ended September 29, 2024 October 1, 2023 Net income 23,095 18,219 Adjustments: Interest expense 48,670 39,032 Income tax benefit (9,898) (9,683) Depreciation and amortization 37,437 32,000 Loss (gain) on impairment, disposals, and other charges, net 1,472 (1) Share-based compensation 4,503 1,911 Closed location EBITDA (1) 
 2,205 2,462 Transactional and other advisory costs (2) 
 3,259 8,398 Changes in the value of earnouts (3) 
 (48,921) (40,682) Other, net (4) 
 1,121 478 Adjusted EBITDA 62,943 52,134 
 Notes to Adjusted EBITDA: 
 (1) The closed location adjustment is to remove EBITDA for closed locations. Closed locations are those locations that are closed for a variety of reasons, including permanent closure, newly acquired or built locations prior to opening, locations closed for renovation or rebranding and conversion. If a location is not open on the last day of the reporting period, it will be considered closed for that reporting period. If the location is closed on the first day of the reporting period for permanent closure, the location will be considered closed for that reporting period. 
 (2) The adjustment for transaction costs and other advisory costs is to remove charges incurred in connection with any transaction, including mergers, acquisitions, refinancing, amendment or modification to indebtedness, dispositions and costs in connection with an initial public offering, in each case, regardless of whether consummated. 
 26

(3) The adjustment for changes in the value of earnouts is to remove of the impact of the revaluation of the earnouts. Changes in the fair value of the earnout liability is recognized in the statement of operations. Decreases in the liability will have a favorable impact on the statement of operations and increases in the liability will have an unfavorable impact. 
 (4) Other includes the following related to transactions that do not represent ongoing or frequently recurring activities as part of the Company s operations: (i) non-routine expenses, net of recoveries for matters outside the normal course of business, (ii) costs incurred that have been expensed associated with obtaining an equity method investment in a subsidiary of VICI, (iii) severance expense, and (iv) other individually de minimis expenses. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We manage our liquidity through assessing available cash-on-hand, our ability to generate cash and our ability to borrow or otherwise raise capital to fund operating, investing and financing activities. The Company remains in a positive financial position with available cash balances. 
 A core tenet of our long-term strategy is to grow the size and scale of the Company in order to improve our operating profit margins through leveraging our fixed costs. As such, one of the Company s known cash requirements is for capital expenditures related to the construction of new locations and upgrading and converting existing locations. We believe our financial position, generation of cash, available cash-on-hand, existing credit facility, and access to potentially obtain additional financing from sale-lease-back transactions or other sources will provide sufficient capital resources to fund our operational requirements, capital expenditures, and material short and long-term commitments for the foreseeable future. We also plan to use available cash-on-hand to fund our share repurchase program, which was implemented as a method to return value to our shareholders. However, there are a number of factors that may hinder our ability to access these capital resources, including but not limited to our degree of leverage, and potential borrowing restrictions imposed by our lenders. See Risk Factors included in our previously filed Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024 for further information. 
 At September 29, 2024, we had approximately 38,448 of available cash and cash equivalents. 
 Three Months Ended September 29, 2024 Compared To the Three Months Ended October 1, 2023 
 The following compares the primary categories of the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the period ended September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023: 
 Three Months Ended Change Change (in thousands) September 29, 2024 October 1, 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 29,413 16,083 13,330 83 Net cash used in investing activities (39,924) (176,576) 136,652 (77) Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities (17,806) 5,091 (22,897) (450) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash (207) (143) (64) 45 Net change in cash and cash equivalents (28,524) (155,545) 127,021 (82) 
 During three months ended September 29, 2024, net cash provided from operations totaled 29,413, as compared to 16,083 during the same period of the prior fiscal year. The increase in cash provided by operating activities primarily reflects higher revenues coupled with the timing of cash rent payments and lease incentive receipts partially offset by an increase in interest expense. 
 Investing activities utilized 39,924, reflecting our capital expenditures, as well as location conversions and related capital expenditures. The higher level of cash used in investing activities during the prior period mainly reflects the heightened acquisition activity. We expect to continue to invest in accretive acquisitions in future periods as well as location upgrades and conversions. 
 Financing activities utilized 17,806, reflecting cash spent for the repurchase of treasury stock through our share repurchase program, cash dividends paid to shareholders and payments on financing leases and debt. 
 Our contractual obligations primarily include, but are not limited to, debt service, self-insurance liabilities, and leasing arrangements. We believe our sources of liquidity, namely available cash on hand, positive operating cash flows, and access to capital markets will continue to be adequate to meet our contractual obligations, as well as fund working capital, planned capital expenditures, location acquisitions, and execute purchases under our share repurchase program.

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Our critical accounting estimates are discussed in Part II, Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of our fiscal year 2024 Form 10-K under Critical Accounting Estimates. There have been no significant changes in our critical accounting estimates during the quarter ended September 29, 2024. 
 Recently Issued Accounting Standards 
 See Note 1 - Description of Business and Significant Accounting Policies of the notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for information regarding new accounting pronouncements. 
 
 Emerging Growth Company Accounting Election 
 We are currently an emerging growth company, as defined in the JOBS Act. Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have elected to use this extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until the earlier of the date we (i) are no longer an emerging growth company or (ii) affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the extended transition period provided in the JOBS Act. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We are exposed to market risk from changes in, among other things, interest rates, credit risk, labor costs, health insurance claims and foreign currency exchange rates, which could impact its results of operations and financial condition. We attempt to address our exposure to these risks through our normal operating and financing activities. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Under our term and revolving credit facilities, we are exposed to a certain level of interest rate risk. Interest on the principal amount of our borrowings under our revolving credit facility loan accrues at the Adjusted Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate or the Alternate Base Rate, as further described in the credit agreement governing our term and revolving credit facilities. An increase or decrease of 1.0 in the effective interest rate would cause an increase or decrease to interest expense of approximately 11,385 over a twelve month period on our outstanding debt without considering the impact of hedging. The Company entered into two hedging transactions effective as of March 31, 2023 for an aggregate notional amount of our Term Loan of 800,000. The hedge transactions have a trade and hedge designation date of April 4, 2023. The hedge transactions, each for a notional amount of 400,000, provide for interest rate collars. The interest rate collars establish a floor on SOFR of 0.9429 and 0.9355 , respectively, and a cap on SOFR of 5.50 . The interest rate collars have a maturity date of March 31, 2026. 
 Credit Risk 
 Financial instruments that potentially subject us to significant concentrations of credit risk consist of cash and temporary investments. We are exposed to credit losses in the event of non-performance by counter parties to our financial instruments. We place cash and temporary investments with various high-quality financial institutions. Although we do not obtain collateral or other security to secure these obligations, we periodically monitor the third-party depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents. Our emphasis is primarily on safety and liquidity of principal and secondarily on maximizing yield on those funds. 
 Commodity Price Risk 
 We are exposed to market price fluctuation in food, beverage, supplies and other costs such as energy. Given the historical volatility of certain of our food product prices, including proteins, produce, dairy products, and cooking oil, these fluctuations can materially impact our food costs. While our purchasing commitments partially mitigate the risk of such fluctuations, there is no assurance that supply and demand factors such as disease or inclement weather will not cause the prices of the commodities used in our food operations to fluctuate. Additionally, the cost of purchased materials may be influenced by tariffs and other trade regulations which are outside of our control. To the extent that we do not pass along cost increases to our customers, our results of operations may be adversely affected. 
 Inflation 
 We experience inflation related to our purchase of certain products that we need to operate our business. This price volatility could potentially have a material impact on our financial condition and/or our results of operations. In order to 
 28 

Table of Contents 
 Index to Notes 

mitigate price volatility, we monitor price fluctuations and may adjust our prices accordingly, however, our ability to recover higher costs through increased pricing may be limited by the competitive environment in which we operate. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed pursuant to the Exchange Act is properly and timely reported and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of September 29, 2024. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting practices or processes that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting during our first quarter ended September 29, 2024.
