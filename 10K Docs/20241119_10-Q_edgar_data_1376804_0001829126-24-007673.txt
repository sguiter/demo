shares of TGRI common stock. As a result of the Merger, VNUE Washington became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and the transaction was accounted for as a reverse merger with VNUE Washington deemed the acquiring company for accounting purposes, and the Company deemed the legal acquirer. 

The Company is developing technology-driven solutions for Artists, Venues, and Festivals to automate the capturing, publishing, and monetization of their content, as well as protection of their rights. 

On February 13, 2022, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement with VNUE Acquisition Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company MergerCo ), Stage It Corp., a Delaware corporation Stage It ), and the stockholders representative for Stage It, pursuant to which the Company will acquire Stage It for up to 10 million (the Merger Consideration ), by merging MergerCo with and into Stage It, with Stage It continuing as the surviving entity and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the Merger ). 

On February 13, 2022, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement with VNUE Acquisition Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company MergerCo ), Stage It Corp., a Delaware corporation Stage It ), and the stockholders representative for Stage It, pursuant to which the Company contracted to acquire Stage It for up to 10 million (the Merger Consideration ), by merging MergerCo with and into Stage It, with Stage It continuing as the surviving entity and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the Merger ). At the same time, Stage It and several of the shareholders of Stage It entered into a voting agreement concerning the Merger. 

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, at the closing of the Merger (the Closing ), each of Stage It s outstanding shares (including common and preferred shares) were converted into the right to receive the applicable portion of the Merger Consideration. of the Merger Consideration was paid in cash and satisfaction of certain outstanding debt obligations of Stage It, as outlined in a Closing Payment Certificate of the Merger Agreement, and the other portion was paid in shares of the Company s common stock or preferred stock, with the actual number of such shares to be issued reduced by the cash component outlaid in the transaction. A portion of the Merger Consideration, 1 million, was held back for the purposes of satisfying certain contingent obligations of Stage It. 

The Merger Agreement provides for the issuance of earnout shares which the company estimates will not be achieved. 

On February 14, 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of Stage It. As a result of the Closing, Stage It became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. For the acquisition, the Company issued the initial shares and paid certain amounts to Stage It vendors. 

in cash on hand, had negative working capital of and had an accumulated deficit of . Additionally for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company used in cash from operating activities. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date of the condensed financial statements being issued. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company s ability to raise additional funds and implement its business plan. The Company does not have any commitments for additional capital. The condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. In addition, the Company s independent registered public accounting firm, in its report on the Company s December 31, 2023, condensed consolidated financial statements, has raised substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

The continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to obtain necessary debt or equity financing to continue operations until it begins generating positive cash flow. Historically, the Company has been able to fund its operations from the proceeds of notes payable and convertible notes. No assurance can be given that any future financing will be available or, if available, that it will be on terms that are satisfactory to the Company. Even if the Company can obtain additional financing, it may contain undue restrictions on our operations, in the case of debt financing, or cause substantial dilution for our stockholders, in the case of equity financing. 

The Company also recognizes revenue from the sale of CDs and USB drives that contain the recording of live concerts and are made available to concert attendees immediately after the show and online. Revenue is recognized on the sale of a product when our performance obligation is completed which is when the risk of loss transfers to our customers and the collection of the receivable is reasonably assured, which generally occurs when the product is purchased. 

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 deferred revenue amounted to and , respectively. As of September 30, 2024, deferred revenue was comprised of solely of in unredeemed notes at Stage It that have been purchased by customers but not used toward any events. When these notes will be redeemed, on average the performing artists will receive 77 , and the Company will record 23 of the value of these notes as revenue.

On February 14, 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of Stage It. As a result of the Closing, Stage It became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. For the acquisition, the Company issued the initial shares and paid certain amounts as detailed under the Merger Consideration in the Merger Agreement. The price to be paid in cash and stock for the Earnout Shares and Holdback Shares are set forth in the Merger Agreement. Stage It did not meet its EBITA targets to issue Earn Out shares.

Answer with Affirmative Defenses. Shortly thereafter, the parties began to engage in the discovery process. 

The Company remains committed to vigorously pursuing its claims for
monetary damages and/or equitable relief.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

In connection with the preparation of this annual report, an evaluation was carried out by our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal accounting officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15c and 15d-15c under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act )) as of December 31, 2023. Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 

Based on that evaluation, and the material weaknesses outlined below under Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, our principal executive officer and principal accounting officer concluded, as of September 30, 2024, due to weaknesses in our internal controls described below, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective in recording, processing, summarizing and reporting information required to be disclosed, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information may not be accumulated and communicated to our principal executive officer and principal accounting officer to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 

Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. Under the supervision of our principal executive officer and principal accounting officer, the Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024 using the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 

A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, the Company determined that there were deficiencies that constituted material weaknesses, as described below. 

1. 
 Lack of proper segregation of duties due to limited personnel. 

2. 
 Lack of a formal review process that includes multiple levels of review. 

3. 
 Lack of adequate policies and procedures for accounting for financial transactions. 

4. 
 Lack of independent board member(s). 

5. 
 Lack of independent audit committee. 

Management is currently evaluating remediation plans for the above material weaknesses. 

16 

In light of the existence of these material weaknesses, management concluded that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the company s internal controls. As a result, management has concluded that the Company did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by COSO. 

Changes in Internal Control 

During the three months ended September 30, 2024, there were no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Forward-Looking Statements 

The statements in this quarterly report that are not reported financial results or other historical information are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 , as amended. These statements appear in a number of different places in this report and can be identified by words such as estimates , projects , expects , intends , believes , plans , or their negatives or other comparable words. Also, look for discussions of strategy that involve risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements include, among others, statements regarding our business plans and availability of financing for our business. Some forward-looking statements that we may use include, without limitation, those statements that relate to: 

Competition and market acceptance of our product, 

Other risks and uncertainties related to the music industry and our business strategy and the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on our operations, 

Our ability to penetrate the market and continually innovate useful technologies, 

Our ability to negotiate and enter into license agreements, 

Our ability to raise capital, and 

Our ability to protect our intellectual property rights. 

You are cautioned that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees and may involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements due to risks facing us or due to facts differing from the assumptions underlying our estimates. Some of these risks and assumptions include those set forth in reports and other documents we have filed with or furnished to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ). We advise you that these cautionary remarks expressly qualify in their entirety all forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf. Unless required by law, we do not assume any obligation to update forward-looking statements based on unanticipated events or changed expectations. However, you should carefully review the reports and other documents we file from time to time with the SEC. 

Presentation of Information 

As used in this quarterly report, the terms we , us , our and the Company mean VNUE, Inc. and its subsidiaries unless the context requires otherwise. 

All dollar amounts in this annual report refer to US dollars unless otherwise indicated. 

Overview 

We were incorporated as a Nevada corporation on April 4, 2006. We are a music technology company that utilizes our platforms to record live concerts and then sell the content to consumers. We make the content we record available to the set.fm platform, as well as our website, immediately after the show is finished. Our technology helps artists and record labels generate alternative income from the recorded content. We also offer high-end collectible products such as CDs, USB drives and laminates, which feature our fully mixed and mastered live concert content. 

18 

Until the acquisition of Stage It, described below, we had two products: 

Set.fm / DiscLive Network - Our consumer app platform allows customers to download and purchase, via their individual mobile device, the concert they just attended. There are also physical collectible products that are recorded and sold at shows as well as online through the Company s exclusive partner DiscLive Network . The app itself is free to download and allows for in-app purchases regarding the content. (Currently, this is the only platform that generates any revenue for the Company.) 

Soundstr - a comprehensive music identification and rights management Cloud platform that we are developing, when fully deployed, can accurately track and audit public performances of music, creating a more transparent ecosystem for general music licensing and associated royalty payments, which will help ensure the correct stakeholders are compensated through the use of our big data collection. 

While Set.fm and Soundstr are proprietary marks of the Company, DiscLive, and its related marks and names are not owned by the Company and are owned and utilized by RockHouse Live Media Productions, Inc. The Company has not filed any formal trademark applications relating to Set.fm with the United States US Patent and Trademark Office but has been using these marks openly since 2017 and claims common law rights to them. 

The Company currently only generates revenue from Set.fm and from DiscLive by (a) recording the audio of live concerts and then selling the content instantly through its set.fm website, as well as the IOS Set.fm mobile application, and (b) selling content on physical products such as CDs, which are burned on-site where customers can purchase them. Our customers are fans of live music and the bands which we record. 

Customers want to take home their experience of the concerts they attend. Our Company enters into agreements with certain bands and artists and record labels if a particular artist is under contract with the label. Our teams then follow that artist or band while they are on tour and record every show on that tour. Our Company uses its own recording and sound equipment while recording concerts. 

As we partner with both artists and labels, we market our services on their websites, social media platforms, and mailing lists, as well as our own websites and social networks. Furthermore, partnerships with companies similar to Ticketmaster allow us to market to customers when they buy tickets to see certain artists in concert. 

On February 13, 2022, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement with VNUE Acquisition Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company MergerCo ), Stage It Corp., a Delaware corporation Stage It ), and the stockholders representative for Stage It, pursuant to which the Company agreed to acquire Stage It for 10 million (the Merger Consideration ), by merging MergerCo with and into Stage It, with Stage It continuing as the surviving entity and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (the Merger ). 

On February 14, 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of Stage It. As a result of the Closing, Stage It became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. 

With the addition of Stage It (Stage It.com), VNUE will have the ability to livestream concerts and other events, adding to the pool of other live music-focused technology services. Stage It is an established platform where concerts or other live events may be ticketed (just like an in-person event), and fans who pay for tickets may enjoy a performance or other engagement by watching digital video as it occurs on their web browser. For example, an artist can create an event through the platform, then, in advance, let their fans know they can purchase the ability to view the concerts on the Stage It platform. Fans then buy the ability to access these concerts, and at the designated time, the fan may then observe the live performance on Stage It.com.

Recent Developments 

Last year, we announced that the Company is launching an aggressive campaign to deploy its Soundstr Music Recognition Technology in every bar, restaurant and hotel in Key West, FL, and brought on local resources to have boots on the ground for the rollout. The effort is continuing, yet at a slower pace due to lack of meaningful funding. 

Key West is one of the most sought-after vacation spots in the world, attracting around five million tourists per year by planes, boats (including cruise ships), and automobiles. It also boasts a large number of businesses that utilize music. In fact, the famed Duval Street is lined with no less than 143 bars in less than two miles. 

Interested businesses may receive the Soundstr Pulse devices for no cost whatsoever. Additionally, in the next several months, VNUE will be offering both playlist functionality meaning clients will be able to play fully-licensed music directly from Soundstr as well as the ability to opt-in for advertising, which will help to offset licensing costs that businesses pay. One of the strongest points about Soundstr Pulse is that it does have high-quality audio output capabilities (for use with advertising and for playlists), as well as Bluetooth beacon technology that will be leveraged for non-invasive advertising. 

The Company has also installed Soundstr devices in Jackson, TN; Los Angeles, CA; Memphis, TN; Southaven, MS; Olive Branch, MS; Clearwater, FL; and Tampa, FL. 

The Company has also signed a MOU with Eyeora, an innovative XR metaverse company. The Company sees a benefit in working with Eyeora as it relates to extending the Stage It experience and introducing additional revenue streams to the company. Eyeora is fully developed and commercialized. Users don 3D goggles to enter this metaverse world and can experience musical artists in 3D and as avatars. 

Also recently, the Company announced the addition of veteran record company executive Jody Best to its extended team, providing record promotion services for VNUE s Artist Services Division. VNUE has been working to build out a full suite of services for interested artists, leveraging VNUE staff s record label, digital, marketing, and promotional experience 

Results of Operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023 

The following discussion and analysis of our results of operations and financial condition for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this report. The following discussion and analysis of our results of operations and financial condition for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this Report. 

Revenues 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had revenue of 57,670 compared to 196,522 in revenue for the same period ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 138,853. The decrease in revenue for the period is primarily attributable to decreased revenues at our Stage It subsidiary and by a reduction in revenue at VNUE because Matchbox Twenty was not on tour during this period. We expect that our revenues will increase in future quarters as a result of the decreased impact of Covid-19 and the accompanying lockdowns on businesses, which has been an obstacle for live performances; however, there can be no assurances. 

20 

Direct Costs of Revenues 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had direct costs of revenue of 26,670 compared to 143,500 for the same period ended September 30, 2023. 

Operating Expenses 

We incurred operating expenses of 1,321,752 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared with 330,132 for the same three month period ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 1,021,621. The increase in operating expenses in the 2024 period compared to 2023 is attributable to a net litigation judgement expense of 1,306,775 (see Note 12) offset by decreases in professional fees and payroll expenses. 

Other Expense 

We recorded other expenses of 23,798 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to other expenses of 58,335 for the same period ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is attributable to lower levels of debt resulting in lower interest expense 

Net Income (Loss) 

As a result of the foregoing, we recorded a net loss available to common shareholders of 1,384,506 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with a net loss available to common shareholders of 375,480 for the same period ended September 30, 2023. 

Results of Operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023 

Revenues 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had revenue of 251,796 compared to 428,552 in revenue for the same period ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 176,756. The decrease in revenue for the period is primarily attributable to a reduction in revenue at VNUE. We expect that our revenues will increase in future quarters as a result of the decreased impact of Covid-19 and the accompanying lockdowns on businesses, which has been an obstacle for live performances; however, there can be no assurances. 

Direct Costs of Revenues 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had direct costs of revenue of 122,836 compared to 292,859 for the same period ended September 30, 2023. 

Operating Expenses 

We incurred operating expenses of 1,802,158 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared with 1,060,773 for the same period ended September 30, 2023. The increase in operating expenses in the 2024 period compared to 2023 is attributable to a net litigation judgement expense of 1,306,775 (see Note 12) offset by decreases in professional fees and payroll expenses. 

21 

Other Expense 

We recorded other expenses of 105,715 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to other expenses of 198,948 for the same period ended September 30, 2023 a decrease of 93,233. The decrease in other expenses in the 2024 period compared to 2023 is solely attributable to lower levels of draws on the Company s equity line in 2024 compared to 2023. 

Net Income (Loss) 

As a result of the foregoing, we recorded a net loss available to common shareholders of 1,778,912 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with a net loss available to common shareholders of 1,124,028 for the same period ended September 30, 2023. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Since our inception, we have funded our operations primarily through private offerings of our equity securities and loans. 

The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. As reflected in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company used cash in operations of 269,641 and, as of September 30, 2024, had an accumulated deficit of 40,222,569 and negative working capital of 7,677,294. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements being issued. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company s ability to raise additional funds and implement its business plan. The condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. 

On September 30, 2024, the Company had cash on hand of 3,416 as compared with cash on hand of 25,430 as of December 31, 2023. 

The continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to obtain necessary debt or equity financing to continue operations until it begins generating positive cash flow. Historically, the Company has been able to fund its operations from the proceeds of notes payable and convertible notes. 

More recently, the Company has been relying on issuances of its preferred stock and its equity line of credit with GHS Investments, LLC GHS ), described below, to fund its operations. All other financial commitments have been terminated, and we are looking for new opportunities to fund the Company to supplement our preferred stock and credit line funding. No assurance can be given that any future financing will be available or, if available, that it will be on terms that are satisfactory to the Company. Even if the Company can obtain additional financing, it may contain undue restrictions on our operations, in the case of debt financing, or cause substantial dilution for our stockholders, in the case of equity financing. 

22 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company utilized its equity line of credit and received 103,626 in gross proceeds from the issuance of 169,614,949 shares of common stock. As a result of the Borger Settlement described in Note 13 Subsequent Events the Company can longer use its equity line of credit until it has its condensed financial statements re-audited for the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. The re-audits have been mandated by the SEC in its published guidance on all public companies impacted by the Borgers Settlement. 

The Company currently does not have the funding to engage its new auditors to undertake the re-audits described above, and is currently looking for other sources of financing to fund its operation. No assurance can be given that any future financing will be available or, if available, that it will be on terms that are satisfactory to the Company. Failure to obtain new sources of financing will have a material adverse impact on the Company. Even if the Company can obtain additional financing, it may contain undue restrictions on our operations, in the case of debt financing, or cause substantial dilution for our stockholders, in the case of equity financing. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our condensed consolidated financial statements, which were prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 

While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this prospectus, we believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to our financial results and to the understanding of our past and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management s estimates and assumptions. We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if: (1) it requires us to make assumptions because the information was not available at the time or it included matters that were highly uncertain at the time we were making our estimate; and (2) changes in the estimate could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. (See Note 1 - Significant and Critical Accounting Policies and Practices in the Company s Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on April 17, 2023.) 

Use of Estimates and Assumptions and Critical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Critical accounting estimates are estimates for which (a) the nature of the estimate is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change and (b) the impact of the estimate on financial condition or operating performance is material. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable in relation to the financial statements taken as a whole under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Management regularly evaluates the key factors and assumptions used to develop the estimates utilizing currently available information, changes in facts and circumstances, historical experience, and reasonable assumptions. After such evaluations, if deemed appropriate, those estimates are adjusted accordingly. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates include the assumptions used to determine the value of the derivative liabilities, the valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset, and the accruals for potential liabilities. 

23 

Derivative Financial Instruments 

The Company evaluates its financial instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives. For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value and is then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is evaluated at the end of each reporting period. Derivative instrument liabilities are classified in the balance sheet as current or non-current based on whether or not the net-cash settlement of the derivative instrument could be required within 12 months of the balance sheet date. 

Stock-Based Compensation 

The Company periodically issues stock options and warrants to employees and non-employees in non-capital raising transactions for services and financing costs. The Company accounts for stock option and warrant grants issued and vesting to employees based on the authoritative guidance provided by FASB, where the value of the award is measured on the date of grant and recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. The Company accounts for stock option and warrant grants issued and vesting to non-employees in accordance with the authoritative guidance of the FASB, where the value of the stock compensation is based upon the measurement date as determined at either a) the date at which a performance commitment is reached, or b) at the date at which the necessary performance to earn the equity instruments is complete. Options granted to non-employees are revalued each reporting period to determine the amount to be recorded as an expense in the respective period. As the options vest, they are valued on each vesting date and an adjustment is recorded for the difference between the value already recorded and the then-current value on the date of vesting. In certain circumstances where there are no future performance requirements by the non-employee, option grants are immediately vested and the total stock-based compensation charge is recorded in the period of the measurement date. 

The fair value of the Company s stock option and warrant grants are estimated using the Black-Scholes-Merton Option Pricing model, which uses certain assumptions related to risk-free interest rates, expected volatility, expected life of the stock options or warrants, and future dividends. Compensation expense is recorded based upon the value derived from the Black-Scholes-Merton Option Pricing model, and based on actual experience. The assumptions used in the Black-Scholes-Merton Option Pricing model could materially affect compensation expense recorded in future periods.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

In connection with the preparation of this quarterly report, an evaluation was carried out by our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal accounting officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act )) as of September 30, 2024. Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 

Based on that evaluation, and the material weaknesses outlined below under Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, our principal executive officer and principal accounting officer concluded, as of the end of the period covered by this annual report, that, due to weaknesses in our internal controls described below, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective in recording, processing, summarizing and reporting information required to be disclosed, within the periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information may not be accumulated and communicated to our principal executive officer and principal accounting officer to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 

b) Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim condensed consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, the Company determined that there were deficiencies that constituted material weaknesses, as described below. 

1. 
 Lack of proper segregation of duties due to limited personnel. 

2. 
 Lack of a formal review process that includes multiple levels of review. 

3. 
 Lack of adequate policies and procedures for accounting for financial transactions. 

4. 
 Lack of independent board member(s) 

5. 
 Lack of independent audit committee 

Management is currently evaluating remediation plans for the above control deficiencies. 

Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting 

During the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls 

Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Due to the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected.
