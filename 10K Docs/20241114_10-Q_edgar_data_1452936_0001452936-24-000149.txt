 . Each reporting period management evaluates the Company s ability to continue as a going concern by evaluating conditions and events, including assessing the liquidity needs to satisfy upcoming debt obligations and the ability to satisfy debt covenant requirements. Through the normal course of operations, and as further discussed in Note 4, the Company has million of debt obligations coming due within one year following the report issuance date. In order to satisfy obligations as they mature, management will evaluate its options and may seek to utilize extension options (if available) in the respective loan agreements, may make partial loan repayments to meet debt covenant requirements, may seek to refinance certain debt instruments, may sell real estate equity securities to convert to cash to make principal payments, may market one or more properties for sale or may negotiate a turnover of one or more secured properties back to the related mortgage lender and remit payment for any associated loan guarantee. Historically, the Company has successfully refinanced debt instruments or utilized extension options in order to satisfy debt obligations as they come due and has not negotiated a turnover of a secured property back to a lender, though the Company may utilize such option if necessary. Based upon these plans, and the plans described above, management believes it will have sufficient liquidity to satisfy its obligations as they come due and to continue as a going concern. There can be no assurance as to the certainty or timing of any of management s plans. 
 Use of Estimates 
 Segments 
 reportable business segments: strategic opportunistic real estate and real estate-related investments strategic opportunistic properties ), residential homes, and hotel, which is how the Company s management manages the business. In general, the Company intends to hold its investments in strategic opportunistic properties for capital appreciation. Traditional performance metrics of strategic opportunistic properties may not be meaningful as these investments are generally non-stabilized and do not provide a consistent stream of interest income or rental revenue. These investments exhibit similar long-term financial performance and have similar economic characteristics. These investments typically involve a higher degree of risk and do not provide a constant stream of ongoing cash flows. As a result, the Company s management views strategic opportunistic properties as similar investments and aggregates them into reportable business segment. The Company owns residential homes in markets which are all aggregated into reportable business segment due to the homes being stabilized, having high occupancy rates and having similar economic characteristics. Additionally, as of September 30, 2024, the Company owns hotel, which is a separate reportable business segment due to the nature of the hotel business with short-term stays. 
 Real Estate Equity Securities

Some of the leases have provisions to extend the lease agreements, options for early termination after paying a specified penalty and other terms and conditions as negotiated.

 Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

 The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements of Pacific Oak Strategic Opportunity REIT, Inc. and the notes thereto. As used herein, the terms we, our and us refer to Pacific Oak Strategic Opportunity REIT, Inc., a Maryland corporation, and, as required by context, Pacific Oak Strategic Opportunity Limited Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership, which we refer to as the Operating Partnership, and to their subsidiaries. 
 
 Forward-Looking Statements 
 Certain statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are forward-looking statements. Those statements include statements regarding the intent, belief or current expectations of Pacific Oak Strategic Opportunity REIT, Inc. and members of our management team, as well as the assumptions on which such statements are based, and generally are identified by the use of words such as may, will, seeks, anticipates, believes, estimates, expects, plans, intends, should or similar expressions. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements. Further, forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise forward-looking statements to reflect changed assumptions, the occurrence of unanticipated events or changes to future operating results over time, unless required by law. 
 The following are some of the risks and uncertainties, although not all of the risks and uncertainties, which could cause our actual results to differ materially from those presented in our forward-looking statements: 
 We depend on our advisor, Pacific Oak Capital Advisors, LLC and its affiliates, to conduct our operations and eventually dispose of our investments. 
 We depend on tenants for our revenue and, accordingly, our revenue is dependent upon the success and economic viability of our tenants. Revenues from our property investments could decrease due to a reduction in tenants (caused by factors including, but not limited to, tenant defaults, tenant insolvency, early termination of tenant leases and non-renewal of existing tenant leases) and/or lower rental rates, limiting our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders. 
 We depend on the availability of and costs associated with sources of real estate liquidity. 
 Our opportunistic investment strategy involves a higher risk of loss than would a strategy of investing in some other types of real estate and real estate-related investments. 
 Inflation and increased interest rates may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations, including with respect to our ability to refinance maturing debt. 
 We have paid distributions from financings and in the future, we may not pay distributions solely from our cash flow from operations or gains from asset sales. To the extent that we pay distributions from sources other than our cash flow from operations or gains from asset sales, we will have less funds available for investment in loans, properties and other assets, the overall return to our stockholders may be reduced and subsequent investors may experience dilution. 
 All of our executive officers and some of our directors and other key real estate and debt finance professionals are also officers, directors, managers, key professionals and/or holders of a direct or indirect controlling interest in our advisor, our dealer manager and other Pacific Oak-affiliated entities. As a result, they face conflicts of interest, including significant conflicts created by our former or current advisor s compensation arrangements with us and other Pacific Oak-advised programs and investors and conflicts in allocating time among us and these other programs and investors. These conflicts could result in unanticipated actions. Fees paid to our advisor in connection with transactions involving the origination, acquisition and management of our investments are based on the cost of the investment, not on the quality of the investment or services rendered to us. This arrangement could influence our advisor to recommend riskier transactions to us. 
 We pay substantial fees to and expenses of our advisor, Pacific Oak Capital Advisors, LLC and its affiliates. These payments increase the risk that our stockholders will not earn a profit on their investment in us and increase our stockholders risk of loss. 
 We have focused, and may continue to focus, our investments in non-performing: real estate, real estate-related loans, investments in joint ventures, and real estate-related securities, which involve more risk than investments in performing real estate and real estate-related assets.

 Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

 All forward-looking statements should be read in light of the risks identified in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ). 
 
 Overview 
 We were formed on October 8, 2008 as a Maryland corporation, elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust REIT beginning with the taxable year ended December 31, 2010 and intend to operate in such manner. Pacific Oak Capital Advisors, LLC Pacific Oak Capital Advisors is our advisor and as our advisor, Pacific Oak Capital Advisors manages our day-to-day operations and our portfolio of investments. Our advisor also has the authority to make all of the decisions regarding our investments, except for our residential homes portfolio. Our residential homes portfolio, held through our subsidiary Pacific Oak Residential Trust, Inc. PORT ), is managed by Pacific Oak Residential Advisors, LLC PORA ), an affiliate of our advisor. The advisory duties are subject to the limitations in our charter and the direction and oversight of our board of directors. Our advisor also provides asset-management, marketing, investor-relations and other administrative services on our behalf. We have sought to invest in and manage a diverse portfolio of real estate-related loans, opportunistic real estate, real estate-related debt securities, real estate equity securities and other real estate-related investments. We conduct our business primarily through our Operating Partnership, of which we are the sole general partner. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we consolidated nine office complexes, encompassing, in the aggregate, approximately 3.2 million rentable square feet, one residential home portfolio consisting of 2,145 residential homes, one apartment property containing 317 units, one hotel property with 196 rooms, four investments in undeveloped land with approximately 581 developable acres, one office/retail development property and held an interest in three investments in unconsolidated entities. 
 
 Market Outlook Real Estate and Real Estate Finance Markets 
 Volatility in global financial markets and changing political environments can cause fluctuations in the performance of the U.S. commercial real estate markets. Possible future declines in rental rates, slower or potentially negative net absorption of leased space and expectations of future rental concessions, including free rent to renew tenants early, to retain tenants who are up for renewal or to attract new tenants, may result in decreases in cash flows from investment properties. To the extent there are increases in the cost of financing due to higher interest rates, this may cause difficulty in refinancing debt obligations at terms as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness. Further, increases in interest rates would increase the amount of our debt payments on our variable rate debt to the extent the interest rates on such debt are not limited by interest rate caps. Market conditions can change quickly, potentially negatively impacting the value of real estate investments. Management continuously reviews our investment and debt financing strategies to optimize our portfolio and the cost of our debt exposure. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our principal demand for funds during the short and long-term is and will be for payments under debt and funding obligations, including principal repayments, the acquisition of real estate and real estate-related investments, payment of operating expenses, capital expenditures and general and administrative expenses, redemptions and purchases of our common stock (to the extent we resume our share redemption program, which we suspended on July 30, 2024) and payments of distributions to stockholders. To date, we have had five primary sources of capital for meeting our cash requirements: 
 Proceeds from the primary portion of our initial public offering; 
 Proceeds from our dividend reinvestment plan; 
 Debt financing, including bond offerings in Israel; 
 Proceeds from the sale of real estate and real estate-related investments; and 
 Cash flow generated by our real estate and real estate-related investments. 
 Our investments in real estate generate cash flow in the form of rental revenues and tenant reimbursements, which are reduced by operating expenditures and corporate general and administrative expenses. Cash flow from operations from our real estate investments is primarily dependent upon the occupancy levels of our properties, the net effective rental rates on our leases, the collectability of rent and operating recoveries from our tenants and how well we manage our expenditures. As of September 30, 2024, our office complexes were collectively 66 occupied, our residential home portfolio was 94 occupied and our apartment property was 95 occupied. 
 Investments in real estate equity securities may generate cash flow in the form of dividend income. As of September 30, 2024, we had one investment in real estate equity securities outstanding with a total carrying value of 17.3 million.

 Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

 Under our charter, we are required to limit our total operating expenses to the greater of 2 of our average invested assets or 25 of our net income for the four most recently completed fiscal quarters, as these terms are defined in our charter, unless the conflicts committee has determined that such excess expenses were justified based on unusual and non-recurring factors. Operating expenses for the four fiscal quarters ended September 30, 2024 did not exceed the charter-imposed limitation. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our cash needs for capital expenditures, redemptions of common stock funding commitment, and debt requirements were met with proceeds from dispositions of real estate, proceeds from debt financing and cash on hand, except where otherwise noted. Operating cash needs during the same period were met through cash flow generated by our real estate and real estate-related investments and cash on hand. As of September 30, 2024, we had outstanding debt obligations in the aggregate principal amount of 943.2 million, with a weighted-average remaining term of 1.9 years. As of September 30, 2024, we had 219.3 million of debt obligations scheduled to mature over the period from October 1, 2024 through September 30, 2025. Of these debt obligations 106.8 million have extension options if we comply with certain debt covenants that may include one or a combination of the following ratios: debt-to-value, debt yield, minimum equity requirements and debt service coverage. In order to satisfy obligations as they mature, we plan to utilize extension options available in the respective loan agreements, may seek to refinance certain debt instruments, may market one or more properties for sale or may negotiate a turnover of one or more secured properties back to the related mortgage lender. We have also agreed to fund expenditures and improvements to the 110 William Joint Venture of 105.0 million (the Capital Commitments ). As of September 30, 2024, the outstanding amount to be paid under the Capital Commitments is approximately 13.3 million. Subsequent to September 30, 2024, the remaining commitment amount was funded. Based upon these plans, we believe we will have sufficient liquidity to continue as a going concern. There can be no assurance as to the certainty or timing of any of our plans. 
 We plan to meet these obligations primarily through a combination of one or more of cash on hand, asset sales, extension options (if available), refinancings (whether with the same lender or different lenders) and issuing additional debt. We believe that with these options we have sufficient cash on hand and availability to address our debt maturities and capital needs scheduled to mature over the period October 1, 2024 through September 30, 2025. However, tighter financial conditions, higher interest rates and lower asset values may make it more difficult to refinance our loans or to sell assets on favorable terms. In recent years, we have accessed debt capital through the Israeli capital markets, but that source of debt capital may be limited in the future because of changing conditions such as the ongoing conflicts in Israel. Our mortgage loans are primarily non-recourse to us, meaning the lender s recourse is to take possession of the underlying property. It is possible we may choose not to repay or refinance some of the maturing loans, which would ultimately result in losing possession of the underlying property. 
 Guarantee Agreements 
 As of September 30, 2024, and as part of the previous 110 William Joint Venture debt and restructuring agreements, we guaranteed the completion of the construction and the development of the building expenditures and tenant improvements. We also guaranteed all debt servicing costs and timely debt payments by the 110 William Joint Venture. 
 The guaranteed amounts are due upon occurrence of a triggering event, such as default for nonpayment or failure to perform based on the conditions defined in the agreement. The maximum potential amount of future payments under the guarantees is not currently estimable as it is dependent on various factors including the 110 William Joint Venture s future operating performance level, potential completion cost overages, future levels of variable rate debt and related interest, and the amount of future contributions by us. Due to uncertainties surrounding these factors, we were unable to estimate the maximum amounts payable under the guarantees. As of September 30, 2024, no triggering events had occurred, the likelihood of loss was determined to be remote, and no liability related to the guarantee was recognized.

 Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
 As of September 30, 2024, we consolidated nine office complexes, encompassing, in the aggregate, approximately 3.2 million rentable square feet and these properties were 66 occupied. In addition, we owned one residential home portfolio consisting of 2,145 residential homes, and one apartment property containing 317 units, which were 94 and 95 occupied, respectively. We also owned one hotel property with 196 rooms, four investments in undeveloped land with approximately 581 developable acres, and one office/retail development property, and held an interest in three investments in unconsolidated entities and one investment in real estate equity securities. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in operating activities was 20.7 million. We expect that our cash flows from operating activities will increase in future periods as a result of leasing additional space that is currently unoccupied and anticipated future acquisitions of real estate and real estate-related investments. However, our cash flows from operating activities may decrease to the extent that we dispose of additional assets. 
 In addition to making investments in accordance with our investment objectives, we use or have used our capital resources to make certain payments to our advisor and our dealer manager. During our offering stage, these payments included payments to our dealer manager for selling commissions and dealer manager fees related to sales in our primary offering and payments to our dealer manager and our advisor for reimbursement of certain organization and other offering expenses related both to the primary offering and the dividend reinvestment plan. During our acquisition and development stage, we have continued to make payments to our advisor in connection with the selection and origination or purchase of investments, the management of our assets and costs incurred by our advisor in providing services to us as well as for any dispositions of assets (including the discounted payoff of non-performing loans). 
 The advisory agreement with our advisor has a one-year term but may be renewed for an unlimited number of successive one-year periods upon the mutual consent of our advisor and our conflicts committee. 
 Among the fees payable to our advisor is an asset management fee. With respect to investments other than real property, the asset management fee is a monthly fee calculated, each month, as one-twelfth of 1.0 , of the lesser of (i) the amount actually paid or allocated to acquire or fund the loan or other investment, inclusive of fees and expenses related thereto and the amount of any debt associated with or used to acquire or fund such investment and (ii) the outstanding principal amount of such loan or other investment, plus the fees and expenses related to the acquisition or funding of such investment, as of the time of calculation. With respect to investments in real property, the asset management fee is a monthly fee equal to one-twelfth of 1.0 , of the sum of the amount paid or allocated to acquire the investment, plus the cost of any subsequent development, construction or improvements to the property, and inclusive of fees and expenses related thereto and the amount of any debt associated with or used to acquire such investment. In the case of investments made through joint ventures, the asset management fee will be determined based on our proportionate share of the underlying investment, inclusive of our proportionate share of any fees and expenses related thereto. 
 Investments made in or through PORT are excluded from the calculation of the asset management fee we pay to our advisor. In addition to other fees described in the advisory agreement between PORT and PORA, PORT pays PORA a quarterly asset management fee equal to 0.25 (1.0 annually) on the aggregate value of PORT s assets, as determined in accordance with PORT s valuation guidelines, as of the end of each quarter. 
 Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
 Net cash provided by investing activities was 13.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and consisted primarily of the following: 
 Proceeds from sales of real estate of 87.4 million; 
 Contributions to unconsolidated entities of 63.4 million; 
 Improvements to real estate of 22.0 million; 
 Proceeds from the sale of real estate equity securities of 16.4 million; and 
 Payments on development obligations of 7.3 million. 
 Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 104.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and consisted primarily of the following: 
 23 

Table of Contents 
 PART I. FINANCIAL INFORMATION (CONTINUED) 
 Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

 Principal payments on notes and bonds payable of 273.2 million, primarily related to the Series B bonds payments of approximately 190.3 million and payoff of the Lofts at NoHo Commons Mortgage Loan of approximately 68.5 million; and 
 Proceeds from notes and bonds payable of 179.8 million, primarily related to proceeds received from the Series D bonds of approximately 156.8 million and the Eight Nine Corporate Centre Mortgage Loan of approximately 20.0 million. 
 In order to execute our investment strategy, we utilize secured debt, and we may, to the extent available, utilize unsecured debt, to finance a portion of our investment portfolio. Management remains vigilant in monitoring the risks inherent with the use of debt in our portfolio and is taking actions to ensure that these risks, including refinancing and interest risks, are properly balanced with the benefit of using leverage. There is no limitation on the amount we may borrow for any single investment. Our charter does not limit us from incurring debt until our aggregate borrowings would exceed 300 of our net assets, which approximates aggregate liabilities of 75 of the cost of our tangible assets (before deducting depreciation or other non-cash reserves); however, we may exceed that limit if a majority of the conflicts committee approves each borrowing in excess of our charter limitation and we disclose such borrowing to our common stockholders in our next quarterly report with an explanation from the conflicts committee of the justification for the excess borrowing. As of September 30, 2024, our borrowings and other liabilities were within the limits stated in our charter. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had bonds outstanding of 1.4 billion Israeli new shekels (approximately 378.5 million as of September 30, 2024) Series Bonds ), of which 360.0 million Israeli new shekels (approximately 96.6 million as of September 30, 2024) were collateralized by real estate (specified lands in Park Highlands and Richardson). The Series Bonds principal payments ranging from January 2025 to February 2029 with interest rates ranging from 3.93 to 9.50 . On August 20, 2024, Pacific Oak SOR BVI issued 299.0 million Israeli new shekels of Series D bonds (the Series D Expansion to Israeli investors pursuant to a public offering registered with the Israel Securities Authority. The Series D Expansion had an equal level of security, pari passu, amongst themselves and between them and the existing Series D bonds without any right of precedence or preference between any of them. On September 19, 2024, we prepaid approximately 312.8 million Israeli new shekels of the January 31, 2025 Series B bond payment, with 75.4 million Israeli new shekels outstanding. Subsequent to September 30, 2024, we sold parcels of collateralized Park Highlands undeveloped land, refer to Subsequent Events, below for additional details.

 Results of Operations 
 Overview 
 As of September 30, 2024, we consolidated nine office complexes, encompassing, in the aggregate, approximately 3.2 million rentable square feet, one residential home portfolio consisting of 2,145 residential homes, one apartment property containing 317 units, one hotel property with 196 rooms, four investments in undeveloped land with approximately 581 developable acres, one office/retail development property, held an interest in three investments in unconsolidated entities and one investment in real estate equity securities. 
 Our results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, may not be indicative of those in future periods due to acquisition and disposition activities. Additionally, the occupancy in our office complexes has not been stabilized. As of September 30, 2024, our office complexes were collectively 66 occupied, our residential home portfolio was 94 occupied and our apartment property was 95 occupied. However, due to the amount of near-term lease expirations, we do not put significant emphasis on quarterly changes in occupancy (positive or negative) in the short run. Our underwriting and valuations are generally more sensitive to terminal values that may be realized upon the disposition of the assets in the portfolio and less sensitive to ongoing cash flows generated by the portfolio in the years leading up to an eventual sale. There are no guarantees that the occupancy of our assets will increase, or that we will recognize a gain on the sale of our assets. In general, we expect that our income and expenses related to our portfolio will increase in future periods as a result of leasing additional space and acquiring additional assets but decrease due to disposition activity.

 Rental income decreased to 30.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 31.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the disposition of residential homes and one apartment property, which resulted in a decrease in rental income of approximately 1.1 million and 0.4 million, respectively. The occupancy rates and income within the residential homes segment remained consistent for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023; however, there was a slight decrease in occupancy rates for the strategic opportunistic properties. Additionally, the rental income per square foot for our strategic opportunistic properties remained consistent for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. We expect rental income to increase in future periods as a result of new lease activity and to the extent we acquire additional properties, but to decrease to the extent we dispose of properties or from naturally expiring leases. 
 Foreign currency transaction loss, net increased to 4.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from a 1.1 million foreign currency transaction loss, net for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the outstanding Series Bonds being denominated in Israeli new shekel and slightly less favorable exchange rates during the three months ended September 30, 2024. We expect to recognize foreign transaction gains and losses due to changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the Israeli new shekel, which may be offset with foreign currency derivative hedges in future periods, and changes in the level of foreign currency exposure. 
 Interest expense, net increased to 20.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 17.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the increase in the weighted-average variable rate to 8.0 as of September 30, 2024, from 7.9 as of September 30, 2023. Additionally, the weighted-average fixed rate increased to 6.3 as of September 30, 2024, from 4.8 as of September 30, 2023, primarily due to the issuance of the Series D bonds of 157.5 million with a fixed interest rate of 9.5 and payment of the Series B bonds of 180.9 million with a fixed interest rate of 3.93 . We anticipate interest expense will continue to increase in 2024 as a result of the effect of higher average market interest rates on our variable-rate debt, since interest rates are expected to plateau and then start to decrease at a slower rate compared to how quickly they increased throughout 2023. Our interest expense in future periods will vary based on interest rates on variable and fixed rate debt, the amount of interest capitalized, level of future borrowings, interest rate derivative instruments, and the impact of refinancing efforts. 
 Impairment charges on real estate and related intangibles decreased to 15.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 28.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. We impaired three strategic opportunistic properties and one hotel during the three months ended September 30, 2024 due to declines in market conditions and projected cash flows, changes in sales comparisons, and also based on a quoted price. We impaired three strategic opportunistic properties during the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to increases in the discount and cap rate assumptions, decreases in projected cash flows and changes in sales comparisons. 
 Loss from unconsolidated entities of 9.8 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 primarily consists of a loss of 9.3 million from the 110 William Joint Venture and no income or loss was recognized related to the 353 Sacramento Joint Venture due to the suspension of the equity method of accounting. The loss from unconsolidated entities, net of 10.4 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023 consists of a loss of 26.3 million from the 353 Sacramento Joint Venture, primarily due to our share of impairment charges on real estate and related intangibles of 22.7 million and partially offset by income of 15.3 million from the 110 William Joint Venture, which is primarily due to recognizing a gain on extinguishment of debt of 71.6 million and partially offset by our share of accumulated losses recognized of 56.3 million. 
 Gain on real estate equity securities, net increased to 8.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from a loss on real estate equity securities, net of 3.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily related to the change in the fair value of our real estate equity securities held and sold during these periods. We expect gains and losses on real estate equity securities to fluctuate in future periods as a result of changes in share prices and the level of our investments in real estate equity securities.

 Rental income decreased to 92.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 96.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the disposition of residential homes and one apartment property, which resulted in a decrease in rental income of approximately 3.8 million and 0.3 million, respectively.

 Interest expense, net increased to 55.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 49.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to the increase in the weighted-average variable rate to 8.0 as of September 30, 2024, from 7.9 as of September 30, 2023. Additionally, the weighted-average fixed rate increased to 6.3 as of September 30, 2024, from 4.8 as of September 30, 2023, primarily due to the issuance of the Series C bonds of 99.5 million with a fixed interest rate of 9.0 , the Series D bonds of 157.5 million with a fixed interest rate of 9.5 and payment of the 180.9 million Series B bonds with a fixed interest rate of 3.93 . We anticipate interest expense will continue to increase in 2024 as a result of higher average market interest rates on our variable-rate debt as interest rates are expected to plateau and then start to decrease at a slower rate compared to how quickly they increased throughout 2023. Our interest expense in future periods will vary based on interest rates on variable and fixed rate debt, the amount of interest capitalized, level of future borrowings, interest rate derivative instruments, and the impact of refinancing efforts. 
 Impairment charges on real estate and related intangibles increased to 76.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 64.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. We impaired five strategic opportunistic properties and one hotel during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to declines in market conditions and projected cash flows, changes in sales comparisons, and also based on a quoted price. We impaired three strategic opportunistic properties during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to increases in discount and cap rate assumptions, decreases in projected cash flows and changes in sales comparisons. 
 Loss from unconsolidated entities of 26.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily consists of a loss of 25.4 million from the 110 William Joint Venture and no income or loss was recognized related to the 353 Sacramento Joint Venture due to the suspension of the equity method of accounting. The loss from unconsolidated entities, net of 27.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 consists of a loss of 44.0 million for the 353 Sacramento Joint Venture, primarily due to impairment charge on the 353 Sacramento Joint Venture of 14.8 million and increases in our share of interest expense and impairment charges on real estate of 3.5 million and 22.7 million, respectively, and partially offset by income of 15.3 million from the 110 William Joint Venture, which is primarily due to recognizing a gain on extinguishment of debt of 71.6 million and partially offset by our share of accumulated losses recognized of 60.1 million. 
 Loss on real estate equity securities, net decreased to 7.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 19.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily related to the change in the fair value of our real estate equity securities held and sold during these periods. We expect gains and losses on real estate equity securities to fluctuate in future periods as a result of changes in share prices and level of our investments in real estate equity securities. 
 
 Funds from Operations, Modified Funds from Operations and Adjusted Modified Funds from Operations 
 We believe that funds from operations FFO is a beneficial indicator of the performance of an equity REIT. We compute FFO in accordance with the current National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts NAREIT definition. FFO represents net income, excluding gains and losses from sales of real estate assets (which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar conditions based on historical cost accounting and useful-life estimates), impairment losses on real estate assets, depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, and adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. In addition, we elected the option to exclude mark-to-market changes in value recognized on equity securities in the calculation of FFO. We believe FFO facilitates comparisons of operating performance between periods and among other REITs. However, our computation of FFO may not be comparable to other REITs that do not define FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition or that interpret the current NAREIT definition differently than we do. Our management believes that historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves. As a result, we believe that the use of FFO, together with the required GAAP presentations, provides a more complete understanding of our performance relative to our competitors and provides a more informed and appropriate basis on which to make decisions involving operating, financing, and investing activities.

 Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

 Changes in accounting rules have resulted in a substantial increase in the number of non-operating and non-cash items included in the calculation of FFO. As a result, our management also uses modified funds from operations MFFO as an indicator of our ongoing performance as well as our dividend sustainability. MFFO excludes from FFO: acquisition fees and expenses (to the extent that such fees and expenses have been recorded as operating expenses); adjustments related to contingent purchase price obligations; amounts relating to straight-line rents and amortization of above- and below-market intangible lease assets and liabilities; accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums on debt investments; amortization of closing costs relating to debt investments; impairments of real estate-related investments; mark-to-market adjustments included in net income; and gains or losses included in net income for the extinguishment or sale of debt or hedges. We compute MFFO in accordance with the definition of MFFO included in the practice guideline issued by the Institute for Portfolio Alternatives IPA in November 2010 as interpreted by management. Our computation of MFFO may not be comparable to other REITs that do not compute MFFO in accordance with the current IPA definition or that interpret the current IPA definition differently than we do. 
 In addition, our management uses an adjusted MFFO Adjusted MFFO as an indicator of our ongoing performance, as well as our dividend sustainability. Adjusted MFFO provides adjustments to reduce MFFO related to operating expenses that are capitalized with respect to certain of our investments in undeveloped land. 
 We believe that MFFO and Adjusted MFFO are helpful as measures of ongoing operating performance because they exclude costs that management considers more reflective of investing activities and other non-operating items included in FFO. Management believes that excluding acquisition costs, prior to our early adoption of ASU No. 2017-01 on January 1, 2017, from MFFO and Adjusted MFFO provides investors with supplemental performance information that is consistent with management s analysis of the operating performance of the portfolio over time, including periods after our acquisition stage. MFFO and Adjusted MFFO also exclude non-cash items such as straight-line rental revenue. Additionally, we believe that MFFO and Adjusted MFFO provide investors with supplemental performance information that is consistent with the performance indicators and analysis used by management, in addition to net income and cash flows from operating activities as defined by GAAP, to evaluate the sustainability of our operating performance. MFFO provides comparability in evaluating the operating performance of our portfolio with other non-traded REITs which typically have limited lives with short and defined acquisition periods and targeted exit strategies. MFFO, or an equivalent measure, is routinely reported by non-traded REITs, and we believe often used by analysts and investors for comparison purposes. 
 FFO, MFFO and Adjusted MFFO are non-GAAP financial measures and do not represent net income as defined by GAAP. Net income as defined by GAAP is the most relevant measure in determining our operating performance because FFO, MFFO and Adjusted MFFO include adjustments that investors may deem subjective, such as adding back expenses such as depreciation and amortization and the other items described above. Accordingly, FFO, MFFO and Adjusted MFFO should not be considered as alternatives to net income as an indicator of our current and historical operating performance. In addition, FFO, MFFO and Adjusted MFFO do not represent cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered an indication of our liquidity. We believe FFO, MFFO and Adjusted MFFO, in addition to net income and cash flows from operating activities as defined by GAAP, are meaningful supplemental performance measures. 
 Although MFFO includes other adjustments, the exclusion of straight-line rent, the amortization of above- and below-market leases, amortization of premium or discount on bond and notes payable, mark-to-market foreign currency transaction adjustments and extinguishment of debt are the most significant adjustments for the periods presented. We have excluded these items based on the following economic considerations: 
 Adjustments for straight-line rent. These are adjustments to rental revenue as required by GAAP to recognize contractual lease payments on a straight-line basis over the life of the respective lease. We have excluded these adjustments in our calculation of MFFO to more appropriately reflect the current economic impact of our in-place leases, while also providing investors with a useful supplemental metric that addresses core operating performance by removing rent we expect to receive in a future period or rent that was received in a prior period; 
 Amortization of above- and below-market leases. Similar to depreciation and amortization of real estate assets and lease related costs that are excluded from FFO, GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of intangible lease assets and liabilities diminishes predictably over time and requires that these charges be recognized currently in revenue. Since market lease rates in the aggregate have historically risen or fallen with local market conditions, management believes that by excluding these charges, MFFO provides useful supplemental information on the realized economics of the real estate; 
 29

 Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (continued) 

 Amortization of premium and discount on notes and bonds payable . These are net adjustments to interest expense as required by GAAP to recognize notes and bonds payable discount and premiums on a straight-line basis over the life of the respective notes and bonds payable. We have excluded these adjustments in our calculation of MFFO to appropriately reflect the current economic impact of our bond and notes payable and related interest expense; 
 Unrealized gain or loss from interest rate caps. These adjustments include unrealized gains from mark-to-market adjustments on interest rate caps. The change in fair value of interest rate caps not designated as a hedge are non-cash adjustments recognized directly in earnings and are included in interest expense. We have excluded these adjustments in our calculation of MFFO to more appropriately reflect the economic impact of our interest rate cap agreements; and 
 Mark-to-market foreign currency transaction adjustments. The U.S. Dollar is our functional currency. Transactions denominated in currency other than our functional currency are recorded upon initial recognition at the exchange rate on the date of the transaction. After initial recognition, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are remeasured at each reporting date into the foreign currency at the exchange rate on that date. In addition, we have entered into foreign currency collars and foreign currency options that results in a foreign currency transaction adjustment. These amounts can increase or reduce net income. We exclude them from MFFO to more appropriately present the ongoing operating performance of our real estate investments on a comparative basis. 
 Adjusted MFFO includes adjustments to reduce MFFO primarily related to income tax provision, as well as real estate taxes, property insurance, and financing costs which are capitalized with respect to certain of our investments in undeveloped land. 
 Our calculation of FFO, which we believe is consistent with the calculation of FFO as defined by NAREIT, is presented in the following table, along with our calculations of MFFO and Adjusted MFFO, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands). No conclusions or comparisons should be made from the presentation of these periods. For the Three Months Ended September 30,

 (3) Reflects real estate taxes, property insurance and financing costs capitalized with respect to certain of our investments in undeveloped land and unconsolidated entity. During the periods in which we are incurring costs necessary to bring these investments to their intended use, certain normal recurring operating costs are capitalized in accordance with GAAP and not reflected in our net loss, FFO and MFFO. 
 FFO, MFFO and Adjusted MFFO may also be used to fund all or a portion of certain capitalizable items that are excluded from FFO, MFFO and Adjusted MFFO, such as tenant improvements, building improvements and deferred leasing costs. We expect FFO, MFFO and Adjusted MFFO to improve in future periods to the extent that we continue to lease up vacant space and acquire additional assets. We expect FFO, MFFO and Adjusted MFFO to decrease as a result of dispositions. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 Our consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP and in conjunction with the rules and regulations of the SEC. The preparation of our financial statements requires significant management judgments and assumptions, requires estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain and which are important for understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. These judgments will affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. With different estimates or assumptions, materially different amounts could be reported in our financial statements. Additionally, other companies may utilize different estimates that may impact the comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses. A discussion of the accounting policies that management considers critical in that they involve significant management judgments, assumptions and estimates is included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC. There have been no significant changes to our policies during 2024. 
 
 Subsequent Events 
 We evaluate subsequent events up until the date the consolidated financial statements are issued. 
 Park Highlands Land 
 In October 2024, we, through an indirect wholly owned subsidiary, sold approximately 122 developable acres of Park Highlands undeveloped land for gross sale proceeds of approximately 75.5 million, before net closing costs and credits. Part of the Park Highlands undeveloped land was used as collateral for the Series C bonds and due to the sale, approximately 10.6 million of the sales proceeds will be held in a deposit account to be applied towards the Series C bonds payment. The purchaser is not affiliated with us or our advisor. 
 Residential Homes Sale 
 In October 2024, we, through an indirect wholly owned subsidiary, sold 45 residential homes for gross sale proceeds of approximately 8.3 million, before closing costs and credits. In connection with the sale, we repaid 3.2 million of the outstanding principal due under the secured mortgage loan. The purchaser is not affiliated with us or our advisor. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 Foreign Currency, Interest Rate and Financial Market Risk 
 Certain transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk. We monitor our foreign currency exposures to maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency positions, including hedges. Principal currency exposure is Israeli new shekel; in particular, we are exposed to the effects of foreign currency changes in Israel with respect to the bonds issued to investors in Israel. 
 In addition, we are exposed to the effects of interest rate changes as a result of borrowings used to maintain liquidity, fund distributions and to fund the refinancing of our real estate investment portfolio and operations. We may also be exposed to the effects of changes in interest rates as a result of the acquisition and origination of mortgage, bonds, and other loans and the acquisition of real estate securities. Our profitability and the value of our investment portfolio may be adversely affected during any period as a result of interest rate changes. Our interest rate risk management objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings, prepayment penalties and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We may manage interest rate risk by maintaining a ratio of fixed rate, long-term debt such that floating rate exposure is kept at an acceptable level. We may also utilize a variety of financial instruments, including interest rate caps, floors, and swap agreements, in order to limit the effects of changes in interest rates on our operations. Additionally, certain of these strategies may reduce the funds available for payments to holders of our common stock.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk (continued) 

 In addition, our profitability and the value of our investment portfolio may be adversely affected during any period as a result of foreign currency changes. In order to limit the effects of changes in foreign currency on our operations, we may utilize a variety of foreign currency hedging strategies such as cross currency swaps, forward contracts, puts or calls. When we use these types of derivatives to hedge the risk of interest-earning assets or interest-bearing liabilities, we may be subject to certain risks, including the risk that losses on a hedge position will reduce the funds available for payments to holders of our common stock and the risk that the losses may exceed the amount we invested in the instruments. Additionally, certain of these strategies may cause us to fund a margin account periodically to offset changes in foreign currency rates which may also reduce the funds available for payments to holders of our common stock. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we held 33.4 million Israeli new shekels and 10.9 million Israeli new shekels in cash and restricted cash, respectively. In addition, as of September 30, 2024, we had Series Bonds outstanding and the related interest payable in the amounts of 1.4 billion Israeli new shekels and 16.7 million Israeli new shekels, respectively. Foreign currency exchange rate risk is the possibility that our financial results could be better or worse than planned because of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Based solely on the remeasurement for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, if foreign currency exchange rates were to increase or decrease by 10 , our net loss would increase or decrease by approximately 38.4 million for the same period. The foreign currency transaction income or loss may be impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, levels at which we hold foreign currency, and future foreign currency collar investments. 
 We borrow funds at a combination of fixed and variable rates. Interest rate fluctuations will generally not affect our future earnings or cash flows on our fixed rate debt unless such instruments mature or are otherwise terminated. However, interest rate changes will affect the fair value of our fixed rate instruments. As of September 30, 2024, the fair value of our bonds was 376.1 million and the outstanding principal balance was 378.5 million. The fair value estimates of the Series Bonds were calculated using the quoted bond price as of September 30, 2024 on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange of 96.46, 105.21 and 100.91 Israeli new shekels, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, excluding the Series Bonds, the fair value of our fixed rate debt was 212.2 million and the outstanding principal balance of our fixed rate debt was 215.8 million. The fair value estimate of our fixed rate debt, excluding the Series Bonds, was calculated using a discounted cash flow analysis utilizing rates we would expect to pay for debt of a similar type and remaining maturity if the loans were originated as of September 30, 2024. As we expect to hold our fixed rate instruments to maturity and the amounts due under such instruments would be limited to the outstanding principal balance and any accrued and unpaid interest, we do not expect that fluctuations in interest rates, and the resulting changes in fair value of our fixed rate instruments, would have a significant impact on our operations. 
 Conversely, movements in interest rates on variable rate debt would change our future earnings and cash flows but would not significantly affect the fair value of those instruments. However, changes in required risk premiums would result in changes in the fair value of floating rate instruments. As of September 30, 2024, we had entered into two separate interest rate caps with an aggregate notional amount of 78.2 million which effectively limits our exposure to increases in one-month Secured Overnight Finance Rate SOFR above certain thresholds. Based on interest rates as of September 30, 2024, if interest rates were 100 basis points higher or lower during the 12 months ending September 30, 2024, interest expense on our variable rate debt would increase or decrease by 2.7 million and 2.8 million, respectively. 
 The weighted-average interest rates of our fixed rate debt and variable rate debt as of September 30, 2024 were 6.3 and 8.0 , respectively. The interest rate and weighted-average interest rate represent the actual interest rate in effect as of September 30, 2024 (consisting of the contractual interest rate and the effect of contractual floor rates, if applicable), using interest rate indices as of September 30, 2024 where applicable. 
 We are exposed to financial market risk with respect to our real estate equity securities. Financial market risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in our real estate equity security prices. Our exposure to changes in real estate equity security prices is a result of our investment in these types of securities. Market prices are subject to fluctuation and, therefore, the amount realized in the subsequent sale of an investment may significantly differ from the reported market value. Fluctuation in the market prices of a real estate equity security may result from any number of factors, including perceived changes in the underlying fundamental characteristics of the issuer, the relative price of alternative investments, interest rates, default rates and general market conditions. In addition, amounts realized in the sale of a particular security may be affected by the relative quantity of the real estate equity security being sold. We do not currently engage in derivative or other hedging transactions to manage our real estate equity security price risk. As of September 30, 2024, we owned real estate equity securities with a book value of 17.3 million. Based solely on the prices of real estate equity securities as of September 30, 2024, if prices were to increase or decrease by 10 , our net loss would increase or decrease by approximately 1.7 million.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As of the end of the period covered by this report, management, including our Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), who are our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, respectively, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon that evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective as of the end of the period covered by this report since the material weakness in the design and operation of our management review controls, previously described in Part II, Item 9A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, was not yet remediated as of September 30, 2024. 
 Notwithstanding the identified material weakness previously described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, our management, including our CEO and CFO, does not believe that this deficiency had an adverse effect on our reported operating results or financial condition, and has concluded that our financial statements and other financial information included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q presents fairly, in all material respects, our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows for the periods presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. 
 Remediation 
 As previously disclosed, we have initiated a comprehensive plan to remediate this material weakness. The remediation actions include review measures to enhance controls related to non-pro rata profit or loss allocations for our investments in unconsolidated entities and consultations with external accounting experts for non-recurring, significant, and/or unusual transactions. We believe that these actions will remediate the material weakness. The weakness will not be considered remediated, however, until the controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. We expect that the remediation of this material weakness will be completed at the end of 2024. 
 Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 Except for the changes described above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 (1) On November 30, 2023 our board of directors approved an estimated value per share of our common stock of 8.03. The change in the redemption price became effective beginning with the December 2023 redemption date. 
 (2) During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we redeemed 1.9 million of common stock under the program, which represented shares in connection with redemption requests made upon a stockholder s death, qualifying disability or determination of incompetence .

NEW PHASING, CLOSING DATES, DEPOSIT, PRICE ALLOCATION 4. Closing in Three Phases. The Purchase Agreement currently contemplates that the Property will be purchased and sold in two (2) phases. Notwithstanding anything in the Purchase Agreement to the contrary, Buyer has requested, and Seller has agreed, to proceed with the purchase and sale of the Property in three (3) phases, as more particularly described in this Amendment. Phase 1, the Phase 1 Property, and the Phase 1 Purchase Price have not changed. Phase 2 and the Phase 2 Property shall be approximately 130.77 gross acres as shown on the phasing plan attached hereto as Exhibit B-3 (the New Phasing Plan ), which shall supersede and replace Exhibit B-3 attached to the Purchase Agreement. The remainder of the original Phase 2 and the Phase 2 Property shall be new Phase 3 and Phase 3 Property , comprising of approximately 111.40 gross acres as shown on the New Phasing Plan.

Finally, the provisions of the Purchase Agreement shall be reasonably interpreted to refer to the Closing in three (3) Phases, and the provisions of the Purchase Agreement shall apply to each Closing and the portion of Property purchased at such Closing, as applicable. For example, in Section 1.1 of the Purchase Agreement (which only specifically references the Phase 1 Closing), if the Purchase Agreement is terminated after the Phase 2 Closing but before the Phase 3 Closing, Section 1.1 would be interpreted to mean that the termination would relate solely to the Phase 3 Property and would not apply to matters pertaining to the Phase 1 Property and the Phase 2 Property that survive (or are deemed to survive) the Phase 1 Closing and the Phase 2 Closing. 5.

17 1614780295.2 certification from the Rating Agency that the Expansion of the Series will not affect the rating of the Debentures (Series D) in effect at that time.

The financial covenants set forth in Subsections 1 to 3 above shall be referred to in this Section 5.3 above and below only collectively as the Financial Covenants and each of the aforementioned financial covenants shall be named: the Financial Covenant . It is hereby clarified that if an adjustment of the interest rate is required in accordance with the mechanism described in this section above, and also in accordance with the mechanism specified in Section 5.2 above, then, in any case, the maximum additional interest rate will not be more than 1.5 above the interest rate determined in the Tender (hereinafter: The Total Maximum Additional Interest Rate ). Arrears interest, if applicable pursuant to Section 4(a) of the terms overleaf, will be added to the abovementioned interest and will not constitute part of it. The Additional Interest Rate addition of interest in the rate of 0.5 for each breach of a financial covenant, separately, and an increase in the accumulated interest of up to 1.5 ; the interest rate will only be raised once due to the breach of any of the financial covenant, if any, and the interest rate will not be raised again if a breach of the same financial covenant continues.

The Breach Date the date of publication of the financial statements that point to the breach. A. If the Company breaches any of the financial covenants pursuant to the latest published audited and reviewed financial reports of the Company (hereinafter in this current Section 5.3: the Breach ), the annual interest on the outstanding principal amount of the Debentures (Series D) will increase by the Additional Interest Rate in respect of the Breach, above the interest rate in effect at the time, prior to the change, in respect of the period from the date of the 27 1614780295.2 Breach until the date of repayment of the outstanding principal amount of the Debentures (Series D) or until the date of publication of the Company's financial statements pursuant to which the Company is in compliance with that financial covenant, whichever is earlier. If the interest rate was increased before that due to a rating downgrade due to as stated in Section 5.2 above, then the interest rate increase due to the breach of a financial covenant as provided in this subsection, will be limited so that the total annual additional interest (except when there is entitlement to arrears) due to the rating downgrade and breach of financial covenants will not exceed the Total Maximum Additional Interest Rate in any case. B. In the event of said breach, no later than one business day from the publication of the Company's audited or reviewed financial statements (as applicable), the Company shall publish an immediate report stating the following: (a) failure to comply with the said undertaking and detailing the financial covenants on the date of publication of the financial statements; (b) the current rating of the Debentures (Series D) based on the last rating report that was published prior to the immediate report and whether the interest was adjusted, as per Section 5.2 above; (c) the accurate interest rate on the Debentures (Series D) for the period from the current interest rate period until the Date of the Breach (the interest will be calculated based on 365 days a year) (hereinafter in this current Section 5.3: the Original Interest Rate ), respectively); (d) the interest rate on the outstanding Debentures (Series D) from the Date of the Breach until the date of the nearest interest payment, that is, the Original Interest Rate plus the Additional Interest Rate per year (the interest rate will be calculated based on 365 days a year) (hereinafter in this current Section 5.3: the Current Interest Rate ). If the interest rate was increased before that due to a rating downgrade as stated in Section 5.2 above, then the increase to the interest rate at the subject of this current Subsection shall be limited so that the total annual interest rate increase (excluding entitlement for interest arrears) in no case exceeds the Total Maximum Additional Interest Rate; (e) the weighted interest rate payable by the Company to the holders of the Debentures (Series D) on the nearest interest payment date, which arises from the provisions of Subsection (c) and (d) above; (f) the annual interest rate arising from the weighted interest rate; (g) the annual interest rate and the semi- annual interest rate (the semi-annual interest rate will be calculated as the annual interest rate divided two) for the upcoming periods. 28 1614780295.2 C. If the Date of the Breach occurs during the period commencing four trading days prior to the record date for the payment of any interest and ending on the interest payment date that is nearest to the record date (hereinafter in this subsection: the Deferral Period ), the Company shall pay the holders of the Debentures (Series D), on the nearest interest payment date, the Original Interest Rate (prior to the change) only, while the interest rate resulting from an increase at a rate equal to the Additional Interest Rate per year during the Deferral Period, will be paid on the next interest payment. The Company shall announce in the immediate report detailed in the above Subsection B the stating the accurate interest rate payable on the next interest payment date as well as the annual and semiannual interest rates pertaining to subsequent interest periods. D. In the event of a breach of a Financial Covenant which affects the interest rate on the Debentures (Series D) as stated above in Section 5.3(A) above or in Section 5.3(E) below, the Company shall notify the Trustee in writing within one business day from the date of publication of the financial statements, as aforesaid. For the avoidance of doubt, it is clarified that if after the breach, the Company will publish its audited or reviewed financial statements (as applicable), pursuant to which the Company will be in compliance with that financial covenant, then the interest rate paid by the Company to the holders of the Debentures (Series D), on the relevant interest payment date, will decrease, in respect of the period commencing on the date of publication of the financial statements that point to its compliance with that financial covenant, so that the interest rate on the outstanding principal amount of the Debentures (Series D), provided the interest rate was not raised before that due to a rating downgrade of Debentures (Series D) as stated in Section 5.2 above, and/or due to breach of another financial covenant, will be the interest rate that shall be determined in the tender or another interest rate determined due to a downgrade in the rating of Debentures (Series D) as stated in Section 5.2 above, and/or due to breach of another financial covenant (and in any case, the interest rate on the Debentures will not be lower than the interest rate that will be determined in the Tender). In such case, the Company shall act in accordance with Subsections (B) to (D) above, mutatis mutandis, as the case may be, arising from the Company's compliance with that financial covenant. It is clarified that the adjustment of the interest rate due to a change in the rating or due to breach of financial covenants will be examined separately without the one affecting the other, 

29 1614780295.2 subject to the effect that the maximum accumulated interest in respect of the downgrading and in respect of non-compliance with financial covenants shall not exceed the Total Maximum Additional Interest Rate. The additional interest for non- compliance, if there was such non-compliance, in accordance with Section 5.3 below, shall continue to apply even in the event of an upgrade in rating. It is clarified that arrears interest, if any, shall be added to the interest rates stated above. E. The examination as to whether the Company is in compliance with the financial covenants will be conducted on the date of publication of the Company's financial statements and as long as the Debentures (Series D) are outstanding, in relation to the quarterly/annual financial statements which the Company published until that date. With respect to the undertaking of the Company for disclosure in connection with this section, see Section 5.10 below. 5.4. For the avoidance of any doubt it is clarified that, subject to the aforesaid, the incremental interest rate payments arising from the rating downgrade as stated in Sections 5.2 above and/or as a result of the Company's failure to comply with the Financial Covenants as stated in Section 5.3 above are cumulative. Therefore, in the event of a rating downgrade and a breach of any of the financial covenants by the Company, the holders of the Debentures (Series D) will be entitled to an additional interest as aforesaid provided the annual interest rate increase due to rate downgrade and breach of financial covenants does not exceed the Total Maximum Additional Interest Rate. It is further clarified that the arrears interest, if any, will be added to the interest rates stated above.

For purposes of this section, quarter shall mean any of the following periods: January March, April June, July September, October December. 7.2.4. The minimum amount of early redemption of Debentures shall not be less than ILS 1 million.

The amount paid to the holders of the Debentures (Series D) in the event of early redemption, shall be the higher of: (1) the market value of the Debentures (Series D), offered for early redemption, which will be determined based on the average closing price of the Debentures (Series D) in the thirty (30) trading days prior to the date of the Board of Directors' resolution regarding an early redemption Market Value of Debentures Balance and Sample Period , respectively) multiplied by the early redemption rate of debentures in circulation. Notwithstanding the aforementioned, should the partial or full early repayment be scheduled for a quarter in which an interest payment date is also scheduled, and the early repayment is undertaken in that same quarter (together with the interest), then in such a case, for the purpose of calculating the market value of debentures to be paid to holders in accordance with this current Section, the amount being remitted on that date shall be deducted from the Market Value of the Debentures Balance, solely against the interest payment, and the balance of 51 1614780295.2 the amount, after deducting the interest to be paid on the payment date, shall be multiplied by the early redemption share. It shall further be clarified that should an interest payment be remitted over the course of the Sample Period, than the amount paid solely against the interest shall be deducted from the closing price established during the trading days included in the Sample Period and which occurred prior to the aforementioned determining date for the interest payment.; (2) the liability value of the outstanding Debentures (Series D) called for early redemption, that is, the principal plus interest, until the actual early redemption date; (3) the balance of cash flow of the Debentures (Series D) called for early redemption (principal plus interest), discounted at the government bond yield (as defined below and no lower than 0 plus 1.5 per annum.

For purposes of this section Government Bond Yield means the average yield to maturity (gross) in the seven business day period that ends two business days before the date of the notice of early redemption notice, of three unlinked series of government bonds in Shekels, bearing a fixed interest rate, whose average life is the closest to the average life of the Debentures on the relevant date, i.e. one series with the nearest high average duration of the Debentures (Series D) on the relevant date, and one series below the average duration of the Debentures (Series D) on the relevant date whose weight will reflect the average duration of the Debentures on the relevant. For example: if the average duration of the Government A Debentures is four years, the average duration of Government B Debentures is two years and the average duration of the loan balance is 3.5 years, the yield will be calculated as follows: 4x + 2(1-x) = 3.5 X = the yield weight of the Government A Bonds. X = the yield weight of the Government B Bonds. According to the calculation, the annual return of the Government A Debentures will be weighted at a rate of seventy-five percent (75 of the return and the annual rate of the Government B Debentures will be weighted at a rate of twenty-five percent (25 of the return. 52 1614780295.2 Should no government debentures series with shorter maturities than Debentures (Series D) remain in circulation, then the government bond yields shall be calculated using the average yield of two government bond series with attributes as detailed in the definition of the term Government Bond Yield, above, with an average duration closest to the average lifetime of Debentures (Series D) on the applicable date. To avoid doubt it shall be clarified that the government bond yield shall be no lower than zero, i.e., should calculation set forth in the definition of the Government Bond Yield result in a negative total, then in the calculation the capitalization interest rate for the purpose of substitution (3) in this current Section, above, the rate pertaining to the Government Bond Yield shall be 0 (i.e., the capitalization interest rate in this case shall total 1.5 ). In the case of an additional interest payment due to the early repayment, the additional interest shall be paid solely on nominal value being redeemed under the terms of the early repayment. 7.2.10. The Company shall furnish to the Trustee, within five business days from the date of the resolution of the Board of Directors regarding the early repayment in accordance with any of the options set for in this current Section 7.2, above, a certification by the Company's' auditing CPA regarding the calculation of the early repayment amount, worded in a manner that will satisfy the Trustee. 8.

The monies shall be collected in the following manner: 83 1614780295.2 26.5.1.1 First The amount shall be financed out of the amounts of interest and if the funds of the interest from the principal which the Company is required to pay to the holders of Debentures (Series D) after the date of the required action will not be sufficient, and the provisions of Section 11 above shall apply (where should the amount also be financed using the principal funds, then as part of disclosing the financing amount, as defined above, Company shall also announce the amount due for each ILS 1, nominal value, net of the financing amount); 26.5.1.2 Second If in the Trustee's opinion the amounts deposited in the financing cushion are not enough to cover the indemnification undertaking, the holders on the effective date (as provided in Section 26.6 above) shall deposit, each according to their proportionate share (as this term is defined) the missing amount with the Trustee. Proportionate share means: The proportion of the Debentures (Series D) held by the holder on the relevant effective date as provided in Section 26.6 above out of the nominal amount in circulation on that date. It is clarified that the calculation of the proportionate share shall remain fixed even if after that date there is a change in the par value of the Debentures held by the holder. It is clarified that the debenture holders who are liable to cover expenses as provided in this section above, may bear expenses as provided in this section above, beyond their proportionate share, and in such case, the order of priorities as provided in Section 10 of this Deed shall apply to the reimbursement of the amounts. 26.6.

If the indemnification undertaking and/or payment of the financing cushion are required pursuant to a resolution of a meeting of holders of Debentures (Series D) the effective date for the obligation shall be the effective date for participation in the meeting (as such date was specified in the notice of invitation) and shall also apply to a Holder who has not participated in the meeting. 26.7. The payment by the holders in place of the Company of any amount that is due from the Company under this Section 26, shall not release the Company from its obligation to bear such payment. The Trustee will act to refund such monies as stated that were paid by the Holders in place of the Company, from the Company. 26.8. Regarding priority in reimbursing holders who bore payments under this section out of the receipts held by the Trustee, see Section 10 above. 27.
