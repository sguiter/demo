Incremental costs are those that result directly from obtaining a contract or costs that would not have been incurred if the contract had not been obtained, which primarily relate to sales commissions and certain contract fulfillment costs. These costs are deferred and amortized over the expected customer life. We determined that the expected customer life is the expected period of benefit as the commission on the renewal contract is not commensurate with the commission on the initial contract. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized expense of million and million,

 million and million, respectively, related to deferred contract acquisition costs. Contract liabilities include deferred revenues related to advanced payments for services and nonrefundable, upfront service activation and set-up fees, which are generally deferred and amortized over the expected customer life as the option to renew without paying an upfront fee provides the customer with a material right. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized previously deferred revenues of million and million, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized previously deferred revenues of million and million, respectively.

Performance Obligations ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ASC 606 ), requires that the Company disclose the aggregate amount of the transaction price that is allocated to remaining performance obligations that are unsatisfied as of September 30, 2024. The guidance provides certain practical expedients that limit this requirement. The service revenue contracts of the Company meet the following practical expedients provided by ASC 606: 1. The performance obligation is part of a contract that has an original expected duration of year or less. 2. Revenue is recognized from the satisfaction of the performance obligations in the amount billable to the customer in accordance with ASC 606-10-55-18. The Company has elected these practical expedients. Performance obligations related to our service revenue contracts are generally satisfied over time. For services transferred over time, revenue is recognized based on amounts invoiced to the customer as the Company has concluded that the invoice amount directly corresponds with the value of services provided to the customer. Management considers this a faithful depiction of the transfer of control as services are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer over the life of the contract. As such, revenue related to unsatisfied performance obligations that will be billed in future periods has not been disclosed.

In addition, Searchlight received the right to an unsecured subordinated note with an aggregate principal amount of approximately million (the Note ), which was convertible into shares of a new series of perpetual preferred stock of the Company with an aggregate liquidation preference equal to the principal amount of the Note plus accrued interest as of the date of conversion. On July 15, 2021, the Company received all required state public utility commission regulatory approvals necessary for the conversion of the CPR into additional shares of the Company s common stock. As a result, the CPR was converted into shares of common stock, which were issued to Searchlight on July 16, 2021. In the second stage of the transaction, which was completed on December 7, 2021 following the receipt of Federal Communications Commission FCC and certain regulatory approvals and the satisfaction of certain other customary closing conditions, Searchlight invested an additional million and was issued the Note.

The Credit Agreement consisted of term loans in an original aggregate amount of million (the Term Loans and a revolving loan facility of million. The Credit Agreement also includes an incremental loan facility which provides the ability to borrow, subject to certain terms and conditions, incremental loans in an aggregate amount of up to the greater of (a) million plus (b) an amount which would not cause its senior secured leverage ratio not to exceed :1.00 (the Incremental Facility ).

Credit Agreement Covenant Compliance The Credit Agreement contains various provisions and covenants, including, among other items, restrictions on the ability to pay dividends, incur additional indebtedness, and issue certain capital stock. We have agreed to maintain certain financial ratios, including a maximum consolidated first lien leverage ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement. Among other things, it will be an event of default, with respect to the revolving credit facility only, if our consolidated first lien leverage ratio is greater than :1.00 as of the end of any fiscal quarter, if on such date the testing threshold is met.

As of September 30, 2024, the testing threshold was met and our consolidated first lien leverage ratio under the Credit Agreement was below :1.00.

 additional monthly pension benefits will accrue under those plans. We also maintain non-qualified supplemental retirement plans (the Supplemental Plans and, together with the defined benefit pension plans, the Pension Plans ). The Supplemental Plans provide supplemental retirement benefits to certain former employees by providing for incremental pension payments to partially offset the reduction of the amount that would have been payable under the qualified defined benefit pension plans if it were not for limitations imposed by federal income tax regulations. The Supplemental Plans are closed to all new entrants. These plans are unfunded and have assets. The benefits paid under the Supplemental Plans are paid from the general operating funds of the Company.

Retirees share in the cost of healthcare benefits, making contributions that are adjusted periodically either based upon collective bargaining agreements or because total costs of the program have changed. Covered expenses for retiree health benefits are paid as they are incurred. Post-retirement life insurance benefits are fully insured. A majority of the healthcare plans are unfunded and have assets, and benefits are paid from the general operating funds of the Company. However, a certain healthcare plan is funded by assets that are separately designated within the Pension Plans for the sole purpose of providing payments of retiree medical benefits for this specific plan.

Contributions We elected to participate in the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 ARPA beginning with the 2021 plan year. ARPA, which was signed into law in March 2021, included changes to the employer funding requirements and is designed to reduce the amounts of required contributions to provide funding relief for employers. During 2021 and the six months ended June 30, 2022, we elected to fund our pension contributions at the pre-ARPA levels, which has created a pre-funded balance. We intend to use our current pre-funded balance to satisfy the minimum contribution requirements until the balance is exhausted, which is expected to occur in late 2024. We expect to contribute approximately million to our Pension Plans and million to our Post-retirement Plans in 2024. As of September 30, 2024, we have contributed million and million of the annual contribution to the Pension Plans and Post-retirement Plans, respectively. million. The net amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would result in an impact to the effective tax rate is million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. We do not expect any material change in our unrecognized tax benefits during the remainder of 2024. Our practice is to recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in interest expense and selling, general and administrative expenses, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we did not have a material liability for interest or penalties and had no material interest or penalty expense. The periods subject to examination for our federal return are years 2020 through 2023. The periods subject to examination for our state returns are years 2019 through 2023. In addition, prior tax years may be subject to examination by federal or state taxing authorities if the Company s net operating loss carryovers from those prior years are utilized in the future. We are currently under examination by certain state taxing authorities. We do not expect any settlement or payment that may result from the examination to have a material effect on our results or cash flows. Our effective tax rate was and for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively and and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. On July 10, 2023, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our Washington operations and the transaction closed on May 1, 2024. As a result, we recorded an increase to our current tax expense of million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, related to the write-down of noncash goodwill included in the transaction that is not deductible for tax purposes. The Company does not consider this sales transaction and related goodwill adjustments unusual or infrequent and therefore the corresponding tax impact is recorded through continuing operations. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded million of tax expense to adjust our 2022 provision to match our 2022 returns. Exclusive of these adjustments, our effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 would have been approximately and , respectively, and approximately and for the nine months ended

 of our subsidiaries, Consolidated Communications of Pennsylvania Company LLC CCPA and Consolidated Communications Enterprise Services, Inc. CCES ), have, at various times, received Assessment Notices and/or Audit Assessment Notices from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Department of Revenue DOR increasing the amounts owed for the Pennsylvania Gross Receipts Tax, and have had audits performed for the tax years 2008 through 2018 (CCPA and CCES) and 2019 through 2020 (CCPA). We filed Petitions for Reassessment with the DOR s Board of Appeals contesting these audit assessments. These cases remain pending and are in various stages of appeal. In May 2017, we entered into an agreement to guarantee any potential liabilities to the DOR up to million. Tax liabilities calculated by the DOR for CCPA and CCES for tax years 2010 (CCPA) and 2014 through 2023 (CCPA and CCES) are approximately million and million, respectively. Based on the initial settlement offers for the tax years 2008 through 2013, which were subsequently settled in 2019 for million, including interest, and the Company s best estimate of the potential additional tax liabilities for the remaining unsettled tax years 2010 (CCPA) and 2014 through 2023 (CCPA and CCES), we have reserved million and million, including interest, for our CCPA and CCES subsidiaries, respectively. We expect the filings for the tax years 2014 through 2023 to be settled at a later date similar to the initial settlement. While we continue to believe a settlement of all remaining disputed claims is possible, we cannot anticipate at this time what the ultimate resolution of these cases will be, nor can we evaluate the likelihood of a favorable or unfavorable outcome or the potential losses (or gains) should such an outcome occur. From time to time we may be involved in litigation that we believe is of the type common to companies in our industry, including regulatory issues. While the outcome of these claims cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that the outcome of any of these legal matters will have a material adverse impact on our financial statements.

 our operating results and trends. These measures should be viewed in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, those measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. See the Non-GAAP Measures section below for a more detailed discussion on the use and calculation of these measures. Overview Consolidated is a broadband and business communications provider offering a wide range of communication solutions to consumer, commercial and carrier customers across a service area in over 20 states. We operate an advanced fiber network spanning nearly 66,000 fiber route miles across many rural areas and metro communities. We offer residential high-speed Internet, phone and home security services as well as multi-service residential and small business bundles. Our business product suite includes: data and Internet solutions, voice, data center services, security services, managed and IT services, and an expanded suite of cloud services. We provide wholesale solutions to wireless and wireline carriers and other service providers including data, voice, network connections and custom fiber builds and last mile connections. We generate the majority of our consolidated operating revenues primarily from monthly subscriptions to our broadband, data and transport services (collectively broadband services marketed to residential and business customers. As consumer demands for bandwidth continue to increase, our focus is on expanding our fiber broadband services and upgrading data speeds in order to offer a highly competitive fiber product. Our investment in more competitive broadband speeds is critical to our long-term success. Our strategic investment with Searchlight Capital Partners L.P. Searchlight combined with the refinancing of our capital structure in 2020 provided us with additional capital that has enabled us to accelerate our fiber expansion plans and provided significant benefits to our consumer, commercial and carrier customers. With this strategic investment, we enhanced our fiber infrastructure and accelerated our investments in high-growth and competitive areas. By leveraging our existing dense core fiber network and an accelerated build plan, we expect to be able to significantly increase data speeds, expand our multi-Gig coverage and strategically extend our network across our strong existing commercial and carrier footprint to attract more on-net and near-net opportunities. As part of our multi-year fiber expansion plan, we plan to upgrade approximately 1.6 million passings to fiber across select service areas to enable multi-Gig capable services to these homes and small businesses including more than 1 million passings within our northern New England service areas. The ultimate total passings will be dependent upon, amongst other things, our ability to secure Public Private Partnership grant arrangements and other broadband infrastructure funding opportunities. In 2024, we plan to continue to execute on our multi-year fiber growth plan and transformation from a copper-based telecommunications provider to a fiber broadband provider. Our fiber build plan includes the upgrade of approximately 150,000 homes and small businesses in 2024. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we upgraded approximately 58,000 and 101,700 passings, respectively and added approximately 18,500 and 55,000 consumer fiber Gig-capable subscribers, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we upgraded approximately 227,500 passings. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 51 of our passings were at least 1 Gig capable, as compared to 22 at December 31, 2021. Fidium Fiber, our Gigabit consumer fiber internet product with an all-new customer experience reinforces our broadband-first strategy. Our Fidium plans offer symmetrical speeds up to 2 Gbps over the latest WiFi 6 technology with no data caps. We expect to continue to expand the availability of Fidium Fiber further into communities within our markets. In February 2023, we launched Fidium@Work and expanded our Fidium Fiber service to small businesses everywhere Fidium internet is available. Fidium@Work is ideal for small businesses that have outgrown residential or traditional internet service, but do not require an enterprise solution. As we continue to increase broadband speeds, we believe that we will also be able to simultaneously enhance our commercial product offerings to meet the needs of our business customers. By leveraging our advanced fiber network, we can tailor our services for business customers by developing solutions to fit their specific needs. We offer fiber broadband connectivity and cloud-based services to deliver differentiated solutions targeting customers ranging from small businesses to large enterprises and carriers. We are focused on driving fiber connectivity, achieving data services growth and standardizing our commercial product portfolio, which increases efficiency and enables greater scalability and reliability for businesses.

 Operating revenues continue to be impacted by the industry-wide trend of declines in voice services, access lines and related network access revenue. Many customers are choosing to subscribe to alternative communication services, and competition for these subscribers continues to increase. Total voice connections decreased 15 as of September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. We have been able to mitigate some of the access line losses through alternative product offerings, such as our VoIP service. As part of our plan to simplify our product offerings and focus on our fiber-first strategy, video services have been discontinued in all markets as of the end of July 2024 as a result of our scheduled decommissioning by state and the transition of customers to streaming services offered through our streaming partnerships. We believe that this may amplify the demand for our competitive multi-gig broadband speeds to facilitate streaming content. In July 2023, we initiated a business simplification and cost savings initiative plan intended to further align our company as a fiber-first provider, improve operating efficiencies, lower our cost structure and ultimately improve the overall customer experience. This initiative included a reduction in workforce, consolidation and elimination of certain facilities and review of our product offerings. In 2024, we expect to continue to seek to improve operating efficiency through technology, better practices and procedures and through cost containment measures, and initiated a plan during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 to further reduce our workforce. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized severance costs of 10.4 million and 16.2 million, respectively, in connection with the plans. Recent Developments Merger Agreement On October 15, 2023, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement with Condor Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company Parent affiliated with certain funds managed by affiliates of Searchlight, and Condor Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent Merger Sub ), pursuant to which, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company (the Merger with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of an affiliate of Searchlight. British Columbia Investment Management Corporation BCI and certain affiliates of Searchlight have committed to provide equity financing to Parent to fund the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Searchlight is currently the beneficial owner of approximately 33 of the Company s outstanding shares of common stock and is the holder of 100 of the Company s outstanding Series A perpetual preferred stock. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, upon the consummation of the Merger, each share of the Company s common stock, par value 0.01 per share (other than shares of the Company s common stock (i) held directly or indirectly by Parent, Merger Sub or any subsidiary of the Company, (ii) held by the Company as treasury shares or (iii) held by any person who properly exercises appraisal rights under Delaware law) will be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to 4.70 per share, without interest (the Merger Consideration ), subject to any withholding of taxes required by applicable law. In addition, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, upon the consummation of the Merger, (i) Company restricted share awards Company RSAs held by non-employee directors or by certain affiliates of Searchlight will vest and be canceled in exchange for the Merger Consideration and (ii) all other Company RSAs will be converted into restricted cash awards based on the Merger Consideration and subject to the same terms and conditions, including time- and performance-based vesting conditions, as the corresponding Company RSA (except that the relative total shareholder return modifier shall be deemed to be achieved at the target level). The Merger Agreement has, unanimously by the directors present, been approved by the board of directors of the Company (the Board ), acting upon the unanimous recommendation of a special committee consisting of only independent and disinterested directors of the Company (the Special Committee ). On January 31, 2024, the Company held a virtual special meeting of stockholders (the Special Meeting to consider three proposals with respect to the Merger Agreement. The first proposal, to adopt the Merger Agreement, was approved by (i) holders of a majority of the voting power represented by the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock that were entitled to vote thereon and (ii) holders of a majority of the voting power represented by the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock that were entitled to vote thereon and held by Unaffiliated Stockholders (as defined in the Merger Agreement). The second proposal, to approve by advisory (non-binding) vote the compensation that may be paid or become payable to the named executive officers of the Company in connection with the consummation of the Merger, was approved by the requisite vote of the

Table of Contents 
 Company s stockholders. The third proposal, to approve any adjournment of the Special Meeting, if necessary, to solicit additional proxies if there were insufficient votes in favor of the Merger Agreement proposal, was also approved by the requisite vote of the Company s stockholders. Because the Merger Agreement proposal was approved by the requisite vote, no adjournment to solicit additional proxies was necessary. The proposed transaction constitutes a going-private transaction under the rules of the SEC and is expected to close in late fourth quarter 2024 or early first quarter 2025. The closing of the Merger is subject to various conditions, including (i) the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods (and any extensions thereof) under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the HSR Act (ii) the receipt of certain required consents or approvals from (a) the Federal Communications Commission, (b) the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, (c) state public utility commissions and (d) local regulators in connection with the provision of telecommunications and media services; (iii) the absence of any order, injunction or decree restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting or making illegal the consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; and (iv) the accuracy of the representations and warranties contained in the Merger Agreement, subject to customary materiality qualifications, as of the date of the Merger Agreement and the date of closing, and performance in all material respects of the covenants and agreements contained in the Merger Agreement. The transaction is not subject to a financing condition. The waiting period under the HSR Act expired on May 9, 2024 at 11:59 p.m. This satisfied the closing condition related to the U.S. antitrust clearance of the transaction. We are awaiting the other required regulatory approvals in order to execute the Merger. Following the closing of the transaction, shares of our common stock will no longer be traded or listed on any public securities exchange. Additional information about the Merger Agreement and the Merger is set forth in the Company s Definitive Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A filed with the SEC on December 18, 2023, as supplemented. Divestiture On July 10, 2023, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our business located in the Washington market (the Washington operations ), for gross cash proceeds of approximately 73.0 million, subject to customary working capital adjustments and other post-closing purchase price adjustments. At December 31, 2023, the assets and liabilities to be sold were classified as assets held for sale in the condensed consolidated balance sheet. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, in connection with the expected sale, the carrying value of the net assets to be sold were reduced to their estimated fair value, which was determined based on the estimated selling price less costs to sell. As a result, we recognized an impairment loss of 77.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The sale of the Washington operations closed on May 1, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized an additional loss on the sale of 0.5 million, which is included in selling, general and administrative expense in the condensed consolidated statement of operations as a result of changes in estimated working capital adjustments and selling costs. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, operating revenues for the Washington operations were 5.0 million or 1.8 of total consolidated operating revenues. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, operating revenues for the Washington operations were 6.3 million or 0.8 and 15.1 million or 1.8 of total consolidated operating revenues, respectively.

As of September 30, 2024 2023 Change Change Consumer customers 494,660 498,198 (3,538) (1) Fiber Gig+ capable 249,656 175,748 73,908 42 DSL/Copper 149,864 210,473 (60,609) (29) Consumer data connections 399,520 386,221 13,299 3 Consumer voice connections 203,231 249,081 (45,850) (18) Video connections 26,158 (26,158) (100) Operating Revenues Consumer Broadband Services Broadband services include revenues from residential customers for subscriptions to our data and Voice over Internet Protocol VoIP products. We offer high-speed Internet access at speeds of up to 2 Gbps, depending on the network facilities that are available, the level of service selected and the location. Our fiber expansion plan is expected to provide fiber broadband revenue growth opportunities as we upgrade data speeds and expand our multi-Gig coverage across our network. Our VoIP digital phone service is also available in certain markets as an alternative to the traditional telephone line. Broadband services revenues increased 7.3 million and 29.3 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. The change in broadband services revenue was reduced in part by the sale of the Washington operations in 2024, which resulted in a decrease of broadband services revenues of 2.0 million and 3.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Broadband services revenue continued to increase primarily as a result of price increases and growth in fiber Internet services as fiber data connections continue to increase and offset the decline in copper data connections. Total consumer data connections increased 3 as of September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. In addition, a greater mix of our subscribers are shifting towards higher broadband speeds and electing to subscribe to our 1 Gig or higher product. Voice Services We offer several different basic local phone service packages and long-distance calling plans, including unlimited flat-rate calling plans. The plans include options for voicemail and other custom calling features such as caller ID, call forwarding and call waiting. Voice services revenues decreased 3.7 million and 11.0 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023 primarily due to a decline in access lines. In addition, the sale of our Washington operations in 2024 accounted for 0.8 million and 1.4 million of the decrease during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. The number of local access lines in service directly affects the recurring revenues we generate from end users and continues to be impacted by the industry-wide decline in access lines. We expect to continue to experience erosion in voice connections due to competition from alternative technologies.

 Video Services Depending on geographic market availability, our video services historically ranged from limited basic service to advanced digital television, which included several plans, each with hundreds of local, national and music channels including premium and Pay-Per-View channels as well as video On-Demand service. Certain customers could have also subscribed to our advanced video services, which consist of high-definition television, digital video recorders DVR and/or a whole home DVR. Our video subscribers could also watch their favorite shows, movies and livestreams on any device. In addition, we offered other on-demand streaming TV services, which provided endless entertainment options. In 2024, we commenced a scheduled decommissioning of video services across all our markets. Video services have been discontinued in all markets as of the end of July 2024 as part of our plan to simplify our product offerings and focus on our fiber-first strategy. Video services revenues decreased 8.5 million and 17.6 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023 primarily due to the planned discontinuance of video services in our markets and the transition of customers to streaming services offered through our streaming partnerships. Commercial Data Services We provide a variety of business communication services to business customers of all sizes, including voice and data services over our advanced fiber network. The services we offer include scalable high-speed broadband Internet access and VoIP phone services, which range from basic service plans to virtual hosted systems. In addition to Internet and VoIP services, we also offer a variety of commercial data connectivity services in select markets including Ethernet services; private line data services; software defined wide area network SD-WAN and multi-protocol label switching. Our networking services include point-to-point and multi-point deployments from 2.5 Mbps to 10 Gbps to accommodate the growth patterns of our business customers. We offer a suite of cloud-based services, which includes a hosted unified communications solution that replaces the customer s on-site phone systems and data networks, managed network security services and data protection services. Data center and disaster recovery solutions provide a reliable and local colocation option for commercial customers. Data services revenues increased 0.8 million and 3.7 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023 due to continued growth in dedicated Internet access and fiber Internet services, which was reduced in part by declines in Metro Ethernet and VoIP phone services as a result of customer churn. In recent years, the growth in data services revenues has been impacted by customer churn from increased competition and price compression as customers are migrating from legacy data connection products to more competitive products with a lower average revenue per user. Voice Services Voice services include basic local phone and long-distance service packages for business customers. The plans include options for voicemail, conference calling, linking multiple office locations and other custom calling features such as caller ID, call forwarding, speed dialing and call waiting. Services can be charged at a fixed monthly rate, a measured rate or can be bundled with selected services at a discounted rate. Voice services revenues decreased 0.3 million and 4.0 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023 primarily due to a decline in access lines as commercial customers are increasingly choosing alternative technologies and the broad range of features that Internet-based voice services can offer. Other Other services include business equipment sales and related hardware and maintenance support, video services, pole attachment fees and other miscellaneous revenues, including 911 service revenues. Other services revenues increased 0.1 million and decreased 2.7 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023 primarily due to a decline in custom construction and structured cabling revenues. Pole license

 attachment fees also decreased following the sale in 2023 of poles located in New Hampshire and video services decreased from the discontinuance of video services in our markets in 2024. However, these declines were offset in part by an increase in business equipment sales. Carrier Data and Transport Services We provide high-speed fiber data transmission services to regional and national interexchange and wireless carriers including Ethernet, cellular backhaul, dark fiber and colocation services. Data and transport services revenues decreased 1.0 million and 3.8 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023 due to a decrease in Ethernet services as a result of customer churn. Colocation and cellular backhaul revenue also declined from the same periods in 2023 as a result of a reduction in pricing of recent contract renewals with our wireless backhaul partners. We expect to recognize further declines in cellular backhaul revenue as a result of the new pricing in 2024. Voice Services We provide basic local phone service packages with customized features for resell by wholesale customers. The plans include options for voicemail, conference calling, linking multiple office locations and other custom calling features. Voice services revenues decreased 0.7 million and 1.9 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023 primarily as a result of customer churn for business data services. Subsidies Subsidies consist of both federal and state subsidies, which are designed to promote widely available, quality broadband services at affordable prices with higher data speeds in rural areas. Subsidies revenues decreased 1.0 million and 1.9 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023 primarily due to changes in state subsidies support and the sale of the Washington operations in May 2024. See the Regulatory Matters section below for a further discussion of the subsidies we receive. Network Access Services Network access services include interstate and intrastate switched access, network special access and end user access. Switched access revenues include access services to other communications carriers to terminate or originate long-distance calls on our network. Special access circuits provide dedicated lines and trunks to business customers and interexchange carriers. Network access services revenues increased 1.2 million and decreased 2.4 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. Special access revenues continue to be impacted by declines in minutes of use, voice connections and carrier circuits as carriers transition to Ethernet based transport solutions; however, the decline was reduced in part by price increases implemented during the three months ended September 30, 2024. End user access revenue increased 0.8 million and decreased 0.8 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as a result of quarterly changes in Federal and State Universal Service Fund USF contribution factors in 2024 as compared to 2023. Other Products and Services Other products and services include revenues from telephone directory publishing, video advertising, billing and support services and other miscellaneous revenues, including revenue from Public Private Partnerships PPP s ). We have entered into numerous PPP agreements with various towns in New Hampshire and Vermont to build new fiber to the premise FTTP Internet networks. The new town networks provide multi-gigabit broadband speeds to residential and commercial customers. PPP s are a key component of Consolidated s commitment to expand rural broadband access. Other products and services revenues decreased 6.7 million and 7.9 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023 primarily due to a decline in revenue from PPP construction projects. Directory advertising revenue also declined from the prior year periods.

 Operating Expenses Cost of Services and Products Cost of services and products decreased 19.2 million and 50.6 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. Video programming costs decreased as a result of a decline in video connections and the planned decommissioning of video services in 2024. Access expense also decreased from the prior year periods as a result of additional fiber costs for PPP construction agreements related to construction projects in 2023, as described above. Contract labor costs declined from savings in maintenance costs. Employee labor costs decreased as a result of a reduction in head count and the cost savings initiative plan implemented in 2023. Required contributions to the State USF decreased in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as a result of a reduction in the funding rates for Texas as compared to 2023. In addition, Federal USF contributions declined due to a one-time adjustment recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 for the final filings for 2023 as well as lower assessable revenues in 2024. Selling, General and Administrative Costs Selling, general and administrative costs increased 2.9 million and 16.3 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. Professional fees increased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 for various system enhancements, customer service improvements and strategic initiatives. However, the increase was reduced in part by an overall decline in severance costs incurred in 2024 and 2023. During each of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we initiated a business simplification and cost savings initiative plan intended to further align our company as a fiber-first provider, improve operating efficiencies, lower our cost structure and ultimately improve the overall customer experience. In connection with the cost savings initiative plans and reduction in workforce, we recognized severance costs of 10.4 million and 16.2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 15.2 million and 19.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Transaction Costs Transaction costs of 0.6 million and 1.1 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 6.7 million and 2.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, consist primarily of legal and other professional fees incurred in connection with the Merger Agreement entered into with Searchlight in October 2023. Loss on Disposal of Assets During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized an additional loss of 2.6 million and 4.7 million, respectively, on the sale of substantially all of the assets of our Kansas City operations as a result of purchase price adjustments and working capital changes. We also recognized a loss of 0.5 million and 4.1 million related to the sale of certain utility poles during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. In addition, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized a loss of 3.6 million on the disposal of certain equipment and inventory. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expense decreased 2.9 million and increased 0.3 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023 primarily due to ongoing capital expenditures related to the fiber network expansion and customer service improvements as well as success-based capital projects for consumer and commercial services. However, depreciation expense declined during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to certain assets becoming fully depreciated. Amortization expense also declined during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 for customer relationships, which are amortized under the accelerated method.

 Regulatory Matters Our revenues are subject to broad federal and/or state regulations, which include such telecommunications services as local telephone service, network access service and toll service. The telecommunications industry is subject to extensive federal, state and local regulation. Under the Telecommunications Act of 1996, federal and state regulators share responsibility for implementing and enforcing statutes and regulations designed to encourage competition and to preserve and advance widely available, quality telephone service at affordable prices. At the federal level, the FCC generally exercises jurisdiction over facilities and services of local exchange carriers, such as our rural telephone companies, to the extent they are used to provide, originate or terminate interstate or international communications. The FCC has the authority to condition, modify, cancel, terminate or revoke our operating authority for failure to comply with applicable federal laws or FCC rules, regulations and policies. Fines or penalties also may be imposed for any of these violations. State regulatory commissions generally exercise jurisdiction over carriers facilities and services to the extent they are used to provide, originate or terminate intrastate communications. In particular, state regulatory agencies have substantial oversight over interconnection and network access by competitors of our rural telephone companies. In addition, municipalities and other local government agencies regulate the public rights-of-way necessary to install and operate networks. State regulators can sanction our rural telephone companies or revoke our certifications if we violate relevant laws or regulations. FCC Matters In general, telecommunications service in rural areas is costlier to provide than service in urban areas. The lower customer density means that switching and other facilities serve fewer customers and loops are typically longer, requiring greater expenditures per customer to build and maintain. By supporting the high-cost of operations in rural markets, USF subsidies promote widely available, quality telephone service at affordable prices in rural areas. In April 2019, the FCC announced plans for the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund RDOF ), the next phase of the Connect America Fund CAF program. The RDOF is a 20.4 billion fund to bring speeds of 25 Mbps downstream and 3 Mbps upstream to unserved and underserved areas of America. The FCC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking at their August 2019 Open Commission Meeting. The order prioritizes terrestrial broadband as a bridge to rural 5G networks by providing a significant weight advantage to traditional broadband providers. Funding will occur in two phases with the first phase auctioning 16.0 billion and the second phase auctioning 4.4 billion, each to be distributed over 10 years. The minimum speed required to receive funding is 25 Mbps downstream and 3 Mbps upstream. Consolidated won 246 census block groups serving in seven states in the 2020 auction. The bids we won are at the 1 Gbps downstream and 500 Mbps upstream speed tier to approximately 27,000 locations at an annual funding level of 5.9 million as of January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2031. Consolidated began receiving RDOF funding in January 2022. American Rescue Plan Act Funding President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 ARPA on March 11, 2021. States have been allocated federal funds to be utilized for capital infrastructure, including broadband deployment, and are in various stages of implementation. We are working with the states and municipalities to participate in this broadband grant program. In January 2023, we were awarded 9.2 million in funding from ARPA to build to approximately 14,000 unserved homes in Skowhegan and Greater East Grand Bay, Maine and in February 2023, we were awarded 40.0 million in funding from ARPA to build nearly 25,000 unserved homes throughout New Hampshire. Construction began for both projects in 2023 and is expected to be largely completed by the end of 2024. The grants will be accounted for as a contribution in aid of construction given the nature of the arrangement. Affordable Connectivity Program The Affordable Connectivity Program ACP is a broadband affordability program set up to help ensure that households can afford the broadband access they need for work, school, healthcare and more. The benefit provides a discount of up to 

 33 

Table of Contents 
 30 per month toward internet service for eligible households and up to 75 per month for households on qualifying Tribal lands. Eligible households can also receive a one-time discount of up to 100 to purchase a laptop, desktop computer, or tablet from participating providers if they contribute more than 10 and less than 50 toward the purchase price. The ACP is limited to one monthly service discount and one device discount per household. The program began distributing funds on March 1, 2022. Due to the expected lapse in the initial funding for the ACP in the second quarter of 2024, the ACP stopped accepting new applications and enrollments on February 7, 2024. The last fully funded month of the program was April 2024. Consolidated participated in this program and had approximately 8,300 ACP customers prior to the termination of the program. Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act Infrastructure Act ), signed on November 15, 2021, included 65.0 billion to support broadband infrastructure deployment and access across the United States with an aim to extend high-speed broadband connectivity to unserved rural, low-income, and tribal communities, as well as to promote broadband affordability and digital literacy. Among other broadband-related initiatives, the Infrastructure Act allocated 42.5 billion for the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment BEAD program, which is administered by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration NTIA ). The NTIA has begun distributing BEAD program funding to states, which, in turn, will award BEAD program grants to ISPs to support broadband deployment and access initiatives. The precise terms under which BEAD program grants will be awarded to ISPs are expected to vary from state to state and are not known at this time. Apart from the broadband funding initiatives in the Infrastructure Act, Congress directed the FCC to adopt rules prohibiting digital discrimination of access, and the FCC in turn issued an order in November 2023 defining that term broadly. In particular, the FCC prohibited any policy or practice by ISPs, among other covered entities, that intentionally discriminates or has a disparate impact based on race, income level, and other prohibited classifications. The FCC indicated that it intends to take enforcement action based on any finding of digital discrimination unless the ISP can show that the policy or practice in question was justified based on economic or technical feasibility. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and several groups representing ISPs filed petitions for review challenging the FCC s order, and the petitions have been consolidated in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. At this time, we cannot determine the likely impacts of the FCC s order or the outcome of the pending appeal. Other Regulatory Matters We are also subject to a number of regulatory proceedings occurring at the federal and state levels that may have a material impact on our operations. The FCC and state commissions have authority to conduct audits and issue and interpret rules and regulations related to our business and federal courts have the authority to interpret the constitutionality of regulatory programs that impact our business. A number of proceedings and findings are pending or anticipated that are related to such telecommunications issues as competition, interconnection, access charges, ICC, broadband deployment, rural subsidy programs, consumer protection and universal service reform. Some proceedings may authorize new services to compete with our existing services. Proceedings that relate to our cable television operations include rulemakings on set top boxes, carriage of programming, industry consolidation and ways to promote additional competition. There are various on-going legal challenges to the scope or validity of FCC orders that have been issued. As a result, it is not yet possible to fully determine the impact of the related FCC rules and regulations on our operations. Non-Operating Items Interest Expense, Net Interest expense, net of interest income, increased 5.3 million and 21.1 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023 primarily due to additional interest on borrowings from the revolving credit facility as a result of outstanding borrowings of 200.0 million as of September 30, 2024 and an increase in variable interest rates on our outstanding term loan during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Interest expense also increased from a decline in interest income of 3.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to additional cash equivalents and short-term investments in 2023. 

 34 

Table of Contents 
 Other Income Other income decreased 3.4 million and 9.7 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023 primarily due to a decline in investment income of 1.8 million and 4.2 million, respectively, as a result of earnings from short-term investments in 2023. Pension and post-retirement expense increased 1.2 million and 3.6 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. See Note 13 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion regarding our pension and post-retirement plans. Income Taxes Income tax benefit increased 3.6 million and decreased 4.7 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. Our effective tax rate was 22.1 and 15.0 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively and 20.7 and 16.8 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. On July 10, 2023, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our Washington operations and the transaction closed on May 1, 2024. As a result, we recorded an increase to our current tax expense of 2.4 million and 8.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and 3.6 million and 17.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, related to the write-down of noncash goodwill included in the transaction that is not deductible for tax purposes. The Company does not consider this sales transaction and related goodwill adjustments unusual or infrequent and therefore the corresponding tax impact is recorded through continuing operations. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded 4.4 million of tax expense to adjust our 2022 provision to match our 2022 returns. Exclusive of these adjustments, our effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 would have been approximately 25.8 and 26.0 , respectively and approximately 25.5 and 25.6 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. In addition, the effective tax rate differed from the federal and state statutory rates due to various permanent income tax differences. Non-GAAP Measures In addition to the results reported in accordance with US GAAP, we also use certain non-GAAP measures such as EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate operating performance and to facilitate the comparison of our historical results and trends. These financial measures are not measures of financial performance under US GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income (loss) as a measure of performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of liquidity. They are not, on their own, necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs as determined in accordance with GAAP. The calculation of these non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable financial measures presented in accordance with GAAP are provided below. EBITDA is defined as net earnings before interest expense, income taxes and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is comprised of EBITDA, adjusted for certain items as permitted or required under our credit facility as described in the reconciliations below. These measures are a common measure of operating performance in the telecommunications industry and we believe they are useful, with other data, as a means to evaluate our ability to fund our estimated uses of cash.

Liquidity and Capital Resources Outlook and Overview Our operating requirements have historically been funded from cash flows generated from our business and borrowings under our credit facilities. We expect that our future operating requirements will continue to be funded from cash flows from operating activities, existing cash and cash equivalents, proceeds from sales of nonstrategic assets and borrowings under our revolving credit facility or other funding arrangements and our ability to obtain future external financing. We anticipate that we will continue to use a substantial portion of our cash flow to fund capital expenditures for our accelerated fiber network expansion and growth plan. The following table summarizes our cash flows: 

Nine Months Ended September 30, (In thousands) 2024 2023 Cash flows provided by (used in): Operating activities 36,103 102,593 Investing activities (221,798) (326,485) Financing activities 225,328 (12,343) Change in cash and cash equivalents 39,633 (236,235) Cash Flows Provided by Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was 36.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 66.5 million compared to the same period in 2023. Cash flows provided by operating activities decreased primarily due to a decline in accounts payable and accrued expense related to the timing of expenditures. Cash flows provided by operating activities also declined related to the timing of cash receipts for special projects and grant funding. Cash paid for interest also increased 13.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023.

 Cash Flows Used In Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities was 221.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and consisted primarily of cash used for capital expenditures and proceeds received from the sale of assets and investments. Capital expenditures continue to be our primary recurring investing activity and were 290.3 million and 424.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Capital expenditures for 2024 are expected to be used for our planned fiber projects and broadband network expansion, including the upgrade in 2024 of approximately 150,000 fiber passings, and to support success-based capital projects for commercial, carrier and consumer initiatives. We expect to continue to invest in the enhancement and expansion of our fiber network in order to retain and acquire more customers through a broader set of products and an expanded network footprint. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we completed the sale of all of the issued and outstanding stock of our Washington operations for cash proceeds, net of selling costs, of 67.8 million. Cash Flows Used In Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities consists primarily of our proceeds from and principal payments on long-term borrowings. Long-term Debt Credit Agreement On October 2, 2020, the Company, through certain of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, entered into a Credit Agreement with various financial institutions (as amended, the Credit Agreement to replace the Company s previous credit agreement in its entirety. The Credit Agreement consisted of term loans in an original aggregate amount of 1,250.0 million (the Term Loans and a revolving loan facility of 250.0 million. The Credit Agreement also includes an incremental loan facility which provides the ability to borrow, subject to certain terms and conditions, incremental loans in an aggregate amount of up to the greater of (a) 300.0 million plus (b) an amount which would not cause its senior secured leverage ratio not to exceed 3.70:1.00 (the Incremental Facility ). Borrowings under the Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions. The Term Loans have a maturity date of October 2, 2027 and bear interest at a rate of 3.50 plus Secured Overnight Borrowing Rate SOFR (subject to a 0.75 SOFR floor) plus a SOFR adjustment. As part of the replacement to SOFR-benchmark rates in 2023, borrowings will include an adjustment of 0.11 , 0.26 and 0.43 for borrowings of one, three and six month loans, respectively. On March 18, 2021, the Company repaid 397.0 million of the then outstanding Term Loans with the net proceeds received from the issuance of 400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.00 senior secured notes due 2028 (the 5.00 Senior Notes ), as described below. The repayment of the Term Loans was applied to the remaining principal payments in direct order of maturity, thereby eliminating the required quarterly principal payments through the remaining term of the loan. The revolving credit facility has a maturity date of October 2, 2027 (subject to springing maturity on April 2, 2027 if the Term Loans, as of April 1, 2027, are scheduled to mature earlier than March 31, 2028) and an applicable margin (at our election) of 4.00 for SOFR-based borrowings or 3.00 for alternate base rate borrowings, with a 0.25 reduction in each case if the consolidated first lien leverage ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement, does not exceed 3.20 to 1.00. As of September 30, 2024, borrowings of 200.0 million were outstanding under our revolving credit facility. At December 31, 2023, there were no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility. Stand-by letters of credit of 46.7 million were outstanding under our revolving credit facility as of September 30, 2024. The stand-by letters of credit are renewable annually and reduce the borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility. As of September 30, 2024, 3.3 million was available for borrowing under the revolving credit facility, subject to certain covenants. As of November 5, 2024, borrowings of 212.0 million and stand-by letters of credit of 35.4 million were outstanding under our revolving credit facility.

Table of Contents 
 The weighted-average interest rate on outstanding borrowings under our credit facility was 8.89 and 8.96 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Interest is payable at least quarterly. Credit Agreement Covenant Compliance The Credit Agreement contains various provisions and covenants, including, among other items, restrictions on the ability to pay dividends, incur additional indebtedness, and issue certain capital stock. We have agreed to maintain certain financial ratios, including a maximum consolidated first lien leverage ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement. Among other things, it will be an event of default, with respect to the revolving credit facility only, if our consolidated first lien leverage ratio is greater than 7.75:1.00 as of the end of any fiscal quarter, if on such date the testing threshold is met. The testing threshold is met if the aggregate amount of our borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility exceeds 35 . As of September 30, 2024, the testing threshold was met and our consolidated first lien leverage ratio under the Credit Agreement was below 7.75:1.00. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with the Credit Agreement covenants. On October 15, 2023, the Company entered into Amendment No. 5 to the Credit Agreement (the Fifth Amendment to, among other things, increase the maximum consolidated first lien leverage ratio (the Step-Up permitted under the Credit Agreement to (i) 7.75 to 1.00, from October 15, 2023 to and including December 31, 2024, (ii) 7.50 to 1.00, from and including January 1, 2025 to and including March 31, 2025, (iii) 7.25 to 1.00, from and including April 1, 2025 to and including June 30, 2025, (iv) 7.00 to 1.00, from and including July 1, 2025 to and including September 30, 2025, (v) 6.75 to 1.00 from and including October 1, 2025 to and including December 31, 2025, (vi) 6.50 to 1.00, from and including January 1, 2026 to and including March 31, 2026, (vii) 6.25 to 1.00, from and including April 1, 2026 to and including June 30, 2026, (viii) 6.00 to 1.00, from and including July 1, 2026 to and including September 30, 2026, and (ix) 5.85 to 1.00 from and including October 1, 2026 and thereafter (the Step-Up Period ). While the Step-Up is in effect, the Company will be subject to additional restrictions on its ability to make certain investments and restricted payments (the Restrictions ). The Step-Up Period and the Restrictions will end and the maximum Consolidated First Lien Leverage Ratio will revert to the levels set forth in the Credit Agreement on the earlier of (a) the Company s election and (b) August 1, 2025, to the extent 300.0 million in cash proceeds have not been received by the Company from equity contributed to its capital by such date. If the proposed Merger is not completed by August 1, 2025, the increase in the maximum consolidated first lien leverage ratio as permitted in the Fifth Amendment to the Credit Agreement to provide interim financial covenant relief will end and the maximum consolidated first lien leverage ratio will revert to 5.85 to 1.00. Fiber Broadband Term Loans On August 28, 2024 and October 7, 2024, the Company entered into loan agreements (the Loan Agreements ), pursuant to which the Company may borrow up to an aggregate amount of 80.0 million and 60.0 million, respectively, in delayed draw term loans to fund further development and construction of fiber infrastructure. Outstanding borrowings under the Loan Agreements will bear interest at a fixed rate of 6.50 per annum, payable semi-annually. The term of the loans is four years from the initial advance with an option to extend the maturity by two one-year periods, subject to certain terms and conditions. The borrowings are senior secured obligations of the Company and the Loan Agreements contain negative covenants substantively similar to the existing Credit Agreement and other covenants customary for facilities of this type. As of September 30, 2024, borrowings of 43.8 million were outstanding under the Loan Agreement entered into on August 28, 2024. As of November 5, 2024, borrowings of 51.8 million and 5.6 million were outstanding under the Loan Agreements entered into on August 28, 2024 and October 7, 2024, respectively. Searchlight Term Loan On March 21, 2024, the Company, through certain of its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and Searchlight, as lender entered into a Term Loan Agreement (the Searchlight Loan Agreement ), which consists of delayed draw term loans in the aggregate amount of 80.0 million (the Loan ). The Searchlight Loan Agreement provides us with the ability to borrow on the Loan in the event either (a) the aggregate amount of available loans to be drawn under the revolving credit facility is less than 25.0 million or (b) drawing under the revolving credit facility would trigger the financial maintenance covenant thereunder and we would not be in compliance with such covenant on a pro forma basis, in each case subject to the satisfaction of certain other customary conditions.

Table of Contents 
 In the event the Loan is ever drawn, we intend to apply the proceeds from the Loan to directly or indirectly fund capital expenditures for our fiber broadband expansion plan. The Searchlight Loan Agreement is unsecured and the Loan will mature on April 2, 2027. Drawn amounts on the Loan bear interest at a rate per annum equal to an applicable rate ranging from 12.0 per annum, which applies prior to the date that is 18 months after the initial borrowing date (unless the Merger Agreement is terminated pursuant to the Company s breach thereof), to the amount required for Searchlight to realize a multiple on invested capital of 1.75x on the Loan, which applies on and after the earlier of (i) the date that the Merger Agreement is terminated pursuant to the Company s breach thereof and (ii) the date that is 18 months after the initial borrowing date. The Searchlight Loan Agreement contains various affirmative, negative, and financial covenants consistent with the Company s existing credit agreement. The Loan Agreement requires, in the event the Merger Agreement is terminated and any amounts in respect of the Loan remain outstanding, for the Company to maintain a maximum consolidated first lien leverage ratio. The Searchlight Loan Agreement also contains customary events of default, including, but not limited to, nonpayment, material inaccuracy of representations and warranties, violations of covenants, nonpayment of other material debts, certain bankruptcy and liquidations, certain material judgments, and certain events related to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended. Senior Notes On October 2, 2020, we completed an offering of 750.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.50 unsubordinated secured notes due 2028 (the 6.50 Senior Notes ). The 6.50 Senior Notes were priced at par and bear interest at a rate of 6.50 , payable semi-annually on April 1 and October 1 of each year. The 6.50 Senior Notes mature on October 1, 2028. On March 18, 2021, we issued 400.0 million aggregate principal amount 5.00 Senior Notes, together with the 6.50 Senior Notes (the Senior Notes ). The 5.00 Senior Notes were priced at par and bear interest at a rate of 5.00 per year, payable semi-annually on April 1 and October 1 of each year. The 5.00 Senior Notes mature on October 1, 2028. The net proceeds from the issuance of the 5.00 Senior Notes were used to repay 397.0 million of the Term Loans outstanding under the Credit Agreement. The Senior Notes are unsubordinated secured obligations of the Company, secured by a first priority lien on the collateral that secures the Company s obligations under the Credit Agreement. The Senior Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a first priority secured basis by the Company and the majority of our wholly-owned subsidiaries. The offerings of the Senior Notes have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended or any state securities laws. Senior Notes Covenant Compliance Subject to certain exceptions and qualifications, the indentures governing the Senior Notes contain customary covenants that, among other things, limits the Company and its restricted subsidiaries ability to: incur additional debt or issue certain preferred stock; pay dividends or make other distributions on capital stock or prepay subordinated indebtedness; purchase or redeem any equity interests; make investments; create liens; sell assets; enter into agreements that restrict dividends or other payments by restricted subsidiaries; consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of its assets; engage in transactions with its affiliates; or enter into any sale and leaseback transactions. The indentures also contain customary events of default. As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all terms, conditions and covenants under the indentures governing the Senior Notes. Finance Leases We lease certain facilities and equipment under various finance leases which expire between 2024 and 2040. As of September 30, 2024, the present value of the minimum remaining lease commitments was approximately 40.4 million, of which 20.6 million was due and payable within the next twelve months. The leases require total remaining rental payments of 45.6 million as of September 30, 2024.

 Sufficiency of Cash Resources The following table sets forth selected information regarding our financial condition. 

September 30, December 31, (In thousands, except for ratio) 2024 2023 Cash and cash equivalents 44,398 4,765 Working capital (deficit) (79,268) (61,090) Current ratio 0.76 0.81 Our net working capital deficit increased 18.2 million as of September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023. Working capital at December 31, 2023, included net assets classified as held for sale of 67.1 million related to the pending sale of the Washington operations, which was completed in the second quarter of 2024. The proceeds from the sale were used in part to fund capital expenditures for the fiber build plan in 2024. An increase in accrued interest reduced working capital 18.1 million at September 30, 2024 related to the timing of the semi-annual interest payments for our Senior Notes. Accounts payable also increased 9.3 million related to the timing of expenditures. However, cash and cash equivalents increased 40.0 million primarily from the borrowings under the Broadband Loan Agreements during the quarter ended September 30, 2024. The working capital deficit was also reduced by a decline in accrued expense of 23.5 million and an increase in accounts receivable of 18.1 million related to the timing of cash receipts for special projects and grant funding. Our most significant use of funds for the remainder of 2024 is expected to be for capital expenditures and interest payments on our indebtedness. We have historically funded certain core network capacity equipment with finance leases and it remains our intent to continue such arrangements with our leasing partners. In the event we are unable to secure such financing, we may be required to make cash expenditures for this capital. The refinancing of our capital structure in recent years, including the Fifth Amendment to our Credit Agreement described above, availability as of September 30, 2024 of approximately 96.2 million and 80.0 million undrawn under the Loan Agreements and the Searchlight Loan Agreement, respectively, provides us with near-term financial and operational flexibility. In the future, our ability to use cash may be limited by our other expected uses of cash and our ability to incur additional debt will be limited by our existing and future debt agreements. We believe that cash flows from operating activities, together with our existing cash and borrowings available under our financing arrangements, will be sufficient for at least the next twelve months to fund our current anticipated uses of cash. After that, our ability to fund expected uses of cash and to comply with the financial covenants under our debt agreements will depend on the results of future operations, performance, cash flow and potential additional divestitures of non-core assets. Our ability to fund expected uses from the results of future operations will be subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business, regulatory, legislative and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. To the extent that our business plans or projections change or prove to be inaccurate, we may require additional financing or require financing sooner than we currently anticipate. Sources of additional financing may include commercial bank borrowings, other strategic debt financing, sales of nonstrategic assets, vendor financing or the private or public sales of equity and debt securities. There can be no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future, that anticipated revenue growth will be realized or that future borrowings or equity issuances will be available in amounts sufficient to provide adequate sources of cash to fund our expected uses of cash. Failure to obtain adequate financing, if necessary, could require us to significantly reduce our operations or level of capital expenditures which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and the results of operations. We may be unable to access the cash flows of our subsidiaries since certain of our subsidiaries are parties to credit or other borrowing agreements, or are subject to statutory or regulatory restrictions, that restrict the payment of dividends or making intercompany loans and investments, and those subsidiaries are likely to continue to be subject to such restrictions and prohibitions for the foreseeable future. In addition, future agreements that our subsidiaries may enter into governing the terms of indebtedness may restrict our subsidiaries ability to pay dividends or advance cash in any other manner to us.

 Surety Bonds In the ordinary course of business, we enter into surety, performance and similar bonds as required by certain jurisdictions in which we provide services. As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 45.7 million of these bonds outstanding. Defined Benefit Pension Plans As required, we contribute to qualified defined pension plans and non-qualified supplemental retirement plans (collectively the Pension Plans and other post-retirement benefit plans, which provide retirement benefits to certain eligible employees as described in the Note 13 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this report in Part I Item 1 Financial Statements . Contributions are intended to provide for benefits attributed to service to date. Our funding policy is to contribute annually an actuarially determined amount consistent with applicable federal income tax regulations. The cost to maintain our Pension Plans and future funding requirements are affected by several factors including the expected return on investment of the assets held by the Pension Plans, changes in the discount rate used to calculate pension expense and the amortization of unrecognized gains and losses. Returns generated on the Pension Plans assets have historically funded a significant portion of the benefits paid under the Pension Plans. We estimate the long-term rate of return on assets will be 6.50 . The Pension Plans invest in marketable equity securities which are exposed to changes in the financial markets. If the financial markets experience a sustained downturn and returns fall below our estimate, we could be required to make material contributions to the Pension Plans, which could adversely affect our cash flows from operations. Our contribution amounts meet the minimum funding requirements as set forth in employee benefit and tax laws. We elected to participate in ARPA beginning with the 2021 plan year. ARPA, which was signed into law in March 2021, included changes to the employer funding requirements and is designed to reduce the amounts of required contributions as a relief. During 2021 and the six months ended June 30, 2022, we elected to fund our pension contributions at the pre-ARPA levels, which has created a pre-funded balance. We intend to use our current pre-funded balance to satisfy the minimum contribution requirements until the balance is exhausted, which is expected to occur in late 2024. We expect that for 2024, contributions to our Pension Plans will be approximately 0.2 million. As of September 30, 2024, we have contributed 5.0 million to our other post-retirement benefit plans, and expect to make contributions to our other post-retirement benefit plans totaling approximately 0.7 million during the remainder of 2024. Income Taxes The timing of cash payments for income taxes, which is governed by the Internal Revenue Service and other taxing jurisdictions, will differ from the timing of recording tax expense and deferred income taxes, which are reported in accordance with GAAP. For example, tax laws in effect regarding accelerated or bonus depreciation for tax reporting resulted in less cash payments than the GAAP tax expense. Acceleration of tax deductions could eventually result in situations where cash payments will exceed GAAP tax expense. Critical Accounting Estimates Our condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with US GAAP. Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management s application of accounting policies. Our judgments are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making estimates about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. For a full discussion of our accounting estimates and assumptions that we have identified as critical in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements, refer to Critical Accounting Estimates in Part II, Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our 2023 Form 10-K filed with the SEC.

 Recent Accounting Pronouncements For information regarding the impact of certain recent accounting pronouncements, see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this report in Part I - Item 1 Financial Statements . ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Our exposure to market risk is primarily related to the impact of interest rate fluctuations on our debt obligations. Market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market interest rates on our variable rate obligations. In order to manage the volatility relating to changes in interest rates, we utilize derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps to maintain a mix of fixed and variable rate debt. We do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. Our interest rate swap agreements effectively convert a portion of our floating-rate debt to a fixed-rate basis, thereby reducing the impact of interest rate changes on future cash interest payments. We calculate the potential change in interest expense caused by changes in market interest rates by determining the effect of the hypothetical rate increase on the portion of our variable rate debt that is not subject to a variable rate floor or hedged through the interest rate swap agreements. Based on our variable rate debt outstanding as of September 30, 2024, a 1.00 change in market interest rates would increase or decrease annual interest expense by approximately 7.0 million. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Limitations on Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Exchange Act that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures In connection with the filing of this Form 10-Q, management evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the design to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based upon that evaluation and subject to the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2024. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Based upon the evaluation performed by our management, which was conducted with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting required by Rules 13a-15(d) under the Exchange Act during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS From time to time we may be involved in litigation that we believe is of the type common to companies in our industry, including regulatory issues. While the outcome of these claims cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that the outcome of any of these legal matters will have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. See Note 15 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this report in Part I - Item 1 Financial Statements for a discussion of recent developments related to these legal proceedings. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Investing in our common stock involves a level of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described under the heading Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A. of our 2023 Form 10-K, the other information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes, as well as our other public filings with the SEC, before deciding to invest in our common stock. There have been no material changes to the Company s risk factors previously disclosed in our 2023 Form 10-K. The occurrence of any of the events described therein could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or prospects. In such an event, the market price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. ITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION Insider Trading Arrangements and Policies During the three months ended September 30, 2024, no director or officer of the Company adopted or terminated a Rule 10 b5-1 trading arrangement or non-Rule 10 b5-1 trading arrangement, as each term is defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K.
