 hotels with guest rooms. Our hotels are concentrated in major urban markets and in destination resort locations and more than of our hotels are operated under a brand owned by one of the leading global lodging brand companies (Marriott International, Inc., Hilton Worldwide, or IHG Hotels Resorts). We are an owner, as opposed to an operator, of the hotels in our portfolio. As an owner, we receive all of the operating profits or losses generated by our hotels after we pay fees to the hotel managers and hotel brands, which are based on the revenues and profitability of the hotels. 
 
 We are a real estate investment trust REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. We conduct our business through a traditional umbrella partnership real estate investment trust, or UPREIT, in which our hotel properties are owned by our operating partnership, DiamondRock Hospitality Limited Partnership, or subsidiaries of our operating partnership. The Company is the sole general partner of our operating partnership and owned of the limited partnership units common OP units of our operating partnership as of September 30, 2024.

 Mortgage Debt 
 
 We have incurred limited recourse, property specific mortgage debt secured by certain of our hotels.

As of September 30, 2024, of our hotels were secured by mortgage debt. On August 6, 2024, we paid off million outstanding on the Courtyard New York Manhattan/Midtown East mortgage loan using cash on hand. We intend to refinance the other mortgage loans that mature in 2025 as they approach their respective maturity dates. In the case that refinancing options are not attractive, we may repay such mortgage loans using our senior unsecured revolving credit facility.

 The fair value of our interest rate swaps is a Level 2 measurement under the fair value hierarchy. We estimate the fair value of the interest rate swaps based on the interest rate yield curve and implied market volatility as inputs and adjusted for the counterparty's credit risk. We concluded the inputs for the credit risk valuation adjustment are Level 3 inputs; however these inputs are not significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.

 million shares of common stock, par value per share. Each outstanding share of common stock entitles the holder to vote on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders. Holders of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends out of assets legally available for the payment of dividends when authorized by our board of directors. 
 
 In August 2024, our board of directors approved an at-the-market equity offering program (the Current ATM Program ), pursuant to which we may issue and sell shares of our common stock from time to time, having an aggregate offering price of up to million. Prior to the establishment of the Current ATM Program, we had a million ATM program (the Prior ATM Program ), which is no longer active. No shares were sold under either the Prior ATM Program or the Current ATM Program during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 In May 2024, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of our common stock under a new share repurchase program, which replaced our prior share repurchase program that was authorized in September 2022. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including price and general business and market conditions. The new share repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of shares, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time at our discretion. The new share repurchase program will expire on May 1, 2026. As of September 30, 2024, we have repurchased shares of common stock at an average price of per share for a total purchase price of million under this program. As of November 8, 2024, we have million of authorized capacity remaining under the new share repurchase program. All share repurchases during the year were made under the new share repurchase program. 
 
 Preferred Shares 
 
 We are authorized by our charter to issue up to million shares of preferred stock, par value per share. Our board of directors is required to set for each class or series of preferred stock the terms, preferences, conversion or other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to dividends or other distributions, qualifications, and terms or conditions of redemption. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were shares of Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock Series A Preferred Stock issued and outstanding with a liquidation preference each of per share. On or after August 31, 2025, the Series A Preferred Stock will be redeemable at the Company's option, in whole or in

per share, plus accrued and unpaid dividends up to, but not including, the redemption date. 
 
 Operating Partnership Units 
 
 In connection with our acquisition of Cavallo Point in December 2018, we issued common OP units to third parties, otherwise unaffiliated with the Company, then valued at per unit. Each common OP unit is redeemable at the option of the holder. Holders of common OP units have certain redemption rights, which enable them to cause our operating partnership to redeem their units in exchange for cash per unit equal to the market price of our common stock, at the time of redemption, or, at our option, for shares of our common stock on a -for-one basis, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of stock splits, mergers, consolidations or similar pro-rata share transactions. 
 
 Long-Term Incentive Partnership units LTIP units ), which are also referred to as profits interest units, may be issued to eligible participants under the 2024 Equity Incentive Plan for the performance of services to or for the benefit of our operating partnership. LTIP units are a class of partnership unit in our operating partnership and will receive, whether vested or not, the same per-unit distributions as the outstanding common OP units, which equal per-share dividends on shares of our common stock. Initially, LTIP units have a capital account balance of zero, do not receive an allocation of operating income (loss), and do not have full parity with common OP units with respect to liquidating distributions. If such parity is reached, vested LTIP units are converted into an equal number of common OP units, and thereafter will possess all of the rights and interests of common OP units, including the right to exchange the common OP units for cash per unit equal to the market price of our common stock, at the time of redemption, or, at our option, for shares of our common stock on a -for-one basis, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of stock splits, mergers, consolidations or similar pro-rata share transactions. See Note 8 for additional disclosures related to LTIP units. 
 
 There were and common OP units held by unaffiliated third parties and executive officers of the Company as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. There were and unvested LTIP units outstanding as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

 For each of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we paid an aggregate cash dividend of per share or unit to holders of our common stock, common OP units, and LTIP units. 
 
 For each of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we paid an aggregate cash dividend of per share to holders of our Series A Preferred Stock.

 shares of our common stock, of which we have issued or committed to issue share s as of September 30, 2024. Shares underlying awards that are granted under the 2024 Plan that are forfeited, cancelled, reacquired prior to vesting, satisfied without the issuance of stock or otherwise terminated (other than be exercise), including shares tendered or held back upon settlement of an award, other than a stock option or stock appreciation right, to cover the tax withholding will be added back to the shares available for issuance under the 2024 Plan. 
 
 Restricted Stock Awards 
 
 Restricted stock awards issued to our officers and employees generally vest over a three to period from the date of grant based on continued employment. We measure compensation expense for the restricted stock awards based upon the fair market value of our common stock at the date of grant. Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period and is included in corporate expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. 
 -13- 

Table of Contents 

Granted Vested ) Unvested balance at September 30, 2024 
 
 The total unvested restricted stock awards as of September 30, 2024 are expected to vest as follows: shares during 2025, shares during 2026, shares during 2027, shares during 2028, and shares during 2029. As of September 30, 2024, the unrecognized compensation cost related to restricted stock awards was million and the weighted-average period over which the unrecognized compensation expense will be recorded is approximately months. We recorded million and million of compensation expense related to restricted stock awards for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We recorded million and million of compensation expense related to restricted stock awards for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which included million of accelerated compensation expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, related to restricted stock awards for the departures of our former Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment Officer. The accelerated compensation expense is recorded as severance costs in corporate expenses within the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. 
 
 Performance Stock Units 
 
 Performance stock units PSUs are restricted stock units that vest three or from the date of grant. Each executive officer is granted a target number of PSUs (the PSU Target Award ). The actual number of shares of common stock issued to each executive officer is based on the Company's achievement of certain performance targets. Under this framework, of the PSUs are based on relative total stockholder return and on hotel market share improvement. The achievement of certain levels of total stockholder return relative to the total stockholder return of a peer group of publicly-traded lodging REITs is measured over a performance period. There is no payout of shares of our common stock if our total stockholder return falls below the th percentile of the total stockholder returns of the peer group. The maximum number of shares of common stock issued to an executive officer is equal to of the PSU Target Award and is earned if our total stockholder return is equal to or greater than the th percentile of the total stockholder returns of the peer group. There are limitations on the number of PSUs earned if the Company's total stockholder return is negative for the performance period. The improvement in market share for each of our hotels is generally measured over a performance period based on a report prepared for each hotel by STR Global, a well-recognized benchmarking service for the hospitality industry. There is no payout of shares of our common stock if the percentage of our hotels with market share improvements is less than . The maximum number of shares of common stock issued to an executive officer is equal to of the PSU Target Award and is earned if the percentage of our hotels with market share improvements is greater than or equal to . 
 
 We measure compensation expense for the PSUs based upon the fair market value of the award at the grant date. Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period and is included in corporate expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income. The grant date fair value of the portion of the PSUs based on our relative total stockholder return is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation performed by a third-party valuation firm. The grant date fair value of the portion of the PSUs based on hotel market share improvement is the closing price of our common stock on the grant date.

 LTIP Units 
 
 LTIP units are designed to offer executives a long-term incentive comparable to restricted stock, while potentially allowing them a more favorable income tax treatment. Each year, executives have the option to elect to receive their annual grant of share-based compensation as either LTIP units or restricted stock awards. Each LTIP unit awarded is deemed equivalent to an award of share of common stock reserved under the 2016 Plan or 2024 Plan, as applicable. At the time of award, LTIP units do not have full economic parity with common OP units, but can achieve such parity over time upon the occurrence of specified events in accordance with partnership tax rules.

 Overview 
 
 DiamondRock Hospitality Company is a lodging-focused Maryland corporation operating as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As of September 30, 2024, we owned a portfolio of 36 premium hotels and resorts that contain 9,760 guest rooms located in 25 different markets in the United States. The markets that we target are those that we believe align with our strategic objectives, which include investing in assets in destination markets with constrained supply trends, those that provide geographic diversity relative to our existing portfolio, and those markets that are considered to have high growth potential.

Table of Contents 

As an owner, rather than an operator, of lodging properties, we receive all of the operating profits or losses generated by our hotels after the payment of fees due to hotel managers and hotel brands, which are calculated based on the revenues and profitability of each hotel. 
 
 Our strategy is to apply aggressive asset management, prudent financial strategy, and disciplined capital allocation to high quality lodging properties in urban and resort markets in the U.S. with superior growth prospects and high barriers-to-entry. Our goal is to deliver long-term stockholder returns that exceed those generated by our peers through a combination of dividends and enduring capital appreciation. 
 
 Our primary business is to acquire, own, renovate and asset manage premium hotel properties in the United States. Our portfolio is concentrated in major urban markets and destination resort locations. All of our hotels are managed by a third party either an independent operator or a brand operator, such as Marriott. 
 
 We critically evaluate each of our hotels to ensure that we own a portfolio of hotels that conforms to our vision, supports our mission and corresponds with our strategy. On a regular basis, we analyze our portfolio to identify opportunities to invest capital in certain projects or market non-core assets for sale in order to increase our portfolio quality. We are committed to a conservative capital structure with prudent leverage. We regularly assess the availability and affordability of capital in order to maximize stockholder value and minimize enterprise risk. In addition, we are committed to following sound corporate governance practices and to being open and transparent in our communications with our stockholders. 
 
 Our Revenues and Expenses 
 
 Our revenue is primarily derived from hotel operations, including but not limited to rooms revenue, food and beverage revenue and other revenue, which consists of parking, spa, resort fees, other guest services, and tenant leases. 
 
 Our operating costs and expenses consist of the costs to provide hotel services, including rooms expense, food and beverage expense, other departmental and support expenses, management and franchise fees, and other property-level expenses. Rooms expense includes housekeeping and front office wages and payroll taxes, room supplies, laundry services and other costs. Food and beverage expense includes the cost of food, beverages and associated labor costs. Other departmental and support expenses include labor and other costs associated with the other operating department revenue, as well as labor and other costs associated with administrative departments, sales and marketing, information technology systems, repairs and maintenance and utility costs. Our hotels that are subject to franchise agreements are charged a royalty fee, plus additional fees for marketing, central reservation systems and other franchisor costs, in order for the hotel properties to operate under the respective brands. Franchise fees are based on a percentage of room revenue, and for certain hotels, additional franchise fees are charged for food and beverage revenue. We enter into management agreements with independent third-party management companies to operate our hotels. The management companies typically earn base and incentive management fees based on the levels of revenues and profitability of each individual hotel. Other property-level expenses include property taxes, insurance, ground lease expense, and other fixed costs. 
 
 Key Indicators of Financial Condition and Operating Performance 
 
 We use a variety of operating and other information to evaluate the financial condition and operating performance of our business. These key indicators include financial information that is prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles U.S. GAAP ), as well as other financial information that is not prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, we use other information that may not be financial in nature, including statistical information and comparative data. We use this information to measure the performance of individual hotels, groups of hotels and/or our business as a whole. We periodically compare historical information to our internal budgets as well as industry-wide information. These key indicators include: 
 
 Occupancy percentage; 
 
 Average Daily Rate ADR 
 
 Rooms Revenue per Available Room RevPAR 
 
 Earnings Before Interest, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization EBITDA ), Earnings Before Interest, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization for real estate EBITDA re , Adjusted EBITDA, and Hotel Adjusted EBITDA; and

Funds From Operations FFO and Adjusted FFO. 
 
 Occupancy, ADR and RevPAR are commonly used measures within the hotel industry to evaluate operating performance. RevPAR, which is calculated as the product of ADR and occupancy percentage, is an important statistic for monitoring operating performance at the individual hotel level and across our business as a whole. We evaluate individual hotel RevPAR performance on an absolute basis with comparisons to budget and prior periods, as well as on a company-wide and regional basis. ADR and RevPAR include only room revenue. Room revenue comprised approximately 66 of our total revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and is dictated by demand, as measured by occupancy percentage, pricing, as measured by ADR, and our available supply of hotel rooms. 
 
 Our ADR, occupancy percentage and RevPAR performance may be impacted by macroeconomic factors such as U.S. economic conditions generally, inflation, interest rates, regional and local employment growth, personal income and corporate earnings, office vacancy rates and business relocation decisions, airport and other business and leisure travel, increased use of lodging alternatives, new hotel construction and the pricing strategies of our competitors. In addition, our ADR, occupancy percentage and RevPAR performance is dependent on the continued success of our hotels' global brands. 
 
 We also use EBITDA, EBITDA re , Adjusted EBITDA, Hotel Adjusted EBTIDA, FFO and Adjusted FFO as measures of the financial performance of our business. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures for further discussion on these financial measures.

 that caused the hotel to be closed for seven days and 0.1 million related to an insurance claim at the Worthington Renaissance Fort Worth Hotel. No business interruption insurance income was recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

Interest expense. Our interest expense increased 0.7 million from the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and was comprised of the following (dollars in thousands): 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, Change 2024 2023 Term loan interest 35,419 31,867 3,552 11.1 Mortgage debt interest 11,572 12,331 (759) (6.2) Credit facility interest and unused fees 938 941 (3) (0.3) Amortization of debt issuance costs and debt premium 1,505 1,540 (35) (2.3) Interest rate swap mark-to-market 2,033 (2,033) (100.0) 49,434 48,712 722 1.5 
 
 The increase in interest expense is primarily the result of elevated interest rates on our variable rate debt. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Our short-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay our scheduled debt service, near term debt maturities, operating expenses, ground lease payments, capital expenditures directly associated with our hotels, any share repurchases, distributions to our common and preferred stockholders, and the cost of acquiring additional hotels. On August 6, 2024, we paid off 73.3 million outstanding on the Courtyard New York Manhattan/Midtown East mortgage loan using cash on hand. 
 
 Our mortgage debt agreements contain cash trap provisions that are triggered when the hotel s operating results fall below a certain debt service coverage ratio. When these provisions are triggered, all of the excess cash flow generated by the hotel is deposited directly into cash management accounts for the benefit of our lenders until a specified debt service coverage ratio is reached and maintained for a certain period of time. Such provisions do not allow the lender the right to accelerate repayment of the underlying debt. We had no cash traps in effect as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Our long-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for the costs of acquiring additional hotels, renovations and other capital expenditures that need to be made periodically to our hotels, scheduled debt payments, debt maturities, certain redemptions of limited operating partnership units common OP units ), ground lease payments, share repurchases, redemption of our preferred shares, and making distributions to our common and preferred stockholders. We expect to meet our long-term liquidity requirements through various sources of capital, including cash provided by operations, borrowings, issuances of additional equity, including common OP units, and/or debt securities and proceeds from property dispositions. Our ability to incur additional debt is dependent upon a number of factors, including the state of the credit markets, our degree of leverage, the value of our unencumbered assets and borrowing restrictions imposed by existing lenders. Our ability to raise capital through the issuance of additional equity and/or debt securities is also dependent on a number of factors including the current state of the capital markets, investor sentiment and our intended use of proceeds. We may need to raise additional capital if we identify acquisition opportunities that meet our investment objectives and require liquidity in excess of existing cash balances. Our ability to raise funds through the issuance of equity securities depends on, among other things, general market conditions for hotel companies and REITs and market perceptions about us. 
 
 Our Financing Strategy 
 
 Since our formation in 2004, we have been committed to a conservative capital structure with prudent leverage. Our outstanding debt consists of fixed interest rate mortgage debt, unsecured term loans and periodic borrowings on our senior unsecured credit facility. We have a preference to maintain a significant portion of our portfolio as unencumbered in order to provide balance sheet flexibility. We expect that our strategy will enable us to maintain a balance sheet with an appropriate amount of debt throughout all phases of the lodging cycle. We believe that it is prudent to reduce the inherent risk of highly cyclical lodging fundamentals through a low leverage capital structure. 
 
 We prefer a relatively simple but efficient capital structure. We generally structure our hotel acquisitions to be straightforward and to fit within our capital structure; however, we will consider a more complex transaction, such as the issuance of common OP units in connection with the acquisition of Cavallo Point, The Lodge at the Golden Gate, if we believe that the projected returns to our stockholders will significantly exceed the returns that would otherwise be available. 
 
 -25- 

Table of Contents 

We believe that we maintain a reasonable amount of debt. As of September 30, 2024, we had 1.1 billion of debt outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 5.60 and a weighted average maturity date of approximately 1.9 years. We have two mortgage loans that mature in the next 12 months. We intend to refinance the other mortgage loans that mature in 2025 as they approach their respective maturity dates. In the case that refinancing options are not attractive, we may repay such mortgage loans using our senior unsecured revolving credit facility. As of September 30, 2024, 33 of our 36 hotels are unencumbered by mortgage debt. We remain committed to our core strategy of prudent leverage. 
 
 Information about our financing activities is available in Note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 
 
 ATM Program 
 
 In August 2024, our board of directors approved an at-the-market equity offering program (the Current ATM Program ), pursuant to which we may issue and sell shares of our common stock from time to time, having an aggregate offering price of up to 200.0 million. Prior to the implementation of the Current ATM Program, we had a 200.0 million ATM program (the Prior ATM Program ), which is no longer active. No shares were sold under either the Prior ATM Program or the Current ATM Program during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Share Repurchase Program 
 In May 2024, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 200.0 million of our common stock under a new share repurchase program, which replaced our prior share repurchase program that was authorized in September 2022. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including price and general business and market conditions. The new share repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of shares, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time at our discretion. The new share repurchase program will expire on May 1, 2026. As of September 30, 2024, we had repurchased 3,114,876 shares of common stock at an average price of 8.33 per share for a total purchase price of 26.0 million under this program. As of November 8, 2024, we have 174.0 million of authorized capacity remaining under the new share repurchase program. All share repurchases during the year were made under the new share repurchase program. 
 
 Short-Term Borrowings 
 
 Other than borrowings under our senior unsecured credit facility, discussed below, we do not utilize short-term borrowings to meet liquidity requirements. 
 
 Senior Unsecured Credit Facility and Unsecured Term Loans 
 
 We are party to a Sixth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement that provides us with a 400 million senior unsecured revolving credit facility and two term loan facilities in the aggregate amount of 800 million. The revolving credit facility matures on September 27, 2026, which we may extend for an additional year upon the payment of applicable fees and satisfaction of certain standard conditions. The term loan facilities consist of a 500 million term loan that matures on January 3, 2028 and a 300 million term loan that matures on January 3, 2026. In September 2024, we exercised our option to extend the maturity from January 3, 2025 to January 3, 2026. We have the right to increase the aggregate amount of the facilities to 1.4 billion upon the satisfaction of certain standard conditions. 
 
 Additional information about the credit facilities, including a summary of significant covenants, can be found in Note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Sources and Uses of Cash 
 
 We expect that our principal sources of cash will include one or more of the following: net cash flow from hotel operations, sales of our equity and debt securities, debt financings and proceeds from any hotel dispositions. Our principal uses of cash are acquisitions of hotel properties, debt service and maturities, share repurchases and redemptions, capital expenditures, operating costs, ground lease payments, corporate expenses, and distributions to holders of common stock, common OP units and preferred stock. As of September 30, 2024, we had 75.3 million of unrestricted cash, 44.5 million of restricted cash and no outstanding borrowings on our senior unsecured credit facility. 
 
 Our net cash provided by operations was 148.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Our cash from operations generally consists of the net cash flow from hotel operations, offset by cash paid for corporate expenses, interest payments, and other working capital changes. The decrease of 36.1 million in cash provided by operations from the nine 
 -26- 

Table of Contents 

months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily driven by timing differences related to collections from our hotel managers and severance payments related to our previously announced leadership changes. 
 
 Our net cash used in investing activities was 58.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which consisted of capital expenditures at our hotels. 
 
 Our net cash used in financing activities was 137.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which consisted of 19.3 million of distributions paid to holders of common stock and common OP units, 7.4 million of distributions paid to holders of preferred stock, 7.1 million of scheduled mortgage debt principal payments, 73.3 million of repayments of mortgage debt, 4.6 million paid to repurchase shares upon the vesting of restricted stock for the payment of tax withholding obligations, and 26.0 million of shares repurchased under our share repurchase program. 
 
 We currently anticipate our significant source of cash for the remainder of the year ending December 31, 2024 will be the net cash flow from hotel operations and potential dispositions. We expect our estimated uses of cash for the remainder of the year ending December 31, 2024 will be potential acquisitions, scheduled debt service payments and maturity payments, capital expenditures, distributions to preferred and common stockholders, share repurchases and corporate expenses. 
 
 Dividend Policy 
 
 We intend to distribute to our stockholders dividends at least equal to our REIT taxable income to avoid paying corporate income tax and excise tax on our earnings (other than the earnings of our taxable REIT subsidiaries, which are all subject to tax at regular corporate rates) and to qualify for the tax benefits afforded to REITs under the Code. In order to qualify as a REIT under the Code, we generally must make distributions to our stockholders each year in an amount equal to at least: 
 
 90 of our REIT taxable income determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gains, plus 
 90 of the excess of our net income from foreclosure property over the tax imposed on such income by the Code, minus 
 any excess non-cash income. 
 
 The timing and frequency of distributions will be authorized by our board of directors and declared by us based upon a variety of factors, including our financial performance, restrictions under applicable law and our current and future loan agreements, our debt service requirements, our capital expenditure requirements, the requirements for qualification as a REIT under the Code and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant from time to time. 
 
 For each of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we paid an aggregate cash dividend of 0.09 per share or unit to holders of our common stock, common OP units, and LTIP units. 
 
 For each of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we paid an aggregate cash dividend of 1.5469 per share to holders of our Series A Preferred Stock. 
 
 Capital Expenditures 
 
 The management and franchise agreements for each of our hotels provide for the establishment of separate property improvement reserves to cover, among other things, the cost of replacing and repairing furniture, fixtures and equipment at our hotels and other routine capital expenditures. Contributions to the property improvement fund are calculated as a percentage of hotel revenues. In addition, we may be required to pay for the cost of certain additional improvements that are not permitted to be funded from the property improvement fund under the applicable management or franchise agreement. As of September 30, 2024, we have set aside 41.7 million for capital projects in property improvement reserves, which are included in restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheet. 
 
 In 2024, we expect to spend approximately 85 million on capital improvements at our hotels, of which we have invested approximately 58.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Significant projects in 2024 include the following: 
 
 Hotel Champlain Burlington: We completed the rebranding and repositioning of the Hilton Burlington Lake Champlain to Hotel Champlain Burlington, a Curio Collection by Hilton in July 2024. 
 Westin San Diego Bayview: We completed a comprehensive renovation of the hotel's guestrooms during the second quarter of 2024. 
 -27- 

Table of Contents 

Bourbon Orleans Hotel: We completed a comprehensive renovation of the hotel's guestrooms during the third quarter of 2024. 
 Orchards Inn Sedona: We commenced the repositioning of Orchards Inn as the Cliffs at L'Auberge on November 1, 2024. The repositioning will integrate the hotel with the adjacent L'Auberge de Sedona and include construction of a new pool connecting the two properties, renovation of the guestrooms and creation of a new arrival experience and new outdoor event space. We expect to complete the project in 2025. 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 We use the following non-GAAP financial measures that we believe are useful to investors as key measures of our operating performance: EBITDA, EBITDA re , Adjusted EBITDA, Hotel Adjusted EBITDA, FFO and Adjusted FFO. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance in accordance with U.S. GAAP. EBITDA, EBITDA re , Adjusted EBITDA, Hotel Adjusted EBITDA, FFO and Adjusted FFO, as calculated by us, may not be comparable to other companies that do not define such terms exactly as the Company. 
 
 Use and Limitations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 Our management and Board of Directors use EBITDA, EBITDA re , Adjusted EBITDA, Hotel Adjusted EBITDA, FFO and Adjusted FFO to evaluate the performance of our hotels and to facilitate comparisons between us and other lodging REITs, hotel owners who are not REITs and other capital intensive companies. The use of these non-GAAP financial measures has certain limitations. These non-GAAP financial measures as presented by us, may not be comparable to non-GAAP financial measures as calculated by other real estate companies. These measures do not reflect certain expenses or expenditures that we incurred and will incur, such as depreciation, interest and capital expenditures. We compensate for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance. Our reconciliations to the most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures, and our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income and consolidated statements of cash flows, include interest expense, capital expenditures, and other excluded items, all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance, as well as the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measures. 
 
 These non-GAAP financial measures are used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. They should not be considered as alternatives to operating profit, cash flow from operations, or any other operating performance measure prescribed by U.S. GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures reflect additional ways of viewing our operations that we believe, when viewed with our U.S. GAAP results and the reconciliations to the corresponding U.S. GAAP financial measures, provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained absent this disclosure. We strongly encourage investors to review our financial information in its entirety and not to rely on a single financial measure. 
 
 EBITDA and EBITDA re 
 
 EBITDA represents net income (calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP) excluding: (1) interest expense; (2) provision for income taxes, including income taxes applicable to sale of assets; and (3) depreciation and amortization. The Company computes EBITDA re in accordance with the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts Nareit guidelines, as defined in its September 2017 white paper Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization for Real Estate. EBITDA re represents net income (calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP) adjusted for: (1) interest expense; (2) provision for income taxes, including income taxes applicable to sale of assets; (3) depreciation and amortization; (4) gains or losses on the disposition of depreciated property including gains or losses on change of control; (5) impairment write-downs of depreciated property and of investments in unconsolidated affiliates caused by a decrease in value of depreciated property in the affiliate; and (6) adjustments to reflect the entity's share of EBITDA re of unconsolidated affiliates. 
 
 We believe EBITDA and EBITDA re are useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because they help investors evaluate and compare the results of our operations from period to period by removing the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest expense) and our asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization, and in the case of EBITDA re , impairment and gains or losses on dispositions of depreciated property) from our operating results. In addition, covenants included in our debt agreements use EBITDA as a measure of financial compliance. We also use EBITDA and EBITDA re as measures in determining the value of hotel acquisitions and dispositions. 
 
 FFO 
 
 -28- 

Table of Contents 

The Company computes FFO in accordance with standards established by Nareit, which defines FFO as net income (calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP) excluding gains or losses from sales of properties and impairment losses, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization. The Company believes that the presentation of FFO provides useful information to investors regarding its operating performance because it is a measure of the Company's operations without regard to specified non-cash items, such as real estate related depreciation and amortization and gains or losses on the sale of assets. The Company also uses FFO as one measure in assessing its operating results. 
 
 Adjustments to EBITDAre and FFO 
 
 We adjust EBITDA re and FFO when evaluating our performance because we believe that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance and that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted FFO when combined with U.S. GAAP net income, EBITDA re and FFO, is beneficial to an investor's complete understanding of our consolidated and property-level operating performance. We adjust EBITDA re and FFO for the following items: 
 
 Non-Cash Lease Expense and Other Amortization : We exclude the non-cash expense incurred from the straight-line recognition of expense from our ground leases and other contractual obligations and the non-cash amortization of our favorable and unfavorable contracts, originally recorded in conjunction with certain hotel acquisitions. We exclude these non-cash items because they do not reflect the actual cash amounts due to the respective lessors in the current period and they are of lesser significance in evaluating our actual performance for that period. 
 
 Cumulative Effect of a Change in Accounting Principle : The Financial Accounting Standards Board promulgates new accounting standards that require or permit the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income to reflect the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. We exclude the effect of these adjustments, which include the accounting impact from prior periods, because they do not reflect the Company s actual underlying performance for the current period. 
 
 Gains or Losses from Early Extinguishment of Debt : We exclude the effect of gains or losses recorded on the early extinguishment of debt because these gains or losses result from transaction activity related to the Company s capital structure that we believe are not indicative of the ongoing operating performance of the Company or our hotels. 
 
 Hotel Acquisition Costs : We exclude hotel acquisition costs expensed during the period because we believe these transaction costs are not reflective of the ongoing performance of the Company or our hotels. 
 
 Severance Costs : We exclude corporate severance costs, or reversals thereof, incurred with the termination of corporate-level employees and severance costs incurred at our hotels related to lease terminations or structured severance programs because we believe these costs do not reflect the ongoing performance of the Company or our hotels. 
 
 Hotel Manager Transition Items : We exclude the transition items associated with a change in hotel manager because we believe these items do not reflect the ongoing performance of the Company or our hotels. 
 
 Hotel Pre-Opening Costs: We exclude the pre-opening costs associated with the redevelopment or rebranding of a hotel because we believe these items do not reflect the ongoing performance of the Company or our hotels. 
 
 Other Items : From time to time we incur costs or realize gains that we consider outside the ordinary course of business and that we do not believe reflect the ongoing performance of the Company or our hotels. Such items may include, but are not limited to the following: lease preparation costs incurred to prepare vacant space for marketing; management or franchise contract termination fees; gains or losses from legal settlements; costs incurred related to natural disasters; and gains on property insurance claim settlements, other than income related to business interruption insurance. 
 
 In addition, to derive Adjusted FFO we exclude any unrealized fair value adjustments to interest rate swaps. We exclude these non-cash amounts because they do not reflect the underlying performance of the Company. 
 
 Hotel Adjusted EBITDA 
 
 We believe that Hotel Adjusted EBITDA provides our investors a useful financial measure to evaluate our hotel operating performance, excluding the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest), our asset base (primarily depreciation and 
 -29- 

Table of Contents 

amortization), and our corporate-level expenses. With respect to Hotel Adjusted EBITDA, we believe that excluding the effect of corporate-level expenses provides a more complete understanding of the operating results over which individual hotels and third-party management companies have direct control. We believe property-level results provide investors with supplemental information on the ongoing operational performance of our hotels and effectiveness of the third-party management companies operating our business on a property-level basis. Hotel Adjusted EBITDA margins are calculated as Hotel Adjusted EBITDA divided by total hotel revenues.

Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies 
 
 Our unaudited consolidated financial statements include the accounts of DiamondRock Hospitality Company and all consolidated subsidiaries. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. While we do not believe the reported amounts would be materially different, application of these policies involves the exercise of judgment and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could differ materially from these estimates. We evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to the impairment of long-lived assets, on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. All of our significant accounting policies, including certain critical accounting policies, are disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. There have been no significant changes to our critical accounting policies since the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Inflation 
 
 Operators of hotels, in general, possess the ability to adjust room rates daily to reflect the effects of inflation. Generally, our management companies may adjust room rates daily, excluding previous contractually committed reservations. However, competitive pressures or other factors may limit the ability of our management companies to raise room rates. Inflation may also affect our expenses and cost of capital improvements, including, without limitation, by increasing the costs of labor, employee-related benefits, food, commodities and other materials, taxes, property and casualty insurance and utilities. 
 
 Inflation increased recently to levels not seen in years. The United States Federal Reserve has raised interest rates in response to concerns about inflati on. During the first half of 2024, inflation continued to persist at levels above the Federal Reserve's target level. In the third quarter of 2024, inflation levels started to trend under 3 , closer to the Federal Reserve's target level. As a result, the Federal Reserve cut its benchmark rate by half a percentage point in September. The Federal Reserve continues to indicate that it will remain data dependent in determining whether to hold its benchmark rate at current levels or continue to slowly ease interest rates during the fourth quarter of 2024 into 2025. Any increases in interest rates, especially if coupled with reduced government spending and volatility in financial markets, may have the effect of further increasing economic uncertainty, and increasing the cost of new indebtedness and servicing our outstanding variable rate debt. 
 
 Seasonality 
 
 The periods during which our hotels experience higher revenues vary from property to property, depending principally upon location and the customer base served. Accordingly, we expect some seasonality in our business. Volatility in our

financial performance from the seasonality of the lodging industry could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 
 Market risk includes risks that arise from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, equity prices and other market changes that affect market sensitive instruments. In pursuing our business strategies, the primary market risk to which we are currently exposed, and to which we expect to be exposed in the future, is interest rate risk. The face amount of our outstanding debt as of September 30, 2024 was 1.1 billion, of which 0.8 billion had a variable interest rate. Our primary sensitivity in 2024 is to changes in one-month Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR ), as the interest rates on our variable-rate indebtedness were based on this benchmark rate. We use interest rate swaps in order to maintain what we believe to be an appropriate level of exposure to interest rate variability. As of September 30, 2024, we held interest rate swaps related to 150 million of our variable-rate indebtedness, which effectively fixes the interest rate on a portion of our variable-rate debt for varying periods, up to or prior to maturity. If market interest rates on our unhedged variable rate debt fluctuate by 100 basis points, interest expense would increase or decrease, depending on rate movement, future earnings and cash flows, by 6.5 million annually. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 The Company s management has evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as required by paragraph (b) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, and has concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to give reasonable assurances that information we disclose in reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. 
 
 There was no change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act during the Company s most recent fiscal quarter that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 
 We are subject to various claims, lawsuits and legal proceedings, including routine litigation arising in the ordinary course of business regarding the operation of our hotels and other company matters. While it is not possible to ascertain the ultimate outcome of such matters, management believes that the aggregate amount of such liabilities, if any, in excess of amounts covered by insurance will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations. The outcome of claims, lawsuits and legal proceedings brought against the Company, however, is subject to significant uncertainties.
