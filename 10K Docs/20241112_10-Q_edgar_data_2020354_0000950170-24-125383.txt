 OVERVIEW 
 We are a specialty finance company that is a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a business development company BDC under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act ). In addition, we intend to elect to be treated as a regulated investment company RIC ), and we expect to qualify annually for tax treatment as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ). We had not commenced investment operations as of September 30, 2024. 
 Our investment objective is to generate current income and, to a lesser extent, long-term capital appreciation. Our investment strategy is consistent with that of the broader Goldman Sachs Asset Management Private Credit platform, with a focus on capital preservation and capital appreciation, and includes : 
 Leveraging Goldman Sachs Asset Management Private Credit s position within GSAM; 

Direct origination with borrowers; 

Prudent investment selection with intensive due diligence and credit analysis; 

Provision of large-sized commitments; 

Structuring expertise with a focus on risk mitigation; 

Rigorous portfolio management; and 

Focus on companies with attractive business fundamentals. 

We expect to hold primarily directly originated, first lien senior secured, floating rate debt of companies located in the United States. We may also invest, to a lesser extent, in second lien, unsecured or subordinated loans, payment-in-kind PIK debt and equity and equity-like instruments, and in very limited circumstances, we may hold loans or other Investments of issuers that are not located in the United States in connection with certain post-closing modifications of existing investments. For a discussion of our investment objectives and guidelines, see Item 1. Business Investments in Amendment No. 3 to our Registration Statement on Form 10, filed with the SEC on August 15, 2024 (the Form 10/A ). 
 We will invest in private companies based in the United States. We intend to focus our lending across a spectrum of directly sourced opportunities in companies ranging from lower middle market to large capitalization in size. We may invest in companies of any size or capitalization. Subject to the limitations of the Investment Company Act, we may invest in loans or other securities, the proceeds of which may refinance or otherwise repay debt or securities of companies whose debt is owned by other Goldman Sachs credit funds or affiliates. We also intend to invest alongside institutional and retail-focused private credit Accounts, which may include proprietary accounts of Goldman Sachs. See Item 1. Business Allocation of Investment Opportunities Co-Investments Alongside Goldman Sachs and Other Accounts; the Relief in the Form 10/A. In addition, we expect to acquire or originate revolving credit facilities from time to time in connection with our investments in other assets. 
 We intend to employ leverage as market conditions permit and at the discretion of the Investment Adviser, subject to the terms of the LLC Agreement and the limitations set forth in the Investment Company Act, which currently allows us to borrow up to 2 of debt for each 1 of equity. We intend to use leverage in the form of borrowings, including loans from financial institutions as well as the issuance of debt securities. In determining whether to borrow money, we will analyze the maturity, covenant package and rate structure of the proposed borrowings as well as the risks of such borrowings compared to our investment outlook. We would expect any such leverage, if incurred, to increase the total capital available for investment by the Company. 
 For a discussion of the competitive landscape we face, please see Item 1A. Risk Factors Competition We operate in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities and Item 1. Business Competitive Advantages in the Form 10/A.

 KEY COMPONENTS OF OPERATIONS 
 Investments 
 Our level of investment activity can and does vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors, including the amount of debt and equity capital available to middle-market companies, the level of merger and acquisition activity for such companies, the general economic environment, the amount of capital we have available to us and the competitive environment for the type of investments we make. 
 As a BDC, we generally will be prohibited from acquiring assets other than qualifying assets unless, after giving effect to any acquisition, at least 70 of our total assets are qualifying assets. Qualifying assets generally include securities of eligible portfolio companies, cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities and high-quality debt instruments maturing in one year or less from the time of investment. Under the Investment Company Act and the rules thereunder, eligible portfolio companies include (i) private U.S. operating companies, (ii) public U.S. operating companies whose securities are not listed on a national securities exchange (e.g., the New York Stock Exchange) or registered under the Exchange Act, and (iii) public U.S. operating companies having a market capitalization of less than 250 million. Public U.S. operating companies whose securities are quoted on the over-the-counter bulletin board and through OTC Markets are not listed on a national securities exchange and therefore are eligible portfolio companies. As of September 30, 2024, we had not commenced investment operations. 
 Revenues 
 We plan to generate revenues in the form of interest income on debt investments and, to a lesser extent, fee income and capital gains and distributions, if any, on equity securities that we may acquire in portfolio companies. Some of our investments may provide for deferred interest payments or PIK income. We expect that the principal amount of the debt investments and any accrued but unpaid interest generally will become due at the maturity date. 
 We expect to generate revenues primarily through receipt of interest income from the investments we hold. In addition, we may generate revenue in the form of commitment, origination, structuring, syndication, exit fees or diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance and consulting fees. Portfolio company fees (directors fees, consulting fees, administrative fees, tax advisory fees and other similar compensation) will be paid to us, unless, to the extent required by applicable law or exemptive relief, if any, therefrom, we receive our allocable portion of such fees when invested in the same portfolio company as other Accounts. We do not expect to receive material fee income as it is not our principal investment strategy. We will record contractual prepayment premiums on loans and debt securities as interest income. 
 Dividend income on preferred equity investments, if any, will be recorded on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the portfolio company and are expected to be collected. Dividend income on common equity investments, if any, will be recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies and on the ex-dividend date for publicly traded portfolio companies. Interest and dividend income will be presented net of withholding tax, if any. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had not commenced investment operations. 
 Expenses 
 We will bear and be responsible for all of the costs and expenses. Our primary operating expenses include the payment of the management fee (the Management Fee to our Investment Adviser, legal and professional fees, interest and other debt expenses and other operating expenses. The Management Fee compensates our Investment Adviser for its work in identifying, evaluating, negotiating, closing and monitoring our investments. We bear all of our other costs and expenses in accordance with the LLC Agreement (as defined below) and the administration agreement (the Administration Agreement ), including: 
 our operational, offering and organizational expenses; 

fees and expenses, including travel expenses, reasonably incurred by our Investment Adviser or payable to third parties related to our investments, including, among others, professional fees (including, without limitation, the fees and expenses of consultants and experts) and fees and expenses relating to evaluating, monitoring, researching and performing due diligence on investments and prospective investments; 

interest, fees and other expenses payable on indebtedness for borrowed money (including through the issuance of notes and other evidence of indebtedness), other indebtedness, financings or extensions of credit, if any, incurred by us; 

fees and expenses incurred by us in connection with membership in investment company organizations; 

brokers commissions; 

fees and expenses associated with calculating our NAV (including the costs and expenses of any independent valuation firm); 

legal, auditing or accounting expenses; 

taxes or governmental fees; 

the fees and expenses of our administrator, transfer agent and/or sub-transfer agent; 

18 

Table of Contents 

 the cost of preparing unit certificates or any other expenses, including clerical expenses of issue, redemption or repurchase of our common units of our limited liability company interests (the "Units"); 

the expenses of and fees for registering or qualifying our Units for sale and of maintaining our registration; 

the fees and expenses of our directors who are not affiliated with our Investment Adviser; 

the cost of preparing and distributing reports, proxy statements and notices to our unitholders, the SEC and other regulatory authorities; 

costs of holding unitholder meetings; 

the fees or disbursements of custodians of our assets, including expenses incurred in the performance of any obligations enumerated by limited liability company agreement or other organizational documents insofar as they govern agreements with any such custodian; 

insurance premiums; and 

costs incurred in connection with any claim, litigation, arbitration, mediation, government investigation or dispute in connection with our business and the amount of any judgment or settlement paid in connection therewith, or the enforcement of our rights against any person and indemnification or contribution expenses payable by us to any person and other extraordinary expenses not incurred in the ordinary course of our business. 

To the extent that expenses incurred by us are related to the Company and to one or more Co-Investing GS Direct Lending Funds, expenses will be allocated among us and such Co-Investing GS Direct Lending Funds in accordance with the Investment Adviser s policies and procedures, which requires that expenses be allocated in a manner that the Investment Adviser reasonably determines is fair and equitable. 
 The Investment Adviser will reimburse us for any initial offering costs and Organizational Expenses (as defined below) borne by us in excess of 2.25 million in the aggregate (the Organizational Expense Cap ). 
 Ordinary Operating Expenses (as defined below) ultimately borne by us will not exceed (i) 2.0 million for the twelve-month period beginning on the Initial Drawdown Date and ending on the day before the one-year anniversary thereof (or if such day does not occur on a calendar quarter-end, the following calendar quarter-end), (ii) 3.25 million for the twelve-month period immediately following the period set forth in clause (i), (iii) 3.25 million for the twelve-month period immediately following the period set forth in clause (ii) and (iv) 5.0 million for each twelve-month period thereafter (collectively, the Operating Expenses Cap ). The Investment Adviser will reimburse us for any Ordinary Operating Expenses in excess of the Operating Expenses Cap. 
 On the Initial Drawdown Date, Company expenses incurred prior to the Initial Drawdown Date (i) will be borne by the unitholders in proportion to the relative number of Units they hold on the Initial Drawdown Date (after taking into account any Units issued on the Initial Drawdown Date) and (ii) to the extent they constitute Ordinary Operating Expenses, will be taken into account in calculating the cap under clause (i) of the Operating Expenses Cap. 
 Organizational Expenses means expenses incurred in respect of legal, tax or accounting services pertaining to the organization and formation of the Company, the drafting of the LLC Agreement (as defined below), any administration, custody and transfer agent agreements and audit fees relating to the initial registration statement and auditing the initial seed capital statement of assets and liabilities. 
 Ordinary Operating Expenses mean our operating expenses, excluding (i) offering costs and organization costs, (ii) interest, fees and other expenses payable on certain financings, (iii) taxes, (iv) the Management Fee (as defined below), (v) brokers commissions and (vi) costs incurred in connection with any claim, litigation, arbitration, mediation, government investigation or dispute in connection with our business and the amount of any judgment or settlement paid in connection therewith, or the enforcement of our rights against any person and indemnification or contribution expenses payable by us to any person and other extraordinary expenses not incurred in the ordinary course of the Company s business. 
 We expect our general and administrative expenses to be relatively stable or decline as a percentage of total assets during periods of asset growth and to increase during periods of asset declines. 
 
 Our initial offering costs (other than the Organizational Expenses) will be amortized to expense over a twelve-month period on a straight-line basis, beginning on the Initial Member Contribution Date. The effect of this accounting treatment is not expected to be material to our financial statements.

 Leverage 
 As a BDC, we are permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of indebtedness and one class of units senior to our Units, if our asset coverage ratio, as defined under the Investment Company Act, is at least equal to 150 immediately after each such issuance. The Small Business Credit Availability Act modified the applicable provisions of the Investment Company Act to reduce the required asset coverage ratio applicable to BDCs from 200 to 150 , subject to certain approval and disclosure requirements. Our Board and Initial Member approved the application of the 150 asset coverage ratio to us in accordance with the requirements of the Investment Company Act. While the leverage we employ may be greater or less than these levels from time to time, we intend to comply with the limitations set forth in the Investment Company Act, which currently allows us to borrow up to 2 of debt for each 1 of equity. In addition, except in limited circumstances, while any indebtedness and senior securities remain outstanding, we must make provisions to prohibit any distribution to our unitholders or the repurchase of such securities or stock unless we meet the applicable asset coverage ratios at the time of the distribution or repurchase. We may also borrow amounts up to 5 of the value of our total assets for temporary or emergency purposes without regard to asset coverage. A loan is presumed to be made for temporary purposes if it is repaid within 60 days and is not extended or renewed; otherwise, it is presumed not to be for temporary purposes. For a discussion of the risks associated with leverage, see Item 1A. Risk Factors Risks Relating to Legal and Regulatory Matters Regulations governing our operations as a BDC affect our ability to, and the way in which we will, raise additional capital. These constraints may hinder the Investment Adviser s ability to take advantage of attractive investment opportunities and to achieve our investment objective in the Form 10/A. 
 We intend to employ leverage as market conditions permit and at the discretion of the Investment Adviser, subject to the terms of the LLC Agreement and the limitations set forth in the Investment Company Act, which currently allows us to borrow up to 2 of debt for each 1 of equity. We intend to use leverage in the form of borrowings, including loans from financial institutions as well as the issuance of debt securities. In determining whether to borrow money, we will analyze the maturity, covenant package and rate structure of the proposed borrowings as well as the risks of such borrowings compared to our investment outlook. We would expect any such leverage, if incurred, to increase the total capital available for investment by the Company. The use of leverage magnifies returns, including losses. See Item 1A. Risk Factors in the Form 10/A.

FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had not commenced investments operations. 
 We expect to generate cash primarily from the net proceeds of any future offerings of our Units, drawdowns of capital commitments, future borrowings and cash flows from operations. Subject to the terms of our Second Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement (as amended and/or restated or otherwise modified from time to time, the LLC Agreement ), to the extent we determine that additional capital would allow us to take advantage of additional investment opportunities, if the market for debt financing presents attractively priced debt financing opportunities, or if our board of directors (the Board of Directors or the Board otherwise determines that leveraging our portfolio would be in our best interest and the best interests of our unitholders, we may enter into credit facilities or issue other senior securities. Subject to the terms of the LLC Agreement, we would expect any such credit facilities may be secured by certain of our assets and may contain advance rates based upon pledged collateral. The pricing and other terms of any such facilities would depend upon market conditions when we enter into any such facilities as well as the performance of our business, among other factors. As a BDC, with certain limited exceptions, we are only permitted to borrow amounts such that our asset coverage ratio, as defined in the Investment Company Act, is at least 150 after such borrowing (if certain requirements are met). We may also refinance or repay any of our indebtedness at any time based on our financial condition and market conditions. 
 We may enter into investment commitments through executed credit agreements or signed commitment letters, that may ultimately become investment transactions in the future. We regularly evaluate and carefully consider our unfunded commitments using GSAM s proprietary risk management framework for the purpose of planning our capital resources and ongoing liquidity, including our financial leverage. 
 An affiliate of the Investment Adviser made a capital commitment to us of 10,000 on May 1, 2024 (inception) and served as our initial member (the Initial Member ). We began accepting subscription agreements Subscription Agreements from investors acquiring Units in our private offering. Under the terms of the Subscription Agreements, investors are required to make capital contributions up to the amount of their undrawn capital commitment to purchase Units each time we deliver a drawdown notice. As of the dates indicated, we had aggregate capital commitments and undrawn capital commitments from investors as follows:

Contractual Obligations 
 We have entered into certain contracts under which we have future commitments. Under the Investment Management Agreement, pursuant to which GSAM has agreed to serve as our Investment Adviser, we pay a Management Fee equal to a percentage of value of our average NAV at the end of the then-current calendar quarter and the prior calendar quarter. Under the Administration Agreement, pursuant to which State Street Bank and Trust Company (the Administrator will be responsible for providing us with various accounting and administrative services necessary to conduct our day-to-day operations, we pay our Administrator such fees as may be agreed between us and our Administrator that we determine are commercially reasonable in our sole discretion. Either party or the unitholders, by a vote of a majority of our outstanding voting securities, may terminate the Investment Management Agreement without penalty on at least 60 days written notice to the other party. Either party may terminate the Administration Agreement without penalty upon at least 30 days written notice to the other party.

(1) Provides, under certain circumstances, a total borrowing capacity of 300 million. 

SCB Revolving Credit Facility 
 We entered into a revolving credit facility on September 25, 2024 with Standard Chartered Bank Ltd., as administrative agent (the Administrative Agent ), lead arranger, sole bookrunner, letter of credit issuer and lender (the SCB Revolving Credit Facility ). 
 Subject to availability under the Borrowing Base (as defined in the SCB Revolving Credit Facility), the maximum principal amount of the SCB Revolving Credit Facility is 300 million. The Borrowing Base is calculated based on the unfunded capital commitments of the unitholders (subject to various eligibility requirements) multiplied by the specified advance rate of 75 . The stated maturity date of the SCB Revolving Credit Facility is September 25, 2026. 
 Under the SCB Revolving Credit Facility, we have the ability to elect, for loans denominated in U.S. Dollars, either Term SOFR with a one- or three- months tenor or the alternative base rate at the time of draw-down (and with respect to loans denominated in non-U.S. Dollar currencies, the applicable benchmark specified in the SCB Revolving Credit Facility), and loans denominated in U.S. Dollars may be converted from one rate to another at any time, subject to certain conditions. The interest rate on obligations under the SCB Revolving Credit Facility is (A) Term SOFR Loan for the applicable tenor (or other listed offered rate, depending upon the currency of borrowing) plus 2.00 per annum or (B) an alternative base rate (the greatest of the prime rate set by the Administrative Agent, the federal funds rate plus 0.50 , and Term SOFR with a one-month tenor plus 1.00 ABR )) plus 1.00 per annum, with a floor of 0 . 
 For details, see Note 6 Debt SCB Revolving Credit Facility to our financial statements included in this report . 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We may become a party to investment commitments and to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of our business to fund investments and to meet the financial needs of our portfolio companies. These instruments may include commitments to extend credit and involve, to varying degrees, elements of liquidity and credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet. As of September 30, 2024, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements. 
 Hedging 
 Subject to our investment guidelines, we may, but are not required to, enter into interest rate, foreign exchange or other derivative agreements to hedge interest rate, currency, credit or other risks, but we will not enter into any such derivative agreements for speculative purposes. These hedging activities, which comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, may include the use of futures, options and forward contracts. We will bear any costs incurred in connection with entering into, administering and settling any such derivative contracts. There can be no assurance any hedging strategy we employ will be successful.

 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP ). The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ materially. 
 For a description of our critical accounting policies, see Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies to our financial statements included in this report. We consider the most significant accounting policies to be those related to our Revenue Recognition and Income Taxes. The critical accounting policies should be read in connection with our risk factors listed under Risk Factors in our Form 10/A. 
 
 RECENT DEVELOPMENTS 
 On October 16, 2024, we delivered a capital drawdown notice to our investors relating to the issuance and sale of 927,000 Units for an aggregate offering price of 18.54 million. The Units were issued on October 30, 2024.

 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 We are subject to financial market risks, most significantly changes in interest rates. Interest rate sensitivity refers to the change in our earnings that may result from changes in the level of interest rates. Because we expect to fund a portion of our investments with borrowings, our net investment income is expected to be affected by the difference between the rate at which we invest and the rate at which we borrow. As a result, there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had not yet called capital for investment operations. Additionally, our borrowings under the SCB Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a floating rate. 
 We regularly measure our exposure to interest rate risk. We assess interest rate risk and manage our interest rate exposure on an ongoing basis by comparing our interest rate sensitive assets to our interest rate sensitive liabilities. 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. As of the end of the period covered by this report, our management carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our Co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, our Co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting . There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our most recently completed fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
