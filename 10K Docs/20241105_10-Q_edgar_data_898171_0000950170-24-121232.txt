million of Fixed Rate Noncumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series B and Series C. The preferred stock qualifies as Tier 1 capital at the Bank and pays dividends at an annual rate of . . This capital is presented as noncontrolling interest in the consolidated balance sheets. Dividends declared on this preferred stock are presented as earnings allocated to the noncontrolling interest in the consolidated statements of income. 
 , the Company's Board of Directors declared a stock dividend payable to shareholders of record on . All information in the accompanying consolidated financial statements regarding earnings per share and weighted average number of shares outstanding has been computed giving effect to this stock dividend. The weighted average number of shares outstanding and earnings per share for the 2023 periods have also been adjusted for the stock dividend declared on . Basic and diluted net income per common share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding during each period after retroactively adjusting for stock dividends. Diluted net income per common share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the net income of the Company. The Company had stock options outstanding at September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. Basic and diluted net income per common share have been computed based upon net income available to common shareholders as presented in the accompanying consolidated statements of income divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding or assumed to be outstanding. The weighted average number of common shares outstanding was for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to for the three-month period ended September 30, 2023 . For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, the weighted average number of common shares outstanding was compared to for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023.

The Company owned Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) stock reported at cost of at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 . The Company owned Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) stock reported at cost of and at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The investments in FRB stock and FHLB stock are required investments related to the Company s membership in, and borrowings with, these banks and are classified as restricted stock on the consolidated balance sheet. These investments are carried at cost since there is no ready market and redemption has historically been made at par value. The Company estimated that the fair value approximated cost and that these investments were not impaired at September 30, 2024. There is allowance for credit losses on available for sale securities.

On a quarterly basis, the Company monitors the credit quality of the debt securities held to maturity through the use of credit ratings. For unrated securities, primarily corporate bonds consisting of subordinated debt of bank holding companies, individual financial reports are reviewed quarterly. Capital, profitability, liquidity and other ratios are reviewed to assist in determining credit quality.

At September 30, 2024 , the Company had securities held to maturity that were past due 30 days or more as to principal or interest payments. The Company had securities held to maturity classified as nonaccrual for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , securities available for sale with a carrying amount of million and million, respectively, were pledged as collateral on public deposits and for other purposes as required or permitted by law. We believe the unrealized losses on investment securities are a result of a volatile market and fluctuations in market prices due to a rise in interest rates, which will adjust if rates decline. Management does not believe these fluctuations are a reflection of the credit quality of the investments.

Declines in the fair value of the available for sale investment portfolio are believed by management to be temporary in nature. When evaluating an investment for credit loss, management considers, among other things, the extent to which the fair value has been in a loss position; the financial condition of the issuer through the review of credit ratings and, if necessary, corporate financial statements; adverse conditions specifically related to the security such as past due principal or interest; underlying assets that collateralize the debt security; other economic conditions and demographics; and the intent and ability of the Company to hold the investment until the loss position is recovered. Any unrealized losses were largely due to increases in market interest rates over the yields available at the time of purchase. The fair value is expected to recover as the bonds approach their maturity date or market yields for such investments decline. Management does not believe any of the securities are impaired due to reasons of credit quality. At September 30, 2024, the Company did not intend to sell and believed it was not likely to be required to sell the available for sale securities that were in a loss position prior to full recovery.

A loan may be individually assessed for determining the allowance for credit losses when it is determined that it does not share similar risk characteristics with other loans. Loans that are on nonaccrual status will be reviewed to determine if they will be individually, rather than collectively, assessed. If the loan is deemed to be collateral dependent and the relationship s outstanding balance is or greater, it will be individually assessed. Collateral dependent loans are loans for which the repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral and the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. Collateral dependent loans require an analysis of the collateral. The fair value of the collateral is discounted by liquidation costs. If the discounted fair value of the collateral is greater than the amortized loan balance, no allowance is required. Otherwise the difference between the balance and the collateral is charged off if deemed uncollectible.

or greater, it will be individually evaluated. Collateral dependent loans are loans for which the repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral and the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. Collateral dependent loans require an analysis of the collateral. The fair value of the collateral is based on appraised values discounted by liquidation costs which the Company considers Level 3 valuations. Foreclosed assets are adjusted to fair value upon transfer of the loans to other real estate owned. Real estate acquired in settlement of loans is recorded initially at the estimated fair value of the property less estimated selling costs at the date of foreclosure. The initial recorded value may be subsequently reduced by additional allowances, which are charged to earnings if the estimated fair value of the property less estimated selling costs declines below the initial recorded value. Fair value is based upon independent market prices, appraised values of the collateral or management s estimation of the value of the collateral. The Company typically bases the fair value of the collateral on appraised values, which the Company considers Level 3 valuations. Loans originated and intended for sale in the secondary market are carried at the lower of cost or estimated fair value in the aggregate, based on secondary market prices. Net unrealized losses, if any, are recognized through a valuation allowance by charges to income. These loans are recorded in Level 2.

Balance at September 30, 2024 

The fair value of mortgage IRLCs at September 30, 2024 was calculated based on a notional amount of million. Significant unobservable inputs are used to determine the fair value of these derivatives. At September 30, 2024 , such inputs included anticipated margins to be earned based on market movement from the original lock date and a weighted average projected pull-through rate of determined by loan product, loan stage, and loan purpose. The fair value of mortgage IRLCs at December 31, 2023 was calculated based on a notional amount of million. Significant unobservable inputs were the same as those used for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and assumed a weighted average projected pull-through rate of at December 31, 2023. Changes in interest rates and other assumptions could significantly change these estimated values. The Company may be required, from time to time, to measure certain assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. These include assets that are measured at the lower of cost or market value that were recognized at fair value less cost to sell at the end of the period.

Item 2.	Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 Caution Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may contain certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements generally relate to estimates with respect to the financial condition, results of operations and business of the Company that are subject to various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these estimates. These factors include, but are not limited to: increases in our past due loans and provision for credit losses that may result from local and/or broader economic effects, including the impacts of inflation and constraints on the availability of credit that may impact our borrowers; declines in general economic conditions, including increased stress in the financial markets; changes in interest rates, deposit flows, loan demand, real estate values, and competition; changes in accounting principles, policies, or guidelines; changes in legislation or regulation; and other economic, competitive, governmental, regulatory, and technological factors affecting the Company s operations, pricing, products and services. Any use of we or our in the following discussion refers to the Company on a consolidated basis. 
 Comparison of Financial Condition at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company s total assets increased 108.5 million, from 1.07 billion to 1.18 billion. 
 Cash and cash equivalents increased 60.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 63.4 million to 123.9 million. The increase is related to continued growth in deposits. 
 Investment securities consist of securities available for sale and securities held to maturity. For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, investment securities decreased 5.8 million from 365.3 million at December 31, 2023 to 359.5 million at September 30, 2024. At September 30, 2024, the Company had net unrealized losses on securities available for sale of 25.1 million, compared to net unrealized losses of 32.6 million at December 31, 2023, an improvement of 7.4 million. The improvement in the fair value of available for sale securities offset 12.1 million in net paydowns and maturities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. During the first nine months of 2024, a 10,000 provision was recorded against the allowance for credit losses on securities held to maturity bringing the balance to 66,000, with an amortized cost basis of 26.8 million, at September 30, 2024. 
 At September 30, 2024, equity securities improved in value from 302,000 at December 31, 2023 to 355,000 as a result of the increase in value in the equity market. 
 Loans held for sale increased 92,000 from December 31, 2023 to 4.8 million at September 30, 2024. Loans held for investment increased from 592.1 million at December 31, 2023 to 647.1 million at September 30, 2024, an increase of 55.1 million. The Company experienced a net increase in all loan sectors with the exception of loans categorized as Commercial - Other." 
 The allowance for credit losses on loans was 5.7 million at September 30, 2024, which represented 0.89 of total loans held for investment, compared to 5.6 million, or 0.94 of total loans held for investment, at December 31, 2023. Additional discussion regarding the allowance is included in the Asset Quality section below. 
 Other changes in the Company s consolidated assets are primarily related to deferred tax assets, which decreased 1.9 million from 8.9 million at December 31, 2023 to 7.0 million at September 30, 2024 as a result of the improvement in fair value of the available for sale security portfolio. Interest receivable increased 428,000 from 4.4 million as of December 31, 2023 to 4.8 million at September 30, 2024. This increase was attributable to the 55.1 million above-mentioned loan growth. 
 Customer deposits, our primary funding source, experienced a 96.1 million increase during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, increasing from 981.7 million to 1.08 billion. The overall increase in deposits is attributable to organic deposit growth combined with promotional time deposit offerings. Demand noninterest-bearing checking accounts increased 18.3 million, primarily from growth in commercial accounts, and time deposits increased 70.5 million during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024. Interest checking and money market accounts increased 13.9 million and savings deposits decreased 6.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Total short-term borrowings increased 40,000 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024. At September 30, 2024, the Company had 29.1 million in long-term debt outstanding, which consists solely of its junior subordinated debt securities, net of unamortized debt issuance costs. During the third quarter of 2019, the Company issued 10.0 million in subordinated debt securities with a final maturity date of September 30, 2029 that may be redeemed on or after September 30, 2024. This junior subordinated debt pays interest quarterly at an annual fixed rate of 5.25 . During the third quarter of 2021, the Company issued 12.0 million and 8.0 million of 10-year and 15-year fixed-to-floating rate subordinated debt securities, respectively. The 10-year subordinated notes mature 
 27 

on September 3, 2031, though they are redeemable at the Company s option on or after September 3, 2026, and initially pay interest quarterly at an annual rate of 3.5 . From and including September 3, 2026 to but excluding September 3, 2031, or up to any early redemption date, the interest rate on the 10-year subordinated notes will reset quarterly to an annual rate equal to the then-current three-month secured overnight financing rate SOFR ), plus 283 basis points payable quarterly in arrears. The 15-year subordinated notes mature on September 3, 2036, though they are redeemable at the Company s option on or after September 3, 2031, and initially pay interest quarterly at an annual rate of 4.0 . From and including September 3, 2031 to but excluding September 3, 2036, or up to any early redemption date, the interest rate on the 15-year subordinated notes will reset quarterly to an annual rate equal to the then-current three-month SOFR plus 292 basis points payable quarterly in arrears. The subordinated debt has been structured to qualify as and is included in the calculation of the Company s Tier 2 capital. Of the subordinated debt that remains outstanding at September 30, 2024, 27.2 million qualifies as Tier 2 capital. The Company also has a 3.0 million line of credit of which 3.0 million was available to use at September 30, 2024. 
 Other changes in the Company s liabilities are related to an increase of 872,000 in other liabilities from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024 resulting primarily from accrual of reserves for payables due throughout 2024. 
 At September 30, 2024, total shareholders equity was 61.1 million, an increase of 11.7 million from December 31, 2023. Net income for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 was 7.6 million, which positively contributed to our shareholders equity. Additionally, improvement in the unrealized loss position on our available for sale securities portfolio contributed 5.7 million to the increase in shareholders' equity during the same nine-month period. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased 160,115 shares of common stock at a total cost of 1.3 million, and the Company paid 424,000 in dividends attributable to noncontrolling interest during the same period. See Note 3 (Noncontrolling Interest) to the Company s Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of the noncontrolling interest. On October 15, 2024, the Company's Board of Directors declared a 2 stock dividend payable on November 18, 2024 to shareholders of record on October 28, 2024. All information presented in this discussion and analysis and in the interim consolidated financial statements regarding earnings per share and weighted average number of shares outstanding has been computed giving effect to this stock dividend. 
 Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 Net Income and Net Income Available to Common Shareholders 
 Uwharrie Capital Corp reported net income of 3.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 2.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Net income available to common shareholders was 2.9 million, or 0.40 per common share, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.0 million, or 0.27 per common share, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Net income available to common shareholders is net income less dividends on the aforementioned noncontrolling interest. 
 Net Interest Income 
 Net interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 9.1 million, an 881,000 increase from the 8.2 million reported for the comparative period in 2023. During the third quarter of 2024, the average yield on our interest-earning assets increased 48 basis points to 5.18 from the same period in 2023, and the average rate we paid for our interest-bearing liabilities increased 60 basis points to 2.55 . These changes resulted in a lower interest rate spread of 2.63 as of September 30, 2024, compared to 2.76 as of September 30, 2023. The Company s net interest margin was 3.34 and 3.30 for the comparable periods in 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Provision for (Recovery of) Credit Losses 
 The recovery of credit losses was 230,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a provision of 599,000 for the same period in 2023. There were net loan recoveries of 51,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to net loan charge-offs of 196,000 during the same period of 2023. Refer to the Asset Quality section below for further information. 
 Noninterest Income 
 The Company places significant emphasis on diversification of revenue sources rather than relying solely upon interest income. Total noninterest income increased by 10,000 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. Other service fees and commissions contributed 116,000 to the increase in total noninterest income. The increase in noninterest income was offset by a decrease in income from mortgage banking of 96,000. 
 Interchange fees, or swipe fees, are charges that merchants pay to us and other card-issuing banks for processing electronic payment transactions.

Income Tax Expense 
 The Company had income tax expense of 962,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 at an effective tax rate of 24.1 compared to income tax expense of 558,000 with an effective tax rate of 20.6 in the comparable 2023 period. Income taxes computed at the statutory rate are primarily affected by the state income tax expense offset by the eligible amount of interest earned on state and municipal securities, tax-free municipal loans and income earned on bank-owned life insurance. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the effective tax rate increased due to the increase in interest expense disallowance resulting from compliance with the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 TEFRA ). The larger disallowance is due to greater projected interest expense for 2024 compared to 2023 and an adjustment in the TEFRA calculation to differentiate between bank qualified and non-bank qualified bonds. 
 Results of Operations for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 Net Income and Net Income Available to Common Shareholders 
 Uwharrie Capital Corp reported net income of 7.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 6.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 1.3 million.

Net income available to common shareholders is net income less dividends on the aforementioned noncontrolling interest. 
 Net Interest Income 
 Net interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 26.4 million, a 2.3 million increase from the 24.1 million reported for the comparative period in 2023. During the first nine months of 2024, the average yield on our interest-earning assets increased 57 basis points to 5.11 from the same period in 2023, and the average rate we paid for our interest-bearing liabilities increased 70 basis points to 2.40 . These changes resulted in a lower interest rate spread of 2.71 as of September 30, 2024, compared to 2.84 as of September 30, 2023. The Company s net interest margin was 3.38 and 3.32 for the comparable periods in 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Provision for Credit Losses 
 The provision for credit losses was 171,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a provision of 985,000 for the same period in 2023. There were net loan charge-offs of 7,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to net loan charge-offs of 572,000 during the same period of 2023. Refer to the Asset Quality section below for further information. 
 Noninterest Income 
 The Company places significant emphasis on diversification of revenue sources rather than relying solely upon interest income. Total noninterest income decreased by 103,000 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. The primary factor contributing to the overall decline in noninterest income was a decrease of 241,000 in income from mortgage banking. This decrease is the result of a decline in the unclosed mortgage pipeline from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024. 
 Interchange fees, or swipe fees, are charges that merchants pay to us and other card-issuing banks for processing electronic payment transactions. Interchange and card transaction fees consist of income from check card usage, point-of-sale income from PIN-based debit card transactions, ATM service fees, and credit card usage. A comparison of gross interchange and card transaction fees and net of associated network costs for the reported periods is presented in the table below:

Noninterest Expense 
 Noninterest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 1.2 million from the same period in 2023, to 23.5 million. Salaries and employee benefits contributed 1.0 million to the increase in noninterest expense due to salary increases and more commissions paid on increased mortgage production during the 2024 period. 
 Total other noninterest expense increased 111,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. The table below reflects the composition of other noninterest expense for the referenced periods.

Income Tax Expense 
 The Company had income tax expense of 2.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 at an effective tax rate of 22.1 compared to income tax expense of 1.6 million with an effective tax rate of 20.3 in the comparable 2023 period. Income taxes computed at the statutory rate are primarily affected by the state income tax expense offset by the eligible amount of interest earned on state and municipal securities, tax-free municipal loans and income earned on bank-owned life insurance. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the effective tax rate increased due to the increase in interest expense disallowance resulting from compliance with the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 TEFRA ). The larger disallowance is due to greater projected interest expense for 2024 compared to 2023 and an adjustment in the TEFRA calculation to differentiate between bank qualified and non-bank qualified bonds. 
 Asset Quality 
 The Company s allowance for credit losses on loans is established through charges to earnings in the form of a provision for credit losses. The allowance is increased by provisions charged to operations and recoveries of amounts previously charged off and is reduced by recovery of provisions and loans charged off. Management continuously evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses. In evaluating the adequacy of the allowance, management considers the following: the growth, composition and industry diversification of the portfolio; historical loan loss experience; current delinquency levels; adverse situations that may affect a borrower s ability to repay; estimated value of any underlying collateral; prevailing economic conditions; and other relevant factors. 
 The allowance for credit losses on loans represents management s estimate of lifetime credit losses inherent in loans as of the balance sheet date. The allowance for credit losses is estimated by management using relevant available information, from both internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The Company s credit administration function, through a review process, periodically validates the accuracy of the initial risk grade assessment. In addition, as a given loan s credit quality improves or deteriorates, the credit administration department has the responsibility to change the borrower s risk grade accordingly. 
 The Company individually reviews loans with total relationship exposure greater than or equal to 100,000 that are determined to be collateral dependent. These collateral dependent loans are evaluated based on the fair value of the underlying collateral as repayment of the loan is expected to be made through the operation or sale of the collateral. Loans that do not share risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis. When management determines that foreclosure is probable and the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, the expected credit losses are based on the fair value of collateral at the reporting date adjusted for selling costs as appropriate. This evaluation is inherently subjective, as it requires material estimates, including internal and external appraisal services. In addition, regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the allowance for credit losses on loans and may require additions for estimated losses based upon judgments different from those of management. 
 The Company measures expected credit losses for loans on a pooled basis when similar risk characteristics exist. The Company evaluates credit risk in the Consumer segment based upon consumer credit scores and collateral and the Commercial segment based upon loan risk grade and collateral. The allowance for credit losses for each segment is calculated using a Non-Discounted Cash Flow methodology. Management uses a risk-grading program designed to evaluate the credit risk in the loan portfolio. In this program, risk grades are initially assigned by loan officers and then reviewed and monitored by credit administration. This process includes the maintenance of an internally classified loan list that is designed to help management assess the overall quality of the loan portfolio and the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses on loans. In establishing the appropriate classification for specific assets, management considers, among other factors, the estimated value of the underlying collateral, the borrower s ability to repay, the borrower s payment history, and the current delinquent status. 
 32 

Additionally, the allowance for credit losses calculation includes subjective adjustments for qualitative risk factors that are likely to cause estimated credit losses to differ from historical experience. These qualitative adjustments may increase or reduce reserve levels and include adjustments for lending management experience and risk tolerance, loan review and audit results, asset quality and portfolio trends, loan portfolio growth, industry concentrations, trends in underlying collateral, external factors and economic conditions not already captured. 
 At September 30, 2024, the level of our individually assessed loans, which includes all loans in nonaccrual status with total relationship exposure of more than 100,000 of collateral dependency, was 285,000. The allowance for credit losses related to individually evaluated loans was 187,000 at September 30, 2024. 
 The allowance, expressed as a percentage of gross loans held for investment, decreased five basis points from 0.94 at December 31, 2023 to 0.89 at September 30, 2024. The primary driver of the reduction in allowance was the decline in the 10-Year T-Bill forecast which is utilized in the regression model for our probability of default forecast. The ratio of nonaccrual loans to total loans decreased from 0.19 at December 31, 2023 to 0.09 at September 30, 2024, and was related to the 543,000 decrease in nonaccrual loans. Four loans totaling 449,000 were paid off and one loan totaling 16,000 was removed from nonaccrual during the first nine months of 2024, offset by four loans totaling 204,000 that were converted to nonaccrual. Principal payments in the amount of 282,000 were received during the same period. 
 Other real estate owned was 141,000 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 As of September 30, 2024, management believed the level of the allowance for credit losses on loans was appropriate in light of the risk inherent in the loan portfolio. While management believes that it uses the best information available to establish the allowance for credit losses on loans, future adjustments may be necessary and results of operations could be adversely affected if circumstances differ from the assumptions used in making the determinations. Furthermore, while management believes it has established the allowance in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, there can be no assurance that banking regulators, in reviewing the Company s loan portfolio, will not require an adjustment to the allowance for credit losses on loans. In addition, because future events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty, there can be no assurance that the existing allowance is adequate or that increases will not be necessary, should the quality of any loans deteriorate because of the factors discussed herein. Any material increase in the allowance for credit losses on loans may adversely affect the Company s financial condition, results of operations and the value of its securities.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 The objective of the Company s liquidity management policy is to ensure the availability of sufficient cash flows to meet all financial commitments and to capitalize on any opportunities for expansion. Liquidity management addresses the ability to meet deposit withdrawals on demand or at contractual maturity, to repay borrowings as they mature and to fund new loans and investments as opportunities arise. 
 The Company s primary sources of internally generated funds are principal and interest payments on loans, cash flows generated from operations and cash flow generated by investments. Growth in deposits is typically the primary source of funds for loan growth. Estimated uninsured deposits, including deposits collateralized by pledged assets, represented 42.2 of total deposits at September 30, 
 33 

2024 and 36.5 of total deposits at December 31, 2023. The Company and its subsidiary bank have multiple funding sources, in addition to deposits, that can be used to increase liquidity and provide additional financial flexibility. At September 30, 2024, these sources were the subsidiary bank s established federal funds lines with correspondent banks aggregating 38.0 million, with available credit of 38.0 million; an established borrowing relationship with the FHLB, with available credit of 136.3 million; and access to borrowings from the FRB discount window, with available credit of 29.0 million. The Company also has a 3.0 million line of credit with TIB The Independent BankersBank, N.A. The line is held by the holding company and is secured with 100 of the outstanding common shares of the Company s subsidiary bank. As of September 30, 2024, 3.0 million remained available for use on the line of credit.

Banks and bank holding companies, as regulated institutions, must meet required levels of capital. The Federal Reserve, the primary federal regulator of the Company and its subsidiary bank, has adopted minimum capital regulations or guidelines that categorize components and the level of risk associated with various types of assets. 
 The Company continues to maintain capital ratios that support its asset growth. The federal bank regulatory agencies have implemented regulatory capital rules known as Basel III. The Basel III rules require a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets minimum ratio of 4.50 , a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 6.00 , a minimum ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets of 8.00 , and a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4.00 . There is also a capital conservation buffer that requires banks to hold common equity Tier 1 capital in excess of minimum risk-based capital ratios by at least 2.5 to avoid limits on capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers and similar employees. The Company s accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, resulting from unrealized gains and losses, net of income tax, on investment securities available for sale, is excluded from regulatory capital. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company s subsidiary bank continued to exceed minimum capital standards and remained well-capitalized under the applicable rules. 
 The Company s subsidiary bank has a net total of 10.7 million in outstanding Fixed Rate Noncumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock. The preferred stock qualifies as Tier 1 capital at the Bank and pays dividends at an annual rate of 5.30 . The net total of 10.7 million is presented as noncontrolling interest at the Company level and qualifies as Tier 1 capital at the Company. At September 30, 2024, the Company had 29.1 million, net of unamortized debt issuance costs, in subordinated debt outstanding, of which 27.2 million qualifies as Tier 2 capital at the Company level. The Company has made all interest and dividend payments in a timely manner. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 Off-balance sheet arrangements include transactions, agreements or other contractual arrangements to which an unconsolidated entity of the Company is a party and pursuant to which the Company has obligations, including an obligation to provide guarantees on behalf of an unconsolidated entity, or retains an interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity. We currently have no off-balance sheet arrangements of this kind. 
 Derivative financial instruments include futures contracts, forward contracts, interest rate swaps, options contracts, and other financial instruments with similar characteristics. We have not engaged in significant derivative activities through September 30, 2024, with the exception of mortgage banking derivatives. See Note 12 (Mortgage Banking Derivatives) to the Company s Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of mortgage banking derivatives. 
 Contractual Obligations 
 The timing and amount of our contractual obligations has not changed materially since our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 6, 2024.
