Management s Discussion and Analysis 
 
 Overview 
 Earnings Summary U.S. Bancorp and its subsidiaries (the Company reported net income attributable to U.S. Bancorp of 1.7 billion for the third quarter of 2024, or 1.03 per diluted common share, compared with 1.5 billion, or 0.91 per diluted common share, for the third quarter of 2023. Return on average assets and return on average common equity were 1.03 percent and 12.4 percent, respectively, for the third quarter of 2024, compared with 0.91 percent and 11.9 percent, respectively, for the third quarter of 2023. The results for the third quarter of 2023 included the impact of 284 million 213 million net-of-tax) of merger and integration charges associated with the acquisition of MUFG Union Bank, N.A. MUB ), which decreased diluted earnings per common share for the third quarter of 2023 by 0.14. 
 Total net revenue for the third quarter of 2024 was 168 million (2.4 percent) lower than the third quarter of 2023, reflecting a 2.4 percent decrease in net interest income and a 2.4 percent decrease in noninterest income. The decrease in net interest income from the third quarter of 2023 was primarily due to the impact of higher interest rates on deposit mix and pricing, partially offset by higher rates on earning assets and changes in balance sheet composition. The decrease in noninterest income was driven by net losses on the sales of investment securities, lower service charges and lower other noninterest income, partially offset by higher fee revenue across all other categories. 
 Noninterest expense in the third quarter of 2024 was 326 million (7.2 percent) lower than the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to the impact of merger and integration charges in the prior year and lower other noninterest expense, partially offset by higher compensation and employee benefits expense. 
 The provision for credit losses for the third quarter of 2024 was 42 million (8.2 percent) higher than the third quarter of 2023, driven by higher net charge-offs. Net charge-offs in the third quarter of 2024 were 564 million, compared with 420 million in the third quarter of 2023. Refer to Corporate Risk Profile for further information on the provision for credit losses, net charge-offs, nonperforming assets and other factors considered by the Company in assessing the credit quality of the loan portfolio and establishing the allowance for credit losses. 
 Net income attributable to U.S. Bancorp for the first nine months of 2024 was 4.6 billion, or 2.77 per diluted common share, compared with 4.6 billion, or 2.79 per diluted common share, for the first nine months of 2023. Return on average assets and return on average common equity were 0.94 percent and 11.6 percent, respectively, for the first nine months of 2024, compared with 0.92 percent and 12.3 percent, respectively, for the first nine months of 2023. The results for the first nine months of 2024 included the impact of 291 million 218 million net-of-tax) of notable items, including 155 million of merger and integration charges and a 136 million charge for an increase in the FDIC special assessment to recover losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund related to certain 2023 bank failures. Combined, these items 

decreased diluted earnings per common share for the first nine months of 2024 by 0.14. The results for the first nine months of 2023 included the impact of 1.1 billion 828 million net-of-tax) of notable items, including 838 million of merger and integration charges, and 243 million of provision for credit losses and an additional 22 million of losses related to balance sheet repositioning and capital management actions. Combined, these items decreased diluted earnings per common share for the first nine months of 2023 by 0.53. 
 Total net revenue for the first nine months of 2024 was 936 million (4.4 percent) lower than the first nine months of 2023, reflecting an 8.6 percent decrease in net interest income, partially offset by a 2.7 percent increase in noninterest income. The decrease in net interest income from the first nine months of 2023 was primarily due to the impact of higher interest rates on deposit mix and pricing, partially offset by higher rates on earning assets and changes in balance sheet composition. The increase in noninterest income was driven by higher fee revenue across most categories, partially offset by higher net losses on the sales of investment securities, lower service charges and lower other noninterest income. 
 Noninterest expense in the first nine months of 2024 was 777 million (5.7 percent) lower than the first nine months of 2023, primarily due to lower merger and integration charges, partially offset by higher compensation and employee benefits expense and the impact of the FDIC special assessment. 
 The provision for credit losses for the first nine months of 2024 was 85 million (4.8 percent) lower than the first nine months of 2023, driven by the impacts of balance sheet repositioning and capital management actions taken in the second quarter of 2023, partially offset by higher net charge-offs in the current year. Net charge-offs in the first nine months of 2024 were 1.6 billion, compared with 1.4 billion in the first nine months of 2023. Refer to Corporate Risk Profile for further information on the provision for credit losses, net charge-offs, nonperforming assets and other factors considered by the Company in assessing the credit quality of the loan portfolio and establishing the allowance for credit losses. 
 
 Statement of Income Analysis 
 Net Interest Income Net interest income, on a taxable-equivalent basis, was 4.2 billion in the third quarter and 12.2 billion in the first nine months of 2024, representing decreases of 102 million (2.4 percent) and 1.2 billion (8.6 percent), respectively, compared with the same periods of 2023. The decreases were primarily due to the impact of higher interest rates on deposit mix and pricing, partially offset by higher rates on earning assets and changes in balance sheet composition. Average earning assets for the third quarter of 2024 were 1.9 billion (0.3 percent) higher than the third quarter of 2023, reflecting increases in investment securities and other earning assets, partially offset by decreases in loans and interest-bearing deposits with banks. Average earning assets for the first nine months of 2024 were 4.8 billion (0.8 percent) lower than the first nine months of 2023, reflecting a 

4 
 U.S. Bancorp 

decrease in loans, partially offset by increases in investment securities and interest-bearing deposits with banks. The net interest margin, on a taxable-equivalent basis, in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 was 2.74 percent and 2.70 percent, respectively, compared with 2.81 percent and 2.94 percent in the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively. The decreases in net interest margin from the same periods of the prior year were primarily due to the impact of higher interest rates on deposit mix and pricing, partially offset by higher rates on earning assets and changes in balance sheet composition. Refer to the Consolidated Daily Average Balance Sheet and Related Yields and Rates table for further information on net interest income. 
 Average total loans in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 were 2.8 billion (0.7 percent) and 10.8 billion (2.8 percent) lower, respectively, than the same periods of 2023. The decreases were primarily due to lower other retail loans, commercial loans and commercial real estate loans, partially offset by higher credit card loans and residential mortgages. The decreases in average other retail loans were driven by lower automobile loans. The decreases in average commercial loans were primarily due to decreased demand as corporate customers accessed the capital markets. The decreases in average commercial real estate loans were primarily due to payoffs exceeding a reduced level of new originations. The increases in average credit cards loans were primarily driven by higher spend volume. The increases in residential mortgages were primarily driven by originations. 
 Average investment securities in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 were 3.7 billion (2.2 percent) and 2.0 billion (1.2 percent) higher, respectively, than the same periods of 2023, primarily due to balance sheet positioning and liquidity management. 
 Average total deposits for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 were 3.5 billion (0.7 percent) lower and 1.9 billion (0.4 percent) higher, respectively, than the same periods of 2023. Average noninterest-bearing deposits for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 were 16.6 billion (17.0 percent) and 30.5 billion (26.9 percent) lower, respectively, than the same periods of 2023, driven by decreases in Wealth, Corporate, Commercial and Institutional Banking, and Consumer and Business Banking balances. Average total savings deposits for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 were 9.0 billion (2.5 percent) and 20.0 billion (5.7 percent) higher, respectively, than the same periods of 2023, driven by increases in Wealth, Corporate, Commercial and Institutional Banking, and Consumer and Business Banking balances. Average time deposits for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 were 4.1 billion (7.5 percent) and 12.5 billion (28.0 percent) higher, respectively, than the same periods of 2023, mainly due to increases in Consumer and Business Banking balances. Changes in time deposits are primarily related to those deposits managed as an alternative to other funding sources, based largely on relative pricing and liquidity characteristics. 
 Provision for Credit Losses The provision for credit losses was 557 million in the third quarter of 2024, representing an 

increase of 42 million (8.2 percent) from the third quarter of 2023, driven by higher net charge-offs in the current year. Net charge-offs increased 144 million (34.3 percent) in the third quarter of 2024, compared with the third quarter of 2023, reflecting higher credit card, commercial and commercial real estate loan net charge-offs. The provision for credit losses was 1.7 billion in the first nine months of 2024, representing a decrease of 85 million (4.8 percent) from the first nine months of 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by the impacts of balance sheet repositioning and capital management actions in the second quarter of 2023, partially offset by higher net charge-offs in the current year. Net charge-offs increased 148 million (10.3 percent) in the first nine months of 2024, compared with the first nine months of 2023, reflecting higher credit card and commercial loan net charge-offs, partially offset by the impacts of charge-offs in the prior year related to acquired loans and balance sheet repositioning and capital management actions. Refer to Corporate Risk Profile for further information on the provision for credit losses, net charge-offs, nonperforming assets and other factors considered by the Company in assessing the credit quality of the loan portfolio and establishing the allowance for credit losses. 
 Noninterest Income Noninterest income was 2.7 billion in the third quarter and 8.2 billion in the first nine months of 2024, representing a decrease of 66 million (2.4 percent) and an increase of 216 million (2.7 percent), respectively, compared with the same periods of 2023. The decrease in noninterest income in the third quarter of 2024, compared with the third quarter of 2023, was driven by net losses on the sales of investment securities, lower service charges and lower other noninterest income, partially offset by higher commercial products revenue, trust and investment management fees and payment services revenue. The increase in noninterest income in the first nine months of 2024, compared with the first nine months of 2023, was driven by higher commercial products revenue, trust and investment management fees, payment services revenue and mortgage banking revenue, partially offset by higher net losses on the sales of investment securities, lower service charges and lower other noninterest income. Commercial products revenue increased in the current year primarily due to higher corporate bond fees and new product growth. Trust and investment management fees increased primarily due to business growth and favorable market conditions. Payment services revenue increased primarily due to higher merchant processing services revenue due to business volume growth and favorable rates, along with increased card revenue due to favorable rates. Mortgage banking revenue increased in the first nine months of 2024, compared with the first nine months of 2023, primarily driven by a gain on the sale of mortgage servicing rights in the second quarter of 2024, along with the impact of balance sheet repositioning and capital management actions taken in the second quarter of 2023.

 Noninterest Expense Noninterest expense was 4.2 billion in the third quarter and 12.9 billion in the first nine months of 2024, representing decreases of 326 million (7.2 percent) and 777 million (5.7 percent), respectively, from the same periods of 2023. The decreases from the prior year reflected lower merger and integration charges and lower other noninterest expense, partially offset by higher compensation and employee benefits expense. The decrease in noninterest expense in the first nine months of 2024, compared with the first nine months of 2023, was further offset by the impact of the FDIC special assessment in the current year. Compensation and employee benefits expense increased in the current year primarily due to higher commissions and performance-based incentives. Marketing and business development expense increased in the first nine months of 2024, compared with the first nine months of 2023, primarily due to the timing of campaigns. Professional services expense decreased in the first nine months of 2024, compared with the 

first nine months of 2023, primarily due to synergies from the MUB acquisition. 
 Income Tax Expense The provision for income taxes was 350 million (an effective rate of 16.9 percent) for the third quarter and 1.1 billion (an effective rate of 19.7 percent) for the first nine months of 2024, compared with 431 million (an effective rate of 22.0 percent) and 1.3 billion (an effective rate of 21.6 percent) for the same periods of 2023, respectively. The tax rate in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 reflected the impact of favorable settlements.

Balance Sheet Analysis 
 Loans The Company s loan portfolio was 374.2 billion at September 30, 2024, compared with 373.8 billion at December 31, 2023, an increase of 329 million (0.1 percent). The increase was driven by higher residential mortgages and commercial loans, partially offset by lower commercial real estate loans and other retail loans. 
 Residential mortgages held in the loan portfolio increased 2.5 billion (2.2 percent) at September 30, 2024, compared with December 31, 2023, driven by originations. Residential mortgages originated and placed in the Company s loan portfolio include jumbo mortgages and branch-originated first lien home equity loans to borrowers with high credit quality. 
 Commercial loans increased 1.8 billion (1.3 percent) at September 30, 2024, compared with December 31, 2023, primarily due to growth in corporate banking. 
 Credit card loans increased 477 million (1.7 percent) at September 30, 2024, compared with December 31, 2023, primarily driven by higher spend volume. 
 Commercial real estate loans decreased 2.8 billion (5.3 percent) at September 30, 2024, compared with December 31, 2023, primarily due to payoffs exceeding a reduced level of new originations. 
 Other retail loans decreased 1.6 billion (3.5 percent) at September 30, 2024, compared with December 31, 2023, primarily due to a decrease in auto loans. 
 The Company generally retains portfolio loans through maturity; however, the Company s intent may change over time based upon various factors such as ongoing asset/liability management activities, assessment of product profitability, credit risk, liquidity needs, and capital implications. If the Company s intent or ability to hold an existing portfolio loan changes, it is transferred to loans held for sale. 
 Loans Held for Sale Loans held for sale, consisting primarily of residential mortgages to be sold in the secondary market, were 3.2 billion at September 30, 2024, compared with 2.2 billion at December 31, 2023. The increase in loans held for sale was principally due to a higher level of mortgage loan closings in the third quarter of 2024, compared with the fourth 

quarter of 2023. Almost all of the residential mortgage loans the Company originates or purchases for sale follow guidelines that allow the loans to be sold into existing, highly liquid secondary markets, in particular in government agency transactions and to government-sponsored enterprises GSEs ). 
 Investment Securities Investment securities totaled 161.7 billion at September 30, 2024, compared with 153.8 billion at December 31, 2023. The 8.0 billion (5.2 percent) increase was primarily due to net investment purchases driven by balance sheet positioning and liquidity management, along with a 1.2 billion favorable change in net unrealized gains (losses) on available-for-sale investment securities. 
 The Company s available-for-sale investment securities are carried at fair value with changes in fair value reflected in other comprehensive income (loss) unless a portion of a security s unrealized loss is related to credit and an allowance for credit losses is necessary. At September 30, 2024, the Company s net unrealized losses on available-for-sale investment securities were 5.7 billion 4.3 billion net-of-tax), compared with 6.9 billion 5.2 billion net-of-tax) at December 31, 2023. The favorable change in net unrealized gains (losses) was primarily due to increases in the fair value of mortgage-backed securities as a result of changes in interest rates. Gross unrealized losses on available-for-sale investment securities totaled 5.9 billion at September 30, 2024, compared with 7.1 billion at December 31, 2023. When evaluating credit losses, the Company considers various factors such as the nature of the investment security, the credit ratings or financial condition of the issuer, the extent of the unrealized loss, expected cash flows of the underlying collateral, the existence of any government or agency guarantees, and market conditions. At September 30, 2024, the Company had no plans to sell securities with unrealized losses, and believed it was more likely than not that it would not be required to sell such securities before recovery of their amortized cost.

 Deposits Total deposits were 521.1 billion at September 30, 2024, compared with 512.3 billion at December 31, 2023. The 8.8 billion (1.7 percent) increase in total deposits reflected increases in time deposits and total savings deposits, partially offset by a decrease in noninterest-bearing deposits. Time deposits increased 7.1 billion (13.5 percent) at September 30, 2024, compared with December 31, 2023, driven by higher Consumer and Business Banking balances. Changes in time deposits are primarily related to those deposits managed as an alternative to other funding sources, based largely on relative pricing and liquidity characteristics. Money market deposit balances increased 11.6 billion (5.8 percent), primarily due to higher Consumer and Business Banking, and Wealth, Corporate, Commercial and Institutional Banking balances. Savings account balances decreased 6.2 billion (14.3 percent), driven by lower Consumer and Business Banking balances. Interest checking balances decreased 485 million (0.4 percent), primarily due to lower Consumer and Business Banking balances, partially offset by higher Wealth, Corporate, Commercial and Institutional Banking balances. Noninterest-bearing deposits decreased 3.2 billion (3.5 percent) at September 30, 2024, compared with December 31, 2023, primarily driven by a decrease in Wealth, Corporate, Commercial and Institutional Banking balances due to the impact of higher interest rates. 
 Borrowings The Company utilizes both short-term and long-term borrowings as part of its asset/liability management and funding strategies. Short-term borrowings, which include federal funds purchased, commercial paper, repurchase agreements, borrowings secured by high-grade assets and other short-term borrowings, were 23.7 billion at 

September 30, 2024, compared with 15.3 billion at December 31, 2023. The 8.4 billion (55.2 percent) increase in short-term borrowings was primarily due to increases in short-term Federal Home Loan Bank FHLB advances and repurchase agreement balances, partially offset by lower commercial paper balances. Long-term debt was 54.8 billion at September 30, 2024, compared with 51.5 billion at December 31, 2023. The 3.4 billion (6.5 percent) increase was primarily due to 6.1 billion of medium-term note issuances and a 2.5 billion increase in FHLB advances, partially offset by 4.6 billion of medium-term note and 1.0 billion of subordinated note repayments.

 Corporate Risk Profile 
 
 Overview Managing risks is an essential part of successfully operating a financial services company. The Company s Board of Directors has approved a risk management framework which establishes governance and risk management requirements for all risk-taking activities. This framework includes Company and business line risk appetite statements which set boundaries for the types and amount of risk that may be undertaken in pursuing business objectives and initiatives. The Board of Directors, primarily through its Risk Management Committee, oversees performance relative to the risk management framework, risk appetite statements, and other policy requirements. 
 The Executive Risk Committee ERC ), which is chaired by the Chief Risk Officer and includes the Chief Executive Officer and other members of the executive management 

8 
 U.S. Bancorp 

team, oversees execution against the risk management framework and risk appetite statements. The ERC focuses on current and emerging risks, including strategic and reputation risks, by directing timely and comprehensive actions. Senior operating committees have also been established, each responsible for overseeing a specified category of risk. 
 The Company s most prominent risk exposures are credit, interest rate, market, liquidity, operational, compliance, strategic, and reputation. Credit risk is the risk of loss associated with a change in the credit profile or the failure of a borrower or counterparty to meet its contractual obligations. Interest rate risk is the current or prospective risk to earnings and capital, or market valuations, arising from the impact of changes in interest rates. Market risk arises from fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and security prices that may result in changes in the values of financial instruments, such as trading and available-for-sale investment securities, mortgage loans held for sale MLHFS ), mortgage servicing rights MSRs and derivatives that are accounted for on a fair value basis. Liquidity risk is the risk that financial condition or overall safety and soundness is adversely affected by the Company s inability, or perceived inability, to meet its cash flow obligations in a timely and complete manner in either normal or stressed conditions. Operational risk is the risk to current or projected financial condition and resilience arising from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems, people (including human errors or misconduct), or adverse external events, including the risk of loss resulting from breaches in data security. Operational risk can also include the risk of loss due to failures by third parties with which the Company does business. Compliance risk is the risk that the Company may suffer legal or regulatory sanctions, financial losses, and reputational damage if it fails to adhere to compliance requirements and the Company s compliance policies. Strategic risk is the risk to current or projected financial condition and resilience arising from adverse business decisions, poor implementation of business decisions, or lack of responsiveness to changes in the banking industry and operating environment. Reputation risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings, capital, or franchise or enterprise value arising from negative public opinion. This risk may impair the Company s competitiveness by affecting its ability to establish new relationships or services, or continue serving existing relationships. In addition to the risks identified above, other risk factors exist that may impact the Company. Refer to Risk Factors in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, for a detailed discussion of these factors. 
 The Company s Board and management-level governance committees are supported by a three lines of defense model for establishing effective checks and balances. The first line of defense, the business lines, manages risks in conformity with established limits and policy requirements. In turn, business line leaders and their risk officers establish programs to ensure conformity with these limits and policy requirements. The second line of defense, which includes the Chief Risk Officer s organization as well as policy and oversight activities of corporate support functions, translates risk appetite and strategy into actionable risk limits and policies. The second line of defense monitors first line of defense conformity with limits and policies and provides reporting and escalation of 

emerging risks and other concerns to senior management and the Risk Management Committee of the Board of Directors. The third line of defense, internal audit, is responsible for providing the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors and senior management with independent assessment and assurance regarding the effectiveness of the Company s governance, risk management and control processes. 
 Management regularly provides reports to the Risk Management Committee of the Board of Directors. The Risk Management Committee discusses with management the Company s risk management performance and provides a summary of key risks to the entire Board of Directors, covering the status of existing matters, areas of potential future concern and specific information on certain types of loss events. The Risk Management Committee considers quarterly reports by management assessing the Company s performance relative to the risk appetite statements and the associated risk limits, including: 
 Macroeconomic environment and other qualitative considerations, such as regulatory and compliance changes, litigation developments, geopolitical events, and technology and cybersecurity; 
 Credit measures, including adversely rated and nonperforming loans, leveraged transactions, credit concentrations and lending limits; 
 Interest rate and market risk, including market value and net income simulation, and trading-related Value at Risk VaR 
 Liquidity risk, including funding projections under various stressed scenarios; 
 Operational and compliance risk, including losses stemming from events such as fraud, processing errors, control breaches, breaches in data security or adverse business decisions, as well as reporting on technology performance, and various legal and regulatory compliance measures; 
 Capital ratios and projections, including regulatory measures and stressed scenarios; and 
 Strategic and reputation risk considerations, impacts and responses. 
 
 Credit Risk Management The Company s strategy for credit risk management includes well-defined, centralized credit policies, uniform underwriting criteria, and ongoing risk monitoring and review processes for all commercial and consumer credit exposures. The strategy also emphasizes diversification on a geographic, industry and customer level, regular credit examinations and management reviews of loans exhibiting deterioration of credit quality. In evaluating its credit risk, the Company considers changes, if any, in underwriting activities, the loan portfolio composition (including product mix and geographic, industry or customer-specific factors), collateral values, trends in loan performance and macroeconomic factors, such as changes in unemployment rates, gross domestic product levels, inflation, interest rates and consumer bankruptcy filings. The Risk Management Committee oversees the Company s credit risk management process. 
 In addition, credit quality ratings, as defined by the Company, are an important part of the Company s overall 

U.S. Bancorp 9 

credit risk management and evaluation of its allowance for credit losses. Loans with a pass rating represent those loans not classified on the Company s rating scale for problem credits, as minimal credit risk has been identified. Loans with a special mention or classified rating (defined by internally assessed rating or exception based monitoring credits in consumer lending and small business loans that are 90 days or more past due and still accruing, nonaccrual loans and loans in a junior lien position that are current but are behind a first lien position on nonaccrual), encompass all loans held by the Company that it considers to have a potential or well-defined weakness that may put full collection of contractual cash flows at risk. The Company s internal credit quality ratings for consumer loans are primarily based on delinquency and nonperforming status. Refer to Note 4 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Company s loan portfolios including internal credit quality ratings. In addition, refer to Management s Discussion and Analysis Credit Risk Management in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, for a more detailed discussion on credit risk management processes. 
 The Company manages its credit risk, in part, through diversification of its loan portfolio which is achieved through limit setting by product type criteria, such as industry, geography and identification of credit concentrations. The Company categorizes its loan portfolio into two segments, which is the level at which it develops and documents a systematic methodology to determine the allowance for credit losses. The Company s two loan portfolio segments are commercial lending and consumer lending. 
 The commercial lending segment includes loans and leases made to small business, middle market, large corporate, commercial real estate, financial institution, non-profit and public sector customers. Key risk characteristics relevant to commercial lending segment loans include the industry and geography of the borrower s business, purpose of the loan, repayment source, borrower s debt capacity and financial flexibility, loan covenants, and nature of pledged collateral, if any, as well as macroeconomic factors such as unemployment rates, gross domestic product levels, corporate bond spreads and long-term interest rates. These risk characteristics, among others, are considered in determining estimates about the likelihood of default by the borrowers and the severity of loss in the event of default. The Company considers these risk characteristics in assigning internal risk ratings to, or forecasting losses on, these loans, which are the significant factors in determining the allowance for credit losses for loans in the commercial lending segment. 
 The consumer lending segment represents loans and leases made to consumer customers, including residential mortgages, credit card loans, and other retail loans such as revolving consumer lines, auto loans and leases and home equity loans and lines. Key risk characteristics relevant to consumer lending segment loans primarily relate to the borrowers capacity and willingness to repay and include unemployment rates, consumer bankruptcy filings, household debt levels, real disposable income and other macroeconomic factors, customer payment history and credit scores, effect of higher interest rates on variable rate or adjustable rate loans, and in some cases, updated loan-to-value LTV information 

reflecting current market conditions on secured loans. These and other risk characteristics are reflected in forecasts of delinquency levels, bankruptcies and losses which are the primary factors in determining the allowance for credit losses for the consumer lending segment. 
 The Company further disaggregates its loan portfolio segments into various classes based on their underlying risk characteristics. The two classes within the commercial lending segment are commercial loans and commercial real estate loans. The three classes within the consumer lending segment are residential mortgages, credit card loans and other retail loans. 
 The Company s consumer lending segment utilizes several distinct business processes and channels to originate consumer credit, including traditional branch lending, mobile and online banking, indirect lending, alliance partnerships and correspondent banks. Each distinct underwriting and origination activity manages unique credit risk characteristics and prices its loan production commensurate with the differing risk profiles. 
 Residential mortgage originations are generally limited to prime borrowers and are performed through the Company s branches, loan production offices, mobile and online services, and a wholesale network of originators. The Company may retain residential mortgage loans it originates on its balance sheet or sell the loans into the secondary market while retaining the servicing rights and customer relationships. Utilizing the secondary markets enables the Company to effectively reduce its credit and other asset/liability risks. For residential mortgages that are retained in the Company s portfolio and for home equity and second mortgages, credit risk is managed by adherence to LTV and borrower credit criteria during the underwriting process. 
 The Company estimates updated LTV information on its outstanding residential mortgages quarterly, based on a method that combines automated valuation model updates and relevant home price indices. LTV is the ratio of the loan s outstanding principal balance to the current estimate of property value. For home equity and second mortgages, combined loan-to-value CLTV is the combination of the first mortgage original principal balance and the second lien outstanding principal balance, relative to the current estimate of property value. Certain loans do not have an LTV or CLTV, primarily due to lack of availability of relevant automated valuation model and/or home price indices values, or lack of necessary valuation data on acquired loans.

 (b) Includes revolving credit, installment and automobile loans. 
 
 Modified Loans In certain circumstances, the Company may modify the terms of a loan to maximize the collection of amounts due when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulties or is expected to experience difficulties in the near-term. In most cases the modification is either a concessionary reduction in interest rate, extension of the maturity date or other concessionary modification of loan terms that would otherwise not be considered. 
 Modified loans accrue interest if the borrower complies with the revised terms and conditions and has demonstrated repayment performance at a level commensurate with the modified terms over several payment cycles, which is generally six months or greater. 
 The Company continues to work with borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulties to modify their loans. Many of the Company s loan modifications are determined on a case-by-case basis in connection with ongoing loan collection processes. The modifications vary within each of the Company s loan classes. Commercial lending segment modifications generally include extensions of the maturity date and may be accompanied by an increase or decrease to the interest rate. The Company may also work with the borrower to make other changes to the loan to mitigate losses, such as 

obtaining additional collateral and/or guarantees to support the loan. 
 The Company has also implemented certain residential mortgage loan modification programs. The Company modifies residential mortgage loans under Federal Housing Administration, United States Department of Veterans Affairs, and its own internal programs. Under these programs, the Company offers qualifying homeowners the opportunity to permanently modify their loan and achieve more affordable monthly payments. These modifications may include adjustments to interest rates, conversion of adjustable rates to fixed rates, extensions of maturity dates or deferrals of payments, capitalization of accrued interest and/or outstanding advances, or in limited situations, partial forgiveness of loan principal. In some instances, participation in residential mortgage loan modification programs requires the customer to complete a short-term trial period. A permanent loan modification is contingent on the customer successfully completing the trial period arrangement, and the loan documents are not modified until that time. 
 Credit card and other retail loan modifications are generally part of distinct modification programs providing 

U.S. Bancorp 13 

customers modification solutions over a specified time period, generally up to 60 months. 
 The Company also makes short-term modifications, in limited circumstances, to assist borrowers experiencing temporary hardships. Short-term consumer lending modification programs include payment reductions, deferrals of up to three past due payments, and the ability to return to current status if the borrower makes required payments. The Company may also make short-term modifications to commercial lending loans, with the most common modification being an extension of the maturity date of three months or less. Such extensions generally are used when the maturity date is imminent and the borrower is experiencing some level of financial stress, but the Company believes the borrower will pay all contractual amounts owed. 
 Nonperforming Assets The level of nonperforming assets represents another indicator of the Company s risk within the loan portfolio. Nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans, modified loans not performing in accordance with modified terms and not accruing interest, modified loans that have not met the performance period required to return to accrual status, other real estate owned OREO and other nonperforming assets owned by the Company. Interest 

payments collected from assets on nonaccrual status are generally applied against the principal balance and not recorded as income. However, interest income may be recognized for interest payments received if the remaining carrying amount of the loan is believed to be collectible. 
 At September 30, 2024, total nonperforming assets were 1.8 billion, compared to 1.5 billion at December 31, 2023. The 354 million (23.7 percent) increase in nonperforming assets was primarily due to higher nonperforming commercial and commercial real estate loans, including the commercial real estate office sector. Office nonperforming loans as a percent of total office loans increased to 12.1 percent at September 30, 2024, compared to 7.6 percent at December 31, 2023. The ratio of total nonperforming assets to total loans and other real estate was 0.49 percent at September 30, 2024, compared with 0.40 percent at December 31, 2023. 
 OREO was 21 million at September 30, 2024, compared with 26 million at December 31, 2023, and was related to foreclosed properties that previously secured loan balances. These balances exclude foreclosed GNMA loans whose repayments are primarily insured by the Federal Housing Administration or guaranteed by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs.

 Analysis of Loan Net Charge-offs Total loan net charge-offs were 564 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared with 420 million for the third quarter of 2023. The increase reflected higher credit card, commercial and commercial real estate loan net charge-offs. Total loan net charge-offs were 1.6 billion for the first nine months of 2024, compared with 1.4 billion for the first nine months of 2023, reflecting higher 

credit card and commercial loan net charge-offs in the current year, partially offset by the impacts in the prior year of charge-offs on acquired loans and charge-offs related to balance sheet repositioning and capital management actions. The ratio of total loan net charge-offs to average loans outstanding on an annualized basis for the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 was 0.60 percent and 0.57 percent, respectively, 

16 
 U.S. Bancorp 

compared with 0.44 percent and 0.50 percent, respectively, for the same periods of 2023. 
 Analysis and Determination of the Allowance for Credit Losses The allowance for credit losses is established for current expected credit losses on the Company s loan and lease portfolio, including unfunded credit commitments. The allowance considers expected losses for the remaining lives of the applicable assets, inclusive of expected recoveries. The allowance for credit losses is increased through provisions charged to earnings and reduced by net charge-offs. 
 Management evaluates the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses on a quarterly basis. Multiple economic scenarios are considered over a three-year reasonable and supportable forecast period, which includes increasing consideration of historical loss experience over years two and three. These economic scenarios are constructed with interrelated projections of multiple economic variables, and loss estimates are produced that consider the historical correlation of those economic variables with credit losses. After the forecast period, the Company fully reverts to long-term historical loss experience, adjusted for prepayments and characteristics of the current loan and lease portfolio, to estimate losses over the remaining life of the portfolio. The economic scenarios are updated at least quarterly and are designed to provide a range of reasonable estimates from better to worse than current expectations. Scenarios are weighted based on the Company s expectation of economic conditions for the foreseeable future and reflect significant judgment and consideration of economic forecast uncertainty. Final loss estimates also consider factors affecting credit losses not reflected in the scenarios, due to the unique aspects of current conditions and expectations. These factors may include, but are not limited to, changes in borrower behavior or conditions in specific lending segments, loan servicing practices, regulatory guidance, and/or fiscal and monetary policy actions. 
 Because business processes and credit risks associated with unfunded credit commitments are essentially the same as for loans, the Company utilizes similar processes to estimate its liability for unfunded credit commitments, which is included in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Both the allowance for loan losses and the liability for unfunded credit commitments are included in the Company s analysis of credit losses and reported reserve ratios. 
 The allowance recorded for credit losses utilizes forward-looking expected loss models to consider a variety of factors affecting lifetime credit losses. These factors include, but are not limited to, macroeconomic variables such as unemployment rates, real estate prices, gross domestic product levels, inflation, interest rates, and corporate bond spreads, as well as loan and borrower characteristics, such as internal risk ratings on commercial loans and consumer credit scores, delinquency status, collateral type and available valuation information, consideration of end-of-term losses on lease residuals, and the remaining term of the loan, adjusted for expected prepayments. For each loan portfolio, including those loans modified under various loan modification programs, model estimates are adjusted as necessary to consider any relevant changes in portfolio composition, lending policies, underwriting standards, risk management practices, economic conditions or other factors that may affect 

the accuracy of the model. Expected credit loss estimates also include consideration of expected cash recoveries on loans previously charged-off or expected recoveries on collateral-dependent loans where recovery is expected through sale of the collateral at fair value less selling costs. Where loans do not exhibit similar risk characteristics, an individual analysis is performed to consider expected credit losses. 
 For loans and leases that do not share similar risk characteristics with a pool of loans, the Company establishes individually assessed reserves. Reserves for individual commercial nonperforming loans greater than 5 million in the commercial lending segment are analyzed utilizing expected cash flows discounted using the original effective interest rate, the observable market price of the loan, or the fair value of the collateral, less selling costs, for collateral-dependent loans as appropriate. 
 When evaluating the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses for any loans and lines in a junior lien position, the Company considers the delinquency and modification status of the first lien, based on either servicing data for first lien accounts serviced by the Company or the status of first lien mortgage accounts reported on customer credit bureau files when the first lien is not serviced by the Company. This information is considered within the overall assessment of economic conditions, problem loans, recent loss experience and other factors in determining the allowance for credit losses. 
 When a loan portfolio is purchased, the acquired loans are divided into those considered purchased with more than insignificant credit deterioration PCD and those not considered PCD. An allowance is established for each population and considers product mix, risk characteristics of the portfolio and delinquency status and refreshed LTV ratios when possible. PCD loans also consider whether the loan has experienced a charge-off, bankruptcy or significant deterioration since origination. The allowance established for purchased loans not considered PCD is recognized through provision expense upon acquisition, whereas the allowance established for loans considered PCD at acquisition is offset by an increase in the basis of the acquired loans. Any subsequent increases and decreases in the allowance related to purchased loans, regardless of PCD status, are recognized through provision expense, with charge-offs charged to the allowance. The Company had a total net book balance of 2.7 billion of PCD loans, primarily related to the MUB acquisition, included in its loan portfolio at September 30, 2024. 
 The Company s methodology for determining the appropriate allowance for credit losses also considers the imprecision inherent in the methodologies used and allocated to the various loan portfolios. As a result, amounts determined under the methodologies described above are adjusted by management to consider the potential impact of other qualitative factors not captured in quantitative model adjustments which include, but are not limited to, the following: model imprecision, imprecision in economic scenario assumptions, and emerging risks related to either changes in the economic environment that are affecting specific portfolios, or changes in portfolio concentrations over time that may affect model performance. The consideration of these items results in adjustments to allowance amounts included in 

U.S. Bancorp 17 

the Company s allowance for credit losses for each loan portfolio. 
 Although the Company determined the amount of each element of the allowance separately and considers this process to be an important credit management tool, the entire allowance for credit losses is available for the entire loan portfolio. The actual amount of losses can vary significantly from the estimated amounts. 
 At September 30, 2024, the allowance for credit losses was 7.9 billion, compared with an allowance of 7.8 billion at December 31, 2023. The 88 million (1.1 percent) increase in the allowance for credit losses at September 30, 2024, compared with December 31, 2023, was primarily driven by credit migration in consumer and small business cards and portfolio growth. The Company continued to monitor economic uncertainty related to interest rates, inflationary pressures and other economic factors that may affect the financial strength of corporate and consumer borrowers. The Company also continued to monitor the commercial real estate office portfolio and has maintained an allowance to loan coverage ratio of over 10 percent at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. In addition to these broad economic factors, expected loss estimates considered various factors including customer specific information impacting changes in risk ratings, projected delinquencies and the impact of economic deterioration on selected borrowers liquidity and ability to repay. 
 The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to period-end loans was 2.12 percent at September 30, 2024, compared with 2.10 percent at December 31, 2023. The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to nonperforming loans was 438 percent at September 30, 2024, compared with 541 percent at December 31, 2023. The ratio of the allowance for credit losses to annualized loan net charge-offs was 353 percent at September 30, 2024, compared with 411 percent of full year 2023 net charge-offs at December 31, 2023. 
 The allowance for credit losses related to commercial lending segment loans increased 24 million during the first nine months of 2024, reflecting credit downgrades in 

commercial and commercial real estate portfolios, partially offset by reduced portfolio exposures. 
 The allowance for credit losses related to consumer lending segment loans increased 64 million during the first nine months of 2024, due to credit migration in credit card portfolios, partially offset by favorability in residential real estate secured portfolios related to strength in home values. 
 Economic conditions considered in estimating the allowance for credit losses at September 30, 2024 included changes in projected gross domestic product and unemployment levels. These factors were evaluated through a combination of quantitative calculations using multiple economic scenarios and additional qualitative assessments that considered the degree of economic uncertainty in the current environment. The projected unemployment rates for 2024 considered in the estimate ranged from 3.6 percent to 6.2 percent. 
 
 The following table summarizes the baseline forecast for key economic variables the Company used in its estimate of the allowance for credit losses at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:

Residual Value Risk Management The Company manages its risk to changes in the residual value of leased vehicles, office and business equipment, and other assets through disciplined residual valuation at the inception of a lease, diversification of its leased assets, regular residual asset valuation reviews and monitoring of residual value gains or losses upon the disposition of assets. As of September 30, 2024, no significant change in the amount of residual values or concentration of the portfolios had occurred since December 31, 2023. Refer to Management s Discussion and Analysis Residual Value Risk Management in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, for further discussion on residual value risk management. 
 
 Operational Risk Management The Company operates in many different businesses in diverse markets and relies on the ability of its employees and systems to process a high number of transactions. Operational risk is inherent in all business activities, and the management of this risk is important to the achievement of the Company s objectives. Business lines have direct and primary responsibility and accountability for identifying, controlling, and monitoring operational risks embedded in their business activities, including those additional or increased risks created by economic and financial disruptions. 
 The Company maintains a system of controls with the objective of providing proper transaction authorization and execution, proper system operations, proper oversight of third parties with whom it does business, safeguarding of assets from misuse or theft, and ensuring the reliability and security of financial and other data. The Company also maintains a cybersecurity risk program which provides centralized planning and management of related and interdependent work with a focus on risks from cybersecurity threats. The Company's cybersecurity risk program is integrated into the Company's overall business and operational strategies and requires that the Company allocate appropriate resources to maintain the program. Refer to Management s Discussion and Analysis Operational Risk Management in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, for further discussion on operational risk management. 
 
 Compliance Risk Management The Company may suffer legal or regulatory sanctions, material financial loss, or damage to its reputation if it fails to comply with laws, regulations, rules, standards of good practice, and codes of conduct, including those related to compliance with Bank Secrecy Act/anti-money laundering requirements, sanctions compliance requirements as administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, consumer protection and other requirements. The Company has controls and processes in place for the assessment, identification, monitoring, management and reporting of compliance risks and issues, including those created or increased by economic and financial disruptions. Refer to Management s Discussion and Analysis Compliance Risk Management in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, for further discussion on compliance risk management. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk Management In the banking industry, changes in interest rates are a significant risk that can impact 

earnings as well as the safety and soundness of an entity. The Company manages its exposure to changes in interest rates through asset and liability management activities within guidelines established by its Asset Liability Management Committee ALCO and approved by the Board of Directors. The ALCO has the responsibility for approving and overseeing compliance with the ALCO management policies, including interest rate risk exposure. One way the Company measures and analyzes its interest rate risk is through analysis of net interest income sensitivities across a range of scenarios. 
 Net interest income sensitivity analysis includes evaluating all of the Company s assets and liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments, inclusive of new business activity, under various interest rate scenarios that differ in the direction, amount and speed of change over time, as well as the overall shape of the yield curve. The balance sheet includes assumptions regarding loan and deposit volumes and pricing which are based on quantitative analysis, historical trends and management outlook and strategies. Deposit balances, mix and pricing are dynamic across interest rate scenarios and will change both with the absolute level of rates as well as the assumed interest rate shock. Deposit pricing changes, commonly referred to as the deposit beta, represents the amount by which the Company s interest-bearing deposit rates have or will change given a change in short-term market rates. Base case and net interest income sensitivities are reviewed monthly by the ALCO and are used to guide asset/liability management strategies. 
 The Company also manages interest rate sensitivity by utilizing market value of equity modeling, which measures the degree to which the market values of the Company s assets and liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments will change given a change in interest rates. Management measures the impact of changes in market values due to interest rates under a number of scenarios, including immediate and sustained parallel shifts, and flattening or steepening of the yield curve. The Company manages its interest rate risk position by holding assets with desired interest rate risk characteristics on its balance sheet, executing certain pricing strategies for loans and deposits and deploying investment portfolio, funding and derivative strategies. 
 Table 9 summarizes the projected impact to net interest income over the next 12 months of various potential interest rate changes. The sensitivity of the projected impact to net interest income over the next 12 months is dependent on balance sheet growth, product mix, deposit behavior, pricing and funding decisions. From December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024, interest rate sensitivity to higher rates decreased, primarily due to deposit migration into higher yielding products. As of September 30, 2024, the Company is relatively neutral to further parallel upward moves in interest rates while the sensitivity to lower rates has improved driven by the projected repricing of the deposit portfolio in declining rate scenarios. While the Company utilizes models and assumptions based on historical information and expected behaviors, actual outcomes could vary significantly. For larger interest rate shock scenarios, mortgage assets and deposits are expected to behave in a non-linear manner resulting in varying impacts to net interest income in those scenarios.

 Use of Derivatives to Manage Interest Rate and Other Risks To manage the sensitivity of earnings and capital to interest rate, prepayment, credit, price and foreign currency fluctuations (asset and liability management positions), the Company enters into derivative transactions. The Company uses derivatives for asset and liability management purposes primarily in the following ways: 
 To convert fixed-rate debt and available-for-sale investment securities from fixed-rate payments to floating-rate payments; 
 To convert floating-rate loans and debt from floating-rate payments to fixed-rate payments; 
 To mitigate changes in value of the Company s unfunded mortgage loan commitments, funded MLHFS and MSRs; 
 To mitigate remeasurement volatility of foreign currency denominated balances; and 
 To mitigate the volatility of the Company s net investment in foreign operations driven by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. 
 In addition, the Company enters into interest rate, foreign exchange and commodity derivative contracts to support the business requirements of its customers (customer-related positions). The Company minimizes the market, funding and liquidity risks of customer-related positions by either entering into similar offsetting positions with broker-dealers, or on a portfolio basis by entering into other derivative or non-derivative financial instruments that partially or fully offset the exposure from these customer-related positions. The Company may enter into derivative contracts that are either exchange-traded, centrally cleared through clearinghouses or over-the-counter. The Company does not utilize derivatives for speculative purposes. 
 The Company does not designate all of the derivatives that it enters into for risk management purposes as accounting hedges because of the inefficiency of applying the accounting requirements and may instead elect fair value accounting for the related hedged items. In particular, the Company enters into interest rate swaps, swaptions, forward commitments to buy to-be-announced securities TBAs ), U.S. Treasury and Eurodollar futures and options on U.S. Treasury futures to mitigate fluctuations in the value of its MSRs, but does not designate those derivatives as accounting hedges. Refer to Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding MSRs, including management of the changes in fair value. 
 Additionally, the Company uses forward commitments to sell TBAs and other commitments to sell residential mortgage loans at specified prices to economically hedge the interest rate risk in its residential mortgage loan production activities. The forward commitments to sell and the unfunded mortgage loan commitments on loans intended to be sold are considered derivatives under the accounting guidance related 

to accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities. The Company has elected the fair value option for the MLHFS. 
 Derivatives are subject to credit risk associated with counterparties to the contracts. Credit risk associated with derivatives is measured by the Company based on the probability of counterparty default. The Company manages the credit risk of its derivative positions by diversifying its positions among various counterparties, by entering into master netting arrangements, and, where possible, by requiring collateral arrangements. The Company may also transfer counterparty credit risk related to interest rate swaps to third parties through the use of risk participation agreements. In addition, certain interest rate swaps, interest rate forwards and credit contracts are required to be centrally cleared through clearinghouses to further mitigate counterparty credit risk. The Company also mitigates the credit risk of its derivative positions, as well as the credit risk on loans or lending portfolios, through the use of credit contracts. 
 For additional information on derivatives and hedging activities, refer to Notes 12 and 13 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 Market Risk Management In addition to interest rate risk, the Company is exposed to other forms of market risk, principally related to trading activities which support customers strategies to manage their own foreign currency, interest rate risk, commodities risk and funding activities. For purposes of its internal capital adequacy assessment process, the Company considers risk arising from its trading activities, as well as the remeasurement volatility of foreign currency denominated balances included on its Consolidated Balance Sheet (collectively, Covered Positions ), employing methodologies consistent with the requirements of regulatory rules for market risk. The Company s Market Risk Committee MRC ), within the framework of the ALCO, oversees market risk management. The MRC monitors and reviews the Company s Covered Positions and establishes policies for market risk management, including exposure limits for each portfolio. The Company uses a VaR approach to measure general market risk. Theoretically, VaR represents the statistical risk of loss the Company has to adverse market movements over a one-day time horizon. The Company uses the Historical Simulation method to calculate VaR for its Covered Positions measured at the ninety-ninth percentile using a one-year look-back period for distributions derived from past market data. The market factors used in the calculations include those pertinent to market risks inherent in the underlying trading portfolios, principally those that affect the Company s corporate bond trading business, foreign currency transaction business, client derivatives business, loan trading business and municipal securities business, as well as those inherent in the Company s foreign denominated balances and the derivatives used to mitigate the related measurement volatility. On average, the Company expects the 

U.S. Bancorp 21 

one-day VaR to be exceeded by actual losses two to three times per year related to these positions. The Company monitors the accuracy of internal VaR models and modeling processes by back-testing model performance, regularly updating the historical data used by the VaR models and regular model validations to assess the accuracy of the models input, processing, and reporting components. All models are required to be independently reviewed and approved prior to being placed in use. If the Company were to experience market losses in excess of the estimated VaR more often than expected, the VaR models and associated assumptions would be analyzed and adjusted. 
 The average, high, low and period-end one-day VaR amounts for the Company s Covered Positions were as follows: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30 (Dollars in Millions) 2024 2023 Average 3 4 High 4 7 Low 2 3 Period-end 3 3 
 The Company did not experience any actual losses for its combined Covered Positions that exceeded VaR during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The Company stress tests its market risk measurements to provide management with perspectives on market events that may not be captured by its VaR models, including worst case historical market movement combinations that have not necessarily occurred on the same date. 
 The Company calculates Stressed VaR using the same underlying methodology and model as VaR, except that a historical continuous one-year look-back period is utilized that reflects a period of significant financial stress appropriate to the Company s Covered Positions. The period selected by the Company includes the significant market volatility of the last four months of 2008. 
 The average, high, low and period-end one-day Stressed VaR amounts for the Company s Covered Positions were as follows: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30 (Dollars in Millions) 2024 2023 Average 10 11 High 16 16 Low 7 6 Period-end 11 7 
 Valuations of positions in client derivatives and foreign currency activities are based on discounted cash flow or other valuation techniques using market-based assumptions. These valuations are compared to third-party quotes or other market prices to determine if there are significant variances. Significant variances are approved by senior management in the Company s corporate functions. Valuation of positions in the corporate bond trading, loan trading and municipal securities businesses are based on trader marks. These trader marks are evaluated against third-party prices, with significant variances approved by senior management in the Company s corporate functions. 
 The Company also measures the market risk of its hedging activities related to residential MLHFS and MSRs using the Historical Simulation method. The VaRs are measured at the 

ninety-ninth percentile and employ factors pertinent to the market risks inherent in the valuation of the assets and hedges. A one-year look-back period is used to obtain past market data for the models. 
 The average, high and low VaR amounts for the residential MLHFS and related hedges and the MSRs and related hedges were as follows: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30 (Dollars in Millions) 2024 2023 Residential Mortgage Loans Held For Sale and Related Hedges Average 1 1 High 3 2 Low 1 Mortgage Servicing Rights and Related Hedges Average 2 8 High 3 12 Low 1 2 
 
 Liquidity Risk Management The Company s liquidity risk management process is designed to identify, measure, and manage the Company s funding and liquidity risk to meet its daily funding needs and to address expected and unexpected changes in its funding requirements. The Company engages in various activities to manage its liquidity risk. These activities include diversifying its funding sources, stress testing, and holding readily-marketable assets which can be used as a source of liquidity if needed. In addition, the Company s profitable operations, sound credit quality and strong credit ratings and capital position have enabled it to develop a large and reliable base of core deposit funding within its market areas and in domestic and global capital markets. 
 The Company s Board of Directors approves the Company s liquidity policy. The Risk Management Committee of the Company s Board of Directors oversees the Company s liquidity risk management process and approves a contingency funding plan. The ALCO reviews the Company s liquidity policy and limits, and regularly assesses the Company s ability to meet funding requirements arising from adverse company-specific or market events. 
 The Company regularly projects its funding needs under various stress scenarios and maintains a contingency funding plan consistent with the Company s access to diversified sources of contingent funding. The Company maintains a substantial level of total available liquidity in the form of on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet funding sources. These liquidity sources include cash at the Federal Reserve Bank and certain European central banks, unencumbered liquid assets, and capacity to borrow from the FHLB and at the Federal Reserve Bank s Discount Window. Unencumbered liquid assets in the Company s investment securities portfolio provide asset liquidity through the Company s ability to sell the securities or pledge and borrow against them. Refer to Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and Balance Sheet Analysis for further information on investment securities maturities and trends. Asset liquidity is further enhanced by the Company s practice of pledging loans to 

22 
 U.S. Bancorp 

access secured borrowing facilities through the FHLB and Federal Reserve Bank. 
 
 The following table summarizes the Company s total available liquidity from on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet funding sources: 
 (Dollars in Millions) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Cash held at the Federal Reserve 
 Bank and other central banks 
 65,055 52,403 Available investment securities 74,736 34,220 Borrowing capacity from the 
 Federal Reserve Bank and 
 FHLB 
 161,380 215,763 Total available liquidity 301,171 302,386 
 
 Borrowing capacity from the Federal Reserve Bank and FHLB declined from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024 primarily due to the expiration of the Federal Reserve Bank s Bank Term Funding Program BTFP ). This decline was partially offset by an increase in available investment securities as a portion of the securities previously pledged through the BTFP were made available for sale or pledging. 
 The Company s diversified deposit base provides a sizeable source of relatively stable and low-cost funding, while reducing the Company s reliance on the wholesale markets. Total deposits were 521.1 billion at September 30, 2024, compared with 512.3 billion at December 31, 2023. Average noninterest-bearing deposit balances for the third quarter of 2024 decreased 17.0 percent and 3.0 percent compared with the third quarter of 2023 and second quarter of 2024, respectively, reflecting the shift of noninterest-bearing balances into interest-bearing deposit products resulting from the higher interest rate environment. The decrease from the second quarter of 2024 reflected a slowing shift into interest-bearing deposits as the Company continued to emphasize relationship-based deposit generation. Average total deposits for both the third quarter of 2024 and third quarter of 2023 funded approximately 77 percent of the Company s total assets for these same periods. Refer to Balance Sheet Analysis for further information on the Company s deposits. 
 Additional funding is provided by long-term debt and short-term borrowings. Long-term debt was 54.8 billion at September 30, 2024, and is an important funding source because of its multi-year borrowing structure. Short-term borrowings were 23.7 billion at September 30, 2024, and supplement the Company s other funding sources. Refer to Balance Sheet Analysis for further information on the Company s long-term debt and short-term borrowings. 
 In addition to assessing liquidity risk on a consolidated basis, the Company monitors the parent company s liquidity. The parent company s routine funding requirements consist primarily of operating expenses, dividends paid to shareholders, debt service, repurchases of common stock and funds used for acquisitions. The parent company obtains funding to meet its obligations from dividends collected from its subsidiaries and the issuance of debt and capital securities. The Company establishes limits for the minimal number of months into the future where the parent company can meet existing and forecasted obligations with cash and securities held that can be readily monetized. The Company 

measures and manages this limit in both normal and adverse conditions. The Company maintains sufficient funding to meet expected capital and debt service obligations for 24 months without the support of dividends from subsidiaries and assuming access to the wholesale markets is maintained. The Company maintains sufficient liquidity to meet its capital and debt service obligations for 12 months under adverse conditions without the support of dividends from subsidiaries or access to the wholesale markets. The parent company is currently in excess of required liquidity minimums. 
 At September 30, 2024, parent company long-term debt outstanding was 35.1 billion, compared with 34.3 billion at December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to 6.1 billion of medium-term note issuances, partially offset by 4.6 billion of medium-term note and 1.0 billion of subordinated note repayments. As of September 30, 2024, there was no parent company debt scheduled to mature in the remainder of 2024. Future debt maturities may be met through medium-term note and capital security issuances and dividends from subsidiaries, as well as from parent company cash and cash equivalents. 
 The Company is subject to a regulatory Liquidity Coverage Ratio LCR requirement which requires large banking organizations to maintain an adequate level of unencumbered high quality liquid assets to meet estimated liquidity needs over a 30-day stressed period. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company s average daily LCR was 106.9 percent and 109.2 percent, respectively. The Company was compliant with this requirement for both of these periods. 
 The Company is also subject to a regulatory Net Stable Funding Ratio NSFR requirement which requires large banking organizations to maintain a minimum level of stable funding based on the liquidity characteristics of their assets, commitments, and derivative exposures over a one-year time horizon. The Company was compliant with this requirement at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 Refer to Management s Discussion and Analysis Liquidity Risk Management in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, for further discussion on liquidity risk management. 
 European Exposures The Company provides merchant processing and corporate trust services in Europe either directly or through banking affiliations in Europe. Revenue generated from sources in Europe represented approximately 3 percent of the Company s total net revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Operating cash for these businesses is deposited on a short-term basis typically with certain European central banks. For deposits placed at other European banks, exposure is mitigated by the Company placing deposits at multiple banks and managing the amounts on deposit at any bank based on institution-specific deposit limits. At September 30, 2024, the Company had an aggregate amount on deposit with European banks of approximately 7.6 billion, predominately with the Central Bank of Ireland and Bank of England. 
 In addition, the Company provides financing to domestic multinational corporations that generate revenue from customers in European countries, transacts with various European banks as counterparties to certain derivative-related activities, and through a subsidiary, manages money market 

U.S. Bancorp 23 

funds that hold certain investments in European sovereign debt. Any deterioration in economic conditions in Europe, including the impacts resulting from the Russia-Ukraine conflict, is not expected to have a significant effect on the Company related to these activities. 
 Commitments, Contingent Liabilities and Other Contractual Obligations The Company participates in many different contractual arrangements which may or may not be recorded on its balance sheet, with unrelated or consolidated entities, under which the Company has an obligation to pay certain amounts, provide credit or liquidity enhancements or provide market risk support. These arrangements include commitments to extend credit, letters of credit and various forms of guarantees. Refer to Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on guarantees and contingent liabilities. These arrangements also include any obligation related to a variable interest held in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, credit enhancement or market risk support. Refer to Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to the Company s interests in variable interest entities. 
 
 Capital Management The Company is committed to managing capital to maintain strong protection for depositors and creditors and for maximum shareholder benefit. The Company also manages its capital to exceed regulatory capital requirements for banking organizations. To achieve its capital goals, the Company employs a variety of capital management tools, including dividends, common share repurchases, and the issuance of subordinated debt, non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, common stock and other capital instruments. The regulatory capital requirements effective for the Company follow Basel III, with the Company being subject to calculating its capital adequacy as a percentage of risk-weighted assets under the standardized approach. Beginning in 2022, the Company began to phase into its regulatory capital requirements the cumulative deferred 

impact of its 2020 adoption of the accounting guidance related to the impairment of financial instruments based on the current expected credit losses CECL methodology plus 25 percent of its quarterly credit reserve increases during 2020 and 2021. This cumulative deferred impact will continue to be phased into the Company s regulatory capital during 2024, culminating with a fully phased in regulatory capital calculation beginning in 2025. Table 10 provides a summary of statutory regulatory capital ratios in effect for the Company at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. All regulatory ratios exceeded regulatory well-capitalized requirements. 
 In July 2023, the U.S. federal bank regulatory authorities proposed a rule to refine the Basel III capital framework for financial institutions. The proposal incorporates elements of the international Basel Committee s post-crisis reforms, including the Fundamental Review of the Trading Book to replace the existing market risk rule, and introduces new standardized approaches for credit risk, operational risk and credit valuation adjustment (CVA) risk. The proposal s finalization could revise the risk-based capital measures applicable to the Company. The proposed effective date is July 1, 2025, with a three-year period to transition the effects of the proposal. 
 The Company believes certain other capital ratios are useful in evaluating its capital adequacy. The Company s tangible common equity, as a percent of tangible assets and as a percent of risk-weighted assets determined in accordance with transitional regulatory capital requirements related to the CECL methodology under the standardized approach, was 5.7 percent and 8.6 percent, respectively, at September 30, 2024, compared with 5.3 percent and 7.7 percent, respectively, at December 31, 2023. In addition, the Company s common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio, reflecting the full implementation of the CECL methodology, was 10.5 percent at September 30, 2024, compared with 9.7 percent at December 31, 2023. Refer to Non-GAAP Financial Measures beginning on page 29 for further information on these other capital ratios.

 U.S. Bancorp 

Total U.S. Bancorp shareholders equity was 58.9 billion at September 30, 2024, compared with 55.3 billion at December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily the result of corporate earnings and changes in unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale investment securities included in other comprehensive income (loss), partially offset by dividends paid. 
 The Company announced on September 12, 2024 that its Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program to repurchase up to 5.0 billion of its common stock, effective September 13, 2024. This share repurchase program replaced the previous share repurchase program announced on December 22, 2020, which was terminated effective on September 12, 2024. Capital distributions, including dividends and stock repurchases, are subject to the approval of the Company s Board of Directors and compliance with regulatory requirements.

 Line of Business Financial Review 
 The Company s major lines of business are Wealth, Corporate, Commercial and Institutional Banking, Consumer and Business Banking, Payment Services, and Treasury and Corporate Support. 
 Basis for Financial Presentation Business line results are derived from the Company s business unit profitability reporting systems by specifically attributing managed balance sheet assets, deposits and other liabilities and their related income or expense. Refer to Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the business lines basis for financial presentation. 
 Designations, assignments and allocations change from time to time as management systems are enhanced, methods of evaluating performance or product lines change or business segments are realigned to better respond to the Company s diverse customer base. During 2024 and 2023, certain organization and methodology changes were made, including revising the Company s line of business funds transfer-pricing methodology related to deposits and loans during the second quarter of 2024 and combining its Wealth Management and Investment Services and Corporate and Commercial Banking lines of businesses to create the Wealth, 

Corporate, Commercial and Institutional Banking line of business during the third quarter of 2023. Prior period results were restated and presented on a comparable basis. 
 Wealth, Corporate, Commercial and Institutional Banking Wealth, Corporate, Commercial and Institutional Banking provides core banking, specialized lending, transaction and payment processing, capital markets, asset management, and brokerage and investment related services to wealth, middle market, large corporate, government and institutional clients. Wealth, Corporate, Commercial and Institutional Banking contributed 1.2 billion of the Company s net income in the third quarter and 3.5 billion in the first nine months of 2024, or an increase of 4 million (0.3 percent) and a decrease of 25 million (0.7 percent), respectively, compared with the same periods of 2023. 
 Net revenue decreased 12 million (0.4 percent) in the third quarter and increased 94 million (1.0 percent) in the first nine months of 2024, compared with the same periods of 2023. Net interest income, on a taxable-equivalent basis, decreased 127 million (6.3 percent) in the third quarter and 173 million (2.9 percent) in the first nine months of 2024, compared with the same periods of 2023, primarily due to lower noninterest-bearing deposit balances, partially offset by the impact of higher interest rates. Noninterest income increased 115 million (11.2 percent) in the third quarter and 267 million (8.6 percent) in the first nine months of 2024, compared with the same periods of 2023, primarily due to higher commercial products revenue and trust and investment management fees, both driven by business growth and favorable market conditions. 
 Noninterest expense increased 24 million (1.8 percent) in the third quarter of 2024, compared with the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to higher net shared services expense. Noninterest expense increased 62 million (1.5 percent) in the first nine months of 2024, compared with the first nine months of 2023, primarily due to higher compensation and employee benefits expense. The provision for credit losses decreased 42 million (30.9 percent) in the third quarter of 2024, compared with the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to stable credit quality in the current quarter. The provision for credit losses increased 64 million (23.6 percent) in the first nine months of 2024, compared with the first nine months of 2023, primarily due to higher net charge-offs, partially offset by slower credit deterioration in the first nine months of 2024. 
 Consumer and Business Banking Consumer and Business Banking comprises consumer banking, small business banking and consumer lending. Products and services are delivered through banking offices, telephone servicing and sales, online services, direct mail, ATM processing, mobile devices, distributed mortgage loan officers, and intermediary relationships including auto dealerships, mortgage banks, and strategic business partners. Consumer and Business Banking contributed 476 million of the Company s net income in the third quarter and 1.4 billion in the first nine months of 2024, or decreases of 89 million (15.8 percent) and 617 million (30.3 percent), respectively, compared with the same periods of 2023. 
 Net revenue decreased 144 million (5.8 percent) in the third quarter and 1.0 billion (12.7 percent) in the first nine months of 2024, compared with the same periods of 2023. Net 

U.S. Bancorp 25 

interest income, on a taxable-equivalent basis, decreased 111 million (5.4 percent) in the third quarter and 993 million (14.8 percent) in the first nine months of 2024, compared with the same periods of 2023, due to the impact of deposit mix and pricing. Noninterest income decreased 33 million (7.6 percent) in the third quarter and 26 million (2.1 percent) in the first nine months of 2024, compared with the same periods of 2023, primarily due to lower service charges, partially offset by higher mortgage banking revenue driven by higher gain on sale margins. 
 Noninterest expense decreased 36 million (2.1 percent) in the third quarter and 269 million (5.1 percent) in the first nine months of 2024, compared with the same periods of 2023, primarily due to lower compensation and employee benefits expense and net shared services expense. The provision for credit losses increased 11 million in the third quarter and 72 million in the first nine months of 2024, compared with the same periods of 2023, primarily due to higher net charge-offs. 
 Payment Services Payment Services includes consumer and business credit cards, stored-value cards, debit cards, corporate, government and purchasing card services and merchant processing. Payment Services contributed 277 million of the Company s net income in the third quarter and 792 million in the first nine months of 2024, or an increase of 54 million (24.2 percent) and a decrease of 75 million (8.7 percent), respectively, compared with the same periods of 2023. 
 Net revenue increased 98 million (5.8 percent) in the third quarter and 289 million (5.8 percent) in the first nine months of 2024, compared with the same periods of 2023. Net interest income, on a taxable-equivalent basis, increased 64 million (9.7 percent) in the third quarter and 169 million (8.7 percent) in the first nine months of 2024, compared with the same periods of 2023, primarily due to higher loan yields driven by higher interest rates and customer revolve rates, along with higher loan balances, partially offset by higher funding costs. Noninterest income increased 34 million (3.3 percent) in the third quarter and 120 million (4.0 percent) in the first nine months of 2024, compared with the same periods of 2023, driven by higher card revenue due to favorable rates, and higher merchant processing services revenue due to business volume growth and favorable rates. 
 Noninterest expense increased 20 million (2.0 percent) in the third quarter and 169 million (5.9 percent) in the first nine months of 2024, compared with the same periods of 2023, reflecting higher net shared services expense. The provision for credit losses increased 5 million (1.3 percent) in the third quarter and 218 million (23.4 percent) in the first nine months of 2024, compared with the same periods of 2023, primarily due to higher net charge-offs. 
 Treasury and Corporate Support Treasury and Corporate Support includes the Company s investment portfolios, funding, capital management, interest rate risk management, income taxes not allocated to the business lines, including most investments in tax-advantaged projects, and the residual aggregate of those expenses associated with corporate activities that are managed on a consolidated basis. Treasury and Corporate Support recorded net losses of 226 million in the third quarter and 1.0 billion in the first nine months of 

2024, compared with net losses of 448 million and 1.8 billion, respectively, in the same periods of 2023. 
 Net revenue decreased 110 million (53.7 percent) in the third quarter and 300 million (52.1 percent) in the first nine months of 2024, compared with the same periods of 2023. Net interest income, on a taxable-equivalent basis, increased 72 million (15.5 percent) in the third quarter of 2024, compared with the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to higher yields on the investment securities portfolio, partially offset by higher funding costs. Net interest income, on a taxable-equivalent basis, decreased 155 million (13.3 percent) in the first nine months of 2024, compared with the first nine months of 2023, primarily due to higher funding costs, partially offset by higher yields on the investment securities portfolio and cash balances. Noninterest income decreased 182 million (69.7 percent) in the third quarter and 145 million (24.7 percent) in the first nine months of 2024, compared with the same periods of 2023, primarily due to higher net losses on the sales of investment securities and a decrease in other revenue. The decrease in noninterest income in the first nine months of 2024, compared with the first nine months of 2023, was partially offset by a gain on the sale of mortgage servicing rights during the second quarter of 2024. 
 Noninterest expense decreased 334 million (72.1 percent) in the third quarter and 739 million (50.5 percent) in the first nine months of 2024, compared with the same periods of 2023, primarily due to lower merger and integration charges and lower other noninterest expense, partially offset by higher higher compensation and employee benefits expense. The decrease in noninterest expense in the first nine months of 2024, compared with the first nine months of 2023, was further offset by the impact of the FDIC special assessment in the current year. The provision for credit losses increased 68 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared with the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to the impact of continued economic uncertainty not allocated to business line reserves. The provision for credit losses decreased 439 million (83.0 percent) in the first nine months of 2024, compared with the first nine months of 2023, primarily due to balance sheet repositioning and capital management actions in the prior year. 
 Income taxes are assessed to each line of business at a managerial tax rate of 25.0 percent with the residual tax expense or benefit to arrive at the consolidated effective tax rate included in Treasury and Corporate Support.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 In addition to capital ratios defined by banking regulators, the Company considers various other measures when evaluating capital utilization and adequacy, including: 
 Tangible common equity to tangible assets, 
 Tangible common equity to risk-weighted assets, and 
 Common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets, reflecting the full implementation of the CECL methodology. 
 These capital measures are viewed by management as useful additional methods of evaluating the Company s utilization of its capital held and the level of capital available to withstand unexpected negative market or economic conditions. Additionally, presentation of these measures allows investors, analysts and banking regulators to assess the Company s capital position relative to other financial services companies. These capital measures are not defined in generally accepted accounting principles GAAP ), or are not currently effective or defined in banking regulations. In addition, certain of these measures differ from currently effective capital ratios defined by banking regulations principally in that the currently effective ratios, which are subject to certain transitional provisions, temporarily exclude 

the full impact of the 2020 adoption of accounting guidance related to impairment of financial instruments based on the CECL methodology. As a result, these capital measures disclosed by the Company may be considered non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes this information helps investors assess trends in the Company s capital adequacy. 
 The Company also discloses net interest income and related ratios and analysis on a taxable-equivalent basis, which may also be considered non-GAAP financial measures. The Company believes this presentation to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income as it provides a relevant comparison of net interest income arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources. In addition, certain performance measures utilize net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis, including the efficiency ratio and net interest margin. 
 There may be limits in the usefulness of these measures to investors. As a result, the Company encourages readers to consider the consolidated financial statements and other financial information contained in this report in their entirety, and not to rely on any single financial measure. 

The following tables show the Company s calculation of these non-GAAP financial measures:

 Critical Accounting Policies 
 The accounting and reporting policies of the Company comply with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and conform to general practices within the banking industry. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions. The Company s financial position and results of operations can be affected by these estimates and assumptions, which are integral to understanding the Company s financial statements. Critical accounting policies are those policies management believes are the most important to the portrayal of the Company s financial condition and results, and require management to make estimates that are difficult, subjective or complex. Most accounting policies are not considered by management to be critical accounting policies. Management has discussed the development and the selection of critical accounting policies with the Company s Audit Committee. Those policies considered to be critical accounting policies relate to the allowance for credit losses, fair value estimates, MSRs, and income taxes. These accounting policies are discussed in detail in Management s Discussion and Analysis Critical Accounting Policies and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

Controls and Procedures 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the Company has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act )). Based upon this evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
 During the most recently completed fiscal quarter, there was no change made in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

 The Company conducts a regular assessment of its available-for-sale investment securities with unrealized losses to determine whether all or some portion of a security s unrealized loss is related to credit and an allowance for credit losses is necessary. If the Company intends to sell or it is more likely than not the Company will be required to sell an investment security, the amortized cost of the security is written down to fair value. When evaluating credit losses, the Company considers various factors such as the nature of the investment security, the credit ratings or financial condition of the issuer, the extent of the unrealized loss, expected cash flows of underlying collateral, the existence of any government or agency guarantees, and market conditions. The Company measures the allowance for credit losses using market information where available and discounting the cash flows at the original effective rate of the investment security. The allowance for credit losses is adjusted each period through earnings and can be subsequently recovered. The allowance for credit losses on the Company s available-for-sale investment securities was immaterial at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 At September 30, 2024, certain investment securities had a fair value below amortized cost.

 These unrealized losses primarily relate to changes in interest rates and market spreads subsequent to purchase of these available-for-sale investment securities. U.S. Treasury and agencies securities and agency mortgage-backed securities are issued, guaranteed or otherwise supported by the United States government. The Company s obligations of state and political subdivisions are generally high grade. Accordingly, the Company does not consider these unrealized losses to be credit-related and an allowance for credit losses is not necessary. In general, the issuers of the investment securities are contractually prohibited from prepayment at less than par, and the Company did not pay significant purchase premiums for these investment securities. At September 30, 2024, the Company had no plans to sell investment securities with unrealized losses, and believes it is more likely than not it would not be required to sell such investment securities before recovery of their amortized cost. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company did not purchase any investment securities that had more-than-insignificant credit deterioration. 
 Predominately all of the Company s held-to-maturity investment securities are U.S. Treasury and agencies securities and highly rated agency mortgage-backed securities that are guaranteed or otherwise supported by the United States government and have no history of credit losses. Accordingly the Company does not expect to incur any credit losses on held-to-maturity investment securities and has allowance for credit losses recorded for these securities.

 reasonable and supportable forecast period, which includes increasing consideration of historical loss experience over years two and three. These economic scenarios are constructed with interrelated projections of multiple economic variables, and loss estimates are produced that consider the historical correlation of those economic variables with credit losses. After the forecast period, the Company fully reverts to long-term historical loss experience, adjusted for prepayments and characteristics of the current loan and lease portfolio, to estimate losses over the remaining life of the portfolio. The economic scenarios are updated at least quarterly and are designed to provide a range of reasonable estimates, from better to worse than current expectations. Scenarios are weighted based on the Company s expectation of economic conditions for the foreseeable future and reflect significant judgment and consideration of economic forecast uncertainty. Final loss estimates also consider factors affecting credit losses not reflected in the scenarios, due to the unique aspects of current conditions and expectations. These factors may include, but are not limited to, loan servicing practices, regulatory guidance, and/or fiscal and monetary policy actions.

million in the commercial lending segment are analyzed utilizing expected cash flows discounted using the original effective interest rate, the observable market price of the loan, or the fair value of the collateral, less selling costs, for collateral-dependent loans as appropriate. For smaller commercial loans collectively evaluated for impairment, historical loss experience is also incorporated into the allowance methodology applied to this category of loans. 
 The Company s methodology for determining the appropriate allowance for credit losses also considers the imprecision inherent in the methodologies used and allocated to the various loan portfolios. As a result, amounts determined under the methodologies described above are adjusted by management to consider the potential impact of other qualitative factors not captured in the quantitative model adjustments which include, but are not limited to, the following: model imprecision, imprecision in economic scenario assumptions, and emerging risks related to either changes in the environment that are affecting specific portfolios, or changes in portfolio concentrations over time that may affect model performance. The consideration of these items results in adjustments to allowance amounts included in the Company s allowance for credit losses for each loan portfolio. 
 The Company also assesses the credit risk associated with off-balance sheet loan commitments, letters of credit, investment securities and derivatives. Credit risk associated with derivatives is reflected in the fair values recorded for those positions. The liability for off-balance sheet credit exposure related to loan commitments and other credit guarantees is included in other liabilities. Because business processes and credit risks associated with unfunded credit commitments are essentially the same as for loans, the Company utilizes similar processes to estimate its liability for unfunded credit commitments. 
 The results of the analysis are evaluated quarterly to confirm the estimates are appropriate for each specific loan portfolio, as well as the entire loan portfolio, as the entire allowance for credit losses is available for the entire loan portfolio.

days past due. Residential mortgage loans and lines in a first lien position are placed on nonaccrual status in instances where a partial charge-off occurs unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection. Residential mortgage loans and lines in a junior lien position secured by 1-4 family properties are placed on nonaccrual status at days past due or when they are behind a first lien that has become days or greater past due or placed on nonaccrual status. Any secured consumer lending segment loan whose borrower has had debt discharged through bankruptcy, for which the loan amount exceeds the fair value of the collateral, is charged down to the fair value of the related collateral and the remaining balance is placed on nonaccrual status. Credit card loans continue to accrue interest until the account is charged-off. Credit cards are charged-off at days past due. Other retail loans not secured by 1-4 family properties are charged-off at days past due, and revolving consumer lines are charged-off at days past due. Similar to credit cards, other retail loans are generally not placed on nonaccrual status because of the relative short period of time to charge-off. Certain retail customers having financial difficulties may have the terms of their credit card and other loan agreements modified to require only principal payments and, as such, are reported as nonaccrual. 
 For all loan classes, interest payments received on nonaccrual loans are generally recorded as a reduction to a loan s carrying amount while a loan is on nonaccrual and are recognized as interest income upon payoff of the loan. However, interest income may be recognized for interest payments received if the remaining carrying amount of the loan is believed to be collectible. In certain circumstances, loans in any class may be restored to accrual status, such as when a loan has demonstrated sustained repayment performance or no amounts are past due and prospects for future payment are no longer in doubt, or when the loan becomes well secured and is in the process of collection. Loans where there has been a partial charge-off may be returned to accrual status if all principal and interest (including amounts previously charged-off) is expected to be collected and the loan is current.

Guarantees provided to certain third parties in connection with the transfer of assets are further discussed in Note 15. 
 For further information on MSRs, refer to Note 6. On a limited basis, the Company may acquire and package high-grade corporate bonds for select corporate customers, in which the Company generally has no continuing involvement with these transactions. Additionally, the Company is an authorized GNMA issuer and issues GNMA securities on a regular basis. The Company has no other asset securitizations or similar asset-backed financing arrangements that are off-balance sheet. 
 The Company is involved in various entities that are considered to be variable interest entities VIEs ). The Company s investments in VIEs are primarily related to investments promoting affordable housing, community development and renewable energy sources. Some of these tax-advantaged investments support the Company s regulatory compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act. The Company s investments in these entities generate a return primarily through the realization of federal and state income tax credits, and other tax benefits, such as tax deductions from operating losses of the investments, over specified time periods. These tax credits are recognized as a reduction of tax expense or, for investments qualifying as investment tax credits, as a reduction to the related investment asset. The Company recognized federal and state income tax credits related to its affordable housing and other tax-advantaged investments in tax expense of million and million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

The Company s recorded investment in these entities, carried in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, was approximately million at September 30, 2024 and million at December 31, 2023. The maximum exposure to loss related to these VIEs was million at September 30, 2024 and million at December 31, 2023, representing the Company s investment balance and its unfunded commitments to invest additional amounts. 
 The Company also held senior notes of billion as available-for-sale investment securities at September 30, 2024, compared with billion at December 31, 2023. These senior notes were issued by third-party securitization vehicles that held billion at

 The fair value of MSRs and their sensitivity to changes in interest rates is influenced by the mix of the servicing portfolio and characteristics of each segment of the portfolio. The Company s servicing portfolio consists of the distinct portfolios of government-insured mortgages, conventional mortgages and Housing Finance Agency HFA mortgages. The servicing portfolios are predominantly comprised of fixed-rate agency loans with limited adjustable-rate or jumbo mortgage loans. The HFA servicing portfolio is comprised of loans originated under state and local housing authority program guidelines which assist purchases by first-time or low- to moderate-income homebuyers through a favorable rate subsidy, down payment and/or closing cost assistance on government- and conventional-insured mortgages.

million (net-of-tax) of realized and unrealized losses on derivatives classified as cash flow hedges recorded in other comprehensive income (loss), compared with million (net-of-tax) of realized and unrealized losses at December 31, 2023. The estimated amount to be reclassified from other comprehensive income (loss) into earnings during the next 12 months is a loss of million (net-of-tax). All cash flow hedges were highly effective for the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Net Investment Hedges The Company uses forward commitments to sell specified amounts of certain foreign currencies, and non-derivative debt instruments, to hedge the volatility of its net investment in foreign operations driven by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The carrying amount of non-derivative debt instruments designated as net investment hedges was billion at September 30, 2024 and billion at December 31, 2023. 
 Other Derivative Positions The Company enters into free-standing derivatives to mitigate interest rate risk and for other risk management purposes. These derivatives include forward commitments to sell TBAs and other commitments to sell residential mortgage loans, which are used to economically hedge the interest rate risk related to MLHFS and unfunded mortgage loan commitments. The Company also enters into interest rate swaps, swaptions, forward commitments to buy TBAs, U.S. Treasury and Eurodollar futures and options on U.S. Treasury futures to economically hedge the change in the fair value of the Company s MSRs. The Company enters into foreign currency forwards to economically hedge remeasurement gains and losses the Company recognizes on foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities. The Company also enters into interest rate swaps as economic hedges of fair value option elected deposits. In addition, the Company acts as a seller and buyer of interest rate, foreign exchange and commodity contracts for its customers. The Company mitigates the market, funding and liquidity risk associated with these customer derivatives by entering into similar offsetting positions with broker-dealers, or on a portfolio basis by entering into other derivative or non-derivative financial instruments that partially or fully offset the exposure to earnings from these customer-related positions. The Company s customer derivatives and related hedges are monitored and reviewed by the Company s Market Risk Committee, which establishes policies for market risk management, including exposure limits for each portfolio. The Company also has derivative contracts that are created through its operations, including certain unfunded mortgage loan commitments and swap agreements related to the sale of a portion of its Class B common and preferred shares of Visa Inc. Refer to Note 14 for further information on these swap agreements. The Company uses credit derivatives to economically hedge the credit risk on its derivative positions and loan portfolios.

 Derivatives are subject to credit risk associated with counterparties to the derivative contracts. The Company measures that credit risk using a credit valuation adjustment and includes it within the fair value of the derivative. The Company manages counterparty credit risk through diversification of its derivative positions among various counterparties, by entering into derivative positions that are centrally cleared through clearinghouses, by entering into master netting arrangements and, where possible, by requiring collateral arrangements. A master netting arrangement allows two counterparties, who have multiple derivative contracts with each other, the ability to net settle amounts under all contracts, including any related collateral, through a single payment and in a single currency. Collateral arrangements generally require the counterparty to deliver collateral (typically cash or U.S. Treasury and agency securities) equal to the Company s net derivative receivable, subject to minimum transfer and credit rating requirements.

trillion total notional amount of derivative positions at September 30, 2024, billion related to bilateral over-the-counter trades, billion related to those centrally cleared through clearinghouses and billion related to those that were exchange-traded. The Company s derivative contracts typically include offsetting rights (referred to as netting arrangements), and depending on expected volume, credit risk, and counterparty preference, collateral maintenance may be required. For all derivatives under collateral support arrangements, fair value is determined daily and, depending on the collateral maintenance requirements, the Company and a counterparty may receive or deliver collateral, based upon the net fair value of all derivative positions between the Company and the counterparty. Collateral is typically cash, but securities may be allowed under collateral arrangements with certain counterparties. Receivables and payables related to cash collateral are included in other assets and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, along with the related derivative asset and liability fair values. Any securities pledged to counterparties as collateral remain on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Securities received from counterparties as collateral are not recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, unless the counterparty defaults. In general, securities used as collateral can be sold, repledged or otherwise used by the party in possession. No restrictions exist on the use of cash collateral by either party. Refer to Note 12 for further discussion of the Company s derivatives, including collateral arrangements. 
 As part of the Company s treasury and broker-dealer operations, the Company executes transactions that are treated as securities sold under agreements to repurchase or securities purchased under agreements to resell, both of which are accounted for as collateralized financings. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase include repurchase agreements and securities loaned transactions. Securities purchased under agreements to resell include reverse repurchase agreements and securities borrowed transactions. For securities sold under agreements to repurchase, the Company records a liability for the cash received, which is included in short-term borrowings on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. For securities purchased under agreements to resell, the Company records a receivable for the cash paid, which is included in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
 Securities transferred to counterparties under repurchase agreements and securities loaned transactions continue to be recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, are measured at fair value, and are included in investment securities or other assets. Securities received from counterparties under reverse repurchase agreements and securities borrowed transactions are not recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet unless the counterparty defaults. The securities transferred under repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions typically are U.S. Treasury and agency securities, residential agency mortgage-backed securities, corporate debt securities or asset-backed securities. The securities loaned or borrowed typically are corporate debt securities traded by the Company s primary broker-dealer subsidiary. In general, the securities transferred can be sold, repledged or otherwise used by the party in possession. No restrictions exist on the use of cash collateral by either party. Repurchase/reverse repurchase and securities loaned/borrowed transactions expose the Company to counterparty risk. The Company manages this risk by performing assessments, independent of business line managers, and establishing concentration limits on each counterparty. Additionally, these transactions include collateral arrangements that require the fair values of the underlying securities to be determined daily, resulting in cash being obtained or refunded to counterparties to maintain specified collateral levels.

Changes in fair value due to instrument specific credit risk were immaterial. Interest income for MLHFS is measured based on contractual interest rates and reported as interest income on the Consolidated Statement of Income. Electing to measure MLHFS at fair value reduces certain timing differences and better matches changes in fair value of these assets with changes in the value of the derivative instruments used to economically hedge them without the burden of complying with the requirements for hedge accounting. 
 Time Deposits The Company elects the fair value option to account for certain time deposits that are hedged with derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting. Electing to measure these time deposits at fair value reduces certain timing differences and better matches changes in fair value of these deposits with changes in the value of the derivative instruments used to economically hedge them. The time deposits measured at fair value are valued using a discounted cash flow model that utilizes market observable inputs and are classified within Level 2. Included in interest expense on deposits were net losses of million and net gains of million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and net losses of million and net gains of million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, from the changes in fair value of time deposits under fair value option accounting guidance.

Significant Unobservable Inputs of Level 3 Assets and Liabilities 
 The following section provides information to facilitate an understanding of the uncertainty in the fair value measurements for the Company s Level 3 assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. This section includes a description of the significant inputs used by the Company and a description of any interrelationships between these inputs. The discussion below excludes nonrecurring fair value measurements of collateral value used for impairment measures for loans and OREO. These valuations utilize third party appraisal or broker price opinions, and are classified as Level 3 due to the significant judgment involved. 
 Mortgage Servicing Rights The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Company s MSRs are expected prepayments and the option adjusted spread that is added to the risk-free rate to discount projected cash flows. Significant increases in either of these inputs in isolation would have resulted in a significantly lower fair value measurement. Significant decreases in either of these inputs in isolation would have resulted in a significantly higher fair value measurement. There is no direct interrelationship between prepayments and option adjusted spread. Prepayment rates generally move in the opposite direction of market interest rates. Option adjusted spread is generally impacted by changes in market return requirements. 
 Option adjusted spread 
 
 Derivatives The Company has two distinct Level 3 derivative portfolios: (i) the Company s commitments to purchase and originate mortgage loans that meet the requirements of a derivative and (ii) the Company s asset/liability and customer-related derivatives that 
 U.S. Bancorp 67 

Inherent MSR value (basis points per loan) 
 
 The significant unobservable input used in the fair value measurement of certain of the Company s asset/liability and customer-related derivatives is the credit valuation adjustment related to the risk of counterparty nonperformance. A significant increase in the credit valuation adjustment would have resulted in a lower fair value measurement. A significant decrease in the credit valuation adjustment would have resulted in a higher fair value measurement. The credit valuation adjustment is impacted by changes in market rates, volatility, market implied credit spreads, and loss recovery rates, as well as the Company s assessment of the counterparty s credit position. At September 30, 2024, the minimum, maximum and weighted-average credit valuation adjustment as a percentage of the net fair value of the counterparty s derivative contracts prior to adjustment was , percent and percent, respectively. 
 The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Visa swaps are management s estimate of the probability of certain litigation scenarios occurring, and the timing of the resolution of the related litigation loss estimates in excess, or shortfall, of the Company s proportional share of escrow funds. An increase in the loss estimate or a delay in the resolution of the related litigation would have resulted in an increase in the derivative liability. A decrease in the loss estimate or an acceleration of the resolution of the related litigation would have resulted in a decrease in the derivative liability.

 Merchant Processing The Company, through its subsidiaries, provides merchant processing services. Under the rules of credit card associations, a merchant processor retains a contingent liability for credit card transactions processed. This contingent liability arises in the event of a billing dispute between the merchant and a cardholder that is ultimately resolved in the cardholder s favor. In this situation, the transaction is charged-back to the merchant and the disputed amount is credited or otherwise refunded to the cardholder. If the Company is unable to collect this amount from the merchant, it bears the loss for the amount of the refund paid to the cardholder. 
 The Company currently processes card transactions in the United States, Canada and Europe through wholly-owned subsidiaries. In the event a merchant was unable to fulfill product or services subject to future delivery, such as airline tickets, the Company could become financially liable for refunding the purchase price of such products or services purchased through the credit card associations under the charge-back provisions. Charge-back risk related to these merchants is evaluated in a manner similar to credit risk assessments and, as such, merchant processing contracts contain various provisions to protect the Company in the event of default. At September 30, 2024, the value of airline tickets purchased to be delivered at a future date through card transactions processed by the Company was billion. The Company held collateral of million in escrow deposits, letters of credit and indemnities from financial institutions, and liens on various assets. In addition to specific collateral or other credit

million primarily related to these airline processing arrangements. 
 Asset Sales The Company regularly sells loans to GSEs as part of its mortgage banking activities. The Company provides customary representations and warranties to GSEs in conjunction with these sales. These representations and warranties generally require the Company to repurchase assets if it is subsequently determined that a loan did not meet specified criteria, such as a documentation deficiency or rescission of mortgage insurance. If the Company is unable to cure or refute a repurchase request, the Company is generally obligated to repurchase the loan or otherwise reimburse the GSE for losses. At September 30, 2024, the Company had reserved million for potential losses from representation and warranty obligations, compared with million at December 31, 2023. The Company s reserve reflects management s best estimate of losses for representation and warranty obligations. The Company s repurchase reserve is modeled at the loan level, taking into consideration the individual credit quality and borrower activity that has transpired since origination. The model applies credit quality and economic risk factors to derive a probability of default and potential repurchase that are based on the Company s historical loss experience, and estimates loss severity based on expected collateral value. The Company also considers qualitative factors that may result in anticipated losses differing from historical loss trends. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had million and million, respectively, of unresolved representation and warranty claims from GSEs. The Company does not have a significant amount of unresolved claims from investors other than GSEs. 
 Litigation and Regulatory Matters 
 The Company is subject to various litigation and regulatory matters that arise from the conduct of its business activities. The Company establishes reserves for such matters when potential losses become probable and can be reasonably estimated. The Company believes the ultimate resolution of existing legal and regulatory matters will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations or cash flows of the Company. However, in light of the uncertainties inherent in these matters, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of one or more of these matters may have a material adverse effect on the Company s results of operations for a particular period, and future changes in circumstances or additional information could result in additional accruals or resolution in excess of established accruals, which could adversely affect the Company s results of operations, potentially materially. 
 Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities Litigation Starting in 2011, the Company and other large financial institutions have been sued in their capacity as trustee for residential mortgage backed securities trusts for losses arising out of the 2008 financial crisis. In the lawsuits brought against the Company, the investors allege that the Company s banking subsidiary, U.S. Bank National Association USBNA ), as trustee caused them to incur substantial losses by failing to enforce loan repurchase obligations and failing to abide by appropriate standards of care after events of default allegedly occurred. The plaintiffs in these matters seek monetary damages in unspecified amounts and most also seek equitable relief. 
 Regulatory Matters The Company is continually subject to examinations, inquiries, investigations and other forms of regulatory and governmental inquiry or scrutiny covering a wide range of issues in its financial services businesses including in areas of heightened regulatory scrutiny, such as compliance, risk management, third-party risk management and consumer protection. In some cases, these matters are part of reviews of specified activities at multiple industry participants; in others, they are directed at the Company individually. For example, the Division of Enforcement of the SEC has been investigating U.S. Bancorp Fund Services, LLC USBFS ), a subsidiary of USBNA, relating to its role providing fund administration services to a third-party investment fund. This investment fund was advised by an investment adviser who engaged in fraud, and USBFS was not affiliated with the investment adviser and did not provide any advisory services to the fund. The Division of Enforcement has made a preliminary determination to recommend that the SEC file an enforcement action against USBFS, and USBFS is in ongoing discussions with the SEC on this matter. The Company is cooperating fully with all pending examinations, inquiries and investigations, any of which could lead to administrative or legal proceedings or settlements. Remedies in these proceedings or settlements may include fines, penalties, restitution or alterations in the Company s business practices (which may increase the Company s operating expenses and decrease its revenue). 
 Outlook Due to their complex nature, it can be years before litigation and regulatory matters are resolved. The Company may be unable to develop an estimate or range of loss where matters are in early stages, there are significant factual or legal issues to be resolved, damages are unspecified or uncertain, or there is uncertainty as to a litigation class being certified or the outcome of pending motions, appeals or proceedings. For those litigation and regulatory matters where the Company has information to develop an estimate or range of loss, the Company believes the upper end of the range of reasonably possible losses in aggregate, in excess of any reserves established for matters where a loss is considered probable, will not be material to its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The Company s estimates are subject to significant judgment and uncertainties, and the matters underlying the estimates will change from time to time. Actual results may vary significantly from the current estimates.
