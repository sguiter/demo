All statements, other than statements of historical facts, contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including statements regarding our strategy, future operations, future financial position, future revenue, projected costs, prospects, plans and objectives of management and expected market growth are forward-looking statements. The words anticipate, believe, continue, could, estimate, expect, intend, may, plan, potential, predict, project, should, target, would, and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. 
 These forward-looking statements include, among other things, statements about: 
 our plans to develop and commercialize LTI-03, including the potential benefits thereof; 

our decision to temporarily delay further clinical development of LTI-01 until additional funds are raised; 

our plans for a Phase 2 trial of LTI-03; 

our unproven approach to drug research and development in the area of fibrotic diseases, with a focus on Caveolin-1, or Cav1, -related peptides, and our ability to develop marketable products; 

our future clinical trials for LTI-03 and LTI-01, whether conducted by us or by any future collaborators, including our ability to enroll patients in our clinical trials, the timing of initiation of these trials and of the anticipated results; 

the possibility that we may be adversely affected by economic, business, and/or competitive factors, including risks inherent in pharmaceutical research and development, such as: adverse results in our drug discovery, preclinical and clinical development activities, the risk that the results of our preclinical studies and early clinical trials may not be replicated in later clinical trials, including a Phase 2 trial of LTI-03, or that partial results of a trial may not be indicative of the full results of the trial, and the risk that any of our clinical trials may not commence, continue or be completed on time, or at all; 

our ability to recognize the anticipated benefits of our acquisition of Lung Therapeutics, Inc. in October 2023; 

our expectations regarding our ability to fund our operating expenses, our planned activities, and capital expenditure requirements with our cash, cash equivalents and investments; 

our belief that our existing cash and cash equivalents will not be sufficient to enable us to fund our current operations for longer than twelve months from the date of issuance of the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern; 

the success of our remediation efforts related to the material weaknesses identified in our internal controls over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures; 

our estimates regarding expenses, future revenue, capital requirements and needs for additional financing; 

the timing of and our ability to obtain and maintain marketing approvals for LTI-03 and LTI-01; 

the rate and degree of market acceptance and clinical utility of any products for which we receive marketing approval; 

our commercialization, marketing and manufacturing capabilities and strategy; 

our intellectual property position and strategy, and our ability to obtain, maintain and enforce intellectual property rights for our platform and development candidates; 

our ability to identify additional product candidates with significant commercial potential;

our reliance on third-party manufacturing and supply vendors; 

potential benefits of any future collaboration; 

developments relating to our competitors and our industry; and 

the impact of government laws and regulations. 

We may not actually achieve the plans, intentions or expectations disclosed in our forward-looking statements, and you should not place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements. Actual results or events could differ materially from the plans, intentions 
 2 

and expectations disclosed in the forward-looking statements we make. We have included important factors in the cautionary statements included or incorporated by reference in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, and this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, particularly in the Risk Factors section, which could cause actual results or events to differ materially from the forward-looking statements that we make. Our forward-looking statements do not reflect the potential impact of any future acquisitions, mergers, dispositions, collaborations, joint ventures or investments that we may make or enter into. 
 You should read this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the documents that we reference herein and have filed or incorporated by reference hereto completely and with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from what we expect. We do not assume any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.

 in net proceeds from sales of common stock and warrants, from sales of preferred stock prior to its initial public offering IPO ), from a collaboration agreement in 2010, in net proceeds in connection with a private placement following the Lung Acquisition in 2023, and in net proceeds in connection with an underwritten offering of the Company's common stock and accompanying warrants to purchase common stock in May 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had in cash and cash equivalents. In May 2024, Aileron completed an underwritten follow-on public offering (the Offering ), pursuant to which the Company issued and sold shares of the Company s common stock, par value per share (the Offering Shares and accompanying warrants (the Offering Warrants to purchase shares of common stock (the Offering Warrant Shares ). All of the Offering Shares and Offering Warrants were sold by the Company. Each Offering Share was offered and sold together with an accompanying 

 8 

, and the underwriter purchased each Offering Share with an accompanying Offering Warrant from the Company at a combined price of . Net proceeds from the Offering were , af ter deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses, and excluding any proceeds that may be received from exercise of the Offering Warrants. On July 26, 2024, the Company entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement with Citizens JMP Securities, LLC Citizens JMP ), as agent and/or principal, under which the Company may offer and sell up to of shares of its common stock from time to time through or to Citizens JMP. Sales of common stock through or to Citizens JMP may be made by any method that is deemed an at the market offering as defined in Rule 415(a)(4) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, including sales made directly on or through the Nasdaq Capital Market. There have been no sales on the "at the market" offering through September 30, 2024. Management believes that, based on the Company s current operating plan, the Company s cash and cash equivalents o f as of September 30, 2024 will not be sufficient to enable the Company to fund its operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at least twelve months from the date of issuance of these condensed consolidated financial statements, which raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Since its inception, the Company has not generated any revenue from pro duct sales and has never generated an operating profit. The Company has incurred significant losses on an aggregate basis. The Company s net losses were and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had an accumulated deficit of . These losses have resulted primarily from costs incurred in connection with research and development activities, licensing and patent investment and general and administrative costs associated with the Company s operations. Management expects to continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future. The Company expects to finance its operations primarily through utilization of its current financial resources and through the sale of additional equity or debt financings, collaborations, licensing arrangements or other sources. The Company plans to address these conditions by, among other things, raising additional funds through equity or debt financings, strategic collaborations, licensing arrangements or other sources. However, there is no assurance that such funding will be available to the Company, will be obtained on terms favorable to the Company or will provide the Company with sufficient funds to meet its objectives. The Company s funding estimates are based on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and the Company could use its available capital resources sooner than it currently expects. If additional funds are not available, the Company could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate its research and development programs or future commercialization efforts and its business could be materially harmed. The Company s future viability is dependent on its ability to raise additional capital, enter into a financing, consummate a successful acquisition, merger, business combination, or a sale of assets or other transaction. If the Company becomes unable to continue as a going concern, it may have to liquidate its assets and the values it receives for its assets in liquidation or dissolution could be significantly lower than the values reflected in its consolidated financial statements. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

of Lung, pursuant to the Lung Acquisition Agreement. At the closing of the Lung Acquisition, Aileron issued to the stockholders of Lung shares of its common stock (excluding fractional shares from the total shares pursuant to the Lung Acquisition Agreement) and shares of its newly designated Series X non-voting convertible preferred stock (the Series X Preferred Stock (excluding fractional shares from the total shares pursuant to the Lung Acquisition Agreement). Each share of Series X Preferred Stock is convertible into shares of common stock. The Company paid cash in lieu of fractional shares of both common stock and Series X Preferred Stock. In addition, Aileron assumed all of Lung s stock options and all warrants exercisable for Lung common stock immediately outstanding prior to the closing of the Lung Acquisition, each subject to adjustment pursuant to the terms of the Lung Acquisition Agreement. Immediately following the closing of the Lung Acquisition, on October 31, 2023, Aileron entered into a Stock and Warrant Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement with a group of accredited investors, pursuant to which Aileron issued and sold (i) an aggregate of shares of Series X Preferred Stock, and (ii) warrants (the PIPE Warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of shares of Aileron common stock (the PIPE Warrant Shares ), for an aggregate purchase price of approximately , which included the conversion of certain convertible promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of issued by Lung to Bios Partners, the majority stockholder of Lung prior to the closing of the Lung Acquisition, at a discount to the per share price of the Series X Preferred Stock (collectively, the PIPE Financing ). The PIPE Financing closed on November 2, 2023. Each share of Series X Preferred Stock is convertible into shares of common stock. At the 2023 annual meeting of stockholders (the 2023 Annual Meeting ), the Company s stockholders approved the issuance, in accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(a), of shares of common stock, upon conversion of the Company s outstanding Series X Preferred Stock. On March 5, 2024, subject to then existing beneficial ownership limitations, shares of Series X Preferred Stock were automatically converted into shares of common stock. The Lung Acquisition was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting under ASC 805, Business Combinations. Under the acquisition method, the total purchase price of the acquisition is allocated to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the fair values as of the date of the acquisition. Consideration transferred is the sum of the acquisition-date fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred by the acquirer to the former owners of the acquiree, and the equity interests issued by the acquirer to the former owners of the acquiree (except for the measurement of share-based payment awards). The Company recorded the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of the Lung Acquisition based on the information available at that date.

As of December 31, 2023, shares of Series X Preferred Stock were issued and outstanding. On October 31, 2023, under the terms of the Lung Acquisition Agreement, at the closing of the Lung Acquisition, Aileron issued to the stockholders of Lung shares of common stock, and shares of Series X Preferred Stock. Immediately following the closing of the Lung Acquisition, on October 31, 2023, Aileron entered into the Purchase Agreement with a group of accredited investors, pursuant to which Aileron issued and sold an aggregate of shares of Series X Preferred Stock

shares of Aileron common stock. Refer to Note 3 for more details on the PIPE Financing in connection with the Purchase Agreement. Since the Series X Preferred Stock was sold as a unit with the PIPE Warrants according to the Purchase Agreement, the proceeds received were allocated to each instrument on a relative fair value basis. Total gross proceeds of , less of issuance costs were allocated as follows: to the Series X Preferred Stock and to the PIPE Warrants. The Series X Preferred Stock and the PIPE Warrants issued in the PIPE Financing were recorded at par value of . At the 2023 Annual Meeting, the Company s stockholders approved the issuance, in accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(a), of shares of common stock, upon conversion of the Company s outstanding Series X Preferred Stock. On March 5, 2024, subject to then existing beneficial ownership limitations, shares of Series X Preferred Stock were automatically converted into shares of common stock. On May 8, 2024, individuals and entities affiliated with Bios Partners (collectively, the Bios Entities provided notice to the Company and converted shares of Series X Preferred Stock held by them into shares of common stock. As of September 30, 2024, shares of Series X Preferred Stock (which are convertible into shares of common stock) remained convertible at the option of the holder thereof, subject to certain beneficial ownership limitations (as described below). The Company evaluated the Series X Preferred Stock for liability classification in accordance with the provisions of ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity ("ASC 480"), and determined that equity treatment was appropriate because the Series X Preferred Stock did not meet the definition of the liability instruments. Specifically, the Series X Preferred Stock is not mandatorily redeemable and does not embody an obligation to buy back the shares outside of the Company s control in a manner that could require the transfer of assets. The Company determined that the Series X Preferred Stock would be recorded as temporary equity, based on the guidance of ASC 480, given that it is contingently redeemable. Each share of Series X Preferred Stock is convertible into shares of Common Stock. The preferences, rights, and limitations initially applicable to the Series X Preferred Stock are set forth in the Certificate of Designation of Series X Non-Voting Convertible Preferred Stock (the Certificate of Designation ). The Series X Preferred Stock has the following characteristics: Voting Except as otherwise required by law, the Series X Preferred Stock does not have voting rights. However, as long as any shares of Series X Preferred Stock are outstanding, the Company will not, without the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the then outstanding shares of the Series X Preferred Stock, (i) alter or change adversely the powers, preferences or rights given to the Series X Preferred Stock or alter or amend the Certificate of Designation, amend or repeal any provision of, or add any provision to, the Certificate of Incorporation or by-laws of the Company, or file any articles of amendment, certificate of designations, preferences, limitations and relative rights of any series of preferred stock, if such action would adversely alter or change the preferences, rights, privileges or powers of, or restrictions provided for the benefit of the Series X Preferred Stock, (ii) issue further shares of Series X Preferred Stock or increase or decrease (other than by conversion) the number of authorized shares of Series X Preferred Stock, or (iii) enter into any agreement with respect to any of the foregoing. Dividends Holders of Series X Preferred Stock are entitled to receive dividends on shares of Series X Preferred Stock equal, on an as-if-converted-to-common-stock basis, and in the same form as dividends actually paid on shares of the common stock. Such dividends are not cumulative. Since the Company s inception, no dividends have been declared or paid. Liquidation, dissolution or winding up The Series X Preferred Stock does not have a preference upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Company. Upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, the Series X preferred stockholders shall be entitled to receive an equivalent amount of distributions as would be paid on the common stock underlying the Series X Preferred Stock, determined on an as-converted basis, pari passu with any distributions to the common stock shareholders. Conversion The Series X Preferred Stock is convertible into common stock at a rate of shares of common stock for every one share of Series X Preferred Stock that is converted.

 Overview and Recent Developments 
 We are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing novel therapies for the treatment of orphan pulmonary and fibrosis indications with no approved or limited effective treatments. We currently have two product candidates in clinical development, LTI-03 and LTI-01, and multiple candidates in preclinical development focused on fibrosis indications. Our pipeline includes: 
 LTI-03, a peptide for which we conducted a Phase 1b dose-ranging, placebo-controlled safety, tolerability, and pharmacodynamic biomarker activity trial in development for the treatment of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis IPF ), that has demonstrated the ability in both preclinical studies and clinical trials to protect healthy lung epithelial cells and reduce pro-fibrotic signaling; 

LTI-01, a proenzyme that completed a Phase 2a dose-ranging, placebo-controlled trial and a Phase 1b safety, tolerability and proof of mechanism trial in loculated pleural effusion LPE ), patients, an indication that has no approved drug treatment; and 

preclinical programs targeting cystic fibrosis and a peptide program focused on the Cav1 protein for systemic fibrosis indications. 

In June 2024, we decided to temporarily delay clinical development of LTI-01 in an effort to focus our resources on clinical development of LTI-03 and until additional funds are raised. 
 Prior to the termination of development of ALRN-6924 in February 2023 and the Lung Acquisition (as described below), our focus was the development of ALRN-6924, a MDM2/MDMX dual inhibitor that leveraged our proprietary peptide drug technology. Since our inception, we have devoted a substantial portion of our resources to developing our product candidates, including ALRN-6924 and since the Lung Acquisition, LTI-03, developing our technology platform, building our intellectual property portfolio, business planning, raising capital and providing general and administrative support for these operations. 
 Data from Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 of Phase 1b Clinical Trial of LTI-03 
 The Phase 1b trial of LTI-03 is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 1b clinical trial of LTI-03 in IPF patients, which is being conducted at 11 centers in the United States, the United Kingdom, Belgium, Germany and Australia. In the trial, these patients have a bronchoscopy at a baseline screening followed by either LTI-03 or placebo twice a day for 14 days. On day 14, shortly after the final dose, patients receive a second bronchoscopy and are monitored thereafter for seven days. In Cohort 1, patients in the active arm inhaled a single 2.5 mg capsule of LTI-03 twice daily. In Cohort 2, patients received two 2.5 mg capsules of LTI-03 for inhalation twice daily. Of the 12 patients enrolled in Cohort 1 of the trial, three were randomized to the placebo arm and nine to the active arm. Of the 12 patients enrolled in Cohort 2 of the trial, three were randomized to the placebo arm and nine to the active arm. In addition to the safety and tolerability of LTI-03, in the trial, various biomarkers relating to epithelial damage, fibrosis and inflammation in blood cells were assessed. The eight biomarkers that we evaluated in Cohort 1 included: thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), galectin-7 (GAL-7), interleukin-11 (IL-11), collagen 1 alpha chain (Col-1 1), phosphorylated SMAD2/3 (pSMAD2/3/tSMAD2/3), phosphorylated AKT kinase (pAKT), soluble (sol) receptor for advanced glycation end-products (solRAGE), and CXC chemokine 7 (CXCL7). The eight biomarkers that we evaluated in Cohort 2 included: TSLP, GAL-7, IL-11, Col-1 1, pSMAD2/3/tSMAD2/3, pAKT, CXCL7, and surfactant protein D (SPD). solRAGE, which was evaluated in Cohort 1, was not able to be evaluated in Cohort 2 due to multiple protocol violations. 
 In May 2024, we announced positive data from the low-dose Cohort 1 of the Phase 1b clinical trial. 
 In Cohort 1, a positive trend was observed in seven out of the eight biomarkers with data from three biomarkers being statistically significant (based on a one-tailed t-test). The findings from Cohort 1 include: 
 LTI-03 reduced expression of multiple profibrotic proteins in both pathologic basal-like cells and fibroblasts, with statistically significant decreases observed in three biomarkers - GAL-7 (p=0.0014, SEM 0.901), TSLP (p=0.0223, SEM 

22 

5.163) and Col-1 1 (p=0.0489, SEM 0.7102) - supporting the potential of LTI-03 to reduce fibrosis, inflammation and associated changes in the lung. 

LTI-03 stimulated production of solRAGE (p=0.1407, SEM 0.3269), a factor indicative of type I epithelial cell health that is a critically important aspect of IPF and has gone largely unaddressed. 

LTI-03 did not induce inflammation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells as measured by pAKT (p=0.358, SEM 11.32). 

LTI-03 was generally well-tolerated with no serious adverse events reported. 

In November 2024, we announced positive topline data from the high-dose Cohort 2 of the Phase 1b clinical trial. 
 In Cohort 2, a positive trend was observed in seven out of the eight biomarkers, with data from three biomarkers that were statistically significant in Cohort 2, and from four biomarkers that were statistically significant in the combined data set of Cohort 1 and Cohort 2, and data from five biomarkers that showed dose dependence relative to the data from those biomarkers in Cohort 1. The findings from Cohort 2 include: 
 LTI-03 reduced expression of multiple profibrotic proteins active in both pathologic basal-like cells and fibroblasts, with four biomarkers (IL-11, CXCL7, TSLP and GAL-7) showing statistically significant decreases in the combined data set supporting the potential of LTI-03 to reduce fibrosis, inflammation and associated functional changes in the lung. 

LTI-03 dose dependent trends were observed in five biomarkers, including COL1A1, CXCL7, TSLP, GAL-7, and SPD, which provide evidence of active LTI-03 pharmacodynamics in the trial. 

SPD, an indicator of epithelial cell health that is linked to decline in lung function, decreased by 5 in Cohort 2 at 14 days of treatment. The current standard of care for IPF, nintetanib, reduced SPD by 4 at 12-weeks in a third party trial of nentanib referred to as the INMARK trial. The biomarker regarding change in SPD in our Phase 1b trial and the data from the INMARK trial of nintedanib compares two clinical trials with different trial designs, patient enrollment criteria and treatment regimens. In addition, the applicable measurements were observed over different time periods. As a result, the data from these trials may not be directly comparable. 

LTI-03 did not induce inflammation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in either Cohort, measured by pAKT, a safety marker for inflammation in this trial. 

LTI-03 was generally well-tolerated, and there were no drug-related adverse events that resulted in a discontinuation of the trial. 

Planning is underway for a Phase 2 clinical trial. 
 The Lung Acquisition 
 On October 31, 2023, we acquired Lung Therapeutics, Inc. Lung pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Lung Acquisition Agreement ). Following our acquisition of Lung (the Lung Acquisition ), Lung became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. In addition, following the Lung Acquisition, the business conducted by Lung became the business primarily conducted by the Company and we shifted our operating disease focus to advancing a pipeline of first-in-class medicines to address significant unmet medical needs in orphan pulmonary and fibrosis indications. 
 Under the terms of the Lung Acquisition Agreement, at the closing of the Lung Acquisition, we issued to the stockholders of Lung 344,345 shares of our common stock and 19,903 shares of our newly designated Series X non-voting convertible preferred stock (the Series X Preferred Stock ). Each share of Series X Preferred Stock is convertible into 1,000 shares of common stock. In addition, we assumed all Lung stock options and all warrants exercisable for Lung common stock immediately outstanding prior to the closing of the Lung Acquisition, each subject to adjustment pursuant to the terms of the Lung Acquisition Agreement. 
 Immediately following the closing of the Lung Acquisition, we entered into a Stock and Warrant Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement with a group of accredited investors led by Bios Partners, the majority stockholder of Lung prior to the closing of the Lung Acquisition, and including Nantahala Capital, as well as additional undisclosed investors, pursuant to which we issued and sold (i) an aggregate of 4,707 shares of Series X Preferred Stock, and (ii) warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 2,353,500 shares of common stock (the PIPE Warrant Shares for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 18.4 million, which included the conversion of certain convertible promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of approximately 1.6 million issued by Lung to Bios Partners prior to the closing of the Lung Acquisition at a 10 discount to the per share price of the Series X Preferred Stock (the PIPE Financing ). The PIPE Financing closed on November 2, 2023. 
 On February 28, 2024, we held our 2023 annual meeting of stockholders in which our stockholders approved the issuance, in accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(a), of shares of common stock, upon conversion of our outstanding Series X Preferred Stock. Following approval of the conversion of outstanding Series X Preferred Stock, the Company had approximately 29,495,512 shares of common stock issued and outstanding on a pro forma basis, which gives effect to the full conversion of the Series X Preferred Stock as 
 23 

of the date of our 2023 annual meeting of stockholders, without regard to beneficial ownership limitations that may limit the ability of certain holders of Series X Preferred Stock to convert such shares to common stock as such time. On March 5, 2024, subject to then existing beneficial ownership limitations, 11,957 shares of Series X Preferred Stock were automatically converted into 11,957,000 shares of common stock. 
 Exclusive Option Agreement with Advancium 
 On October 31, 2024, we entered into an exclusive option agreement with Advancium for the sale of ALRN-6924. During the option period, Advancium intends to evaluate ALRN-6924 as a potential therapy for retinoblastoma. Under the terms of the option agreement Advancium paid us a non-refundable fee of 0.1 million for the exclusive option to acquire ALRN-6924 and related assets. If Advancium exercises its option, we will receive an exercise payment with potential for additional development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments and sales royalties. 
 Liquidity and Going Concern 
 Management believes that, based on our current operating plan, our cash and cash equivalents of 17.7 million as of September 30, 2024 will not be sufficient to enable the Company to fund its operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at least twelve months from the date of issuance of the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-Q, which raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. See Note 1 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included under Part I, Item I of this Form 10-Q for a further discussion of our liquidity and the conditions that raise substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. 
 Components of our Results of Operations 
 Revenue 
 We have not generated any revenue from product sales and we do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of products in the foreseeable future. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Our expenses since inception have consisted solely of research and development costs, general and administrative, and restructuring costs. 
 Research and Development Expenses 
 For the periods presented in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for our research activities, including our discovery efforts, and the development of our product candidates, and include: 
 salaries, benefits and other related costs, including stock-based compensation expense, for personnel engaged in research and development functions; 

expenses incurred in connection with the clinical development of our product candidates, including under agreements with third parties, such as consultants and contract research organizations, or CROs; 

the cost of manufacturing product candidates for use in our clinical trials and preclinical studies, including under agreements with third parties, such as consultants and contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs; 

expenses incurred in connection with the preclinical development of our product candidates, including outsourced professional scientific development services, consulting research fees and payments made under sponsored research arrangements with third parties; 

the costs of laboratory supplies and acquiring, developing and manufacturing preclinical study and clinical trial materials; 

third-party license fees; 

costs related to compliance with regulatory requirements; and 

facility-related expenses, which included direct depreciation costs and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and other operating costs. 

We expense research and development costs as incurred. We recognize costs for certain development activities, such as clinical trials, based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using data such as patient enrollment, clinical site activations or information provided to us by our vendors and our clinical investigative sites. Payments for these activities are based on the terms of the individual agreements, which may differ from the pattern of costs incurred, and are reflected in our financial statements as prepaid or accrued research and development expenses. 
 24 

In addition, we typically use our employee and infrastructure resources across our development programs. We track outsourced development costs and milestone payments made under our licensing arrangements by product candidate or development program, but we do not allocate personnel costs, license payments made under our licensing arrangements or other internal costs to specific development programs or product candidates because these costs are deployed across multiple programs and, as such, are not separately classified. 
 Research and development activities are central to our business model. The duration, costs and timing of clinical trials and development of a product candidate depend on a variety of factors, including: 
 the scope, rate of progress, expense and results of clinical trials of the product candidates that we are developing and other research and development activities that we have conducted; 

uncertainties in clinical trial design and patient enrollment rates; 

significant and changing government regulation and regulatory guidance; 

the timing and receipt of any marketing approvals; and 

the expense of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights. 

A change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of a product candidate could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. For example, if the FDA, or another regulatory authority were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those that we anticipate would be required for the completion of clinical development of a product candidate, or if we experience significant trial delays due to patient enrollment or other reasons, we could be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel in our executive, finance and corporate and administrative functions. General and administrative expenses are comprised of professional fees associated with being a public company including costs of accounting, auditing, legal, regulatory, tax and consulting services associated with maintaining compliance with exchange listing and the SEC requirements, director and officer insurance costs; and both public and investor relations costs. General and administrative expenses also include legal fees relating to patent and corporate matters; legal and other professional fees relating to our strategic process; other insurance costs; travel expenses; and facility-related expenses, which include direct depreciation costs and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and other operating costs. 
 Restructuring Costs 
 Restructuring-related charges are comprised of one-time termination costs in connection with our reduction-in-workforce in 2023, including severance, benefits, and related costs. 
 Other Income, net 
 Interest and Other Income 
 Interest income consists of interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents. Historically, our interest income had not been significant due to low investment balances and low interest earned on those balances. We anticipate that our interest income will fluctuate in the future in response to our cash and cash equivalents and the interest rate environment. 
 Other income, net consists of gains or losses recognized from non-routine items such as accretion on short-term investments, and gains or losses recognized from foreign currency transactions, and the disposal of fixed assets.

Research and Development Expenses 
 Research and development expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 3.7 million, compared to less than 0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of 3.7 million was primarily a result of the clinical programs acquired as part of the Lung Acquisition in October 2023. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred expenses of 2.1 million on clinical trials, 1.0 million on manufacturing including 0.8 million write-offs due to the temporary delay of clinical development of LTI-01, and 0.1 million on regulatory and development consulting as well as 0.5 million on employee and related expenses associated with clinical programs acquired in the Lung Acquisition. These programs and related activities were not included in the Company s financial results for periods prior to the Lung Acquisition, including during the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses were 2.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of 0.4 million was primarily due to increased employee and related expenses of 0.5 million as a result of increased headcount associated with the Lung Acquisition and severance expense recognized due to departure of former employees, and increased facilities and other expenses of 0.2 million, offset by decreased professional fees of 0.3 million as a result of less external consulting expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Restructuring and Other Costs 
 There were no restructuring-related expenses incurred in the three months ended September 30, 2024. Before the Lung Acquisition, in February 2023, our Board of Directors determined to reduce the Company s workforce at that time from nine to three full-time employees. We incurred restructuring-related charges of less than 0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Restructuring-related charges were comprised of one-time termination costs in connection with the reduction-in-workforce, including severance, benefits, and related costs. All restructuring-related expenses were incurred and paid in 2023. 
 Other Income, net 
 Other income, net for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 0.2 million and it was primarily driven by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest of our money market funds and treasury bills.

Research and Development Expenses 
 Research and development expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 10.9 million, compared to 2.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of 8.9 million was primarily a result of the clinical programs acquired as part of the Lung Acquisition in October 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred expenses of 4.2 million on clinical trials, 4.6 million on manufacturing including 3.2 million write-offs due to the expiration of clinical materials and the temporary delay of clinical development of LTI-01, and 0.5 million on regulatory and development consulting as well as 1.6 million on employee and related expenses associated with clinical programs acquired in the Lung Acquisition. These programs and related activities were not included in the Company s financial results for periods prior to the Lung Acquisition, including during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. There were 2.0 million research and development expenses related to ALRN-6924 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses were 11.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 6.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of 5.4 million was primarily due to increased professional fees of 1.7 million and increased employee and related expenses of 2.6 million as a result of increased consulting activities and headcount associated with the Lung Acquisition and severance expense recognized due to departure of former employees, and increased facilities and other expenses of 1.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Restructuring and Other Costs 
 There were no restructuring-related expenses incurred in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We incurred restructuring-related charges of 0.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 in connection with our February 2023 restructuring before the Lung Acquisition. Restructuring-related charges were comprised of one-time termination costs in connection with the reduction-in-workforce, including severance, benefits, and related costs. All restructuring-related expenses were incurred and paid in 2023. 
 Other Income, net 
 Other income, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 0.4 million and it was primarily driven by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest of our money market funds and treasury bills. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Since inception, we have not generated any revenue from product sales and have incurred significant operating losses and negative cash flows from operations. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future as we advance the clinical development of our lead product candidates, LTI-03 and LTI-01, or any future product candidates. We expect that our research and development and general and administrative costs will continue to increase significantly, including in connection with conducting clinical trials and manufacturing for our lead product candidates or any future product candidates to support potential future commercialization and providing general and administrative support for our operations, including the costs associated with operating as a public company. 
 As a result, we will need additional capital to fund our operations, which we may obtain from additional equity or debt financings, strategic collaborations, licensing arrangements or other sources. See the section titled Risk Factors found elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on April 15, 2024 for additional risks associated with our substantial capital requirements. 
 27 

To date, we have funded our operations through sales of common stock in our initial public offering, sales of common stock and warrants in follow-on public offerings, sales of common stock and warrants in a private placement, sales of common stock in at-the-market offerings, sales of common stock under our now terminated equity line with Lincoln Park Capital LLC, sales of preferred stock prior to our initial public offering, payments received under a collaboration agreement, sales of common stock, preferred stock and warrants in connection with the Lung Acquisition and the PIPE Financing and sales of common stock upon option exercises. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 17.7 million. 
 In July 2024, we entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement with Citizens JMP Securities, LLC Citizens JMP ), as agent and/or principal, under which we may offer and sell up to 50.0 million of our common stock from time to time through or to Citizens JMP. Sales of common stock through or to Citizens JMP may be made by any method that is deemed an at the market offering as defined in Rule 415(a)(4) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, including sales made directly on or through the Nasdaq Capital Market. We did not sell any shares of common stock pursuant to the Equity Distribution Agreement during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Upon entry into the Equity Distribution Agreement, we terminated our prior at the market offering pursuant to a Capital on Demand Sales Agreement with JonesTrading Institutional Services LLC and William Blair Company, L.L.C. At the time of termination, we had not sold any shares under the sales agreement prospectus related to the prior sales agreement. 
 In May 2024, we completed an underwritten follow-on public offering (the Offering of 4,273,505 shares of our common stock and accompanying warrants to purchase 4,273,505 shares of our common stock. All of the shares and accompanying warrants sold in the Offering were sold by the Company. Each share was offered and sold together with an accompanying warrant at a combined offering price of 4.68, and the underwriter purchased each share and accompanying warrant at a combined price of 4.35. Net proceeds from the Offering were approximately 17.7 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses, and excluding any proceeds that may be received from exercise of the warrants. 
 Each warrant has an exercise price per share of common stock equal to 4.68. Each warrant may be exercised until May 1, 2027. Each warrant is exercisable solely by means of a cash exercise, except that a warrant is exercisable via cashless exercise if at the time of exercise, a registration statement registering the issuance of shares underlying the warrants is not then effective or the prospectus contained therein is not available for the issuance of such shares. 
 Each warrant is callable by the Company during the ten trading day period after the date that is 30 days following the public announcement by the Company of the topline results from the Phase 1b clinical trial of LTI-03 in patients with IPF, including a statement that there were no drug-related adverse events that resulted in a discontinuation of the trial. In accordance with the terms of the warrants, each warrant is callable by the Company during the ten-trading day period after November 13, 2024 (the Trigger Date ). Subject to certain exceptions, in the event that the warrants are outstanding, if, after the Trigger Date, then the Company may, within ten trading days of the Trigger Date, upon notice (a Call Notice ), call for cancellation of the warrants for which a notice of exercise has not yet been delivered for consideration equal to 0.001 per share of common stock; provided that the Company may only deliver such Call Notice if the volume-weighted average price of its shares of common stock exceeds the exercise price of the warrants on the trading day immediately prior to the date the Company delivers the Call Notice. Any warrant subject to such Call Notice for which a notice of exercise shall not have been received by the Call Date (as hereinafter defined) will be canceled at 6:30 p.m. (New York City time) on the tenth trading day after the date we send the Call Notice (such date and time, the Call Date ).

Operating Activities. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in operating activities was 17.5 million primarily due to our net loss of 21.9 million, offset by cash provided by the change in operating assets and liabilities of 3.4 million and non-cash charges of 1.0 million. Non-cash charges resulted primarily from stock-based compensation expense of 1.0 million. Changes in our operating assets and liabilities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted primarily of a decrease of 2.2 million in other assets due to the recognition of a prepaid expense, and an increase of 1.4 million in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, offset by an increase of less than 0.1 million in prepaid expenses and other current assets and a decrease of 0.1 million in accounts payable. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash used in operating activities was 9.4 million primarily due to our net loss of 8.4 million and 1.8 million of decreased net operating assets and liabilities, offset by 0.8 million in non-cash expenses. 
 Investing Activities . 
 28 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there was no cash provided by investing activities. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash provided by investing activities was 16.3 million primarily resulting from proceeds from the sale of investments. 
 Financing Activities. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by financing activities was 17.8 million primarily due to the Offering in May 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, there were no cash provided by financing activities. 
 Funding Requirements 
 Our plan of operation is to continue implementing our business strategy, continue research and development of LTI-03 and LTI-01 and any other product candidates we may acquire or develop and continue to expand our research pipeline and our internal research and development capabilities. We expect our expenses to increase substantially in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we advance the preclinical activities and clinical trials of our current and future product candidates. In addition, we expect to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company. Accordingly, we will need to obtain substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we would be forced to delay, reduce or terminate our research and development programs or future commercialization efforts. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including: 
 the scope, timing, progress, costs, and results of discovery, preclinical development, and clinical trials for our current and future product candidates; 

the number of clinical trials required for regulatory approval of our current and future product candidates; 

the costs, timing, and outcome of regulatory review of any of our current and future product candidates; 

the cost of manufacturing clinical and commercial supplies of our current and future product candidates; 

the costs and timing of future commercialization activities, including manufacturing, marketing, sales, and distribution, for any of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval; 

the costs and timing of preparing, filing, and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights, and defending any intellectual property-related claims, including any claims by third parties that we are infringing upon their intellectual property rights; 

our ability to maintain existing, and establish new, strategic collaborations, licensing, or other arrangements and the financial terms of any such agreements, including the timing and amount of any future milestone, royalty, or other payments due under any such agreement; 

the revenue, if any, received from commercial sales of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval; 

expenses to attract, hire and retain, skilled personnel; 

the costs of operating as a public company; 

if our product candidates are approved, our ability to establish a commercially viable pricing structure and obtain approval for coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party and government payors; 

the effect of competing technological and market developments; 

the extent to which we acquire or invest in businesses, products, and technologies; and 

unfavorable global economic conditions, which may exacerbate the magnitude of the factors discussed above. 

A change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of a product candidate could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of the product candidates. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 17.7 million. Based on our current operating plan, we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024 will be sufficient to enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into June 2025. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could exhaust our available capital resources sooner than we expect. 
 Until such time as we can generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our operations from the sale of additional equity or debt financings, strategic collaborations, licensing, arrangements or other sources. In the event that additional financing is required, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us, or at all. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible preferred stock, it may result in dilution to our existing stockholders. Debt financing or preferred equity financing, if available, may result in increased fixed payment obligations, and the existence of securities with rights that may be senior to those of our common stock. If we incur indebtedness, we could become subject to covenants that would restrict our operations. 
 29 

If we raise funds through strategic collaborations, licensing or other arrangements, we may relinquish significant rights or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. Our ability to raise additional funds may be adversely impacted by potential worsening global economic conditions and the recent disruptions to, and volatility in, the credit and financial markets in the United States and worldwide. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market products or product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements to this Report on Form 10-Q, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, costs, and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no material changes to the items that we disclosed as our critical accounting estimates in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 as filed with the SEC on April 15, 2024. 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 See Note 2 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements to this Report on Form 10-Q for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. 
 Smaller Reporting Company Status 
 We are a smaller reporting company as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). We may continue to be a smaller reporting company if either (i) the market value of our shares held by non-affiliates is less than 250.0 million or (ii) our annual revenue was less than 100.0 million during the most recently completed fiscal year and the market value of our shares held by non-affiliates is less than 700.0 million. For so long as we continue to be a smaller reporting company, we may continue to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are available to smaller reporting companies. 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitati ve Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 We are a smaller reporting company, as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, for this reporting period and are not required to provide the information required under this item. 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 
 The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, refers to controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and principal financial officer, evaluated, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2024, because of the identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting described below. 
 30 

Material Weaknesses 
 A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a possibility that a material misstatement of our financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Management identified material weaknesses related to (i) lack of sufficient accounting and supervisory personnel to maintain appropriate segregation of duties relating to user access of the financial accounting system and who have the appropriate level of technical accounting experience and training, (ii) lack of evidence over reviews of account reconciliations and supporting schedules, and (iii) lack of adequate procedures and controls to ensure that accurate financial statements could have been prepared and reviewed on a timely basis for annual reporting purposes. In the year ended December 31, 2023, management identified material weaknesses related to the accounting for our acquisition of Lung, including a lack of sufficient precision in the performance of reviews supporting the purchase price allocation accounting, and a lack of timely oversight over third-party specialists and the reports they produced to support the accounting for the Lung Acquisition. These material weaknesses continue to exist as of September 30, 2024. 
 Management s Plan to Remediate the Material Weaknesses 
 We have implemented and are continuing to implement procedures to remediate these material weaknesses, including the hiring of a Controller with the requisite supervisory background and knowledge in financial reporting, integration into one accounting system, engaging third party accounting specialists and building a more streamlined process in order to prepare and review financial information, however, our control environment needs improvement, and as a result we may be exposed to errors. Our remediation plan also includes the hiring of additional accounting employees and/or consultants with the specific technical accounting experience necessary to assist with complex, non-routine transactions and to support the timely completion of financial close procedures, the implementation of robust processes, and to assist with the preparation of financial statements and our compliance with SEC reporting obligations. Management has engaged a third-party to assist in evaluating and documenting the design and operating effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, and their work is ongoing. With the help of third-party consultants, we have nearly completed the integration of the acquired systems from the Lung Acquisition into our financial and accounting systems. Additionally, we intend to develop and implement consistent accounting policies and internal control procedures and provide additional training to our accounting and financial reporting personnel. 
 The below are actions that we have taken to date to remediate the above-mentioned material weaknesses: 
 Enhanced the execution of our risk assessment activities by evaluating whether the design of our internal controls appropriately addresses changes in the business (including changes to people, processes and systems) that could impact our system of internal controls. 

Substantially completed the integration of the acquired systems from the Lung Acquisition into our financial and accounting systems to allow for systematic segregation of duties, and to enhance the accurate and timely preparation and review of financial statements and supporting schedules. 

In addition to implementing and executing the aforementioned activities, the following activities are expected to be completed in fiscal year 2024: 
 Continue to reassess staffing and add additional resources, as required, with the requisite technical accounting experience and training, to further allow for segregation of duties and to support our system of internal control. 

As needed, we will also supplement our internal resources with third-party resources and enhance our corporate oversight and monitoring over these resources, process-level controls and structures to ensure that there is appropriate assignment of authority, responsibility, and accountability. 

Engage a third-party to assist in redesigning, documenting, and testing the internal control activities that support the Company s timely preparation and review of account reconciliations, financial statements and supporting schedules. 

Continue to report regularly to the audit committee on the progress and results of the remediation plan, including the identification, status and resolution of internal control deficiencies. 

The material weaknesses will not be considered remediated until management completes the design and implementation of the measures described above and the controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are effective. Management believes that the remediation measures described above will be implemented in a manner such that the controls can be tested, and the identified material weaknesses can be determined to be remediated, however, no assurance can be made that such remediation will occur or that additional material weaknesses will not be identified. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 Except for the above noted and previously reported material weaknesses and the related ongoing remediation activities described above, no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) 
 31 

has occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 32 

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 We are not currently a party to any material legal proceedings. From time to time, we may be subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of our business activities. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have a material adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement, costs, diversion of management resources, and other factors. 
 Item 1A. Ri sk Factors. 
 Other than as described below, there have been no material changes to our risk factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A-Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 You should carefully consider the risks included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, together with all of the other information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The occurrence of any single risk or any combination of risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the trading price of our common stock. 
 We may not achieve our publicly announced milestones according to schedule, or at all. 
 From time to time, we may announce the timing of certain events that we expect to occur, such as the anticipated timing of results from our clinical trials. These statements are forward-looking and are based on the best estimates of management at the time relating to the occurrence of such events. However, the actual timing of such events may differ from what has been publicly disclosed. The timing of events such as initiation or completion of a clinical trial, the announcement of the results of a clinical trial, or the filing of an application to obtain regulatory approval may ultimately vary from what is publicly disclosed. These variations in timing may occur as a result of different events, including the nature of the results obtained during a clinical trial or during a research phase, timing of the completion of clinical trials, or any other event having the effect of delaying the publicly announced timeline. We undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking information or statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as otherwise required by law. Any variation in the timing of previously announced milestones could have a material adverse effect on our business plan, financial condition or operating results and the trading price of our common stock. 
 Due to our limited resources and access to capital, we must make decisions on the allocation of resources to certain programs and product candidates; these decisions may prove to be wrong and may adversely affect our business. 
 We have limited financial and human resources and intend to initially focus on research programs and product candidates for a limited set of indications. As a result, we may forgo or delay pursuit of opportunities with other product candidates or for other indications that later prove to have greater commercial potential or a greater likelihood of success. This approach may cause us to commit significant resources to prepare for and conduct later-stage trials for one or more product candidates that subsequently fail earlier-stage clinical testing. Therefore, our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities, or expend resources on product candidates that are not viable. For instance, in June 2024, we decided to temporarily delay clinical development of LTI-01 in an effort to focus our resources on clinical development of LTI-03 for the treatment of IPF and until additional funds are raised. 
 There can be no assurance that we will ever be able to identify additional therapeutic opportunities for our product candidates or to develop suitable potential product candidates through internal research programs, which could materially adversely affect our future growth and prospects. We may focus our efforts and resources on potential product candidates or other potential programs that ultimately prove to be unsuccessful. 
 Mergers and acquisitions in the biopharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, more convenient, or less expensive than any products that we may develop. Furthermore, products currently approved for other indications could be discovered to be effective treatments of IPF and LPE as well, which could give such products significant regulatory and market timing advantages over LTI-03 and LTI-01 or other product candidates that we may identify. Currently, off-label use of fibrinolytics is utilized in many hospitals for the treatment of LPE. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. If competitors obtain patent protection or market exclusivity for their products before any of our products are approved, they could significantly delay the approval, and even review (in some cases), of our marketing application. Additionally, products or technologies developed by our competitors may render our potential product candidates uneconomical or obsolete and we may not be successful in marketing any product candidates we may develop against competitors. The availability of competitive products could limit the demand, and the price we are able to charge, for any products that we may develop and commercialize.
