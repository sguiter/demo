 patents and patent applications worldwide. On October 1, 2022, the Company completed the previously announced separation the Separation of its product business into a separate, independent, publicly-traded company, Xperi Inc. Xperi Inc. ). The Separation was structured as a spin-off, which was achieved through the Company s distribution of percent of the outstanding shares of Xperi Inc. s common stock to holders of the Company s common stock as of the close of business on the record date of September 21, 2022 (the Record Date ). Each Company stockholder of record received shares of Xperi Inc. common stock for every shares of Company common stock that it held on the Record Date. Following the Separation, the Company retains no ownership in Xperi Inc., which is now listed under the ticker symbol XPER on the New York Stock Exchange. Effective at the open of business on October 3, 2022, the Company s shares of common stock, par value per share, began trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the new ticker symbol ADEA . Additionally, as a result of the Separation, the Company changed its operational structure in the fourth quarter of 2022, resulting in reportable segment, IP Licensing. 
 Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted in accordance with such rules and regulations. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements reflect all adjustments necessary (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) to state fairly the financial position of the Company and its results of operations and cash flows as of and for the periods presented. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2024 or any future period and the Company makes no representations related thereto.

Public entities with a single reportable segment are required to apply the disclosure requirements in ASU 2023-07, as well as all existing segment disclosures and reconciliation requirements in ASC 280 on an interim and annual basis. ASU 2023-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and for interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2023-07. In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures ASU 2023-09 ), which requires public entities, on an annual basis, to provide disclosure of specific categories in the rate reconciliation, as well as disclosure of income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction.

or less. The Company applies a practical expedient to expense costs to obtain a contract with a customer as incurred as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses when the amortization period would have been or less. The Company applies a practical expedient when disclosing revenue expected to be recognized from unsatisfied performance obligations to exclude contracts with customers with an original duration of less than ; amounts attributable to variable consideration arising from (i) a sales-based or usage-based royalty of an intellectual property license or (ii) when variable consideration is allocated entirely to a wholly unsatisfied performance obligation; or to a wholly unsatisfied promise to transfer a distinct good or service that forms part of a single performance obligation. 
 Revenue Details Revenue Disaggregation The following information depicts how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors by disaggregating revenue by category, market vertical and geographic location (presented in Note 15 Segment and Geographic Information ). This information includes revenue recognized from contracts with customers and revenue from other sources, including sales-based or usage-based royalty revenues and fees associated with releases for past infringement. Recurring and non-recurring revenue Recurring revenue includes the following: (i) for fixed-fee Media IP license agreements, revenue associated with rights to existing and future patented technologies during reporting periods beginning with the reporting period in which the agreement is executed through the end of the term of the agreement, which are recognized on a straight-line basis; and (ii) for per-unit or per-subscriber Media IP or Semiconductor IP royalty license agreements, revenue associated with sales-based or usage-based royalties in exchange for a license of IP, which are recognized in the period such subsequent sales or usage occurs. Non-recurring revenue includes the following: (i) for fixed-fee or minimum guarantee Semiconductor IP license agreements, revenue in the amount of such fixed fee or minimum guarantee associated with the right to use the IP, which is recognized upon execution of the agreement; and (ii) for all license agreements, revenue in the amount of the fees associated with releases for past patent infringement or licenses, in each case with respect to reporting periods prior to the execution of the agreement, which is recognized upon execution of the agreement.

Contract Balances Contracts Assets Contract assets primarily consist of unbilled contracts receivable that are expected to be received from customers in future periods, where the revenue recognized to date exceeds the amount billed. The amount of unbilled contracts receivable may not exceed their net realizable value and are classified as long-term assets if the payments are expected to be received more than one year from the reporting date. Contract assets also include the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer, principally sales commissions when the renewal commission is not commensurate with the initial commission.

Contract Liabilities Contract liabilities are comprised of deferred revenue related to multi-period licensing arrangements for which the Company is paid in advance, while the underlying performance obligation is satisfied at a future date or over time. Allowance for Credit Losses The allowance for credit losses represents the Company s best estimate of lifetime expected credit losses inherent in accounts receivable and unbilled contracts receivable. The Company s long-term unbilled contracts receivable is derived from fixed-fee or minimum-guarantee Semiconductor IP licensing and is primarily comprised of contracts with large, well-capitalized companies. It is generally considered to be of high credit quality due to past collection history and the nature of the customers. The allowance for credit losses at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 wa s million and million, respectively and is presented as part of accounts receivable, net in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Performance obligations satisfied in previous periods (1) 

(1) Performance obligations satisfied in previous periods consist mainly of fees associated with releases for past patent infringement, settlements of litigation during the period, and revenue from past royalties owed pursuant to expired or terminated IP license agreements. For long-term and multi-year revenue contracts, the Company recorded revenue from the releases for past infringement during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and expects to record revenue from the prospective license in future periods.

At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had million and million, respectively, in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. A portion of these amounts was held in marketable securities, as shown above. The remaining balances of million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, consisted of cash held in operating accounts not included in the tables above. Debt Securities The gross realized gains and losses on sales of marketable debt securities were immaterial during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Unrealized losses on AFS debt securities were immaterial as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The Company evaluated whether the decline in fair value has resulted from credit losses or other factors and concluded these amounts were related to temporary fluctuations in value of AFS securities and were due primarily to changes in interest rates and market conditions of the underlying securities. The Compan y did t rec ognize a provision for credit losses related to its AFS debt securities during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

 million. There were changes t o the carrying value of goodwill from January 1, through September 30, 2024. Goodwill at each reporting unit is evaluated for potential impairment annually, as of the beginning of the fourth quarter, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable. The process of evaluating goodwill for potential impairment is subjective and requires significant estimates, assumptions and judgments particularly related to the identification of reporting units, the assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units and estimating the fair value of each reporting unit. impairment charges were recognized during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

Basic net income per share is computed using the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period, excluding any unvested restricted stock units that are subject to repurchase. Diluted net income per share is computed using the treasury stock method to calculate the weighted average number of shares of common stock and, if dilutive, potential common shares outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive common shares include unvested restricted stock units and incremental common shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options, less shares repurchased from assumed proceeds. The assumed proceeds calculation includes actual proceeds to be received from the employee upon exercise and the average unrecognized stock compensation cost during the period.

The 2020 EIP provides for option grants designed as either incentive stock options or non-statutory options. Options generally are granted with an exercise price not less than the value of the common stock on the grant date and have a term of from the date of grant and vest over a period. The vesting criteria for restricted stock awards and restricted stock units is generally the passage of time or meeting certain performance-based objectives, and continued employment through the vesting period, which is generally for time-based awards. Assumed Plans On June 1, 2020, the Company assumed all then-outstanding stock options, awards, and shares available and reserved for issuance under all legacy Equity Incentive Plans of TiVo (collectively, the Assumed Plans ). Stock options assumed from the Assumed Plans generally have vesting periods of and a contractual term of . Awards of restricted stock and restricted stock units assumed from the Assumed Plans are generally subject to a vesting period. The Company has not issued any awards under these plans since the 2020 EIP was amended in 2022.

Performance Awards Performance awards may be granted to employees or consultants based upon, among other things, the contributions, responsibilities and other compensation of the particular employee or consultant. The value and the vesting of such performance awards are generally linked to one or more performance goals or certain market conditions determined by the Company, in each case on a specified date or dates or over any period or periods determined by the Company, and may range from to percent of the grant. For performance awards subject to a market vesting condition market-based PSUs ), the fair value per award is fixed at the grant date and the amount of compensation expense is not adjusted during the performance period regardless of changes in the level of achievement of the market condition. Employee Stock Purchase Plans On June 1, 2020, the Company adopted the 2020 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the 2020 ESPP ). The 2020 ESPP is implemented through consecutive overlapping 24-month offering periods, each of which is comprised of four six-month purchase periods. The first offering period commenced on September 1, 2020 and ended on August 31, 2022. Due to the Separation, the next offering period under the 2020 ESPP plan commenced on December 1, 2022. Each subsequent offering period under the 2020 ESPP will be twenty-four months long and will commence on each December 1 with four six-month purchase periods. Participants may contribute up to of their base earnings and commissions through payroll deductions, and the accumulated deductions will be applied to the purchase of shares on each semi-annual purchase date. The purchase price per share will equal of the fair market value per share on the start date of the offering period or, if lower, of the fair market value per share on the semi-annual purchase date. An eligible employee s right to buy the Company s common stock under the 2020 ESPP may not accrue at a rate in excess of of the fair market value of such shares per calendar year for each calendar year of an offering period. If the fair market value per share of the Company s common stock on any purchase date during an offering period is less than the fair market value per share on the start date of the offering period, then that offering period will automatically terminate and a new offering period will begin on the next business day. All participants in the terminated offering will be transferred to the new offering period. At the 2022 Annual Stockholders Meeting on April 29, 2022, the Company s stockholders approved an amendment to the 2020 ESPP and increased by million the number of shares reserved for issuance. As of September 30, 2024, the re were approximately million shares reserved for grant under the Company s 2020 ESPP.

per common share, respectively. The capacity to pay dividends in the future depends on many factors, including the Company s financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, capital structure, industry practice and other business conditions that the Board considers relevant. Stock Repurchase Programs On June 12, 2020 the Board authorized a new stock repurchase program providing for the repurchase of up to million of the Company s Common Stock dependent on market conditions, share prices and other factors. On April 22, 2021, the Board authorized an additional million of purchases under the existing stock repurchase plan. There were shares repurchased during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had repurchased a total of approximately million shares of common stock, since inception of the plan, at an average price of per share for a total cost of million. The shares repurchased are recorded as treasury stock and are accounted for under the cost method. No expiration date has been specified for this plan. As of September 30, 2024, the total remaining amount available for repurchase under this plan w as million. The Company may execute authorized repurchases from time to time under the plan. The Company accounts for stock repurchases using the cost method and records retirement of treasury stock as a reduction of the cumulative treasury stock paid-in capital balance. Once the cumulative balance is reduced to zero, any remaining difference resulting from the retirement of treasury stock is recorded as a reduction of retained earnings. The Company issues restricted stock awards as part of the equity incentive plans described above. For the majority of restricted awards, shares are withheld to satisfy required withholding taxes at the vesting date. Shares withheld to satisfy required withholding taxes in connection with the vesting of restricted awards are treated as common stock repurchases in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements because they reduce the number of shares that would have been issued on vesting. However, these withheld shares are not included in common stock repurchases under the Company s authorized share repurchase plan.

The effective tax rate varies from the U.S. federal tax rate primarily due to unrealized foreign exchange gain or loss on prior year South Korea withholding tax refund claims. The decrease in income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily due to certain unrealized foreign exchange benefits associated with South Korea withholding tax refund claims.

. to , some of which may include options to the leases for or longer, and some of which may include the leases within the next five years or less. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets; expense for these leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Variable lease payments are expensed as incurred and are not included within the lease liability and right-of-use assets calculation. As a practical expedient, the Company elected, for all office and facility leases, not to separate non-lease components (e.g., common-area maintenance costs) from lease components (e.g., fixed payments including rent) and instead to account for each separate lease component and its associated non-lease components as a single lease component. As most of the leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company generally, for purposes of discounting lease payments, uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the estimated rate of interest for collateralized borrowing over a similar term of the lease payments at commencement date.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The following discussion is intended to promote understanding of the results of operations and financial condition and should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto, and with our audited financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2023 found in the Form 10-K filed by us on February 23, 2023 (the Form 10-K ). This section of this Form 10-Q generally discusses quarter over quarter comparisons of 2024 against 2023.

All forward-looking statements by their nature address matters that involve risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the Company s control, and are not guarantees of future results. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. Accordingly, there are or will be important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in such statements and, therefore, you should not place undue reliance on any such statements and caution must be exercised in relying on forward-looking statements. Important risk factors that may cause such a difference include, but are not limited to: the Company s ability to implement its business strategy; the Company s ability to enter into new and renewal license agreements with customers on favorable terms; the Company s ability to retain and hire key personnel; uncertainty as to the long-term value of the Company s common stock; legislative, regulatory and economic developments affecting the Company s business; general economic and market developments and conditions; the Company s ability to grow and expand its patent portfolios; changes in technology and development of new technology in the industries in which the Company operates; the evolving legal, regulatory and tax regimes under which the Company operates; unforeseen liabilities and expenses; risks associated with the Company s indebtedness; the Company s ability to achieve the intended benefits of, and its ability to recognize the tax treatment of, the spin-off of its product business; unpredictability and severity of catastrophic events, including, but not limited to, acts of terrorism or outbreak of war or hostilities, natural disasters and future outbreaks or pandemics, each of which may have an adverse impact on the Company s business, results of operations, and financial condition.

On October 1, 2022, we completed the previously announced separation the Separation of its product business into an independent, publicly-traded company, Xperi Inc. Xperi Inc. ). The Separation was structured as a spin-off, which was achieved through Adeia s distribution of 100 percent of the outstanding shares of Xperi Inc. s common stock to holders of Adeia s common stock as of the close of business on the record date of September 21, 2022 (the Record Date ). Each Adeia stockholder of record received four shares of Xperi Inc. common stock for every ten shares of Adeia common stock that it held on the Record Date. Following the Separation, Adeia retains no ownership interest in Xperi Inc., which is now listed under the ticker symbol XPER on the New York Stock Exchange. Effective at the open of business on October 3, 2022, Adeia s shares of common stock, par value 0.001 per share, began trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the new ticker symbol ADEA . 
 Headquartered in Silicon Valley with more than 35 years of operating experience, we have approximately 144 employees, with substantially all of our employees located in the U.S. 
 Macroeconomic Conditions 
 Macroeconomic conditions due to inflation, geopolitical instability and global health events may have an adverse impact on our business. For example, such conditions may continue to cause volatility in the markets we serve, particularly the broad consumer electronics market. Impacts from adverse macroeconomic conditions may negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations, which could result in an impairment of our long-lived assets, including goodwill, and increased credit losses. 
 Reportable Segments 
 We operate and report in one segment: IP Licensing. We believe that this structure reflects our current operational and financial management and provides the best structure for us to focus on growth opportunities. Our Chief Executive Officer has been determined to be the Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM in consideration with the authoritative guidance on segment reporting. 
 We primarily license our innovations to leading companies in the broader media entertainment and semiconductor industries, and those companies developing new technologies that will help drive these industries forward. Licensing arrangements include access to one or more of our foundational patent portfolios and may also include access to some portions of our industry-leading technologies and know-how.

The decrease in revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily attributable to the execution of the long-term renewal of a license agreement with Samsung, revenue from the settlement of litigation and revenue from updated royalty audit recovery from an existing customer relating to prior periods, each of which occurred in the third quarter of 2023. 
 Recurring revenues decreased slightly to 82.7 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 83.6 million in the same period in 2023. 
 Non-recurring revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 3.4 million and 17.8 million, respectively. The decrease of 14.4 million was primarily attributable to the recognition of revenue from periods prior to the execution of the long-term renewal of a license agreement with Samsung, revenue from the settlement of litigation and revenue from updated royalty audit recovery from an existing customer relating to prior periods, each of which occurred in the third quarter of 2023. 
 The decrease in revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily attributable to the execution of two long-term license agreements with Kioxia and Western Digital in the first quarter of 2023, recognition of revenue from periods prior to the execution of the long-term renewal of a license agreement with Samsung in the third quarter of 2023, and a decline in royalty revenue from certain Pay-TV customers, partially offset by a multi-year agreement with X Corp. for access to our media portfolio that occurred in the second quarter of 2024. 
 Recurring revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 249.8 million and 255.1 million, respectively. The decrease of 5.2 million was primarily attributable to a decrease in royalty revenue from certain Pay-TV customers. 
 Non-recurring revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 7.0 million and 46.8 million, respectively. The decrease of 39.8 million was primarily attributable to the execution of long-term license agreements with Kioxia and Western Digital in the first quarter of 2023 and revenue from periods prior to the execution of the long-term renewal of a license agreement with Samsung in the third quarter of 2023, partially offset by a settlement agreement and multi-year renewal with X Corp. for access to our media portfolio that occurred in the second quarter of 2024. 
 Research and Development (in thousands, except for percentages): 
 Research and development expense R D expense consists primarily of personnel costs, stock-based compensation, outside engineering consulting expenses associated with new IP development, as well as costs related to patent applications and examinations, reverse engineering, materials, supplies and an allocation of facilities costs. All R D expense is expensed as incurred. We intend to make a continued investment in our R D efforts because we believe they are essential to grow our patent portfolios to maintain and improve our competitiveness.

The increase in R D expense during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily due to an increase in patent prosecution, patent portfolio development costs and an increase in personnel related costs as a result of increased headcount. 
 The increase in R D expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, was primarily due to an increase in personnel costs as a result of increased headcount and an increase in patent portfolio development costs, partially offset by a decrease in professional services costs.

The increase in litigation expense during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same periods in 2023, was primarily due to increased activity in current litigation matters.

We expect that litigation expense will continue to be a significant portion of our operating expenses, as it is used to enforce and protect our IP and contract rights. Litigation expense may fluctuate between periods because of planned or ongoing litigation, as described in Part II, Item 1 Legal Proceedings .

The decrease in interest expense during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same periods in 2023, was primarily due to lower debt balance and lower interest rates on our variable interest rate debt due to the repricing of our Term Loan B during the second quarter of 2024. 
 We anticipate interest expense will continue to decrease in 2024, when compared to 2023, as a result of a full year of a lower debt balance, the reduction of the interest rate margin benefited from the repricing of our Term Loan B during the second quarter of 2024, and the Federal Reserve interest rate cut during the third quarter of 2024.

The decrease in other income and expense, net during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same periods in 2023, was primarily due to a decrease in interest income from significant financing components from certain revenue contracts. 
 Loss on Debt Extinguishment 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized 0.5 million associated with the repricing of our Term Loan B and there were no such costs in 2023. Refer to discussion below for further detail on the repricing of our Term Loan B.

Our income tax provision for interim periods is based on the estimated annual effective tax rate adjusted for discrete items during the period. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded income tax benefit of 2.5 million on pretax income of 16.8 million, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded an income tax expense of 6.1 million on pretax income of 34.7 million, which resulted in effective tax rates of (14.9) and 17.6 , respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease in income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily due to certain unrealized foreign exchange benefits associated with South Korea withholding tax refund claims. The decrease in income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in the prior year was primarily due to certain unrealized foreign exchange benefits associated with South Korea withholding tax refund claims. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded an income tax expense of 1.7 million on pretax income of 25.9 million, and for nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded an income tax expense of 15.9 million on pretax income of 70.5 million, which resulted in effective tax rates of 6.6 and 22.5 , respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 The effective tax rate varies from the 21 U.S. federal tax rate primarily due to unrealized foreign exchange gain or loss on prior year South Korea withholding tax refund claims. 
 We periodically evaluate the realizability of our net deferred tax assets based on all available evidence, both positive and negative. After considering the evidence to assess the recoverability of our net deferred tax assets, we concluded that it was more-likely-than-not that we would realize our federal and certain state deferred tax assets.

Our primary sources of liquidity and capital resources are our operating cash flows and our short-term investments in marketable securities. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were 89.2 million at September 30, 2024, an increase of 5.6 million from 83.6 million at December 31, 2023. This increase primarily resulted from 105.0 million of cash generated from operations, and 1.5 million in proceeds from purchases through our employee stock purchase program and exercise of stock options, partially offset by 64.2 million in repayment of our long-term debt, 11.6 million in repurchases of common stock associated with tax withholdings on equity awards, 16.3 million in dividends paid, 1.3 million in purchases of property and equipment, and 8.5 million in purchases of intangible assets. 
 39 

The primary objectives of our investment activities are to preserve principal and to maintain liquidity, while at the same time capturing a market rate of return. To achieve these objectives, we maintain a diversified portfolio of securities including money market funds and debt securities such as corporate bonds and notes, municipal bonds and notes, commercial paper, treasury and agency notes and bills and certificates of deposit. Our marketable debt securities are classified as available-for-sale AFS with credit losses recognized as a credit loss expense and non-credit related unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss. 
 For information about our material cash requirements, see Liquidity and Capital Resources in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Other than the principal payments of 64.2 million made by us under the existing Term Loan B during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our cash requirements have not materially changed since December 31, 2023. 
 We expect to continue to make additional payments on our existing debt from cash generated from operations. In addition to the cash requirements outlined above, we have returned cash to stockholders through both quarterly dividend payments and repurchases of our common stock under our stock repurchase plan. 
 Quarterly Dividends 
 In September 2024, we paid quarterly cash dividends of 0.05 per share of common stock. In October 2024, our board of directors (the Board authorized payment of a quarterly cash dividend of 0.05 per share, to be paid in December 2024. 
 
 Stock Repurchase Plan 
 On June 12, 2020, our Board terminated a prior stock repurchase program and approved a new stock repurchase plan (the Plan ), which provides for the repurchase of up to 150.0 million of our common stock dependent on market conditions, share price and other factors. No expiration has been specified for this Plan. On April 22, 2021, our Board authorized an additional 100.0 million of purchases under the Plan. The stock repurchases may be made from time to time, through solicited or unsolicited transactions in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, or pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan. Since the inception of the Plan, and through September 30, 2024, we have repurchased an aggregate of approximately 10.0 million shares of common stock at a total cost of 172.2 million at an average price of 17.24. As of September 30, 2024, the total remaining amount available for repurchase under the Plan was 77.8 million. We may continue to execute authorized repurchases from time to time under the Plan. The amount and timing of any repurchases under the Plan depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the trading price, volume and availability of our common shares. There is no guarantee that such repurchases under the Plan will enhance the value of our common stock. 
 We believe that based on current levels of operations and anticipated growth, our cash from operations, together with cash and cash equivalents currently available, will be sufficient to satisfy our currently anticipated cash requirements through at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. Poor financial results, unanticipated expenses, unanticipated acquisitions of technologies or businesses, or unanticipated strategic investments could give rise to additional financing requirements sooner than we expect. There can be no assurance that equity or debt financing will be available when needed or, if available, that such financing will be on terms satisfactory to us. The sale of additional equity securities could result in dilution to our stockholders. The incurrence of indebtedness could result in increased debt service obligations and may include covenants that would restrict our operations. 
 Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
 Cash flows provided by operations were 105.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, were primarily due to our net income of 28.6 million being adjusted for non-cash items of amortization of intangible assets of 56.8 million, amortization of debt issuance costs of 2.4 million, stock-based compensation expense of 19.2 million, depreciation of property and equipment of 1.5 million and (0.7) million in changes in operating assets and liabilities including payment during the period of employee bonuses earned in 2023. 
 40 

Cash flows provided by operations were 113.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to our net income of 54.7 million being adjusted for non-cash items of amortization of intangible assets of 70.7 million, amortization of debt issuance costs of 3.3 million and stock-based compensation expense of 13.1 million. These increases were partially offset by 29.6 million in changes in operating assets and liabilities including payment during the period of employee bonuses earned in 2022. 
 Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 8.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily related to purchases of short-term investments of 25.1 million, purchases of property and equipment of 1.3 million, purchases of intangible assets of 8.5 million, and proceeds from maturities of investments of 26.5 million. 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 31.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily related to purchases of short-term investments of 33.6 million, capital expenditures of 1.9 million and proceeds from maturities of investments of 3.8 million. 
 Capital Expenditures 
 Our capital expenditures for property and equipment consist primarily of leasehold improvements, purchases of computer hardware and software, information systems, and semiconductor production and test equipment. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we spent 1.3 million and 1.9 million on capital expenditures, respectively, and we expect capital expenditures in the remainder of 2024 to be approximately 1.0 million. Our capital expenditures for intangible assets consists primarily of acquired patents. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we spent 8.5 million on purchases of intangible assets. These expenditures are expected to be financed with cash from operations, existing cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. There can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized, and plans are subject to change upon further review of our capital expenditure needs. 
 Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 90.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to 64.2 million in repayment of indebtedness, 16.3 million in dividends paid, 11.6 million in repurchases of common stock for tax withholdings on equity awards, partially offset by 1.5 million in proceeds from purchases through our employee stock purchase program and exercise of stock options. 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 144.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to 118.9 million in repayment of indebtedness, 16.0 million in dividends paid, 10.5 million in repurchases of common stock for tax withholdings on equity awards, partially offset by 1.1 million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock grant programs and employee stock purchase plans. 
 
 Long-term Debt 
 On June 8, 2021, we entered into Amendment No. 1 Amendment No. 1 to that certain Credit Agreement dated June 1, 2020 by and among us, the lenders party thereto and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent and collateral agent (the 2020 Credit Agreement ). The 2020 Credit Agreement initially provided for a five-year senior secured term loan B facility in an aggregate principal amount of 1,050 million (the 2020 Term Loan B Facility ). Amendment No. 1 provided for, among other things, (i) a new tranche of term loans (the 2021 Refinanced Term Loan B in an aggregate principal amount of 810.0 million, (ii) a reduction of the interest rate margin applicable to such loans to (x) in the case of base rate loans, 2.50 per annum and (y) in the case of Eurodollar loans, LIBOR plus a margin of 3.50 per annum, (iii) a prepayment premium of 1.00 in connection with any repricing transaction with respect to the 2021 Refinanced Term Loan B within six months of the closing date of Amendment No. 1, (iv) an extension of the maturity to June 8, 2028, and (v) certain additional amendments, including amendments to provide us with additional flexibility under the covenant governing restricted payments. 
 41 

On May 30, 2023, we entered into Amendment No. 3 Amendment No. 2 to the 2020 Credit Agreement to replace the reference to LIBOR as the base rate with the reference to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR as administered by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. 
 On May 20, 2024, we entered into Amendment No. 3 Amendment No. 3 to the 2020 Credit Agreement, which provided for, among other things, (i) a repricing of the 2020 Term Loan B Facility through a refinancing of the entire amount of the 2021 Refinanced Term Loan B with a new tranche of term loans (the 2024 Term Loan B in an aggregate principal amount of 561.1 million, (ii) a reduction of the interest rate margin applicable to such loans to (x) in the case of SOFR loans, SOFR plus a margin of 3.00 per annum and (y) in the case of base rate loans, 2.00 per annum, (iii) a reduction in the excess cash flow mandatory payment thresholds and (iv) a prepayment premium of 1.00 in connection with any repricing transaction with respect to the 2024 Term Loan B within six months of the closing date of Amendment No. 3. The 2024 Term Loan B will mature on June 8, 2028, the same date upon which the 2021 Refinanced Term Loan B matured prior to giving effect to Amendment No. 3. 
 At September 30, 2024, 537.1 million was outstanding under the term loan B facility with an interest rate, including unamortized debt discount and issuance costs of 12.7 million. Interest is payable monthly. Under the existing loan agreement, we have future minimum principal payments for our debt of 7.0 million in the remainder of 2024, 28.1 million each year from 2025 through 2027, with the remaining principal balance of 445.9 million due in 2028. After the Separation, we own the debt under the term loan B facility. Additionally, we paid 29.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, based on certain leverage ratios and our excess cash flow generated for the year ended December 31, 2023. We are obligated to continue to pay a portion of excess cash flows on an annual basis. The term loan B facility contains customary covenants, and as of September 30, 2024, we were in full compliance with such covenants. The 2020 Credit Agreement, as amended, also requires that we continue to make cash payments on an annual basis based on certain leverage ratios and excess cash flow generated for the immediately preceding fiscal year. The cash payments are applied to the remaining principal balance due at final maturity. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

PART II - OTH ER INFORMATION 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 In the normal course of our business, we are involved in legal proceedings. In the past, we have litigated to enforce our patents and other intellectual property rights IP ), to enforce the terms of license agreements, to protect trade secrets and to defend our patents against claims of invalidity. We expect to continue to be involved in similar legal proceedings in the future, including proceedings regarding infringement of our patents and proceedings to ensure proper and full payment of royalties by licensees under the terms of our license agreements. 
 We cannot predict the outcome of any of the proceedings described below, other than to the extent such proceedings have concluded. An adverse decision in any of these proceedings could significantly harm our business and our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. 
 Patent Infringement Litigation 
 In the ordinary course of our business, we engage in litigation to protect our IP from infringement. While litigation is never our preference, and we prefer to reach mutually agreeable commercial licensing arrangements with third parties, it is sometimes a necessary step to effectively protect our investment in our IP. As a result of these lawsuits, defendants have often filed Inter Partes Review IPR petitions with the U.S. Patent Office s Patent Trial and Appeal Board (and other similar post-grant proceedings outside of the U.S.) seeking to invalidate one or more of our patents. We are currently engaged in multiple lawsuits with several third parties. 
 Videotron Patent Infringement Litigation 
 On June 23, 2017, Adeia Guides Inc. (formerly known as Rovi Guides, Inc.) and Adeia Media Solutions Inc. (formerly known as TiVo Solutions Inc.) (together, Adeia Media filed a patent infringement complaint against Videotron Ltd. and Videotron G.P. (together, Videotron in Toronto, Canada, alleging infringement of six patents Videotron 1 ). On June 10, 2022, the Federal Court of Canada issued its decision in the case finding in favor of Videotron and its legacy illico platform. Specifically, the Court found invalid each of the asserted claims related to the four remaining patents involved in the case. In Canada, the prevailing party in patent litigation is entitled to reimbursement of certain of its costs and expenses. Accordingly, we paid 2.5 million for expense reimbursement in the fourth quarter of 2022. On September 12, 2022, Adeia Media filed a notice of appeal with the Federal Court of Appeal of Canada appealing the decision of the Federal Court of Canada. On January 30, 2023, Adeia Media filed its opening memorandum of fact and law. Videotron filed its memorandum of fact and law on April 17, 2023. On November 28, 2023, the Federal Court of Appeal of Canada held a hearing on the appeal and took the matter under reserve. On August 6, 2024, the Federal Court of Appeal of Canada issued a judgment in the appeal in which it dismissed the appeal. 
 On May 21, 2021, Adeia Media filed a patent infringement complaint against Videotron in Toronto, Canada, alleging infringement of four patents Videotron 2 ). On July 21, 2021, the Federal Court of Canada held a case management conference in Videotron 2, shortly before which Videotron filed a motion to strike various portions of the statement of claim. On March 22, 2022, the Court issued an order on Videotron s motion to strike, dismissing the motion in its entirety. On April 1, 2022, Videotron filed an appeal of the Court s order dismissing Videotron s motion to strike. On June 30, 2022, the Court of Appeal issued its decision in Videotron s appeal in which it ruled in Adeia Media s favor and dismissed Videotron s appeal. The trial is scheduled to start on January 20, 2025.
