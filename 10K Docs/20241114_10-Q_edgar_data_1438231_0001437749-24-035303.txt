The fair value maturities of the Company s cash equivalents and marketable securities as of September 30, 2024 , were as follows: 

The Company considers all highly liquid marketable securities with original maturities of 90 days or less at the date of acquisition to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents include commercial paper, federal agency notes, U.S. treasuries, and money market securities t otaling and at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively. Cash equivalents are carried at either cost or fair value, depending on the type of security. 

Customer arrangements may contain multiple performance obligations such as software subscriptions, software products, and professional services. The Company accounts for individual products and services separately if they are distinct. To determine the transaction price, the Company considers the terms of the contract and the Company s customary business practices. Some contracts may contain variable consideration. In those cases, the Company estimates the amount of variable consideration based on the sum of probability-weighted amounts in a range of possible consideration amounts. As part of this assessment, the Company will evaluate whether any of the variable consideration is constrained and if it is the Company will not include it in the transaction price. The consideration is allocated between distinct products and services based on their stand-alone selling prices. For items that are not sold separately, the Company estimates the standalone selling price based on reasonably available information, including market conditions, specific factors affecting the Company, and information about the customer. For distinct products and services, the Company typically recognizes the revenue associated with these performance obligations as they are delivered to the customer. Products and services that are not capable of being distinct are combined with other products or services until a distinct performance obligation is identified. 
 
 All revenue recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations is considered to be revenue from contracts with customers.

 Performance Restricted Stock Units 
 
 The fair value of performance restricted stock unit PRSU awards that vest upon meeting a service condition and a performance condition, such as the Company exceeding a future annual recurring revenue target, is determined based on the fair market value of the Company's common stock on the date of the grant, adjusted for probability of achievement of the performance criteria as of each reporting date (measurement date), and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the service period of the award, which is generally three years for employee grants. The probability of achievement is subject to judgment, and could change from period to period, impacting the amount of expense to be recognized. 
 
 The fair value of performance restricted stock units awards that vest upon meeting a service condition and a market condition, such as the Company exceeding shareholder returns as compared to an index of peer companies, is determined on the date of grant (measurement date) using the Monte Carlo valuation model. The Company recognizes the fair value of the award on a straight-line basis over the service period of the award, which is generally three years for employee grants. 
 
 The following inputs are used in the Monte Carlo valuation model to estimate the fair value: 
 
 Stock Price. The stock price represents the fair market value of the Company s common stock on the date of the grant. 
 
 Expected Volatility. The Company estimates the volatility of its common stock at the date of grant based on the historical volatility of its common stock based on historical prices over the most recent period commensurate with the term of the award. 
 
 Risk-Free Interest Rate. The Company determines the risk-free interest rate using current U.S. treasury yields for bonds with a maturity commensurate with the term of the award.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts 
 
 The Company s accounts receivables are subject to concentrations of credit risk. The Company maintains an allowance for its doubtful accounts receivable to reflect any estimated credit losses. The allowance is established in accordance with the current expected credit loss model, which requires the estimation of expected credit losses over the contractual life of financial assets. The allowance is calculated using a forward-looking probability-weighted approach based on historical loss experience, current economic conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The Company records the allowance in general and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, up to the amount of revenue recognized to date for each account. Any incremental allowance is recorded as an offset to deferred revenue in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Account receivables are written off and charged against the recorded allowance when the Company has exhausted collection efforts without success. 
 
 Unpaid Deferred Revenue 
 
 The unpaid deferred revenue that is included in trade accounts receivable is billed in accordance with the provisions of the contracts with the Company s customers.

 The Digimarc Illuminate platform is a distinctive SaaS cloud-based platform for digital connectivity that provides the tools for the application of advanced digital watermarks and dynamic QR codes, software (digital twins) that enables various systems and devices to interact with those data carriers, and a centralized platform for capturing insights about digital interactions and automating activities based on that information. 
 
 The Digimarc product suite is built on top of the Digimarc Illuminate platform to power a trusted and scalable ecosystem that can address specific business needs in areas like automation, authenticity, sustainability, and customer trust and connectivity. All of the Company s products are complementary to each other, providing exponential benefits when combined. By enabling customers to create and connect digital twins to physical and digital items, Digimarc s products provide many benefits including: 

Digimarc Automate improves product inspection by embedding imperceptible digital watermarks into products, labels, and packaging, which are detectable by standard vision systems. This significantly reduces mixing errors and mislabeling, ensuring higher accuracy and efficiency in production, fulfillment, and distribution facilities without additional costs for special inks or hardware. By enabling real-time data analysis and minimizing human error, Digimarc Automate enhances quality assurance, reduces waste, and lowers the risk of product recalls, giving brands a competitive edge. 

Digimarc Engage activates products and multimedia to create and leverage an interactive, fully owned communications channel directly with consumers. Digimarc delivers dynamic QR codes and hyperlinks that provide contextual redirection capabilities for multiple consumer experiences based on a variety of factors such as time and location or previous behavior. Connecting engagements across the physical and digital worlds in a singular view results in powerful new capabilities and insights for brands. 

Digimarc Recycle increases the quality and quantity of recycled materials by digitizing products and packaging with digital watermarking technology. Coupled with consumer engagement capabilities, brands can leverage a direct, digital communications channel. Plus, a cloud-based record of never-before-seen post-consumption data provides new insights that benefit stakeholders across the value chain, including brands, facility operators, and Producer Responsibility Organizations PROs ). 

Digimarc Retail Experience delivers smarter, connected packaging that supports next-generation retail checkout systems, including checkout efficiency (faster scanning) and checkout effectiveness (reduced shrinkage), optimized operational processes, advanced consumer engagement experiences, compliance with upcoming industry standards, and the collection of powerful first-party data and consumer insights. 

Digimarc Validate supports authentication in the physical and digital worlds to help ensure online interactions can be trusted and that real products and digital assets are genuine and in the right place. Digimarc s technology protects digital images, audio, product packaging, gift cards, and other physical items by delivering exclusive, covert digital watermarks and/or dynamic QR codes and a cloud-based record of product authentication information. In addition, consumer engagement capabilities provide a direct, digital communications channel.

Subscription 
 
 Subscription revenue consists primarily of revenue earned from subscription fees for access to our SaaS platform and products and, to a lesser extent, licensing fees for our software products. The majority of subscription contracts are recurring, paid in advance and recognized over the term of the subscription, which is typically one to three years. 
 
 The 0.4 million increase in subscription revenue for the three month period ended September 30, 2024 , compared to the corresponding three month period ended September 30, 2023 , primarily reflects higher subscription revenue from new and existing commercial contracts, partially offset by the delayed timing in the anticipated renewal of a commercial contract . 
 
 The 4.0 million increase in subscription revenue for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024 , compared to the corresponding nine month period ended September 30, 2023 , primarily reflects higher subscription revenue from new and existing commercial contracts, partially offset by the delayed timing in the anticipated renewal of a commercial contract . 
 
 Service 
 
 Service revenue consists primarily of revenue earned from the performance of software development services and, to a lesser extent, professional services. The majority of software development contracts are structured as time and materials agreements. Revenue for services is generally recognized as the services are performed. Billing for services rendered generally occurs within one month after the services are provided. Service contracts can range from days to several years in length. Our contract with the Central Banks, which accounts for the majority of our service revenue, has a contract term through December 31, 2029. The contract is subject to work plans that are reviewed and agreed upon quarterly. The contract provides for predetermined billing rates, which are adjusted annually to account for cost of living variables, and provides for the reimbursement of third party costs incurred to support the work plans. 
 
 Service revenue for the three month period ended September 30, 2024 remained flat, compared to the corresponding three month period ended September 30, 2023 , primarily reflecting 0.4 million of higher service revenue from HolyGrail recycling projects, partially offset by 0.2 million of lower government service revenue due to timing of program work with the Central Banks . 
 
 The 0.2 million increase in service revenue for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024 , compared to the corresponding nine month period ended September 30, 2023 , primarily reflects higher government service revenue due to timing of program work with the Central Banks.

ARR decreased 0.9 million, or 5 from September 30, 2023 to September 30, 2024 , reflecting a 5.8 million decrease due to the delayed timing in the anticipated renewal of a commercial contract, partially offset by new annual recurring revenue from entry into new commercial subscription contracts and increased subscription fees on existing commercial contracts. 
 
 We provide an ARR performance metric to help investors better understand and assess the performance of our business because our mix of revenue generated from recurring sources has increased in recent years. ARR is calculated as the aggregation of annualized subscription fees from all of our commercial contracts as of the measurement date. ARR does not have any standardized meaning and is therefore unlikely to be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue and deferred revenue and is not intended to be combined with, or to replace, either of those items. ARR is not a forecast and the active contracts at the end of a reporting period used in calculating ARR may or may not be extended or renewed by our customers.

The changes in stock-based compensation expense for the three month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to the corresponding three month period ended September 30, 2023 were insignificant . 
 
 The decrease in stock-based compensation expense for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to the corresponding nine month period ended September 30, 2023 , primarily reflects 0.6 million of stock-based severance costs incurred in 2023 and the reversal of stock compensation expense of 0.4 million on unvested stock awards that were forfeited , partially offset by a higher value of employee equity awards . 
 
 We anticipate incurring an additional 16.0 million in stock-based compensation expense through September 30, 2028, for stock awards outstanding as of September 30, 2024.

The increase in other income, net for the three month period ended September 30, 2024 , compared to the corresponding three month period ended September 30, 2023 , primarily reflects higher interest income. 
 
 The changes in other income, net for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024 , compared to the corresponding nine month period ended September 30, 2023, primarily reflects lower refundable tax credits, partially offset by higher interest income. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 
 The provision for income taxes reflects current taxes and deferred taxes. The effective tax rate for each of the nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 0 . Our effective tax rate is significantly lower than our statutory tax rate because we have a valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets. 
 
 The valuation allowance against deferred tax assets as of September 30, 2024, was 104.1 million, an increase of 8.9 million from 95.3 million as of December 31, 2023. 
 
 We continually assess the applicability of a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. Based upon the positive and negative evidence available as of September 30, 2024, and largely due to the cumulative loss incurred by us over the last several years, which is considered a significant piece of negative evidence when assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, a valuation allowance is recorded against our deferred tax assets. We will not record tax benefits on any future losses until it is determined that those tax benefits will be realized. Future reversals of the valuation allowance would result in a tax benefit in the period recognized. 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 The following discussion and analysis includes both financial measures in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP as well as non-GAAP financial measures. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company s performance, financial position or cash flows that exclude amounts that are not normally excluded in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed as supplemental to, and should not be considered as alternatives to, GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures may not be indicative of the historical operating results of the Company nor are they intended to be predictive of potential future results. Investors should not consider non-GAAP financial measures in isolation or as substitutes for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Our management uses and relies on Non-GAAP gross profit, Non-GAAP gross profit margin, Non-GAAP operating expenses, Non-GAAP net loss, and Non-GAAP loss per share (diluted), which are all non-GAAP financial measures. We believe that both management and shareholders benefit from referring to the following non-GAAP financial measures in planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. 

26

Table of Contents 

Our management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating its financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Our management recognizes that the non-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations because of the described excluded items. 
 
 We define Non-GAAP gross profit, Non-GAAP gross profit margin, Non-GAAP operating expenses, Non-GAAP net loss, and Non-GAAP loss per share (diluted) excluding the adjustments in the table below. These non-GAAP financial measures are an important measure of our operating performance because they allow management, investors and analysts to evaluate and assess our core operating results from period-to-period after removing non-cash and non-recurring activities that can affect comparability. 
 
 We have included a reconciliation of our financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP to the most comparable non-GAAP financial measures. We believe that providing the non-GAAP financial measures, together with the reconciliation to GAAP, helps investors make comparisons between us and other companies. In making any comparisons to other companies, investors need to be aware that companies use different non-GAAP measures to evaluate their financial performance. Investors should pay close attention to the specific definitions being used and to the reconciliation between such measures and the corresponding GAAP measures provided by each company under applicable SEC rules. 
 
 The following table presents a reconciliation of Non-GAAP gross profit, Non-GAAP gross profit margin, Non-GAAP operating expenses, Non-GAAP net loss, and Non-GAAP loss per share (diluted) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

Non-GAAP gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2024, increased by 0.5 million compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase primarily reflects higher subscription revenue. 
 
 Non-GAAP gross profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , increased by 4.4 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . The increase primarily reflects higher subscription revenue. 
 
 Non-GAAP gross profit margin for the three months ended September 30, 2024, increased to 78 compared to 76 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase primarily reflects higher subscription revenue . 
 
 Non-GAAP gross profit margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased to 79 compared to 74 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase primarily reflects higher subscription revenue combined with a favorable mix of subscription revenue . 
 
 Non-GAAP operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024, increased by 0.9 million compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase primarily reflects 0.6 million of cash severance costs and 0.2 million of lower cash labor costs allocated to cost of revenue due to the amount and mix of billable labor hours incurred . 
 
 Non-GAAP operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased by 0.3 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase primarily reflects 0.3 million of higher professional service and consulting costs and 0.1 million of higher other costs, partially offset by lower cash compensation costs of 0.3 million. The decrease in cash compensation costs primarily reflects 1.5 million of cash severance costs in 2023, partially offset by 0.6 million of cash severance costs in 2024, and 0.5 million of lower cash labor costs allocated to cost of revenue due to the amount and mix of billable labor hours incurred.

 The current ratio is calculated by dividing total current assets by total current liabilities. 

T he 6.5 million increase in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at September 30, 2024, from December 31, 2023, resulted primarily from: 

net proceeds from the issuance of common stock; partially offset by 

cash used in operations; 

purchases of common stock related to tax withholding in connection with the vesting of restricted stock, restricted stock units, and performance restricted stock units; and 

purchases of property and equipment and capitalized patent costs. 

Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, and trade accounts receivable. We place our cash and cash equivalents with major banks and financial institutions and at times deposits may exceed insured limits. Marketable securities include commercial paper, federal agency notes, money market securities, and U.S. treasuries. Our investment policy requires our portfolio to be invested to ensure that the greater of 3.0 million or 7 of the invested funds will be available within 30 days notice. 
 
 Other than cash used for operating needs, which may include short-term marketable securities, our investment policy limits our credit exposure to any one financial institution or type of financial instrument by limiting the maximum of 5 of our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities or 1.0 million, whichever is greater, to be invested in any one issuer except for the U.S. government, U.S. federal agencies and U.S.-backed securities, which have no limits, at the time of purchase. Our investment policy also limits our credit exposure by limiting to a maximum of 40 of our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, or 15.0 million, whichever is greater, to be invested in any one industry category (e.g., financial, energy, etc.) at the time of purchase. As a result, we believe our credit risk associated with cash and investments to be minimal. 
 
 A decline in the market value of any security that is deemed to be other-than-temporary is charged to earnings. To determine whether an impairment is other-than-temporary, we consider whether we have the ability and intent to hold the investment until a market price recovery and evidence indicating that the cost of the investment is recoverable outweighs evidence to the contrary. There have been no other-than-temporary impairments identified or recorded by us for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

Cash flows used in operating activities for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024, increased by 5.7 million, compared to the corresponding nine month period ended September 30, 2023 , primarily as a result of 9.9 million from unfavorable timing of changes in operating assets and liabilities, and 0.8 million of lower non-cash items included in net loss, partially offset by 5.0 million lower net loss. The unfavorable timing of changes in operating assets and liabilities are largely due to the timing of customer billings and receipts, and the amount and timing of collecting the refundable tax credits. The change in non-cash items primarily reflects lower depreciation and write-off of property and equipment, lower impairment of lease right of use assets and leasehold improvements, and lower stock-based compensation. 
 
 Cash flows from investing activities 
 
 Cash flows from investing activities for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to the corresponding nine month period ended September 30, 2023, decreased by 20.4 million. The decrease primarily reflects higher purchases of marketable securities, and lower net proceeds from maturities of marketable securities . 
 
 Cash flows from financing activities 
 
 Cash flows from financing activities for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024, compared to the corresponding nine month period ended September 30, 2023, increased by 31.4 million. The increase primarily reflects the 32.2 million of net cash proceeds raised from our registered direct stock offering in February 2024, partially offset by higher purchases of common stock.

Table of Contents 

Future Cash Expectations 
 
 We believe that our current cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances will satisfy our projected working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months. 
 
 Registered Direct Offering 
 
 On February 24, 2024, we entered into purchase agreements with certain investors providing for the issuance and sale by us of 929 thousand shares of our common stock in a registered direct stock offering. The common shares were offered at a price of 35.00 per share, and the gross cash proceeds to us were 32.5 million. We incurred 0.3 million of legal costs related to the offering. The closing of the registered direct offering occurred on February 27, 2024. 
 
 Shelf Registration 
 
 On June 23, 2023, we filed a new shelf registration statement on Form S-3 that included 34.6 million of unsold securities from our prior shelf registration statement filed on June 5, 2020. The new shelf registration statement became effective on July 19, 2023, and expires on July 19, 2026. Under the new shelf registration statement, we may sell securities in one or more offerings up to 100.0 million. As of September 30, 2024 , 67.5 million remained available under the new shelf registration statement. 
 
 We may sell shares under the shelf registration and/or use similar or other financing means to raise working capital in the future, if necessary, to support continued investment in our growth initiatives. We may also raise capital in the future to fund acquisitions and/or investments in complementary businesses, technologies or product lines. If it becomes necessary to obtain additional financing, we may not be able to do so, or if these funds are available, they may not be available on satisfactory terms.

 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), and Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933.

We do not undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect future events, information or circumstances that arise after the date of the filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 Not applicable. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 We conducted an evaluation (pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) of the Exchange Act), under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. These disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Our disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that this information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 Based on the evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, were effective. 
 
 Changes in Controls 
 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the three month period ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 
 We are subject from time to time to legal proceedings and claims arising in the ordinary course of business. At this time, we do not believe that the resolution of any such matters will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 Our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be affected by a number of factors. Detailed information about risk factors that may affect Digimarc s actual results are set forth in Part I, Item 1A: Risk Factors of our 2023 Annual Report. The risks and uncertainties described in our 2023 Annual Report are those risks of which we are aware and that we consider to be material to our business. If any of those risks and uncertainties develop into actual events, our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline. As of September 30, 2024, there have been no material changes to the risk factors previously disclosed in our 2023 Annual Report.
