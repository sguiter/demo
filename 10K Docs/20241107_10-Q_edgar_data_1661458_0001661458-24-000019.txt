 , matures on November 1, 2033 and requires interest-only payments through December 1, 2028 and principal and interest payments thereafter. The interest rate is variable and was and on September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. In conjunction with the loan closing, the Company purchased an interest rate cap contract to cap the interest at through its November 1, 2026 expiration at which point the Company is required by the terms of the loan agreement to purchase a new cap contract. 
 The Company s mortgage and the related swap agreement on The Locale had an initial maturity date of September 1, 2023. Prior to the initial maturity date, the Company exercised the one-year extension option provided for in the loan documents and entered into a new swap agreement to fix the interest rate at and extend the maturity date to September 1, 2024. On November 8, 2023, the Company placed permanent financing on The Locale and simultaneously repaid the outstanding balance on the extended loan and terminated the swap agreement. The new loan matures on December 1, 2030, has a principal balance of , bears interest at a fixed rate of and requires interest-only payments for the duration of its term. 
 On September 20, 2023, the Company assumed mortgage loans in the total principal amount of , net of a debt discount of . The carrying value of the assumed debt was marked to market as of the acquisition date. According to the terms of the loan agreements, the contractual fixed interest rates are and , require payments of principal and interest and the maturity date of both loans is January 1, 2036. The debt discount will be amortized to interest expense over the life of the loans. 
 The Company obtained a loan on April 6, 2023, which was secured by a mortgage encumbering one of the buildings comprising the Trimble office investment property. The building is approximately square feet and is currently occupied by Veeco Instruments, Inc. The loan secured by a mortgage on this Trimble building has a principal amount of , of which is guaranteed by the Company. The loan matures on April 6, 2025, with a extension option, which requires, among other criteria, that at the time of extension, the mortgage is not in default, a minimum debt service coverage ratio is met and the extension fee is paid. Simultaneously with the loan closing, we entered into a swap arrangement to fix the interest rate at for the term of the loan. The Company expects to exercise its extension option or place permanent financing on Trimble at maturity. 
 The Company obtained a loan on January 24, 2023, which was secured by a mortgage encumbering Tennyson, one of the Company s multi-family investment properties. The loan has a principal balance of . The loan matures on February 1, 2030, bears interest at a rate of and requires interest-only payments for the duration of its term. 
 The Company s ability to pay off the mortgages when they become due is dependent upon the Company s ability either to refinance the related mortgage debt or to sell the related investment property. With respect to each mortgage loan, if the applicable wholly-owned property-owning subsidiary is unable to refinance or sell the related investment property, or in the event that the estimated value is less than the mortgage balance, the applicable wholly-owned property-owning subsidiary may, if appropriate, satisfy a mortgage obligation by transferring title of the investment property to the lender or permitting a lender to foreclose. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company guaranteed mortgage loan up to . However, Highlands or its subsidiaries may act as guarantor under customary, non-recourse, carve-out guarantees in connection with obtaining mortgage loans on certain of our investment properties. 
 Some of the mortgage loans require compliance with certain covenants, such as debt service coverage ratios and minimum net worth requirements. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company was in compliance with such covenants.

 derivative financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges. The interest rate swap on Trimble (also outstanding at September 30, 2023) had an original notional amount of and a maturity date of April 6, 2026. The interest rate cap on The Muse had an original notional amount of and a maturity date of November 1, 2026. As of September 30, 2023, we had additional derivative financial instrument designated as a cash flow hedge, with a notional amount of and a maturity date of September 1, 2024. These derivatives are measured at fair value on a recurring basis. 
 For derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk, the gain or loss on the derivative is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss on the consolidated balance sheets and is subsequently reclassified into interest expense in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. The amounts recorded as other comprehensive loss related to our derivative financial instruments was and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively and a loss of and income of for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 Amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on our variable rate debt. The Company estimates that will be reclassified as a decrease to interest expense over the next twelve months.

 Classified as Other liabilities December 31, 2023 Derivative financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges: Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Classified as Deferred costs and other assets, net 
 The fair value of our derivative financial instruments was determined using widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of the derivative financial instrument. This analysis reflected the contractual terms of the derivative, including the period to maturity, and used observable market-based inputs, including interest rate market data and implied volatilities in such interest rates. While it was determined that the majority of the inputs used to value the derivative fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy under authoritative accounting guidance, the credit valuation adjustments associated with the derivative also utilized Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default. However, as of September 30, 2024, the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of the derivative financial instrument was assessed, and it was determined that these adjustments were not significant to the overall valuation of the derivative financial instrument. As a result, it was determined that the derivative financial instrument in its entirety should be classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 
 Non-Recurring Measurements 
 In accordance with ASC 360-10, the Company records impairment losses on long-lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that long-lived assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those assets. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, events and circumstances indicated that certain investment properties might be impaired. However, the Company s estimate of undiscounted cash flows indicated that such carrying values were expected to be recovered. Nonetheless, it is reasonably possible that the estimate of undiscounted cash flows may change in the future resulting in the need to write down assets to fair value. 
 Financial Liabilities Disclosed at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis 
 
 The Company estimates the fair value of its debt instruments using a weighted average market effective interest rate of and per annum as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Company estimates the fair value of its mortgage loans by discounting the anticipated future cash flows of each instrument at rates currently offered to the Company by its lenders for similar debt instruments of comparable maturities. The rates used are based on credit spreads observed in the marketplace during the quarter for similar debt instruments, and a floor rate that the Company has derived using its subjective judgment for each asset segment. Based on this, the Company determines the appropriate rate for each of its individual mortgage loans based upon the specific terms of the agreement, including the term to maturity, the quality and nature of the underlying property and its leverage ratio. The weighted average market effective interest rates used range from to and to as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The assumptions reflect the terms currently available on similar borrowing terms to borrowers with credit profiles similar to the Company s. The Company has determined that its debt instrument valuations are classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

The following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements based upon our current expectations, estimates and assumptions that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors, including but not limited to, factors discussed in Part I - Item 1A. Risk Factors and Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Certain statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, other than purely historical information, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). These statements include statements about Highlands plans, objectives, strategies, financial performance and outlook, trends, the amount and timing of future cash distributions, prospects or future events and involve known and unknown risks that are difficult to predict.

Such forward-looking statements are necessarily based upon estimates and assumptions that, while considered reasonable by Highlands and its management based on their knowledge and understanding of the business and industry, are inherently uncertain. These statements are not guarantees of future performance, and stockholders should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. There are a number of risks, uncertainties and other important factors, many of which are beyond our control, that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Such risks, uncertainties and other important factors include, among others: the risks, uncertainties and factors set forth in our filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K; business, financial and operating risks inherent to real estate investments and the industry; our ability to renew leases, lease vacant space, or re-lease space as leases expire; our ability to repay or refinance our debt as it comes due; difficulty selling or re-leasing our investment properties due to their specific characteristics as described elsewhere in this report; contraction in the global economy or low levels of economic growth; our ability to sell our investment properties at a price and on a timeline consistent with our investment objectives, or at all; our ability to service our debt; changes in interest rates and operating costs; compliance with regulatory regimes and local laws; uninsured or underinsured losses, including those relating to natural disasters or terrorism; domestic or international instability or political or civil unrest, including the ongoing hostilities in Ukraine and Israel and their worldwide economic impact; the amount of debt that we currently have or may incur in the future; provisions in our debt agreements that may restrict the operation of our business; our separation from InvenTrust and our ability to operate as a stand-alone public reporting company; our organizational and governance structure; our status as a REIT; the cost of compliance with and liabilities under environmental, health and safety laws; the uncertainty and economic impact of pandemics, epidemics or other public health emergencies or fear of such events; adverse litigation judgments or settlements; changes in real estate and zoning laws and increase in real property tax rates; changes in federal, state or local tax law, including legislative, administrative, regulatory or other actions affecting REITs; changes in governmental regulations or interpretations thereof; and estimates relating to our ability to make distributions to our stockholders in the future. 
 These factors are not necessarily all of the important factors that could cause our actual financial results, performance, achievements or prospects to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by any of our forward-looking statements. Other unknown or unpredictable factors also could harm our results. All forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements set forth above. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we do not undertake or assume any obligation to update publicly any of these forward-looking statements to reflect actual results, new information or future events, changes in assumptions or changes in other factors affecting forward-looking statements, except to the extent required by applicable laws.

Overview 
 We are a self-advised and self-administered real estate investment trust REIT created to own and manage substantially all of the non-core investment properties previously owned and managed by our former parent, InvenTrust Properties Corp., a Maryland corporation InvenTrust ). On April 28, 2016, we were spun-off from InvenTrust through a pro rata distribution (the Distribution by InvenTrust of 100 of the outstanding shares of our common stock to holders of InvenTrust s common stock. Prior to or concurrent with the separation, we and InvenTrust engaged in certain reorganization transactions that were designed to consolidate substantially all of InvenTrust s remaining non-core investment properties in Highlands. 
 This inherited portfolio of non-core investment properties, which were acquired by InvenTrust between 2005 and 2008, included investment properties that are special use, single tenant or build to suit; face unresolved legal issues; are in undesirable locations or in weak markets or submarkets; are aging or functionally obsolete; and/or have sub-optimal leasing metrics. Certain of our investment properties are retail properties located in tertiary markets, which are particularly susceptible to the negative trends affecting retail real estate. As a result of these characteristics, such investment properties are difficult to lease, finance and refinance and are relatively illiquid compared to other types of real estate properties. These factors also significantly limit our investment property disposition options, impact the timing of such dispositions and restrict the viable options available to the Company for future potential liquidity options. 
 Our strategy is focused on preserving, protecting and maximizing the total value of our portfolio with the long-term objective of providing stockholders with a return of their investment. We engage in rigorous asset management, seek to sustain and enhance our portfolio, and improve the quality and income-producing ability of our portfolio by engaging in selective dispositions, acquisitions, capital expenditures, financing, refinancing and enhanced leasing. We are also focused on cost containment efforts across our portfolio, improving our overall capital structure and making select investments in our existing non-core investment properties to maximize their value. To the extent we are able to generate cash flows from operations or dispositions of investment properties, in addition to the cash uses outlined above, our board of directors has determined that it is in the best interest of the Company to seek to reinvest in investment properties that are more likely to generate more reliable and stable cash flows, such as multi-family investment properties, as part of the Company s overall strategy to optimize the value of the portfolio, enhance our options for future potential liquidity options and maximize shareholder value. Given the nature and quality of the non-core investment properties in our portfolio as well as current market conditions, a definitive timeline for execution of our strategy cannot be made. 
 With this strategy in mind, in the fourth quarter of 2023, we launched a modified Dutch Auction self-tender offer in an effort to provide a liquidity option for certain of our stockholders who elected to tender their stock while at the same time balancing the best interests of the Company and of those stockholders who wished to remain invested in the Company. We believe that the tender offer provided an efficient mechanism to provide our stockholders who desired immediate liquidity with the opportunity to tender shares, while also providing a benefit to those stockholders who did not participate, as such stockholders automatically increased their relative percentage ownership interest in the Company and our future operations, including any liquidity events that we may have in the future. The tender offer closed in the fourth quarter of 2023 with the repurchase of 169.4 million shares of common stock at a price per share of 0.14. Total cash required to complete the tender offer was 25.2 million, including all costs and fees of the tender offer. Subsequent to the close of the tender offer, the Company discovered an administrative error in which certain tender requests were not processed. We honored all such tender requests in April 2024, and accordingly another 33 shares were repurchased. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred 0.2 million of additional costs related to this previously executed tender offer. We will evaluate the results of this tender offer when considering the manner and timing of potential future liquidity options. Our ability to execute on future liquidity events will be influenced by external and macroeconomic factors, including, among others, interest rate movements, inflation, local, regional, national and global economic performance and real estate markets, government policy changes and competitive factors and we may be unable to execute such a transaction on terms we find attractive for our stockholders. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our portfolio of investment properties included thirteen multi-family, three retail and one office property, one correctional facility and one parcel of unimproved land. We currently have two business segments, consisting of multi-family and other assets. We may have additional or fewer segments in the future to the extent we enter into additional real property sectors, dispose of investment properties, or change the character of our assets. For the complete presentation of our reportable segments, see Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

through voting rights or similar rights or (ii) by means other than voting rights if Highlands is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity VIE ). The portions of the equity and net income of consolidated subsidiaries that are not attributable to the Company are presented separately as amounts attributable to non-controlling interests in our consolidated financial statements. Entities which Highlands does not control and entities which are VIEs in which Highlands is not a primary beneficiary, if any, are accounted for under appropriate GAAP. Highlands subsidiaries generally consist of limited liability companies LLCs ). The effects of all significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated. 
 
 Critical accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 contained in the Company s latest Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any new accounting policies or updates to existing accounting policies as a result of new accounting pronouncements have been discussed in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The application of critical accounting policies may require management to make assumptions, judgments and estimates about the amounts reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Management uses historical experience and all available information to make these estimates and judgments, and different amounts could be reported using different assumptions and estimates. 
 
 Revenues and Expenses 
 Revenues 
 Our revenues are primarily derived from rental income and expense recoveries we receive from our tenants under leases with us, including monthly rent and other property income pursuant to tenant leases. Tenant recovery income primarily consists of reimbursements for real estate taxes, common area maintenance costs, management fees and insurance costs. 
 Expenses 
 Our expenses consist of property operating expenses, real estate taxes, depreciation and amortization expense, general and administrative expenses, interest expense and provision for asset impairment. Property operating expenses primarily consist of repair and maintenance, management fees, utilities and insurance (some of which are recoverable from the tenant).

 Cash flow from operations as determined in accordance with GAAP; 
 Economic and physical occupancy and rental rates; 
 Leasing activity and lease rollover; 
 Management of operating expenses; 
 Management of general and administrative expenses;

 Results of Operations 
 Comparison of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Key performance indicators are as follows: As of September 30, 2024 2023 Economic occupancy (1) 
 72.1 79.9 Rent per square foot (2) 
 25.99 16.92 
 (1) Economic occupancy is defined as the percentage of total gross leasable area for which a tenant is obligated to pay rent under the terms of its lease agreement, regardless of the actual use or occupation by the tenant of the area being leased. Actual use may be less than economic square footage. 
 (2) Rent per square foot is computed as annualized base rent divided by the total occupied square footage at the end of the period. Annualized rent is computed as revenue for the last month of the period multiplied by twelve months. Annualized rent includes the effect of rent abatements, lease inducements and straight-line rent GAAP adjustments. 
 Consolidated Results of Operations

 Net loss increased 0.3 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, due primarily to higher property operating expenses, interest expense due to new mortgages entered into during 2023 and depreciation and amortization resulting from the acquisition of The Q Lofts. Partially offsetting these increased expenses was higher revenues during the three months ended September 30, 2024 from XP Power at Trimble s rent commencement and the acquisition of The Q Lofts in September 2023. 
 Net income increased 6.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, due primarily to the gain on sale of investment properties recorded in conjunction with the February 2024 sale of our industrial investment properties and to the items discussed for the three-month periods. 
 Details of these changes are provided below.

 Total revenues increased 1.1 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, due primarily to the acquisition of The Q Lofts in September 2023 and to rent commencement on the XP Power lease at Trimble. Partially offsetting this increase in revenue is decreased revenues resulting from the sale of our industrial properties in February 2024. 
 Total revenues increased 3.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, due primarily to the same items discussed for the three-month periods.

 Property operating expenses increased 0.2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, due primarily to the acquisition of The Q Lofts and higher bad debt expense, repair and maintenance and payroll costs at our properties. 
 Property operating expenses increased 0.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, due to the acquisition of The Q Lofts and higher insurance, bad debt expense, repair and maintenance and payroll costs at our properties. These increases are offset by the sale of our industrial assets in February 2024 and lower utility costs. 
 Real estate taxes remained consistent during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Real estate taxes decreased 0.05 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, due to consulting fees incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to obtain reductions in real estate taxes for certain investment properties and due to lower estimates of current year taxes based on these reductions. This decrease in real estate tax expense is partially offset by real estate taxes on The Q Lofts which was acquired in September 2023. 
 Depreciation and amortization increased 0.3 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, due primarily to the acquisition of The Q Lofts and to the tenant allowance on the XP Power lease at Trimble. Partially offsetting this increase in depreciation and amortization was the sale of our industrial assets.

Depreciation and amortization increased 1.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, due to the same items discussed for the three-month periods. 
 General and administrative expense increased 0.1 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, due primarily to increased salaries and benefits as a result of annual increases. Partially offsetting this increase is a decrease in professional costs. 
 General and administrative expense increased 0.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, due primarily to the same items discussed for the three-month periods.

 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 General 
 The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Significant estimates, judgments, and assumptions are required in a number of areas, including, but not limited to, evaluating the collectability of accounts receivable, allocating the purchase price of acquired investment properties, and evaluating the impairment of real estate assets. We base these estimates, judgments and assumptions on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 
 Acquisition of Real Estate 
 We evaluate the inputs, processes and outputs of each investment property acquired to determine if the transaction is a business combination or asset acquisition. If an acquisition qualifies as a business combination, the related transaction costs are recorded as an expense in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). If an acquisition qualifies as an asset acquisition, the related transaction costs are generally capitalized and amortized over the useful life of the acquired assets. Generally, acquisition of real estate qualifies as an asset acquisition.

Table of Contents 

We allocate the purchase price of real estate to land, building, other building improvements, tenant improvements, and intangible assets and liabilities (such as the value of above- and below-market leases and in-place leases). The values of above- and below-market leases are recorded as intangible assets, net, and other liabilities, respectively, in the consolidated balance sheets, and are amortized as either a decrease (in the case of above-market leases) or an increase (in the case of below-market leases) to rental income over the remaining term of the associated tenant lease. The values associated with in-place leases are recorded in intangible assets, net in the consolidated balance sheets and are amortized to depreciation and amortization expense in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) over the remaining lease term. 
 The difference between the contractual rental rates and our estimate of market rental rates is measured over a period equal to the remaining non-cancelable term of the leases, including below-market renewal options for which exercise of the renewal option appears to be reasonably assured. The remaining term of leases with renewal options at terms below market reflect the assumed exercise of such below-market renewal options and assume the amortization period would coincide with the extended lease term. 
 Impairment of Real Estate 
 The Company assesses the carrying values of the respective long-lived investment properties whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of these investment properties may not be fully recoverable, such as a reduction in the expected holding period of the investment property. If it is determined that the carrying value is not recoverable because the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed carrying value, the Company records an impairment loss to the extent that the carrying value exceeds fair value. The valuation and possible subsequent impairment of investment properties is a significant estimate that can and does change based on the Company s continuous process of analyzing each investment property and reviewing assumptions about uncertain inherent factors, as well as the economic condition of the asset at a particular point in time. 
 The use of projected future cash flows and related holding periods is based on assumptions that are consistent with the estimates of future expectations and the strategic plan the Company uses to manage its underlying business. However, assumptions and estimates about future cash flows and capitalization rates are complex and subjective. Changes in economic and operating conditions and the Company s ultimate investment intent that occur subsequent to the impairment analyses could impact these assumptions and result in future impairment charges of the real estate properties. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 35.9 million of cash and cash equivalents, and 2.1 million of restricted cash and escrows. 
 Our primary sources and uses of capital are as follows: 
 Sources: 
 cash flows from our investment properties; 
 proceeds from sales of investment properties; and 
 proceeds from debt. 
 Uses: 
 to pay the operating expenses of our investment properties; 
 to pay our general and administrative expenses; 
 to pay for acquisitions; 
 to pay for capital commitments; 
 to pay for short-term obligations; 
 to service or pay-down our debt; and 
 to fund capital expenditures and leasing related costs. 
 Certain of our investment properties have lease maturities within the next two years that we expect to reduce our cash flows from operations if they are not renewed or replaced. Significant lease maturities include Marshalls at Buckhorn Plaza expiring in May 2025 and Office Max at Market at Hilliard expiring in May 2025.

We may, from time to time, repurchase our outstanding equity and/or debt securities, if any, through cash purchases or via other transactions. Such repurchases or transactions, if any, will depend on our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions, and other factors. The amounts involved may be material. 
 Material Cash Requirements 
 In November 2022, the Company executed a lease with XP Power, LLC for approximately 80,000 square feet at Trimble. Rental payments under this lease commenced in January 2024. The lease required significant landlord work, a tenant allowance, which is being accounted for as lessor-owned improvements, and leasing commission. The total cost commitment is estimated to be approximately 13.2 million. As of September 30, 2024, we estimate that remaining costs to be paid under this commitment are approximately 1.1 million. The remainder of the tenant allowance will be paid by the Company upon final request by the tenant. 
 In April 2024, the Company executed a lease with LTF Lease Company, LLC, for an approximately 61,000 square foot Life Time Fitness at Sherman Plaza, located in Evanston, Illinois. Rental payments under this lease are expected to commence in the second quarter of 2025 although the tenant is required to begin reimbursing for its share of common area maintenance upon taking possession of the space, which occurred in July 2024. The total cost commitment is estimated to be approximately 9.2 million. As of September 30, 2024, we estimate that remaining costs to be paid under this commitment are approximately 8.8 million. 
 The Company expects to use cash on hand, cash flows from operations and proceeds from financings to fund the above commitments. 
 
 Borrowings 
 Total debt outstanding as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was 124.1 million and 124.8 million, respectively, with a weighted average interest rate of 5.48 and 5.47 per annum, respectively.

 (1) See below for discussion of the derivative agreements entered into with the mortgage loans obtained on Trimble and The Muse. For Trimble (2025), the interest rate in the table above is the fixed rate. For The Muse (thereafter), the interest rate is the rate in effect on September 30, 2024 
 The Company obtained a loan on November 9, 2023, which was secured by a mortgage encumbering The Muse, one of the Company's multi-family investment properties. The loan has a principal balance of 19.5 million, matures on November 1, 2033 and requires interest-only payments through December 1, 2028 and principal and interest payments thereafter. The interest rate is variable and was 7.41 and 7.39 on September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. In conjunction with the loan closing, the Company purchased an interest rate cap contract to cap the interest at 7.44 through its November 1, 2026 expiration at which point the Company is required to purchase a new cap contract. 
 The Company s mortgage and the related swap agreement on The Locale had an initial maturity date of September 1, 2023. Prior to the initial maturity date, the Company exercised the one-year extension option provided for in the loan documents and entered into a new swap agreement to fix the interest rate at 7.34 and extend the maturity date to September 1, 2024. On November 8, 2023, the Company placed permanent financing on The Locale and simultaneously repaid the 17.1 million outstanding balance on the extended loan and terminated the swap agreement. The new loan matures on December 1, 2030, has a principal balance of 17.7 million, bears interest at a fixed rate of 6.49 and requires interest-only payments for the duration of its 7-year term.

Table of Contents 

On September 20, 2023, the Company assumed two mortgage loans in the total principal amount of 11.3 million, net of a debt discount of 2.0 million. The carrying value of the assumed debt was marked to market as of the acquisition date. According to the terms of the loan agreements, the contractual fixed interest rates are 4.61 and 4.50 , require payments of principal and interest and the maturity date of both loans is January 1, 2036. The debt discount will be amortized to interest expense over the life of the loans. 
 The Company obtained a loan on April 6, 2023, which was secured by a mortgage encumbering one of the buildings comprising the Trimble office investment property. The building is approximately 97,000 square feet and is currently occupied by Veeco Instruments, Inc. The loan secured by a mortgage on this Trimble building has a principal amount of 20.0 million, 4.0 million of which is guaranteed by the Company. The loan matures on April 6, 2025, with a 12-month extension option, which requires, among other criteria, that at the time of extension, the mortgage is not in default, a minimum debt service coverage ratio is met and the extension fee is paid. Simultaneously with the loan closing, we entered into a swap agreement to fix the interest rate at 5.86 for the term of the loan. 
 The Company obtained a loan on January 24, 2023, which was secured by a mortgage encumbering Tennyson, one of the Company s multi-family investment properties. The loan has a principal balance of 10.3 million. The loan matures on February 1, 2030, bears interest at a rate of 4.84 and requires interest-only payments for the duration of its 7-year term. 
 The Company s ability to pay off the mortgages when they become due is dependent upon the Company s ability either to refinance the related mortgage debt or to sell the related investment property. With respect to each mortgage loan, if the applicable wholly-owned property-owning subsidiary is unable to refinance or sell the related investment property, or in the event that the estimated value is less than the mortgage balance, the applicable wholly-owned property-owning subsidiary may, if appropriate, satisfy a mortgage obligation by transferring title of the investment property to the lender or permitting a lender to foreclose. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company guaranteed one mortgage loan up to 4,000. However, Highlands or its subsidiaries may act as guarantor under customary, non-recourse, carve-out guarantees in connection with obtaining mortgage loans on certain of our investment properties. 
 Volatility in the capital markets could expose us to the risk of not being able to borrow on terms and conditions acceptable to us for refinancing. 
 
 Summary of Cash Flows 
 Comparison of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands) Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net cash flows provided by operating activities 3,779 3,723 Net cash flows provided by (used in) investing activities 15,644 (24,690) Net cash flows provided by (used in) financing activities (921) 28,411 Net increase in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and escrows 18,502 7,444 Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and escrows, at beginning of period 19,484 27,918 Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and escrows, at end of period 37,986 35,362 
 Cash provided by operating activities was 3.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 3.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in cash provided by operating activities compared to the same period in 2023 is due primarily to cash received upon rent commencement for new tenant XP Power at Trimble, the acquisition of The Q Lofts in September 2023 and increased occupancy and base rent per square foot in the multi-family portfolio. This increase is partially offset by the loss of revenue upon the sale of our industrial assets in February 2024. 
 Cash provided by investing activities was 15.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to cash used in investing activities of 24.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Cash provided by investing activities increased 40.3 million compared to the same period in 2023, as a result of proceeds received from the sale of our industrial properties totaling 20.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which was partially offset by higher cash spent for capital expenditures and tenant improvements, This is compared to using 21.3 million in cash to acquire The Q Lofts during the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Table of Contents 

Cash used in financing activities was 0.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to cash provided by financing activities of 28.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included principal payments on debt totaling 0.7 million and payment of additional costs in relation to the tender offer that we executed in the fourth quarter of 2023. Cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 included proceeds from a new mortgage on Tennyson in the amount of 30.3 million, principal payments on mortgage debt in the amount of 0.8 million and payment of debt issuance costs of 1.0 million related to the Tennyson mortgage. 
 We consider all demand deposits, money market accounts and investments in certificates of deposit and repurchase agreements with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. We maintain our cash and cash equivalents at financial institutions. The combined account balances at one or more institutions exceed the Federal Depository Insurance Corporation FDIC insurance coverage and, as a result, there is a concentration of credit risk related to amounts on deposit in excess of FDIC insurance coverage. 
 
 Distributions 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, no cash distributions were paid by the Company. 
 
 Funds From Operations and Adjusted Funds From Operations 
 The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts NAREIT ), an industry trade group, has promulgated a non-GAAP financial measure known as Funds From Operations, or FFO. As defined by NAREIT, FFO is net income (loss) in accordance with GAAP excluding gains (or losses) resulting from dispositions of investment properties, plus depreciation and amortization and impairment charges on depreciable property. We have adopted the NAREIT definition in our calculation of FFO as management considers FFO a widely accepted and appropriate measure of performance for REITs. FFO is not equivalent to our net income or loss as determined under GAAP. 
 Since the definition of FFO was promulgated by NAREIT, management and many investors and analysts have considered the presentation of FFO alone to be insufficient. Accordingly, in addition to FFO, we may also use Adjusted Funds From Operations, or AFFO, as a measure of our operating performance. We define AFFO, a non-GAAP financial measure, to exclude from FFO adjustments for gains or losses related to early extinguishment of debt instruments as these items are not related to our continuing operations. By excluding these items, management believes that AFFO provides supplemental information related to sustainable operations that will be more comparable between other reporting periods and to other public, non-listed REITs. AFFO is not equivalent to our net income or loss as determined under GAAP. 
 In calculating FFO and AFFO, impairment charges of depreciable real estate are added back even though the impairment charge may represent a permanent decline in value due to decreased operating performance of the applicable investment property. Further, because gains and losses from sales of investment property are excluded from FFO and AFFO, it is consistent and appropriate that impairments, which are often early recognition of losses on prospective sales of investment property, also be excluded. 
 We believe that FFO and AFFO are useful measures of our investment properties operating performance because they exclude noncash items from GAAP net income. Neither FFO nor AFFO is intended to be an alternative to net income nor to cash flows from operating activities as determined by GAAP as a measure of our capacity to pay distributions. Other REITs may use alternative methodologies for calculating similarly titled measures, which may not be comparable to our calculation of FFO and AFFO. The Company may not present AFFO if the events and transactions of the reporting period do not include the related reconciling items.

The following section presents our calculation of FFO to net income (in thousands): 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Net income (loss) attributable to Highlands REIT, Inc. common stockholders (2,092) (1,783) 598 (5,629) Depreciation and amortization (1)

 (1) The depreciation and amortization add-back excludes the portion of expense attributable to the non-controlling interest. 
 Use and Limitations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 FFO and AFFO do not represent cash generated from operating activities under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or loss, operating profit, cash flows from operations or any other operating performance measure prescribed by GAAP. Although we may present and use FFO and AFFO because we believe they are useful to investors in evaluating and facilitating comparisons of our operating performance between periods and between REITs that report similar measures, the use of this non-GAAP measure has certain limitations as an analytical tool. This non-GAAP financial measure is not a measure of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to fund capital expenditures, contractual commitments, working capital, service debt or make cash distributions. This measurement does not reflect cash expenditures for long-term assets and other items that we have incurred and will incur. This non-GAAP financial measure may include funds that may not be available for management s discretionary use due to functional requirements to conserve funds for capital expenditures, investment property acquisitions and other commitments and uncertainties. This non-GAAP financial measure, as presented, may not be comparable to non-GAAP financial measures as calculated by other real estate companies. 
 We compensate for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance. Our reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP financial measures, and our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) and cash flows, include interest expense, capital expenditures and other excluded items, all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance, as well as the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measure. This non-GAAP financial measure reflects an additional way of viewing our operations that we believe, when viewed with our GAAP results and the reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP financial measure, provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained absent this disclosure. We strongly encourage investors to review our financial information in its entirety and not to rely on a single financial measure.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We are subject to market risk associated with changes in interest rates both in terms of variable-rate debt and the price of new fixed-rate debt upon maturity of existing debt and for acquisitions. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Our interest rate risk management objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs. As of September 30, 2024, our debt included a variable-rate mortgage loan of 20.0 million, which has been swapped to a fixed rate of 5.86 and a variable rate mortgage loan of 19.5 million, with an interest cap, capping the rate at 7.44 . The interest rate in effect on the capped variable rate mortgage loan on September 30, 2024 was 7.41 . 
 With regard to our variable-rate financing, we assess interest rate cash flow risk by identifying and monitoring changes in interest rate exposures that may adversely impact expected future cash flows and by evaluating hedging opportunities. We maintain risk management control systems to monitor interest rate cash flow risk attributable to both outstanding or forecasted debt obligations. 
 We may use financial instruments to hedge exposure to changes in interest rates on loans. To the extent we do, we are exposed to credit risk and market risk. Credit risk is the risk of failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the derivative contract. When the fair value of a derivative contract is positive, the counterparty owes us, which creates a credit risk for us. When the fair value of a derivative contract is negative, we owe the counterparty and, therefore, it does not pose credit risk. We seek to minimize the credit risk in derivative instruments by entering into transactions with what we believe are high-quality counterparties. Market risk is the adverse effect on the value of a financial instrument resulting from a change in interest rates. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had two derivative financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges, with original notional amounts of 20.0 million and 19.5 million and maturity dates of April 6, 2026 and November 1, 2026, respectively. The fair value of the derivatives was 0.003 million as of September 30, 2024 included in deferred costs and other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and 0.1 million included in other liabilities. The gains or losses resulting from marking-to-market our derivative financial instruments during the periods presented are recognized as an increase or decrease in comprehensive income on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As required by Rule 13a-15(b) and Rule 15d-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), our management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer evaluated, as of September 30, 2024, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures, as of September 30, 2024, were effective at a reasonable assurance level for the purpose of ensuring that information required to be disclosed by us in this Quarterly Report is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the rules and forms of the Exchange Act and is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.

Part II. 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 We are from time to time involved in legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. We are not currently involved in any legal or administrative proceedings that we believe are likely to have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. 
 
 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds

 On October 24, 2023, we launched a modified Dutch Auction self-tender offer for the repurchase of up to 25 million of common stock. The tender offer closed on December 8, 2023, with the repurchase of 169,391 shares of common stock at a price per share of 0.14. Subsequent to the close of the tender offer, the Company discovered an administrative error in which certain tender requests were not processed. We honored all such tender requests in April 2024, and accordingly another 33 shares were repurchased.
