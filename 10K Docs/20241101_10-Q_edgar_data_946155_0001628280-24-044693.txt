 In addition to providing the services described above, TIAA charges the Account fees to bear certain mortality and expense risks and risks with providing the liquidity guarantee. These fees are charged as a percentage of the net assets of the Account. Rates for these fees are established annually. 
 Once an Account contract owner begins receiving lifetime annuity income benefits, payment levels cannot be reduced as a result of the Account s actual mortality experience. As such, mortality and expense risk are contractual charges for TIAA s assumption of this risk. 
 TIAA provides the Account with a liquidity guarantee enabling the Account to have funds available to meet contract owner redemption, transfer or cash withdrawal requests. The liquidity guarantee is required by the New York State Department of Financial Services and is subject to a prohibited transaction exemption that the Account received in 1996 (96-76) from the U.S. Department of Labor PTE 96-76 ). The Account pays TIAA for the risk associated with providing the liquidity guarantee through a daily deduction from the Account s net assets. Whether the liquidity guarantee is exercised is based on the cash level of the Account from time to time, as well as recent contract owner withdrawal activity and the Account s expected working capital, debt service and cash needs, and subject to the oversight of the Account's independent fiduciary. If the Account cannot fund contract owner withdrawal or redemption requests from the Account s own cash flow and liquid investments, TIAA will fund them by purchasing accumulation units issued by the Account (accumulation units that are purchased by TIAA are generally referred to as liquidity units ). TIAA guarantees that contract owners can redeem their accumulation units at the accumulation unit value next determined after their transfer or cash withdrawal request is received in good order. Liquidity units owned by TIAA are valued in the same manner as accumulation units owned by the Account s contract owners. 
 Pursuant to its existing liquidity guarantee obligation, beginning August 31, 2023 through the second quarter of 2024, the TIAA General Account purchased a cumulative total of million liquidity units issued by the Account, amounting to million. Although the Account continued to experience net contract owner outflows during the third quarter of 2024, the TIAA General Account was not required to purchase any liquidity units. The independent fiduciary, which has the right to adjust the percentage of total accumulation units that TIAA s ownership should not exceed (the trigger point ), has established the trigger point at of the outstanding accumulation units. As of September 30, 2024, the TIAA General Account owned approximately of the outstanding accumulation units of the Account. The independent fiduciary will continue to monitor TIAA's ownership interest in the Account and provide further recommendations as necessary. 
 Expenses for the services and fees described above are identified as such in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations and are further identified as "Expenses" in Note 12 Financial Highlights .

 (1) Includes loans receivable with related parties. 
 The Account monitors the risk profile of the loan receivable portfolio with the assistance of a third-party rating service that models the loans and assigns risk ratings based on inputs such as loan-to-value ratios, yields, credit quality of the borrowers, property types of the collateral, geographic and local market dynamics, physical condition of the collateral, and the underlying structure of the loans. Ratings for loans are updated monthly. Assigned ratings can range from AAA to C, with an AAA designation representing debt with the lowest level of credit risk and C representing a greater risk of default or principal loss. Loans that are delinquent or in default are generally assigned a D rating unless the value of the collateral asset is estimated to be greater than, or equal to, the outstanding loan balance. Debt in good health is typically reflective of a risk rating in the B range (e.g., BBB, BB, or B), as these ratings reflect borrowers' having adequate financial resources to service their financial commitments, or the value of the collateral asset is estimated to be greater than, or equal to, the outstanding loan balance, but also acknowledging that adverse economic conditions, should they occur, would likely impede on a borrowers' ability to pay. 
 On August 29, 2024, the Account took equity ownership of, and began operating, the collateral office property associated with the Five Oak mezzanine loan receivable through a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure agreement, after the borrower defaulted on the terms of the loan.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 The following discussion and analysis of the Account s financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes contained in this report, the audited Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes contained in the Account s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on March 14, 2024 (the Form 10-K ), and with consideration to the sub-section entitled Forward-Looking Statements, which begins below, the section entitled Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Account's 2023 Form 10-K and the section entitled Item 1.A Risk Factors of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the Account s previous Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, as such risk factors may be updated in subsequent reports. The past performance of the Account is not indicative of future results. 
 Forward-looking Statements 
 Some statements in this Form 10-Q which are not historical facts may be forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements include statements about management s expectations, beliefs, intentions or strategies for the future, include the assumptions and beliefs underlying these forward-looking statements, and are based on current expectations, estimates and projections about the real estate industry, domestic and global economic conditions, including conditions in the credit and capital markets, employment rates, the sectors and markets in which the Account invests and operates, and the transactions described in this Form 10-Q. While management believes the assumptions underlying any of its forward-looking statements and information to be reasonable, such information may be subject to uncertainties and may involve certain risks which may be difficult to predict and are beyond management s control. These risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the risks associated with the following: 
 Acquiring, owning and selling real property and real estate investments, including risks related to general economic and real estate market conditions, the risk that the Account s properties become too concentrated (whether by geography, sector or by tenant mix) and the risk that the sales price of a property might differ from its estimated or appraised value; 
 Property valuations, including the fact that the Account s appraisals are generally obtained on a quarterly basis and there may be periods in between appraisals of a property during which the value attributed to the property for purposes of the Account s daily accumulation unit value may be more or less than the actual realizable value of the property; 
 Financing the Account s properties, including the risk of default on loans secured by the Account s properties (which could lead to foreclosure); 
 Contract owner transactions, in particular that (i) significant net contract owner transfers out of the Account may impair our ability to pursue or consummate new investment opportunities, (ii) significant net contract owner transfers into the Account may result, on a temporary basis, in our cash holdings and/or holdings in liquid non-real estate-related investments exceeding our long-term targeted holding levels and (iii) high levels of cash and liquid non-real estate-related investments in the Account during times of appreciating real estate values can impair the Account s overall return; 
 Joint ventures and real estate funds, including the risk that the Account may have limited rights with respect to the joint venture or that a co-venturer or fund manager may have financial difficulties; 
 Governmental regulatory matters such as zoning laws, rent control laws, and property and other taxes; 
 Potential liability for damage to the environment or injury to individuals caused by hazardous substances used or found on its properties, as well as risks associated with federal and state environmental laws, that may impose restrictions on the manner in which a property may be used; 
 Certain catastrophic losses that may be uninsurable, as well as risks related to climate-related changes and hazards, which could adversely impact the Account s investment returns; 
 ESG criteria used to assess economic risk or financial opportunity projections in the evaluation of commercial real estate investments may not materialize in the way we have anticipated, resulting in the Account 
 32 

subsequently underperforming relative to other investment vehicles that did not utilize such ESG criteria in selecting and managing portfolio properties; 
 Countries with emerging market, foreign commercial real properties, foreign real estate loans, foreign debt investments and foreign securities investments that may experience unique risks such as changes in currency exchange rates, imposition of market controls or currency exchange controls, seizure, expropriation or nationalization of assets, political, social or diplomatic events or unrest (for example, the wars in Ukraine and Gaza), regulatory and taxation risks and risks associated with enforcing judgments in foreign countries that could cause the Account to lose money; 
 Investments in REITs, including changes in the value of the underlying properties or by the quality of any credit extended, as well as exposure to market risk due to changing conditions in the financial markets; 
 Investments in mortgage-backed securities, which are subject to the same risks inherent in real estate investing, making mortgage loans and investing in debt securities. For example, the underlying mortgage loans may experience defaults, are subject to prepayment risks and are sensitive to economic conditions impacting the credit markets generally; 
 Risks associated with the Account s investments in mortgage loans, including (i) borrower default that results in the Account being unable to recover its original investment, (ii) liens that may have priority over the Account s security interest, (iii) a deterioration in the financial condition of tenants, and (iv) changes in interest rates for the Account s variable-rate mortgage loans and other debt instruments; 
 Risks associated with the Account s investments in, and leasing of, single-family real estate include risks relating to the condition of the properties, the credit quality and employment stability of the tenants, and compliance with applicable local laws regarding the acquisition and leasing of single family real estate (which may include manufactured housing); 
 Investment securities issued by U.S. Government agencies and U.S. Government-sponsored entities, including the risk that the issuer may not have their securities backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government, which could adversely affect the pricing and value of such securities; 
 Risks associated with investments in liquid, fixed-income investments and real estate-related liquid assets (which could include, from time to time, registered or unregistered REIT securities and CMBS), and non-real estate-related liquid assets, 
 Conflicts of interests associated with TIAA serving as investment manager of the Account and provider of the liquidity guarantee while also serving as an investment manager to other real estate accounts or funds; 
 Lending securities, which has the Account bear the market risk with respect to the investment of collateral or a portion of the income generated by interest paid by the securities lending agent on the cash collateral balance; 
 The Account s requirement to sell property in the event that TIAA owns too large of a percentage of the Account s accumulation units, which sales could occur at a time or price that is not optimal for the Account s returns; and 
 The tax rules applicable to the contracts vary and your rights under a contract may be subject to the terms of your employer's retirement plan itself, regardless of the terms of the contract. We cannot provide detailed information on all tax aspects of owning the contracts. Tax rules may change without notice, and we cannot predict whether, when, or how tax rules could change or what, if any, tax legislation will actually be proposed or enacted. 
 Continued liquidity risks within the Account's portfolio. Additional detail regarding the recent triggering of the Account s Liquidity Guarantee is included below in the sub-section entitled Liquidity and Capital Resources. 
 More detailed discussions of certain of these risk factors are contained in the section of the Form 10-K entitled Item 1A. Risk Factors and "Part II, Item 1A, Risk Factors" in this Report and also in the section below entitled Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. These risks could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or management s present expectations. 
 Caution should be taken not to place undue reliance on management s forward-looking statements, which represent management s views only as of the date that this report is filed. Neither management nor the Account undertake any obligation to update publicly or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, changed assumptions, future events or otherwise. 
 33 

Commercial real estate market statistics discussed in this section are obtained by the Account from sources that management considers reliable, but some of the data are preliminary for the period ended September 30, 2024 and may be subsequently revised. Prior period data may have been adjusted to reflect updated calculations. Investors should not rely exclusively on the data presented below in forming a judgment regarding the current or prospective performance of the commercial real estate market generally. 
 ABOUT THE TIAA REAL ESTATE ACCOUNT 
 The Account was established, under the laws of New York, in February 1995 as a separate account of TIAA and interests in the Account were first offered to eligible contract owners on October 2, 1995. The Account offers individual and group accumulating annuity contracts (with contributions made on a pre-tax or after-tax basis), as well as individual lifetime and term-certain variable payout annuity contracts (including the payment of death benefits to beneficiaries). Investors are entitled to transfer funds to or from the Account under certain circumstances. Funds invested in the Account for each category of contract are expressed in terms of units, and unit values will fluctuate depending on the Account s performance. 
 Investment Objective and Strategy

 Real Estate-Related Investments. The Account intends to have between 75 and 85 of its net assets invested directly in real estate or real estate-related investments with the goal of producing favorable long-term returns primarily through rental income and appreciation. These investments may consist of: 
 Direct ownership interests in domestic and foreign real estate; 
 Direct ownership of real estate through interests in joint ventures; 
 Indirect interests in real estate through real estate-related securities: such as 
 private real estate limited partnerships and limited liability companies (collectively, real estate funds 
 real estate operating businesses; 
 investments in equity or debt securities of domestic and foreign companies whose operations involve real estate (i.e., that primarily own, develop or manage real estate) which may not be real estate investment trusts REITs 
 domestic or foreign loans, including conventional commercial mortgage loans, participating mortgage loans, secured domestic and foreign mezzanine loans, subordinated loans and collateralized mortgage obligations, including commercial mortgage-backed securities CMBS ), collateralized mortgage obligations CMOs ),and other similar investments; and 
 public and/or privately placed, domestic and foreign, registered and unregistered equity investments in REITs, which investments may consist of registered or unregistered common or preferred stock interests. 
 The Account s principal strategy is to purchase direct ownership interests in income-producing real estate, including the four primary sectors of industrial, multi-family, office, and retail, as well as alternative real estate sectors (defined as real estate outside of the four primary sectors noted above, including single-family real estate). The Account targets holding between 65 and 85 of the Account s net assets in such direct ownership interests. 
 In addition, the Account is authorized to hold up to 25 of its net assets in liquid real estate-related securities, including publicly traded REITs and CMBS. Management intends that the Account will not hold generally more than 10 of net assets in such securities on a long-term basis. As of September 30, 2024, the Account did not hold any publicly traded REITs or CMBS. 
 In making commercial real estate investments within the Account, TIAA seeks to make investments that are suitable from a financial perspective, taking into account the potential financial impacts associated with industry recognized environmental, social and governance ESG criteria to the extent that such criteria are reasonably expected to impact the financial performance of the investment and not to achieve a desired outcome or as an investment

qualification or screen. Ultimately, the Account will make an investment decision that incorporates ESG criteria only to the extent that the criteria are reasonably expected to enhance our understanding of the investment s ability to achieve desired returns for the Account. 
 TIAA believes awareness, and, as appropriate, implementation of ESG criteria in commercial real estate holdings is beneficial to total long-term returns for the Account. 
 Liquid, Fixed-Income Investments . The Account will invest the remaining portion of its assets (targeted to be between 15 and 25 of its net assets) in the following types of liquid, fixed income investments; 
 U.S. Treasury or U.S. Government agency securities; 
 Intermediate-term or long-term government related instruments, such as bond or other fixed-income securities issued by U.S. Government agencies, U.S. states or municipalities or U.S. Government-sponsored entities as well as foreign governments and their agencies (including those in emerging markets) and supranational or multinational organizations (e.g., European Union); 
 Intermediate-term or long-term non-government related instruments, such as corporate debt securities, domestic- or foreign mezzanine or other debt, and structured securities, (e.g. unsecured debt obligations with a return linked to the performance of an underlying asset). Such structured securities may include asset-backed securities ABS issued by domestic or foreign entities, mortgage backed securities MBS ), residential mortgage backed securities RMBS ), debt securities of foreign governments, and collateralized debt CDO ), collateralized bond CBO and collateralized loan CLO obligations, but only if such non-government related instruments are investment-grade securities; 
 Money market instruments and other cash equivalents. These will usually be high-quality, short-term debt instruments, including U.S. Government or government agency securities, commercial paper, certificates of deposit, bankers acceptances, repurchase agreements, interest-bearing time deposits, and corporate debt securities; and 
 To a limited extent, privately issued (or non-publicly traded) debt securities, including Rule 144A securities, issued by domestic and foreign companies that do not primarily own or manage real estate, but only if such domestic and foreign privately issued debt securities are investment-grade securities. 
 However, the Account s liquid, fixed-income investments may comprise less than 15 of its net assets especially during and following periods of significant net contract owner outflows. In addition, the Account, on a temporary basis, may hold in excess of 25 of its net assets in liquid, fixed-income investments, particularly during times of significant inflows into the Account and/or a lack of attractive real estate related investments available in the market. 
 Liquid Securities Generally . Primarily due to management s need to manage fluctuations in cash flows, in particular during and following periods of significant contract owner net transfer activity into or out of the Account, the Account may, on a temporary or long term basis (i) exceed the upper end of its targeted holdings (currently 35 of the Account s net assets) in liquid securities of all types including both publicly traded non-real estate-related liquid investments and liquid real estate related securities, such as REITs and structured securities (including ABS, RMBS, CMBS and MBS), or (ii) be below the low end of its targeted holdings in such liquid securities (currently 15 of the Account s net assets). 
 The portion of the Account s net assets invested in liquid investments of all types may exceed the upper end of its target, for example, if (i) the Account receives a large inflow of money in a short period of time, in particular due to significant contract owner transfer activity into the Account, (ii) the Account receives significant proceeds from sales or financings of direct real estate assets, (iii) there is a lack of attractive direct real estate investments available on the market, and/or (iv) the Account anticipates more near-term cash needs, including to acquire or improve direct real estate investments, pay expenses or repay indebtedness. The portion of the Account s net assets invested in liquid investments of all types may decline below the lower end of its target, for example, as a result of significant contract owner net transfer or withdrawal activity from the Account. 
 35 

Foreign Investments . The Account may also make foreign real estate, foreign real estate-related investments and foreign liquid, fixed-income investments. Under the Account s investment guidelines, investments in direct foreign real estate and real estate loans, together with foreign real estate-related securities and foreign liquid, fixed-income investments may not comprise more than 25 of the Account s net assets. However, management does not intend such foreign investments, in the aggregate, to exceed 10 of the Account's net assets. As of September 30, 2024, the fair value of the Account's foreign real estate investments was 43.9 million, or 0.2 of net assets. 
 In managing any domestic or foreign mezzanine debt or other domestic or foreign loans or securities, the Account may enter into certain derivatives transactions (including forward currency contracts and swaps, futures contracts, put and call options and other hedging transactions) in order to hedge against the risks of exchange rate uncertainties, interest rate uncertainties and foreign currency or market fluctuations impacting the Account s domestic or foreign investments. The Account does not intend to speculate in such transactions. 

THIRD QUARTER 2024 U.S. ECONOMIC AND COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE OVERVIEW 
 The Account invests primarily in high-quality, core real estate in order to meet its investment objective of obtaining favorable long-term returns through rental income and the appreciation of its real estate holdings.

 Growth in the U.S. economy continued at a healthy rate in the third quarter and outpaced expectations of a more significant slowdown after robust growth in the second half of 2023. U.S. GDP grew at an estimated annualized rate of 2.2 in the third quarter according to Moody s Analytics, down from 3.0 in the second quarter, though year-over-year growth remained solid at 2.5 . Job growth reaccelerated in the third quarter to a monthly average of 186,000 jobs added per month after slowing significantly in the second quarter of 2024. The unemployment rate held at 4.1 at the end of the quarter as a result, helping to ease concerns over the health of the labor market and the underpinnings for consumer spending in the economy. 
 The U.S. economy also continued to make progress in its fight against persistent inflation during the third quarter. Year-over-year inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, remains slightly above the Federal Reserve s target of 2 but continued on a general downward trend, finishing the third quarter at 2.4 . This marks the slowest pace of inflation in the economy in three and a half years. Given this backdrop, Federal Reserve officials cut the federal funds rate by 50 basis points in September, marking the first cut in the policy rate since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Yields on 10-year Treasury bonds, which began to trend downward late in the second quarter in anticipation of looser monetary policy, continued a downward path in the third quarter finishing at 3.81 . 
 Real Estate Market Conditions and Outlook 
 The recent decline in long-term interest rates has not yet translated into a significant uptick in commercial real estate transaction activity. According to Real Capital Analytics, sales of commercial properties in the U.S. through the first 
 36 

three quarters of 2024 totaled 282.7 billion, down 1.2 from the same period last year. Lending standards for commercial real estate loans remain generally tight, but are beginning to stabilize, and should ease as the Federal Reserve continues to cut interest rates in upcoming quarters. Improved lending from traditional lenders should lead to increased transaction activity, particularly in target areas like industrial, alternatives, necessity retail and pockets of housing, which continue to experience healthy fundamentals. 
 The Account returned -0.43 in the third quarter of 2024 and -9.35 for the last twelve months. As a result of elevated interest rates and decreased commercial property transactions volume during the reporting periods, property values have been adjusted downward. The third quarter net return was negative for the eighth consecutive quarter and reflects the impact of these broader economic conditions on property valuations. While the Account has experienced valuation declines, property fundamentals remain strong and the properties within the Account are generally well positioned. Potential future investment activity will be consistent with the Account s multi-year strategy of reducing exposure to segments characterized by high capital expenditures and potentially low yields, such as traditional office and retail, and increasing allocations to lower capex and anticipated higher-yielding sectors like industrial, housing, and alternatives. The Account is particularly interested in increasing exposure to the alternatives sector, which includes property types such as self-storage, data centers, life science, medical office, and senior and student housing. 
 Data for the Account s top five markets in terms of market value as of September 30, 2024 are provided below. The five markets presented below represent 40.4 of the Account s total real estate portfolio. Across all markets, the Account s properties are 90.9 leased.

 Office 
 The office sector is undergoing a structural transformation as it absorbs moderating demand characterized by a stagnation in office attendance rates driven by work-from-home trends and cyclical challenges stemming from softness in office-using sectors. High-quality office buildings in prime locations have fared better in recent quarters and have been able to capture market share as tenants command premium space. Most companies have embraced hybrid schedules as the new normal, with tenants using this opportunity to reduce and evaluate space needs. However, several prominent employers have announced more stringent in-office requirements in recent months and several executive surveys suggest that there will be a continued push towards greater in-office time in the near future. Construction of office spaces has continued to slow on the supply side, reflecting the uncertainty of the current and future use of traditional office spaces. Alternatives in the office sector, such as medical office and life sciences face less of a challenge from work-from-home shifts, and benefit from favorable demographic tailwinds from an aging population which make them attractive investments over the long term. 
 The office vacancy rate for the U.S. markets held steady at 13.8 in the third quarter of 2024, as reported by CoStar. The vacancy rate of the Account s office portfolio increased slightly from 16.3 in the second quarter of 2024 to 16.4 in the third quarter of 2024 due to lease expirations. The depth of large tenants is thin which is causing difficulty in re-leasing the space once leases expire. This has been a key driver for the elevated vacancy in the Account's top markets.

 Industrial 
 Declines in manufacturing and housing activity has restrained demand growth in the industrial sector over the last 18 months. Solid growth in consumer spending, particularly through e-commerce channels, and improved import activity have kept net new demand positive in the sector at 31.7 million square feet but well below the strength seen in 2021 and 2022. Demand is poised to improve in upcoming quarters, as many of the demand drivers of industrial space are sensitive to interest rates and are likely to benefit from the Federal Reserve entering a rate-cutting cycle. On the supply side, the number of new deliveries slowed sharply in the third quarter of 2024 after record supply growth over the past two years. According to Costar, only 61.1 million square feet of net new space was completed in the third quarter of 2024, marking the slowest quarter of supply growth in over three years. The construction pipeline for industrial spaces has quickly normalized and the number of new industrial construction starts is near decade-lows, so the supply risk that has driven the rapid rise in vacancy rates and loss of rent growth momentum should subside in coming quarters. 
 The national industrial vacancy rate was 6.6 in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 6.5 in the second quarter, as reported by CoStar. The average vacancy rate of the industrial properties held by the Account increased from 7.0 in the second quarter of 2024 to 8.2 in the third quarter of 2024, due to expiring leases.

 Multi-Family 
 The multifamily sector is demonstrating its ability to absorb record levels of new supply as the market registers record levels of demand. Supply pressure is expected to alleviate after 2024 s peak deliveries. Construction starts are slowing significantly, which means fewer deliveries by the second half of 2025 and into 2026. Supply growth is 
 38 

highest across Sunbelt markets, which are experiencing favorable demographic trends including in-migration and employment growth. Home price appreciation and historically high mortgage rates have dampened home affordability and the cost premium of owning an entry-level home to renting an apartment has never been higher. 
 The national apartment vacancy rate decreased to 5.2 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 5.8 in the second quarter, as reported by Real Page. The vacancy rate of the Account s apartment properties increased slightly from 5.2 in the second quarter of 2024, to 5.5 in the third quarter. Despite the increase, several properties have seen a strong increase in leasing.

 Retail 
 The retail sector remains in a strong position in the third quarter of 2024 thanks to healthy levels of demand and lack of new supply. Vacancy rates for open-air retail remain historically low, and while the vacancy rate for the mall sector remains above its historical average, it is showing signs of improvement. The overall vacancy rate for U.S. malls, which includes malls of all classes, masks the outperformance of the most dominant malls rated class A and higher. These properties will continue to capture the most desirable tenants and a larger share of retail sales compared to their lower-rated counterparts. Across retail product types, construction activity remains suppressed and will help to keep vacancy rates below average even if demand pulls back. These trends are projected to continue into future years as new development activity remains minimal and spaces available continue to lease at an above-average pace. Tenants in necessity-based and grocery-anchored retail are likely to remain resilient should the U.S. economy slow. Leasing activity is concentrated in smaller spaces as the retail market benefits from higher demand for quick-service restaurants and service tenants in the post-pandemic economy. Well-located mixed used opportunities represent attractive investment targets over the medium to long term. 
 The national vacancy rate for retail of all types in the third quarter of 2024 remained unchanged at 4.1 from the previous quarter, as reported by CoStar. The Account's retail portfolio is composed primarily of high-end lifestyle shopping centers and regional malls in large metropolitan or tourist centers, which tend to have higher vacancy rates than the overall national retail market. The Account has over 1,100 retailers across its portfolio, with its largest retail exposure comprising less than 5.0 of total retail rentable area. The retail portfolio is managed to minimize significant exposure to any single retailer. The average vacancy rate of the retail properties held by the Account decreased from 9.6 in the second quarter of 2024 to 8.6 in the third quarter of 2024. Although there were some lease expirations, several properties saw increases in leasing during the quarter to offset the effect.

 The Power Center designation is reserved for properties with three or more anchor units. Anchor units are leased to large retailers such as department stores, home improvement stores, and warehouse clubs. Properties with the Neighborhood, Community and Strip designation consist of two or less anchor units. 
 Hotel 
 Despite inflation and the rising costs of travel, the hotel industry continued to see strong occupancy in the third quarter of 2024, due primarily to the continued improvement in business travel and other group travel, bolstered by the leisure travel that is typically strong in the summer months. Occupancy is expected to remain steady through the remainder of 2024. 
 The Account's exposure to the hospitality sector is limited to one hotel in the Dallas metro area. The hotel is located in a business park in the Dallas metro area and caters largely to business travelers. Key metrics to track hotel performance include occupancy, the average daily rate ADR and revenue per available room RevPAR ). For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, occupancy of the property increased to 62.0 , as compared to 57.2 in the previous quarter. ADR and RevPAR were 159.17 and 184.02, respectively, for the third quarter of 2024, as compared to 159.79 and 161.14, respectively, in the prior quarter. 
 
 INVESTMENTS 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Account had total net assets of 22.4 billion, a 5.3 decrease from December 31, 2023. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Account held 87.9 of its total investments in real estate and real estate joint ventures. The Account also held investments in loans receivable, including those with related parties, representing 4.1 of total investments, a real estate operating business representing 3.6 of total investments, real estate funds representing 2.9 of total investments, U.S. government agency notes representing 1.0 of total investments, and U.S treasury securities representing 0.5 of total investments. 
 The outstanding principal on loans payable on the Account s wholly-owned real estate portfolio as of September 30, 2024 was 1.4 billion. The Account s proportionate share of outstanding principal on loans payable within its joint venture investments was 2.7 billion, which is netted against the underlying properties when determining the joint venture investment s fair value presented on the Consolidated Schedules of Investments. Total outstanding principal on the Account s portfolio as of September 30, 2024, inclusive of loans payable within the joint venture investments, 347.4 million in loans collateralized by a loan receivable, 72.0 million outstanding on the Account's line of credit and 900.0 million in senior notes payable, was 5.4 billion, which represented a loan-to-value ratio of 19.5 . 
 Management believes that the Account s real estate portfolio is diversified by location and property type. The Account does not intend to buy and sell its real estate investments simply to make short-term profits. Rather, the Account s general strategy in selling real estate investments is to dispose of those assets that management believes (i) have maximized in value, (ii) have underperformed or face deteriorating property-specific or market conditions, (iii) need significant capital infusions in the future, (iv) are appropriate to dispose of in order to remain consistent with the Account s intent to diversify the Account by property type and geographic location (including reallocating the Account s exposure to or away from certain property types in certain geographic locations), or (v) otherwise do 
 40 

not satisfy the investment objectives of the Account. Management, from time to time, will evaluate the need to manage liquidity in the Account as part of its analysis as to whether to undertake a particular asset sale. The Account may reinvest any sale proceeds that it does not need to pay operating expenses or to meet debt service or redemption requests (e.g . , contract owner withdrawals or benefit payments).

Rental Income: 
 Rental income increased by 7.7 million, or 2.2 , when compared to the third quarter of 2023, primarily driven by a bad debt settlement and increases in rental rates in the office sector. 
 Operating Expenses: 
 Operating expenses decreased 0.1 million, or 0.1 , when compared to the third quarter of 2023 primarily due to property dispositions, as indicated in the table above, offset by an increase in repair and maintenance, utility and other service related costs in the office, industrial and retail sectors. 
 Real Estate Taxes: 
 Real estate taxes decreased 3.3 million, or 5.9 , when compared to the same quarter in 2023, driven by property dispositions as indicated in the table above. 
 Interest Expense: 
 Interest expense decreased 5.7 million, or 22.3 , primarily due to lower average interest rates on loans payable, as compared to the same quarter in 2023. 
 Income from Real Estate Joint Ventures: 
 Income from real estate joint ventures increased 0.1 million, or 0.2 , when compared to the same quarter in 2023, as a result of higher distributed income from an office property located in Houston, TX, as well as housing ventures located in various locations. Higher distributed income is the result of lower expenses paid by the Account's joint ventures. 
 Income from Real Estate Funds: 
 Income from real estate funds decreased 1.1 million, or 28.9 , when compared to the same quarter in 2023, primarily as a result of lower dividends received from one of the Account's real estate fund investments. Lower dividends are attributable to current market conditions and higher expenses paid by the Account's real estate funds. 
 Interest Income: 
 Interest income decreased 4.0 million, or 11.7 , in comparison to the same quarter of 2023, due to the continual decrease in the Account's loans receivable and lower average securities holdings. 
 Expenses: 
 Investment management, administrative and distribution costs charged to the Account are associated with managing the Account. Investment management charges (which are provided to the Account by TIAA on an at cost basis) are comprised primarily of fixed components, but fluctuate based on the size of the Account s portfolio of investments, whereas administrative and distribution charges are comprised of more variable components that generally correspond with movements in net assets. Both distribution services (pursuant to the Distribution Agreement) and administrative services are provided to the Account by Services and TIAA, respectively, on an at cost basis. Investment management expenses decreased by 3.6 million when compared to the prior year third quarter due to a reduction in the Account's total investments. Administrative expenses decreased 4.9 million when compared to the prior year third quarter due to lower average net assets. Distribution charges increased 1.3 million from the comparable quarter of 2023 due to increase in charge rates. 
 Mortality and expense risk and liquidity guarantee expenses are contractual charges to the Account from TIAA for TIAA s assumption of these risks and provision of the liquidity guarantee. The rate for these charges is established annually and are charged at a fixed rate based on the Account s net assets. There were no mortality and expense risk expenses charged by TIAA in the comparative periods. Liquidity guarantee expenses were 2.0 million lower than the comparable period of 2023 as a result of lower average net assets. 
 Interest expense on the Account's credit facility and other unsecured debt decreased 9.2 million when compared to the same quarter of 2023, due to a lower average outstanding principal balance on the Account's credit facility.

 Real Estate Properties: 
 Wholly-owned real estate investments experienced net realized and unrealized losses of 170.2 million during the third quarter of 2024, compared to 464.7 million of net realized and unrealized losses during the comparable quarter of 2023. Unrealized losses in the third quarter of 2024 were primarily driven by office and industrial properties in the East and West regions due to broader economic trends and struggling occupancy rates. The realized loss is attributable to the sale of two office properties located in California and Utah, as well as a retail property located in Florida. 
 Real Estate Joint Ventures: 
 Real estate joint ventures experienced unrealized losses of 154.4 million during the third quarter of 2024, compared to 278.1 million of net realized and unrealized losses during the third quarter of 2023. Current quarter unrealized losses were seen across the Account's joint venture investments portfolio, with the largest losses seen in the office and retail sectors, due to decreased market demand caused by current economic conditions. 
 Real Estate Funds: 
 Real estate funds experienced net realized and unrealized losses of 6.8 million during the third quarter of 2024, compared to 3.3 million of net realized and unrealized losses during the third quarter of 2023. Unrealized losses in the third quarter of 2024 were due to unfavorable valuations of four of the Account's real estate funds, driven by higher capitalization rates. 
 44 

Real Estate Operating Business: 
 The Account's real estate operating business experienced unrealized gains of 97.2 million during the third quarter of 2024, compared to 3.5 million of unrealized losses in the third quarter of 2023. Unrealized gains in the third quarter of 2024 were the result of favorable valuations supported by increased capital commitments and forecasted future growth. 
 Foreign Currency Exchange on Forward Contracts: 
 The Account's did not hold any forward contracts in the third quarter of 2024. 
 Marketable Securities 
 The Account's marketable securities investments experienced net realized and unrealized gains of 0.2 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to unrealized losses of 0.2 million during the third quarter of 2023. Current period gains can be attributed to slightly declining U.S Treasury rates during the quarter. 
 Loans Receivable, including those with related parties: 
 Loans receivable, including those with related parties, experienced net realized and unrealized losses of 46.1 million during the third quarter of 2024, compared to 62.3 million of unrealized losses during the comparable quarter of 2023. Current period unrealized losses are attributed to two loans collateralized by office properties. The appraised values of the collateral asset properties were less than the principal value of the loans, which resulted in the unfavorable valuation of the loans payable. 
 Loans Payable: 
 Loans payable experienced unrealized gains of 3.7 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 16.3 million of unrealized losses during the comparable quarter of 2023. The unrealized gains in the third quarter of 2024 are attributable to the slight decrease in U.S Treasury yields driven by favorable market conditions and interest rate changes. 
 Other Unsecured Debt: 
 The Account's other unsecured debt experienced unrealized losses of 27.7 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 13.6 million of unrealized gains during the comparable quarter of 2023. The current period loss is attributable to detrimental shifts in the risk-free yield curve.

 N/M Not meaningful 
 Rental Income: 
 Rental income increased by 21.1 million, or 2.1 , when compared to the first nine months of 2023.

The largest increases were experienced in the office, industrial, apartment sectors. 
 46 

Operating Expenses: 
 Operating expenses increased 7.4 million, or 3.0 , when compared to the same period of 2023. The increase is attributed to repair and maintenance costs, as well as utility costs, due to inflation and current market conditions. The largest increases can be seen in the industrial, office and apartment sectors. 
 Real Estate Taxes: 
 Real estate taxes decreased 8.1 million, or 5.0 , when compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to property sales and continual decreased property tax expenses in the office, industrial and apartment sectors, resulting from the decline in property valuations. 
 Interest Expense: 
 Interest expense decreased 7.8 million, or 10.8 , when compared to the same period in 2023, as a result of lower average interest rates on the Account's loans payable. 
 Income from Real Estate Joint Ventures: 
 Income from real estate joint ventures decreased 16.8 million, when compared to the same period in 2023, as a result of lower distributed income from two of the Account's retail joint venture investments, due to increased expenses. 
 Income from Real Estate Funds: 
 Income from real estate funds decreased 2.5 million, when compared to the same period in 2023, as a result of decreased distributed income from two of the Account's real estate fund investments, due to dispositions of properties held within the fund and current market conditions. 
 Interest Income: 
 Interest income decreased 24.7 million in comparison to the same period in 2023, due to a continual decrease in the Account's loans receivable and lower average holdings in the comparable period. 
 Expenses: 
 Investment management, administrative and distribution costs charged to the Account are associated with managing the Account. Investment management charges (which are provided to the Account by TIAA on an at cost basis) are comprised primarily of fixed components, but fluctuate based on the size of the Account s portfolio of investments, whereas administrative and distribution charges are comprised of more variable components that generally correspond with movements in net assets. Both distribution services (pursuant to the Distribution Agreement) and administrative services are provided to the Account by Services and TIAA, respectively, on an at cost basis. Investment management expenses increased 1.6 million over the comparable period due to increases in the charge rate. Administrative expenses decreased 5.3 million due to lower average net assets during the current year period. Distribution charges were up 3.0 million over the comparable period due to increases in charge rate. 
 Mortality and expense risk and liquidity guarantee expenses are contractual charges to the Account from TIAA for TIAA s assumption of these risks and provision of the liquidity guarantee.

There were no mortality and expense risk expenses charged by TIAA in the comparative periods. Liquidity guarantee expenses were 8.7 million lower than the comparable period of 2023 as a result of lower average net assets. 
 Interest expense from the Account's other unsecured debt and line of credit decreased 7.5 million when compared to the same period of 2023, due to a lower average outstanding principal balance on the Account's credit facility and senior notes payable.

 Real Estate Properties: 
 Wholly-owned real estate investments experienced net realized and unrealized losses of 1.2 billion during the first nine months of 2024, compared to 1.9 billion of net realized and unrealized losses during the comparable period of 2023. While the Account saw depreciation across various real estate sectors during the period, unrealized losses were primarily driven by office and industrial properties in the Western and Eastern region due to higher concessions and current economic conditions. The realized loss is attributable to the sale of three office property located in New York, California and Utah. 
 Real Estate Joint Ventures: 
 Real estate joint ventures experienced net realized and unrealized losses of 456.9 million during the first nine months of 2024, compared to net realized and unrealized losses of 1.0 billion during the comparable period of 2023. Net losses in the first nine months of 2024 were primarily driven by the Account's joint venture investments in the office and retail sectors due to a continued decrease in market demand. 
 Real Estate Funds: 
 Real estate funds experienced net realized and unrealized losses of 34.5 million during the first nine months of 2024, compared to net realized and unrealized losses of 18.2 million during the first nine months of 2023. Current period losses are due to unfavorable valuations of four of the Account's real estate funds, due to higher capitalization rates. 
 
 48 

Real Estate Operating Business: 
 The Account's real estate operating business experienced unrealized gains of 140.4 million during the first nine months of 2024, compared to 8.2 million unrealized losses in the comparable period of 2023. Unrealized gains were primarily attributed to favorable valuations, largely based on market pricing and projected future growth. 
 Foreign Currency Exchange on Forward Contracts: 
 The Account did not hold any forward contracts in the first nine months of 2024. 
 Marketable Securities: 
 The Account's marketable securities investments experienced neither a gain or loss during the first nine months of 2024, compared to net realized and unrealized gains of 11.3 million in the comparable period of 2023. Prior period gains can be attributed to net changes in interest and U.S. Treasury rates during the year. 
 Loans Receivable, including those with related parties: 
 Loans receivable, including those with related parties, experienced net realized and unrealized losses of 159.9 million during the first nine months of 2024, compared to 221.6 million of unrealized losses during the comparable period of 2023. Losses in the first nine months of 2024 are primarily attributable to unfavorable valuations of four loans during the period. The appraised values of the collateral asset properties were lower than the principal value of the loans, which resulted in the unfavorable valuation of the loans receivable, compounded by defaults on receivables and loan payoffs on two properties. 
 Loans Payable: 
 Loans payable experienced unrealized losses of 14.2 million in the first nine months of 2024, compared to 39.0 million of unrealized losses during the comparable period of 2023. The unrealized losses in the first nine months of 2024 were mainly attributable to the changes in U.S. Treasury yields driven by inflation risk and widening credit spreads. 
 Other Unsecured Debt: 
 Other unsecured debt experienced unrealized losses of 14.2 million in the first nine months of 2024, attributable to unfavorable changes in credit spreads and fluctuations in the risk-free yield curve. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Account s cash and cash equivalents and non-real estate-related marketable securities had a value of 436.3 million and 206.2 million, respectively (2.0 and 0.9 of the Account s net assets at such dates, respectively). The Account s liquid assets continue to be available to purchase suitable real estate properties, meet the Account s debt obligations, expense needs, and contract owner redemption requests (i.e., contract owner transfers, withdrawals or benefit payments). In addition, as disclosed in the Account's 2023 Form 10-K, the Account is able to meet its short-term and long-term liquidity needs through cash provided by operating activities, the available capacity on its credit facility and the liquidity guarantee provided by TIAA as described below. 
 Liquidity Guarantee 
 The liquidity guarantee ensures that the account will be able to meet its cash requirements with respect to redeeming accumulation unit contract owners, both in the short- and long-term. In accordance with the liquidity guarantee obligation, TIAA guarantees that all contract owners in the Account may redeem their accumulation units at their accumulation unit value next determined after their transfer or cash withdrawal request is received in good order. The Account pays TIAA a fee for the risks associated with providing the liquidity guarantee through a daily deduction from the Account s net assets. 
 Pursuant to its existing liquidity guarantee obligation, beginning August 31, 2023 through the second quarter of 2024, the TIAA General Account purchased a cumulative total of 1.8 million liquidity units issued by the Account, amounting to 911.3 million. Although the Account continued to experience net contract owner outflows during the third quarter of 2024, the TIAA General Account was not required to purchase any liquidity units. TIAA's 
 49 

ownership is approximately 3.87 of the outstanding accumulation units of the Account as of September 30, 2024. The independent fiduciary, which has the right to adjust the percentage of total accumulation units that TIAA s ownership should not exceed (the trigger point ), has established the trigger point at 45 of the outstanding accumulation units. 
 Net Investment Income 
 Net investment income continues to be an additional source of liquidity for the Account. Net investment income was 569.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 566.5 million for the comparable period of 2023. The increase in total net investment income is described more fully in the Results of Operations section. 
 Leverage 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Account s ratio of outstanding principal amount of debt (inclusive of the Account s proportionate share of debt held within its joint venture investments, senior notes payable and any loans outstanding on the Account's Credit Agreement) to total gross asset value (i.e., a "loan -to-value ratio") was 19.5 . The Account intends to maintain its loan-to-value ratio at or below 30 (this ratio is measured at the time of incurrence and after giving effect thereto). The Account s total gross asset value, for these purposes, is equal to the total fair value of the Account s assets (including the fair value of the Account s net equity interest in joint ventures), with no reduction associated with any indebtedness on such assets. 
 The Account's credit facility, which is a 1.4 billion unsecured line of credit, is used to facilitate near-term investment objectives, as further described in Note 10 Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2024, the Account had 72.0 million outstanding on the line of credit. The Account exercised its first of three extension options to extend the facility's termination date to September 20, 2025, subject to customary representations, warranties and closing conditions. 
 As of September 30, 2024, total principal for mortgages on properties held directly by the account, four collateralized by a loan receivable, and senior notes payable are 2.7 billion. There are twelve mortgage obligations secured by real estate investments wholly-owned by the Account, totaling 781.2 million, that are scheduled to mature within the next twelve months. The Account currently has sufficient liquidity in the form of cash and cash equivalents, short-term securities, and available capacity on the Account's line of credit that can be drawn to meet its current mortgage obligations. 
 In times of high net inflow activity, in particular during times of high net contract owner transfer inflows, management may determine to apply a portion of such cash flows to make prepayments of indebtedness prior to scheduled maturity, which would have the effect of reducing the Account s loan-to-value ratio. 
 Statements of Cash Flows 
 The following table sets forth the Account's sources and uses of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in millions): 
 September 30, 
 2024 2023 Cash flows provided by (used in): 
 Operating activities 535.8 1,944.1 Financing activities (523.0) (1,959.0) 
 The following provides information regarding the Account's cash flows from operating and financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Operating Activities : The Account's operating cash flows are primarily impacted by net investment income and the purchase or sale of investments and debt. Cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the prior year period, decreased by approximately 1.4 billion, primarily driven by: 
 50 

1.1 billion decrease in net assets 
 400.9 million of contributions to joint ventures, real estate operating business and real estate funds 
 236.5 million decrease in securities 
 229.9 million of capital improvements on real estate properties 
 Partially offsetting the decreases in cash provided by operating activities above were 724.9 million in cash inflows from the sale of real estate properties. 
 Financing Activities : The Account's financing cash flows are primarily impacted by contract owner transactions, proceeds from debt issuances and repayments of debt. For the period ended September 30, 2024, key drivers were: 
 The Account repaid 584.0 million on the line of credit. 
 Net contract owner outflows totaled 416.4 million. 
 The TIAA General Account purchased 293.7 million of accumulation units. 
 The Account borrowed 193.0 million on the line of credit. 
 Long-Term Financing and Capital Needs 
 The Account expects to meet its long-term liquidity requirements, such as debt maturities, property acquisitions and financing of development activities, through the use of unsecured debt and credit facilities, proceeds received from the disposition of certain properties and joint ventures, along with cash generated from operations after all distributions. The Account has a significant number of unencumbered properties available to secure additional mortgage borrowings should unsecured capital be unavailable or the cost of alternative sources of capital be too high. The value of and cash flow from these unencumbered properties are in excess of the requirements the Account must maintain in order to comply with covenants under its unsecured notes and credit facility. 
 A summary of the Account's outstanding debt is as follows (in millions): 
 September 30, 2024 
 December 31, 2023 Principal Balance of Total Principal Balance of Total Secured 1,787.5 64.8 1,922.6 58.5 Unsecured 972.0 35.2 1,363.0 41.5 Total 2,759.5 100.0 3,285.6 100.0 Fixed Rate Debt: Secured 1,396.0 50.6 1,592.0 48.5 Unsecured 900.0 32.6 900.0 27.4 Fixed Rate Debt 2,296.0 83.2 2,492.0 75.9 Floating Rate Debt: Secured 391.5 14.2 330.6 10.0 Unsecured 72.0 2.6 463.0 14.1 Floating Rate Debt 463.5 16.8 793.6 24.1 Total 2,759.5 100.0 3,285.6 100.0

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Management s discussion and analysis of the Account s financial condition and results of operations is based on the 
 Account s Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of the Account s financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Management considers the valuation of real estate properties and valuation of real estate joint ventures to be critical accounting estimates because they involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have a material impact on the Account s financial condition and results of operations. 
 There have been no material changes to the Account's critical accounting policies described in the Account's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 The Account s real estate holdings, including real estate joint ventures, funds, an operating business and loans receivable, including those with related parties, which, as of September 30, 2024, represented 98.5 of the Account s total investments, expose the Account to a variety of risks. These risks include, but are not limited to: 
 General Real Estate Risk The risk that the Account s property values or rental and occupancy rates could go down due to general economic conditions, a weak market for real estate generally, disruptions in the credit and/or capital markets, or changing supply and demand for certain types of properties; 
 Appraisal Risk The risk that the sale price of an Account property (i.e., the value that would be determined by negotiations between independent parties) might differ substantially from its estimated or appraised value, leading to losses or reduced profits to the Account upon sale; 
 Risk Relating to Property Sales The risk that the Account might not be able to sell a property at a particular time for its full value, particularly in a poor market. This might make it difficult to raise cash quickly and also could lead to Account losses; 
 Risks of Borrowing The risk that interest rate changes may impact Account returns if the Account borrows against a credit facility, takes out a mortgage on a property, buys a property subject to a mortgage or holds a property subject to a mortgage, and hedging against such interest rate changes, if undertaken by the Account, may entail additional costs and be unsuccessful; and 
 Foreign Currency Risk The risk that the value of the Account s foreign investments, related debt, or rental income could increase or decrease due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates or foreign currency exchange control regulations, and hedging against such currency changes, if undertaken by the Account, may entail additional costs and be unsuccessful. 
 The Account believes the diversification of its real estate portfolio, both geographically and by sector, along with its quarterly valuation procedure, helps manage the real estate and appraisal risks described above. 
 As of September 30, 2024, 1.5 of the Account s total investments were comprised of marketable securities. Marketable securities include high-quality debt instruments (i.e . , government agency notes and U.S. treasury securities) and REIT securities. The Account's Consolidated Statements of Investments sets forth the general financial terms of these instruments, along with their fair values, as determined in accordance with procedures described in Note 1 Organization and Significant Accounting Policies to the Account s Consolidated Financial Statements of the Account's 2023 Form 10-K. As of September 30, 2024, the Account does not invest in derivative financial instruments, although it does engage in hedging activity related to foreign currency denominated investments. 
 Risks associated with investments in real estate-related liquid assets (which could include, from time to time, REIT securities and CMBS), and non-real estate-related liquid assets, include the following: 
 Financial/Credit Risk The risk, for debt securities, that the issuer will not be able to pay principal and interest when due (and/or declare bankruptcy or be subject to receivership) and, for equity securities such as common or preferred stock, that the issuer s current earnings will fall or that its overall financial soundness will decline, reducing the security s value. 
 53 

Market Volatility Risk The risk that the Account s investments will experience price volatility due to changing conditions in the financial markets regardless of the credit quality or financial condition of the underlying issuer. This risk is particularly acute to the extent the Account holds equity securities, which have experienced significant short-term price volatility over the past year. Also, to the extent the Account holds debt securities, changes in overall interest rates can cause price fluctuations. 
 Interest Rate Volatility The risk that interest rate volatility may affect the Account s current income from an investment. 
 Deposit/Money Market Risk The risk that, to the extent the Account s cash held in bank deposit accounts exceeds federally insured limits as to that bank, the Account could experience losses if banks fail. The Account does not believe it has exposure to significant concentration of deposit risk. In addition, there is some risk that investments held in money market accounts can suffer losses. 
 In addition, to the extent the Account were to hold MBS (including CMBS) these securities are subject to prepayment risk or extension risk (i.e . , the risk that borrowers will repay the loans earlier or later than anticipated). If the underlying mortgage assets experience faster than anticipated repayments of principal, the Account could fail to recoup some or all of its initial investment in these securities, since the original price paid by the Account was based in part on assumptions regarding the receipt of interest payments. If the underlying mortgage assets are repaid later than anticipated, the Account could lose the opportunity to reinvest the anticipated cash flows at a time when interest rates might be rising. The rate of prepayment depends on a variety of geographic, social and other functions, including prevailing market interest rates and general economic factors. The fair value of these securities is also highly sensitive to changes in interest rates. Note that the potential for appreciation, which could otherwise be expected to result from a decline in interest rates, may be limited by any increased prepayments. These securities may be harder to sell than other securities. 
 In addition to these risks, real estate equity securities (such as REIT securities and MBS) would be subject to many of the same general risks inherent in real estate investing, making mortgage loans and investing in debt securities. For more information on the risks associated with all of the Account s investments, see Item 1A. Risk Factors, of the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as such risk factors may be updated in Item 1A of this Form 10-Q or in subsequent reports. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 (a) The registrant maintains a system of disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the registrant s reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the registrant s Principal Executive Officer PEO and the Principal Financial Officer PFO ), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Under the supervision and participation of the registrant s management, including the registrant s PEO and PFO, the registrant conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the registrant s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act as of September 30, 2024. Based upon management s review, the PEO and PFO concluded that the registrant s disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report, were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the objectives of disclosure controls and procedures are met. 
 (b) There have been no changes in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant s last fiscal quarter that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant s internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. 
 In the normal course of business, the Account may be named, from time to time, as a defendant or may be involved in various legal actions, including arbitration, class actions and other litigation. 
 54 

The Account establishes an accrual for all litigation and regulatory matters when it believes it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Once established, accruals are adjusted, as appropriate, in light of additional information. The amount of loss ultimately incurred in relation to those matters may be higher or lower than the amounts accrued for those matters. 
 As of the date of this report, management of the Account does not believe that the results of any such claims or litigation, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material effect on the Account s business, financial position or results of operations. 
 
 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. 
 Continued liquidity challenges could adversely impact the Account s operations, financial condition, growth and prospects and continue to trigger the Account s Liquidity Guarantee 
 The Account requires sufficient liquidity to fund ongoing Account-level loan and debt commitments to make payments on its debt obligations as they become due, satisfy contract owner redemption requests, fund purchases and maintenance of portfolio properties, and meet other cash and contractual commitments. Starting in late 2023, the Account experienced a decrease in liquid assets, which was largely due to a spike in contract owner redemption requests (i.e., contract owner withdrawals or benefit payments), influenced by negative trends in the U.S commercial real estate market. These trends were exacerbated by higher interest rates that adversely affected property values. TIAA was required to trigger the Liquidity Guarantee by purchasing liquidity units beginning August 31, 2023 through the second quarter of 2024. The pace of net contract owner outflows has slowed over the period covered by this report and no additional liquidity units were purchased during the third quarter of 2024; however, any reversal or adverse change in the pace or scope of these outflows in future fiscal quarters or periods could have a material adverse effect on the Account s business, financial condition and results of operations.
