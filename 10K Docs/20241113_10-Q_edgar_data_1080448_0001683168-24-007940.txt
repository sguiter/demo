of net smelter returns (see Note 3) and recognizes revenue at the time minerals are produced
and sold at the Moss Mine. The Company s revenue recognition policy standards include the following elements under ASU 606: 

1. 
 Identify the contract with the customer. This is documented in the Purchase and Sale Agreement with Golden Vertex dated 5/12/16 and the Royalty Deed dated 5/25/16. 

2. 
 Identify the performance obligations in the contract. The performance obligation required Patriot to relinquish its 30 interest in the Moss Mine. The Company conveyed all of its right, title and interest in those certain patented and unpatented lode mining claims situated in the Oatman Mining District, Mohave County, Arizona together with all extralateral and other associated rights, water rights, tenements, hereditaments and appurtenances belonging or appertaining thereto, and all rights-of-way, easements, rights of access and ingress to and egress from the claims appurtenant thereto, and in which the Company had any interest. 

3. 
 Determine the transaction price. The transaction price was C 1,500,000 plus 3 of the Net Smelter Returns on the future production of the Moss Mine. See Note 3 for definition of Net Smelter Returns. 

4. 
 Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract. The Company only has one performance obligation, the transfer of the rights to the Moss Mine, which has already been fulfilled. 

5. 
 Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. The C 1,500,000 was recognized as a sale of the mining rights in 2016, resulting in a gain from the disposition of the property. The 3 net smelter returns royalty are recognized as revenue in the period that Golden Vertex produces and sells minerals from the Moss Mine, which began in March 2018. The royalties that have been received to date have been highly variable, as the amounts are dependent upon the monthly production, the demand of the buyers, the spot price of gold and silver, the costs associated with refining and transporting the product, etc. As such, management has determined that the revenue recognition shall be treated as variable consideration as defined in ASC 606. Variable consideration should only be recognized to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. Given the fact that royalties to date have been highly variable with a great degree of uncertainty, and any attempts to estimate future revenue would likely result in a significant reversal of revenue, royalty revenue will be recognized when payments and settlement statements are received from Golden Vertex, in the period for which the sales were made by Golden Vertex. It is at that time that any uncertainty related to royalty payments is resolved. The Company applied ASC 606 using the modified retrospective method applied to contracts not yet completed as of the date of adoption. 

unpatented mining claims
(approximately acres). The Company has a 100 interest in the Vernal property, subject to an existing royalty. As of September 30,
2024, the Company has incurred approximately of accumulated option and exploration expenses on the Vernal property. During the
nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company incurred exploration expenses on the Vernal property of and ,
respectively. 

Moss Mine Property 

In 2004, the Company obtained a 100 interest in a
number of patented and unpatented mining claims known as the Moss Mine property located in the Oatman Mining District of Mohave county
Arizona. In 2011, the Company entered into an Exploration and Option to Enter Joint Venture Agreement (the Moss Agreement ),
with Idaho State Gold Company, LLC, ISGC whereby the Company granted the option and right to earn a vested seventy percent
(70 interest in the property and the right and option to form a joint venture for the management and ownership of the properties called
the Moss Mine, Mohave County, Arizona. Subsequently, ISGC transferred its rights to Elevation Gold Mining Corporation. Elevation ),
formerly known as Northern Vertex Mining Corporation. In 2016, it was determined that Northern Vertex had met the required conditions
to earn an undivided 70 interest in the Moss Mine. As such, the Company entered into a material definitive Agreement for Purchase and
Sale of Mining Claims and Escrow Instructions (the Purchase and Sale Agreement with Golden Vertex Corp., an Arizona corporation Golden Vertex, a wholly-owned Subsidiary of Northern Vertex) whereby Golden Vertex agreed to purchase the Company s
remaining 30 working interest in the Moss Mine for 1,155,600 (C 1,500,000) plus a 3 net smelter return NSR royalty.
See Note 4 and Note 11 for additional information regarding the royalty from the Moss Mine. 

Windy Peak Property 

The Windy Peak Property, Windy Peak consists of unpatented mineral claims covering approximately acres, 3 miles NNE of the Bell Mountain and 7 miles east of the
Fairview mining district in southwest Nevada. Annual maintenance fees paid to the BLM and recording fees must be paid to the respective
county on or before September 1 of each year to keep the claims in good standing, provided the filings are kept current these claims can
be kept in perpetuity. As of September 30, 2024, the company has incurred approximately of exploration expenses on the Windy
Peak Property, and and were spent for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

Rainbow Mountain Property 

The Rainbow Mountain gold project consisted of 
unpatented lode claims totaling approximately contiguous acres, located approximately 23 km southeast of Fallon, in the state of
Nevada. In August, 2021, the Company relinquished these claims to the BLM and have completed the required reclamation work. The BLM has
inspected and approved the reclamation work and as a result, the Company has received a refund of its reclamation deposit of , which
is included in Other Income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

net smelter return royalty on the Moss Mine in Arizona. 

Revenue recognition criteria is outline in Note 2
above. However, ASC 606-10-25-1(e) requires the Company to assess whether it is probable that it will collect substantially all of the
revenue. 

In August, 2024, Elevation, the parent company of
Golden Vertex, filed a petition under chapter 15 of the US Bankruptcy Code with the US Bankruptcy Court for the District of Arizona. The
petition included, among other things, a stay of creditor claims and proceedings. This may affect Patriot's receivables discussed in Note
2 and litigation discussed in Note 5. While under creditor protection, Elevation intends to continue the operations of the beneficiation
facilities at the Moss Mine but temporarily cease active mining from the open pit, in order to allow Elevation to meet its cash needs
during the restructuring proceedings. As a result of the bankruptcy filing, it raises the question as to the collectability of Patriot s
earned royalties which remain outstanding. Therefore, revenue has been recognized for the six-month period from April 1, 2024 through
September 30, 2024. The amount of revenue that was earned during this time frame is not readily determinable. For the nine months ended
September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized royalties of and , respectively. 

Pursuant to the Bruner Purchase and Sale Agreement
with Canamex Resources Buyer dated April 25, 2017, the Company has a NSR royalty on the Bruner Gold/Silver mine in
Nevada, including any claims acquired within a two-mile area of interest around the existing claims. The Buyer has the option to buy-down
half of the NSR royalty retained by Patriot for 5 million any time during a five-year period following closing of the purchase and sale
agreement. As of September 30, 2024, royalties have yet been earned. 

In March 2019, the Company purchased a Vanadium Oxide
royalty interest from a related party. In exchange for a non-refundable payment of , the Company is to receive royalties based
on the gross production of Vanadium Oxide Vanadium from a bitumen deposit covering 19 oil sands leases in Alberta. For
each barrel of bitumen produced from the specified oil sands until March 21, 2039, or upon termination of mining, whichever is earlier,
the Company is to be paid a royalty equal to 25 grams of Vanadium per barrel of bitumen produced, multiplied by the price of Vanadium
Pentoxide 98 min in-warehouse Rotterdam published on the last business day of the month in which the gross production of bitumen occurred.
While management believes the royalty interest continues to have value, there is no defined timeline to begin production of Vanadium and
as such, the Company has fully impaired the royalty asset. 

compensation costs charged against those plans for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

The 2019 Plan and the 2014 Plan reserve and make available
for grant common stock shares of up to and , respectively. No option can be granted under the plans 10 years after
the plan inception date. 

Options granted to officers or employees under the
plans may be incentive stock options or non-qualified stock options. Options granted to directors, consultants, and independent contractors
are limited to non-qualified stock options. 

The plans are administered by the Board of Directors
or a committee designated by the Board of Directors. Subject to specified limitations, the Board of Directors or the Committee has full
authority to grant options and establish the terms and conditions for vesting and exercise thereof. However, the aggregate fair market
value (determined at the time the option is granted) of the shares with respect to which incentive stock options are exercisable for the
first time by an optionee during any calendar year cannot exceed . 

Options granted pursuant to the plans are exercisable
within ten years after the date of grant. The exercise price per share of common stock for options granted shall be determined by the
Board of Directors or the designated committee, except for incentive stock options granted to a holder of ten percent or more of Patriot's
common stock, for whom the exercise price per share will not be less than 110 of the fair market value. 

As of September 30, 2024, there were and shares available
for grant under the 2019 Plan and 2014 Plan, respectively. 

Stock Option Activity 

The fair value of each stock option is estimated at
the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. No options were granted in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Assumptions
regarding volatility, expected term, dividend yield and risk-free interest rate are required for the Black-Scholes model. The volatility
assumption is based on the Company s historical experience. The risk-free interest rate is based on a U.S. treasury note with a
maturity similar to the option award s expected life. The expected life represents the average period of time that options granted
are expected to be outstanding. 

The following table summarizes stock option activity and related information

shares of
 par value common stock. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had of common shares outstanding. Some of these outstanding
shares were granted as payment for services provided to the Company and are restricted. T he restricted
common stock is restricted for a period of three years following the date of grant. During the three-year period the recipient may not
sell or otherwise dispose of the shares. The Company has applied a discount for illiquidity to the price of the Company s
stock when determining the amount of expense to be recorded for the Restricted Common Stock issuance. The discount for illiquidity for
the Restricted Common Stock was estimated on the date of grant by taking the average close price of the freely traded common shares for
the period in which the services were provided, and applying an illiquidity discount of 10 for each multiple that the total Restricted
Common Stock is of the average daily volume for the period, to a maximum of 50 .

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Forward-Looking Statements 

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking
information. Forward-looking information includes statements relating to future actions, prospective products, future performance or results
of current or anticipated products, sales and marketing efforts, costs and expenses, interest rates, outcome of contingencies, financial
condition, results of operations, liquidity, business strategies, cost savings, objectives of management of Patriot Gold Corp. (hereinafter
referred to as the Company, Patriot Gold or we and other matters. One can find many of these
statements by looking for words including, for example, believes, expects, anticipates, estimates 
or similar expressions. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a
result of new information or future events. 

The Company has based the forward-looking statements
relating to the Company s operations on management s current expectations, estimates and projections about the Company and
the industry in which it operates. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions
that we cannot predict. In particular, we have based many of these forward-looking statements on assumptions about future events that
may prove to be inaccurate. Accordingly, the Company s actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by these forward-looking
statements. Any differences could result from a variety of factors, including, but not limited to general economic and business conditions,
competition, and other factors. 

General Overview 

As a natural resource exploration company, our focus
is to acquire, explore and develop natural resource properties which may host mineral reserves which may be economical to extract commercially.
With this in mind, we have identified and secured interests in mining claims with respect to properties in Nevada. Current cash on hand
plus anticipated royalty revenue is sufficient to fund planned operations for 2024 after payment of accounts payable outstanding at September
30, 2024. Our officers and directors and advisors, attorneys and consultants will continue to be utilized to support all operations. 

Results of Operations 

Comparison of the Three and Nine Months Ended September
30, 2024 to the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 

During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and
2023, we had revenues of 0 and 509,250, respectively, resulting from the Moss Mine royalty. Please refer to Note 4 of the footnotes
for an explanation of our decision not to report revenue for this period. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we
had revenues of 361,523 and 1,429,835, respectively. We are currently exploring and developing our properties and are actively reviewing
new projects. 

Net loss for the three months ended September 30,
2024 was 364,517) compared to net income of 13,880 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Net loss for the nine months ended
September 30, 2024 was 1,234,000) compared to a net profit of 350,692 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change in profitability
is primarily due to the 1,068,312 decrease in royalty revenue compared to the prior year. In addition, there was an approximate 124,000
increase in mineral costs and a 510,000 increase in general and administrative expenses. 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and
2023, mineral and exploration expenses were 8,991 and 133,895, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,
mineral and exploration expenses were 361,553 and 237,685, respectively. The increase in 2024 is primarily due to drilling and exploration
expenditures on the Windy Peak project. 

19 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and
2023, general and administrative expenses were 93,944 and 53,940, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,
general and administrative expenses were 662,726 and 152,538, respectively. The increase in 2024 is primarily due to an increase in
consulting fees. 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and
2023, other income (expenses) were 11,470) and 4,041, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, other income
(expenses) were 23,791 and 12,612), respectively. The change in other income/expense is due to a 25,550 increase in interest income
and the receipt of 7,100 of a reclamation deposit related to Rainbow Mountain. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

We had total assets of 1,993,061 at September 30,
2024 consisting primarily of 520,032 of cash, 15,518 of marketable securities, 269,704 of royalty receivables, and 128,807 of prepaid
expenses. We had total liabilities of 285,438 at September 30, 2024, consisting primarily of accounts payable and accrued expenses, both
trade and with related parties. 

We anticipate that we will incur the following during
the year ended December 31, 2024: 

1,500,000 for operating expenses, including exploration, working capital and general, legal, accounting and administrative expenses associated with reporting requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and compliance with Canadian regulatory authorities. 

Cash provided by (used in) operations was 1,088,335)
and 824,155 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The 1,912,490 decrease in cash provided by operations
was primarily due to the change in royalty receivables and accounts payable and accrued liabilities. 

There were no investing activities for the nine months
ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

Cash used in financing activities was 93,360 and
 717,081 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, due to a repurchase of the Company s common stock of 1,000,000 and
6,392,206 shares, respectfully. 

Management estimates that the Company will not need
additional funding for the next twelve months. 

We currently have no agreements, arrangements or understandings
with any person to obtain funds through bank loans, lines of credit or any other sources. 

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

Use of Estimates 

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Management believes that all applicable estimates and adjustments
are appropriate. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Revenue Recognition 

On June 1, 2018, the Company adopted Financial Accounting
Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ASC
606 ), which provides a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers.
The Company receives a royalty from Golden Vertex of 3 of net smelter returns (see Note 3) and recognizes revenue at the time minerals
are produced and sold at the Moss Mine. The Company s revenue recognition policy standards include the following elements under
ASU 606: 

1. 
 Identify the contract with the customer. This is documented in the Purchase and Sale Agreement with Golden Vertex dated 5/12/16 and the Royalty Deed dated 5/25/16. 

2. 
 Identify the performance obligations in the contract. The performance obligation required Patriot to relinquish its 30 interest in the Moss Mine. The Company conveyed all of its right, title and interest in those certain patented and unpatented lode mining claims situated in the Oatman Mining District, Mohave County, Arizona together with all extralateral and other associated rights, water rights, tenements, hereditaments and appurtenances belonging or appertaining thereto, and all rights-of-way, easements, rights of access and ingress to and egress from the claims appurtenant thereto, and in which the Company had any interest. 

3. 
 Determine the transaction price. The transaction price was C 1,500,000 plus 3 of the Net Smelter Returns on the future production of the Moss Mine. See Note 3 for definition of Net Smelter Returns. 

4. 
 Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract. The Company only has one performance obligation, the transfer of the rights to the Moss Mine, which has already been fulfilled. 

5. 
 Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. The C 1,500,000 was recognized as a sale of the mining rights in 2016, resulting in a gain from the disposition of the property. The 3 net smelter returns royalty will be recognized as revenue in the period that Golden Vertex produces and sells minerals from the Moss Mine, which began in March 2018. The royalties that have been received to date have been highly variable, as the amounts are dependent upon the monthly production, the demand of the buyers, the spot price of gold and silver, the costs associated with refining and transporting the product, etc. As such, management has determined that the revenue recognition shall be treated as variable consideration as defined in ASC 606. Variable consideration should only be recognized to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. Given the fact that royalties to date have been highly variable with a great degree of uncertainty, and any attempts to estimate future revenue would likely result in a significant reversal of revenue, royalty revenue will be recognized when payments and settlement statements are received from Golden Vertex, in the period for which the sales were made by Golden Vertex. It is at that time that any uncertainty related to royalty payments is resolved. The Company applied ASC 606 using the modified retrospective method applied to contracts not yet completed as of the date of adoption. 

Mineral Property Acquisition and Exploration
Costs 

Mineral exploration costs and payments related to
the acquisition of the mineral rights are expensed as incurred. When it has been determined that a mineral property can be economically
developed as a result of establishing proven and probable reserves, the costs incurred to acquire and develop such property will be capitalized.
Such costs will be amortized using the units-of-production method over the estimated life of the probable reserve. No costs have been
capitalized through September 30, 2024. 

21 

Deferred Taxes 

The Company follows ASC 740-10-30, which requires
recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial
statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are based on the differences between the financial statement
and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the fiscal year in which the differences are expected to
reverse. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the Statements of Income in the period
that includes the enactment date. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent management concludes it is more
likely than not that the assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected
to apply to taxable income in the fiscal years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect
on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the Statements of Income in the period that includes
the enactment date. 

The Company adopted ASC 740-10-25 ASC 740-10-25 with regard to uncertainty of income tax positions. ASC 740-10-25 addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or
expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. Under ASC 740-10-25, we may recognize the
tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by
the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from
such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon ultimate
settlement. ASC 740-10-25 also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties on income taxes, and accounting
in interim periods and requires increased disclosures. 

Stock-Based Compensation 

We account for equity-based transactions with nonemployees
awards in accordance with the Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2018-07, Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718): ASU
2018-07 establishes that equity-based payment transactions with nonemployees shall be measured at the fair value of the consideration
received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. The fair value of common stock issued
for payments to nonemployees is measured at the market price on the date of grant. The fair value of equity instruments, other than common
stock, is estimated using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. In general, we recognize the fair value of the equity instruments
issued as deferred stock compensation and amortize the cost over the term of the contract. 

We account for employee stock-based compensation in
accordance with the guidance of FASB ASC Topic 718, Compensation Stock Compensation, which requires all share-based payments
to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values. The
fair value of the equity instrument is charged directly to compensation expense and credited to additional paid-in capital over the period
during which services are rendered. 

The Company has granted Restricted Common Stock, where
the Restricted Common Stock is restricted for a period of three years following the date of grant. During the three-year period the recipient
may not sell or otherwise dispose of the shares. The Company has applied a discount for illiquidity to the price of the Company s
stock when determining the amount of expense to be recorded for the Restricted Common Stock issuance. The discount for illiquidity for
the Restricted Common Stock was estimated on the date of grant by taking the average close price of the freely traded common shares for
the period in which the services were provided, and applying an illiquidity discount of 10 for each multiple that the total Restricted
Common Stock is of the average daily volume for the period, to a maximum of 50 .
