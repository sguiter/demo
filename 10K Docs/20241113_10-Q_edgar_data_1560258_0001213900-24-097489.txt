million and million and used cash in its operations of million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. These conditions have raised substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 
 The Company has historically funded its operations from the sale of its securities. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , the Company received net proceeds of approximately million from such sales and as of September 30, 2024 , the Company s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled million Cash Position ). 
 Based on its current assessment, the Company believes its Cash Position will enable it to fund its operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements, as currently planned, for at least the next 12 months from the date the accompanying financial statements are issued. The Company therefore believes that the previously disclosed substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern is alleviated. There remain significant risks and uncertainties regarding the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. The Company s future capital requirements are difficult to forecast and will depend on many factors that are out of its control. If the Company is unable to achieve its planned operating results or maintain sufficient financial resources, including through potential positive cash flow from operations or supplemental access to third-party debt, equity or hybrid capital, its business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.

 Valuation Information for Stock-Based Compensation 
 The Company uses the Black- Scholes model to estimate the grant date fair value of each stock option awarded. Effective July 1, 2023, expected volatility was based on the Company's historical common stock volatility. For the period presented below, the expected volatility was based on a composite comprising of of the Company's historical common stock volatility; the remaining was based on historical volatility of its peers. The risk-free interest rate was based on the average U.S. Treasury rate that most closely resembled the expected life of the related award. The expected term of the award was calculated using the simplified method. dividend was assumed as the Company does not pay regular dividends on its common stock and does not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future.

 On September 15, 2020, the Company and the other defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint for failure to state a claim. On November 6, 2020, the plaintiffs filed their opposition to the motion to dismiss. The Company and the other defendants filed reply papers in support of the motion on December 7, 2020. Argument of the motion to dismiss occurred on June 18, 2021. On August 13, 2021, the Court dismissed the amended complaint with leave to re-plead. On October 4, 2021, the plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint in the Turnofsky case. The defendants moved to dismiss, and briefing on the motion was complete on January 7, 2022. On July 13, 2023, the court dismissed the second amended complaint with leave to re-plead. The plaintiffs did not file a third amended complaint. On August 23, 2023, the plaintiffs provided the court with an order of dismissal, and the court entered the order on August 24, 2023. On September 8, 2023, plaintiff Carole Tibbs filed a notice of appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. The appeal has been docketed as number 23 - 2655 .

On October 9, 2024, the court advised that it will decide the appeal on the papers and will not hear oral argument. 
 The Company intends to continue to vigorously defend itself in these matters. However, in light of, among other things, the preliminary stage of these litigation matters, the Company is unable to determine the reasonable probability of loss or a range of potential loss. Accordingly, the Company has not established an accrual for potential losses, if any, that could result from any unfavorable outcome, and there can be no assurance that these litigation matters will not result in substantial defense costs and/or judgments or settlements that could adversely affect the Company s financial condition.

Item 2 . Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL 

 CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

You should read this section in conjunction with our unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this Quarterly Report and our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023 included in our Annual Report. As discussed in the section titled Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements, the following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, as well as assumptions that, if they never materialize or prove incorrect, could cause our results to differ materially from tho se expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below, and those under the caption "Risk Factors" in the aforementioned Annual Report and this Quarterly Report. 
 We are a commercial stage bioelectronic medicine and wellness company dedicated to improving health and quality of life through our propriety non-invasive vagus nerve stimulation nVNS technology platform. 
 nVNS modulates neurotransmitters through its effects on both the peripheral and central nervous systems. Our nVNS treatment is delivered through a proprietary high-frequency burst waveform that safely and comfortably passes through the skin and stimulates therapeutically relevant fibers in the vagus nerve. Various scientific publications suggest that nVNS works through a variety of mechanistic pathways including the modulation of neurotransmitters. 
 Historically, vagus nerve stimulation or VNS, required an invasive surgical procedure to implant a costly medical device. This has generally limited VNS from being used by anyone other than the most severe patients. Our non-invasive medical devices and general wellness products are self-administered and intended for regular or intermittent use over many years. 
 Our capabilities include product development, regulatory affairs and compliance, sales and marketing, product testing, assembly, fulfillment, and customer support. We derive revenues from the sale of products in the United States and select overseas markets. We have two principal product categories : 

Handheld, personal use medical devices for the management and treatment of certain medical conditions such as primary headache; and 

Handheld, personal use consumer product offerings utilizing nVNS technology to promote general wellness and human performance. 

We believe our nVNS treatment may be used in the future to effectively treat additional medical conditions. 

18 

Our goal is to be a leader in non-invasive neuromodulation by using our proprietary nVNS platform technology to deliver better health. To achieve this, we offer multiple propositions: 

Prescription gammaCore medical devices for the treatment of certain medical conditions such as primary headache; 

Truvaga products for the support of general health and wellbeing; and 

TAC-STIM for human performance. 

Our flagship gammaCore Sapphire is a prescription medical device that is FDA cleared for a variety of primary headache conditions. gammaCore is available by prescription only and Sapphire is a portable, reusable, rechargeable and reloadable personal use option for patients to use at home or on the go. Prescriptions are written by a health care provider and dispensed from a specialty pharmacy, through the patient s healthcare system, or shipped directly to certain patients in the United States directly from our facility in Rockaway, NJ. After the initial prescription is filled, access to additional therapy can be refilled for certain of our gammaCore products through the input of a prescription-only authorization. 
 
 We offer two versions of our Truvaga products for the support of general health and wellbeing. Truvaga 350 is a personal use consumer electronics general wellness product and Truvaga Plus, which was launched in April 2024, is our next generation, app-enabled general wellness product. Neither product require a prescription, and both are available direct-to-consumer from electroCore at www.truvaga.com. 
 
 TAC-STIM is a form of nVNS for human performance and has been developed in collaboration with the United States Department of Defense Biotech Optimized for Operational Solutions and Tactics, or BOOST program. TAC-STIM products are available as a Commercial Off the Shelf (COtS) solution to professional organizations and are the subject of ongoing research and evaluation within the United States Air Force Special Operations Command, the United States Army Special Operations Command and at the United States Air Force Research Laboratory. 
 
 Truvaga and TAC-STIM products are intended for general wellness in compliance with the FDA guidance document entitled General Wellness: Policy for Low-Risk Devices; Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, issued on September 27, 2019. Truvaga and TAC-STIM products are not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease or medical condition. 
 
 We are exploring strategies to make our TAC-STIM product available to other branches of the active-duty military and certain human performance professionals in the United States and abroad. Our TAC-STIM product is not a medical device and is not intended to diagnose, cure, mitigate, prevent, or treat a disease or condition. 
 
 Our two largest customers by revenue are the United States Department of Veterans Affairs and United States Department of Defense, or VA/DoD, and the United Kingdom National Health Service, or NHS, utilizing our FDA cleared and CE marked product, gammaCore. 
 
 The VA/DoD comprised 72.9 of our revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 . The majority of our 2024 sales were made through open market sales to individual facilities within the VA Hospital system and a smaller amount pursuant to our qualifying contract under the Federal Supply Schedule, or FSS, which was secured by us in December 2018 and through Lovell Government Services, or Lovell. The initial term of our FSS contract was scheduled to expire on January 15, 2024. We obtained modifications to the initial contract, temporarily extending the term fr om January 15, 2024 to December 14, 2024 , while the VA/ DoD Federal Supply Schedule Service reviews our follow-on offer application for a replacement FSS contract. Although we continue to work with the appropriate government personnel to replace our existing FSS contract, there can be no assurance that the VA/DoD will accept our application which may limit or eliminate our ability to sell certain gammaCore products into the government channel pursuant to our qualifying FSS contract or individual facilities that utilize our FSS contract number for open market purchases. 

19 

In August 2023, we signed a non-exclusive distribution agreement with Lovell providing Lovell the right to list and distribute certain gammaCore products into the federal market. Lovell is a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) offering medical and pharmaceutical goods and services to federal healthcare providers. Listing products with Lovell is intended to streamline the sales process to a variety of government procurement channels through Lovell s compliance with contracting regulations and its provision of logistical solutions connected directly into government contracting portals, all of which are intended to help government agencies meet their SDVOSB procurement goals. Customers for these vehicles are federal healthcare systems such as the Veterans Health Administration (VHA, which includes the VA/DoD), the Military Health System (MHS), and Indian Health Services (IHS), which we believe serve up to approximately 21 million patients combined. Between November 2023 and January 2024, certain gammaCore products were added to the FSS, the VA/DoD s Distribution and Pricing Agreement or DAPA, GSA Advantage, and Defense Logistics Agency s ECAT system procurement portals through the Lovell contract vehicles, enabling the purchase of gammaCore products within the government channel and throughout the federal markets, including, but not limited to, the VA/DoD. The gammaCore products offered through Lovell provide government customers with similar product configuration options to those currently sold through our existing FSS contract and open market sales made directly to individual VA/DoD facilities. We expect a significant portion of our 2024 sales to continue in the government channel broadly, and to our largest customer the VA/DoD, specifically, pursuant to our FSS contract if replaced and / or through our relationship with Lovell and its qualifying FSS, GSA, DAPA, and ECAT contracts for which gammaCore has been added. 
 
 Sales under the Med Tech Funding Mandate, or MTFM, program for cluster headache in the UK comprised 5.1 and 5.4 of our revenue during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively. In October 2023, we were notified by NHS Supply Chain that it intends to continue to include the gammaCore device within their framework agreement, commencing March 2024 through March 2026 with our option to extend for a further two years. In 2024 , we expect NICE to review the guidance document and any changes in recommendation or pricing may adversely impact our ability to work with NHS England on the MTFM program. 
 
 We believe there may be large commercial opportunities
for our gammaCore medical device with adoption by third-party payors, cash pay
and physician dispense models, along with general wellness and human
performance propositions through our Truvaga and TAC-STIM products. Therefore,
we will continue our investments to expand our efforts in these channels and
markets in 2024 and beyond. 
 
 We face a variety of challenges and risks that we will need to address and manage as we pursue our strategies, including our ability to develop and retain an effective sales force, achieve market acceptance of our gammaCore medical device among clinicians, patients, and third-party payers, expand the use of our gammaCore medical device to additional therapeutic indications, and to develop our nascent wellness and human performance business including the recent launch of Truvaga Plus, our next generation app-enabled device under the Truvaga brand. 
 
 Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with our commercialization efforts, as well as research and product development activities, we are unable to predict the timing or amount of increased expenses, or when, if ever, we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability. Even if we are able to increase sales of our products, we may not become profitable. If we fail to become profitable or are unable to sustain profitability, then we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce or terminate our operations. 
 
 Our expected cash requirements for the next 12 months and beyond are based on the commercial success of our products and our ability to control operating expenses. We believe our cash, cash
equivalents, marketable securities, and anticipated revenue will enable us to
fund our operating expenses, working capital and capital expenditures as
currently planned through 12 months from the date of the financial statements in this Quarterly Report, however, t here can be no assurance that we will have sufficient cash flow and liquidity to fund our planned activities, which could force us to significantly reduce or curtail our activities and, ultimately potentially cease operations. See Liquidity Outlook. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The preparation of our financial statements is in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and other related disclosures. While we believe our estimates, assumptions and judgments are reasonable, they are based on information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates due to changes in judgments, assumptions and conditions as a result of unforeseen events or otherwise, which could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations. 
 
 We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if: (i) the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made, and (ii) changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. The critical accounting estimates, that we believe have the greatest potential impact on the condensed consolidated financial statements are disclosed in the section titled Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in Part II of our Annual Report.

Net Sales 
 Net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 45 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 . The increase of 2.0 million is due to an increase in net sales across major channels including our prescription gammaCore medical devices sold in the United States and abroad; and revenue from the sales of our nonprescription general wellness Truvaga products. We expect that the majority of our remaining 2024 fiscal year revenue will continue to come from the VA/DoD. In addition, the amount of
revenue we recognize from the sale of our TAC-STIM product, however, may
fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter. See the above Overview for discussion regarding our FSS contract with the VA/DoD.

Gross Profit 
 Gross profit increased by 1.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 . Gross margin was 84 and 85 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. Gross profit and gross margin for the remainder of 2024 will be largely dependent on revenue levels, product mix, and any changes in the estimated useful lives of licensed devices. 

21 

Research and Development 
 
 Research and development expense in the third quarter of 2024 was 0.5 million, as compared to 1.2 million in the third quarter of 2023 . This decrease was primarily due to a significant reduction in investments associated with the development of our next generation of smartphone-integrated and smartphone-connected non-invasive therapies. For the remainder of 2024 , we expect our research and development expense to continue to be lower than the comparable period in 2023 . 
 
 Selling, General and Administrative 
 
 Selling, general and administrative expense of 7.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 0.9 million, or 13 , as compared to 6.7 million for the previous year period. This increase was primarily due to our greater variable selling and marketing costs consistent with our increase in sales. During the remainder of 2024 , we plan on continuing to make targeted investments in sales and marketing to support our commercial efforts, particularly around sales and marketing efforts across all major U.S. channels. 
 
 Other (Income) Expense 
 
 The increase in Other (Income) Expense of 60,000 is primarily due to an increase in interest income.

Net Sales 
 
 Net sales increased 67 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period. The increase of 7.3 million is due to an increase in net sales across all major channels including the sale of our prescription gammaCore medical devices in our U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs and U.S. commercial channel, and revenue from the sales of our nonprescription Truvaga products. We expect that the majority of remaining 2024 fiscal year revenue will continue to come from our U.S. channels. The amount of revenue we recognize from the sale of our TAC-STIM product, however, may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter.

Gross margin increased to 85 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 84 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . In recent quarters, we have sold an increasing number of longer duration therapy, resulting in a higher average selling price. Gross profit and gross margin in the remainder of 2024 will be largely dependent on revenue levels, product mix, and any changes in the estimated useful lives of licensed devices. 
 Research and Development 
 Research and development expense decreased b y 2.7 million or 63 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period. This decrease was primarily
due to a significant reduction in investments associated with the development
of our next generation of smartphone-integrated and smartphone-connected
non-invasive therapies. For the remainder of 2024 ,
we expect our research and development expense to continue to be lower than the comparable period in 2023 . 
 Selling, General and Administrative 
 Selling, general and administrative expense of 22.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 2.6 million compared to 20.2 million for the previous year period. This increase was primarily
due to our greater variable selling and marketing costs consistent with our
increase in sales and recognition of lease expense associated with the lease expansion of our facility in Rockaway, New Jersey. During the remainder of 2024 ,
we plan on continuing to make targeted investments in sales and marketing to
support our commercial efforts, particularly around sales and marketing efforts
across all major U.S. channels. Selling, general and administrative expense for
the nine months ended September 30, 2023 included severance charges of 445,000. 
 Other (Income) Expense 
 
 The decrease in Other
Income of 13,000 is primarily due to increased interest income offset by a one-time expense associated with the termination of an agreement in the current period. 
 
 Benefit from Income Taxes 
 
 We may be eligible, from time to time, to receive cash from the sale of our net operating losses under New Jersey's Department of the Treasury - Division of Taxation NOL Transfer Program. On March 6, 2024, the Company received a net cash payment of 122,000 from the sale of its New Jersey state net operating losses.

Operating Activities 
 Net cash used in operating activities was 5.7 million and 11.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively . This decrease is primarily due to the decrease in our net loss adjusted for non-cash expense items. 
 Investing Activities 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , 8.0 million was used in investing activities primarily the result of the purchase of 8.0 million in marketable securities. 
 Financing Activities 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , net cash provided by
financing activities was 8.1 million which was attributable to the Company entering into a registered direct offering and concurrent private placements,
which closed on June 5, 2024. In addition, we received 1.0 million from the
issuance of securities to our legal counsel. Upon issuance of these shares,
certain of our financial obligations to our legal counsel were deemed paid
and satisfied in full. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023 net cash provided by financing activities was
 7.5 million which was attributable to the Company entering into a registered direct offering and concurrent private placements, which closed on July 31, 2023. 
 Liquidity Outlook 
 We have experienced significant net losses, and
we expect to continue to incur net losses for the near future as we work to
increase market acceptance of our gammaCore therapy and general wellness and
human performance products. We have never been profitable and we have incurred
net losses and negative cash used in operations in each year since our inception.
We incurred net losses of 8.7 million and 14.8 million and used cash in our operations
of 5.7 million and 11.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and
 2023 , respectively. 
 We have historically funded our operations from the
sale of our securities. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , we received
net proceeds of approximately 9 .0 million from such sales and as of September 30, 2024 , our cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities totaled 13.2 million. 
 Based on our current assessment, reduction in net loss and current cash position, we believe we will be able to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure
requirements, as currently planned, for at least the next 12 months from the
date the accompanying financial statements are issued. We therefore
believe that the previously disclosed substantial doubt about our ability to
continue as a going concern is alleviated. There remain significant risks and
uncertainties regarding our business, financial condition and results of
operations. Our future capital requirements are difficult to forecast and will
depend on many factors that are out of our control. If we are unable to achieve
our planned operating results or maintain sufficient financial resources, including through potential cash flow from operations or supplemental access to third-party debt, equity or hybrid capital, our
business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and
adversely affected. 
 On
January 18, 2022, we filed a Form S- 3 registration statement, or the 2022 Shelf Registration Statement, with the SEC, for
the issuance of common stock, preferred stock, warrants, rights, debt
securities and units, which we refer to collectively as the Shelf Securities,
up to an aggregate amount of 75.0 million. The 2022 Shelf Registration Statement was declared
effective on January 25, 2022. The proposed maximum offering price per unit and
the proposed maximum aggregate offering price per class of Shelf Security will be
determined from time to time by us in connection with the issuance by us of the Shelf Securities . Until such time
as the aggregate market value of our securities held by non-affiliates equals
or exceeds 75.0 million, the
aggregate maximum offering price of all Shelf Securities issued by us in any given 12 -calendar month period pursuant to the 2022
Shelf Registration Statement (or any successor registration statement on Form
S-3) may not exceed one -third of the
aggregate market value of our securities held by non-affiliates. As of September 30, 2024 , we had approximately 11.6 million available of unused capacity under the
2022 Shelf Registration Statement, subject to the one-third limit. If our public float increases, we will have
additional availability under such limit, and if our public float increases to
 75.0 million or more, such one-third limit will terminate. There can be no
assurance that our public float will increase. that we will no longer be
subject to such limitation, that such limitation may not reapply after
termination under applicable SEC rules, or that the 2022 Shelf Registration
Statement will allow us to raise additional capital in a timely manner, on
acceptable terms, or at all.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

 We develop our products in the United Sta tes and sell those products int o several countries. As a result, our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets. Most of our sales in Europe are denominate d in British Pound Sterling and our license agreement with Teijin Limited is denominated in Japanese Yen. As our sales in currencies other than the U.S. dollar increase, our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations may increase. In addition, changes in exchange rates also may affect the end-user prices of our products compared to those of our foreign competitors, who may be selling their products based on local currency pricing. These factors may make our products less competitive in some countries. 

 If the U.S. dollar uniformly increased or decreased in strength by 10 relative to the foreign currencies in which our sales were denominated, our net income would have correspondingly increased or decreased by an immaterial amount for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 . 

 Our exposure to market interest rate risk is confined to our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities. The goals of our investment policy are preservation of capital, fulfillment of liquidity needs and fiduciary control of cash and investments. We also seek to maximize income from our investments without assuming significant risk. To achieve our goals, we may maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in a variety of securities of high credit quality. The securities in our investment portfolio, if any, are not leveraged, are classified as available for sale and are, due to their very short-term nature, subject to minimal interest rate risk. We currently do not hedge interest rate exp osure. Because of the short-term maturities of our cash equivalents, we do not believe that an increase in market rates would have any material negative impact on interest income recognized in our statement of operations. We have no investments denominated in foreign currencies and therefore our investments are not subject to foreign currency exchange risk. We contract with investigational sites, suppliers and other vendors in Europe and internationally. In addition, our license agreement requires payments to us to be denominated in Japanese Yen. We are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency rates in connection with these agreements. We do not hedge our foreign currency exchange rate risk. 

 All of the potential changes noted above are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position as of September 30, 2024 .

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to us, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decision making regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, as ours are designed to do, and we apply our judgment in evaluating whether the benefits of the controls and procedures that we adopt outweigh their costs. 
 As required by Rule 13a-15(b) of the Exchange Act, an evaluation as of September 30, 2024 was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures, as of September 30, 2024 were effective and remediated the material weakness described below. 
 Management's Report in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 During October 2023, a vendor notified us that it had not received a payment we made via wire transfer based on instructions the Company believed were sent by the vendor. Our internal controls over vendor management, as designed, would not have timely prevented an unauthorized payment based on incorrect vendor information from occurring. As such, the Company has concluded that a material weakness existed in its internal controls over financial reporting. This material weakness did not result in any identified misstatement, and there were no changes to previously reported financial results. 
 Remediation Plan for the Material Weakness 
 In 2024, management has implemented measures designed to ensure that the control deficiencies that contributed to the material weakness were remediated, such that these controls are designed, implemented, and operating effectively. 
 Remediation efforts included but are not limited to (a) enhance processes and procedures around payment security, (b) verifying changes to vendor information on a timely basis, and (c) using alternate channels to verify changes to vendor payment information. 
 As of the three months ended September 30, 2024, management has completed its testing and evaluation of the implementation of internal controls and revised processes and has concluded that the material weakness has been remediated and will provide reasonable assurance that they will prevent or detect a material error in our financial statements. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 Except as described above, there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act, that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.

 shall be the exclusive means for a stockholder to make nominations and submit
 other business (other than matters properly included in the corporation s
 notice of meeting of stockholders and proxy statement under Rule 14a-8 under
 the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the 1934 Act ), and the rules

 and (5) such other information concerning such nominee as would be required to
 be disclosed in a proxy statement soliciting proxies for the election of such
 nominee as a director in an election contest (even if an election contest is
 not involved), or that is otherwise required to be disclosed pursuant to

 (including such person s written consent to being named as a nominee and to
 serving as a director if elected); (B) a representation that the stockholder or
 Proponent (as defined below), if any, will or is part of a group that will (1)
 solicit proxies from holders of the corporation s outstanding capital stock
 representing at least 67 of the voting power of shares of capital stock
 entitled to vote on the election of directors, (2) include a statement to that
 effect in its proxy statement and/or its form of proxy, (3) otherwise comply

 Guidelines; and (D) the information required by Sections 5(b)(4) and 5(b)(5). The corporation may require any proposed
 nominee to furnish such other information as it may reasonably require to

 stockholder s understanding of the independence, or lack thereof, of such
 proposed nominee. 
 (2) 
 Other
 than proposals sought to be included in the corporation s proxy materials
 pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the 1934 Act, for business other than nominations

 stockholder proposes to bring before the meeting, a brief description of the
 business desired to be brought before the meeting, the reasons for conducting
 such business at the meeting, and any material interest (including any
 anticipated benefit of such business to any Proponent other than solely as a
 result of its ownership of the corporation s capital stock, that is material to
 any Proponent individually, or to the Proponents in the aggregate) in such
 business of any Proponent; and (B) the information required by Sections 5(b)(4)
 and 5(b)(5).

 stockholder to be timely must be so received not earlier than the close of
 business on the one hundred twentieth (120th) day prior to such annual meeting
 and not later than the close of business on the later of the ninetieth (90th)

 notice as described above. 

2

 (d) 
 Notwithstanding
 anything in Section 5(b)(3) to the contrary, in the event that the number of

 appointment was made, of the vacancy in such class, made by the corporation at
 least ten (10) days before the last day a stockholder may deliver a notice of
 nomination in accordance with Section 5(b)(3), a stockholder s notice required
 by this Section 5 and which complies with the requirements in Section 5(b)(1),
 other than the timing requirements in Section 5(b)(3), shall also be considered
 timely, but only with respect to nominees for any new positions in such
 Expiring Class created by such increase, if it shall be received by the
 Secretary at the principal executive offices of the corporation not later than
 the close of business on the tenth (10th) day following the day on which such
 public announcement is first made by the corporation. For purposes of this section, an Expiring
 Class shall mean a class of directors whose term shall expire at the

3 

(e) 
 A
 person shall not be eligible for election or re-election as a director unless
 the person is nominated either in accordance with clause (ii) of Section 5(a),
 or in accordance with clause (iii) of Section 5(a). Except as otherwise required by law, the
 chairperson of the meeting shall have the power and duty to determine whether a
 nomination or any business proposed to be brought before the meeting was made,
 or proposed, as the case may be, in accordance with the procedures set forth in
 these Bylaws and, if any proposed nomination or business is not in compliance
 with these Bylaws, or the Proponent does not act in accordance with the
 representations in Sections 5(b)(4)(D) and 5(b)(4)(E), to declare that such
 proposal or nomination shall not be presented for stockholder action at the
 meeting and shall be disregarded, notwithstanding that proxies in respect of
 such nominations or such business may have been solicited or received. 
 
 (f) 
 Notwithstanding

 (d) 
 Notwithstanding
 the foregoing provisions of this Section 6, a stockholder must also comply with

 thereunder with respect to matters set forth in this Section 6. Nothing in these Bylaws shall be deemed to
 affect any rights of stockholders to request inclusion of proposals in the

 by such person, either before or after such meeting, and will be waived by any
 stockholder by his, her or its attendance thereat in person, by remote
 communication, if applicable, or by proxy, except when the stockholder attends
 a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the
 meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully
 called or convened. Any stockholder so
 waiving notice of such meeting shall be bound by the proceedings of any such
 meeting in all respects as if due notice thereof had been given.

Section 8. 
 
 Section 8. Quorum. At all meetings of stockholders, except where
 otherwise provided by statute or by the Certificate of Incorporation, or by
 these Bylaws, the presence, in person, by remote communication, if applicable,
 or by proxy duly authorized, of the holders of one-third of the voting power of
 the outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote shall constitute a quorum for
 the transaction of business. In the
 absence of a quorum, any meeting of stockholders may be adjourned, from time to
 time, either by the chairperson of the meeting or by vote of the holders of a
 majority of the voting power of the shares represented thereat, but no other
 business shall be transacted at such meeting. The stockholders present at a duly called or convened meeting, at which
 a quorum is present, may continue to transact business until adjournment,
 notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough stockholders to leave less than a
 quorum. Except as otherwise provided by statute
 or by applicable stock exchange rules, or by the Certificate of Incorporation
 or these Bylaws, in all matters other than the election of directors, the
 affirmative vote of the majority of the voting power of the shares present in
 person, by remote communication, if applicable, or represented by proxy at a
 duly constituted meeting and entitled to vote generally on the subject matter
 shall be the act of the stockholders. Except as otherwise provided by statute or by applicable stock exchange
 rules, the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, directors shall be
 elected by a plurality of the votes of the shares present in person, by remote
 communication, if applicable, or represented by proxy at a duly constituted
 meeting and entitled to vote generally on the election of directors. Where a separate vote by a class or classes
 or series is required, except where otherwise provided by statute, or by
 applicable stock exchange rules, or by the Certificate of Incorporation or
 these Bylaws, one-third of the voting power of the outstanding shares of such
 class or classes or series, present in person, by remote communication, if
 applicable, or represented by proxy duly authorized, shall constitute a quorum
 entitled to take action with respect to that vote on that matter. Except where otherwise provided by statute or
 by applicable stock exchange rules or by the Certificate of Incorporation or
 these Bylaws, the affirmative vote of the majority (plurality, in the case of
 the election of directors) of shares of such class or classes or series present
 in person, by remote communication, if applicable, or represented by proxy at a
 duly constituted meeting shall be the act of such class or classes or series. 
 Section 9. Adjournment and Notice of Adjourned Meetings. Any meeting of stockholders, whether annual
 or special, may be adjourned from time to time either by the chairperson of the
 meeting or by the vote of a majority of the voting power of the shares present
 in person, by remote communication, if applicable, or represented by proxy at
 the meeting, although less than a quorum. When a meeting is adjourned to another time or place, if any, notice
 need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time and place, if any,
 thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken. At the adjourned meeting, the corporation may
 transact any business which might have been transacted at the original
 meeting. If the adjournment is for more
 than thirty (30) days or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed
 for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to
 each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting. 

 Section 10. Voting Rights. For the purpose of determining those
 stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of the stockholders, except as
 otherwise provided by law, only persons in whose names shares stand on the
 stock records of the corporation on the record date, as provided in Section 12
 of these Bylaws, shall be entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders. Every person entitled to vote shall have the
 right to do so either in person, by remote communication, if applicable, or by
 an agent or agents authorized by a proxy granted in accordance with Delaware
 law. An agent so appointed need not be a
 stockholder. No proxy shall be voted
 after three (3) years from its date of creation unless the proxy provides for a
 longer period. 

 Section 11. Section 11. Joint Owners of Stock . If shares or other securities having voting
 power stand of record in the names of two (2) or more persons, whether
 fiduciaries, members of a partnership, joint tenants, tenants in common,
 tenants by the entirety, or otherwise, or if two (2) or more persons have the
 same fiduciary relationship respecting the same shares, unless the Secretary is
 given written notice to the contrary and is furnished with a copy of the
 instrument or order appointing them or creating the relationship wherein it is
 so provided, their acts with respect to voting shall have the following effect:
 (a) if only one (1) votes, his or her act binds all; (b) if more than one (1)
 votes, the act of the majority so voting binds all; (c) if more than one (1)
 votes, but the vote is evenly split on any particular matter, each faction may
 vote the securities in question proportionally, or may apply to the Delaware
 Court of Chancery for relief as provided in the DGCL, Section 217(b). If the instrument filed with the Secretary
 shows that any such tenancy is held in unequal interests, a majority or
 even-split for the purpose of subsection (c) shall be a majority or even-split
 in interest. 
 
 Section 12. List of Stockholders. The Secretary shall prepare and make, at
 least ten (10) days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of
 the stockholders entitled to vote at said meeting, arranged in alphabetical
 order, showing the address of each stockholder and the number and class of
 shares registered in the name of each stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of
 any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, (a) on a reasonably
 accessible electronic network, provided that the information required to gain
 access to such list is provided with the notice of the meeting, or (b) during
 ordinary business hours, at the principal place of business of the
 corporation. In the event that the
 corporation determines to make the list available on an electronic network, the
 corporation may take reasonable steps to ensure that such information is
 available only to stockholders of the corporation. The list shall be open to examination of any
 stockholder during the time of the meeting as provided by law. 
 
 Section 13. Action without Meeting. No action shall be taken by the stockholders
 except at an annual or special meeting of stockholders called in accordance
 with these Bylaws, and no action shall be taken by the stockholders by written
 consent or by electronic transmission.

 if a Chairperson has not been appointed or is absent, the President, or, if the
 President is absent, a chairperson of the meeting chosen by a majority in
 interest of the stockholders entitled to vote, present in person or by proxy,
 shall act as chairperson. The Secretary,
 or, in his or her absence, an Assistant Secretary directed to do so by the
 President, shall act as secretary of the meeting.

ARTICLE IV 
 
 DIRECTORS 

Section 15. Number and Term of Office. The authorized number of directors of the
 corporation shall be fixed in accordance with the Certificate of
 Incorporation. Directors need not be
 stockholders unless so required by the Certificate of Incorporation. If for any cause, the directors shall not
 have been elected at an annual meeting, they may be elected as soon thereafter
 as convenient at a special meeting of the stockholders called for that purpose
 in the manner provided in these Bylaws. 

Section 16. Powers. The powers of the corporation shall be
 exercised, its business conducted and its property controlled by the Board of
 Directors, except as may be otherwise provided by statute or by the Certificate
 of Incorporation. 

Section 17. Classes of Directors. Effective immediately following the closing
 of the initial public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement
 under the 1933 Act, covering the offer and sale of the Corporation s common
 stock to the public (the " Initial Public Offering ") the
 directors shall be divided into three classes as nearly equal in number as
 practicable, hereby designated as Class I, Class II and Class III,
 respectively. The Board of Directors is
 authorized to assign members of the Board of Directors already in office to
 such classes at the time the initial classification becomes effective. The term of office of the initial Class I
 directors shall expire upon the election of directors at the first annual
 meeting of stockholders following the closing of the Initial Public Offering;
 the term of office of the initial Class II directors shall expire upon the
 election of directors at the second annual meeting of stockholders following
 the closing of the Initial Public Offering; and the term of office of the
 initial Class III directors shall expire upon the election of directors at the
 third annual meeting of stockholders following the closing of the Initial
 Public Offering. At each annual meeting of stockholders, commencing with the
 first annual meeting of stockholders following the closing of the Initial
 Public Offering, each of the successors elected to replace the directors of a
 class whose term shall have expired at such annual meeting shall be elected to
 hold office until the third annual meeting of stockholders next succeeding his
 or her election and until his or her respective successor shall have been duly
 elected and qualified. Subject to the
 rights of holders of any outstanding series of Preferred Stock with respect to
 the election of directors, if the number of directors that constitutes the
 Board of Directors is changed, any newly created directorships or decrease in
 directorships shall be so apportioned by the Board of Directors among the
 classes as to make all classes as nearly equal in number as is practicable,
 provided that no decrease in the number of directors constituting the Board of
 Directors shall shorten the term of any incumbent director. Notwithstanding the
 foregoing provisions of this paragraph, and subject to the rights of holders of
 any series of Preferred Stock with respect to the election of directors, each
 director shall serve until such director s successor is duly elected and
 qualified or until such director s earlier death, resignation or removal. 

7 

Section 18. Vacancies. Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate
 of Incorporation, and subject to the rights of the holders of any series of
 Preferred Stock, any vacancies on the Board of Directors resulting from death,
 resignation, disqualification, removal or other causes and any newly created
 directorships resulting from any increase in the number of directors shall,
 unless the Board of Directors determines by resolution that any such vacancies
 or newly created directorships shall be filled by stockholders, be filled only
 by the affirmative vote of a majority of the directors then in office, even
 though less than a quorum of the Board of Directors, or by a sole remaining
 director, and not by the stockholders, provided,
 however , that whenever the holders of any class or classes of stock or
 series thereof are entitled to elect one or more directors by the provisions of
 the Certificate of Incorporation, vacancies and newly created directorships of
 such class or classes or series shall, unless the Board of Directors determines
 by resolution that any such vacancies or newly created directorships shall be
 filled by stockholders, be filled by a majority of the directors elected by
 such class or classes or series thereof then in office, or by a sole remaining
 director so elected, and not by the stockholders. Any director elected in accordance with the
 preceding sentence shall hold office for the remainder of the full term of the
 director for which the vacancy was created or occurred and until such
 director s successor shall have been elected and qualified. A vacancy in the Board of Directors shall be
 deemed to exist under this Bylaw in the case of the death, removal or
 resignation of any director. 

Section 19. Resignation. Any director may resign at any time by
 delivering his or her notice in writing or by electronic transmission to the
 Secretary, such resignation to specify whether it will be effective at a
 particular time. If no such
 specification is made, the resignation shall be deemed effective at the time of
 delivery of the resignation to the Secretary. When one or more directors shall resign from the Board of Directors,
 effective at a future date, a majority of the directors then in office,
 including those who have so resigned, shall have power to fill such vacancy or
 vacancies, the vote thereon to take effect when such resignation or
 resignations shall become effective, and each director so chosen shall hold
 office for the unexpired portion of the term of the director whose place shall
 be vacated and until his or her successor shall have been duly elected and
 qualified. 

 Section 20. Removal.

 Subject
 to the rights of holders of any series of Preferred Stock to elect additional
 directors under specified circumstances, neither the Board of Directors nor any
 individual director may be removed without cause. 
 (b)

 to any limitation imposed by law, any individual director or directors may be
 removed with cause by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least sixty-six
 and two-thirds percent (66 2/3 of the voting power of all then outstanding
 shares of capital stock of the corporation entitled to vote generally at an
 election of directors, voting together as a single class.

 convened. 

8 

(e) 
 Waiver
 of Notice. The transaction of all
 business at any meeting of the Board of Directors, or any committee thereof,
 however called or noticed, or wherever held, shall be as valid as though it had
 been transacted at a meeting duly held after regular call and notice, if a
 quorum be present and if, either before or after the meeting, each of the
 directors not present who did not receive notice shall sign a written waiver of
 notice or shall waive notice by electronic transmission. All such waivers shall be filed with the
 corporate records or made a part of the minutes of the meeting. 
 Section 22. Quorum and Voting. 

 (a) 
 Unless
 the Certificate of Incorporation requires a greater number, and except with
 respect to questions related to indemnification arising under Section 44 for
 which a quorum shall be one-third of the exact number of directors fixed from
 time to time, a quorum of the Board of Directors shall consist of a majority of
 the exact number of directors fixed from time to time by the Board of Directors
 in accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation; provided, however , at any meeting whether a quorum be present or
 otherwise, a majority of the directors present may adjourn from time to time
 until the time fixed for the next regular meeting of the Board of Directors,
 without notice other than by announcement at the meeting. 
 (b) 
 At
 each meeting of the Board of Directors at which a quorum is present, all
 questions and business shall be determined by the affirmative vote of a
 majority of the directors present, unless a different vote be required by law,
 the Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws. 

Section 23. Action without Meeting . Unless otherwise restricted by the
 Certificate of Incorporation or these Bylaws, any action required or permitted
 to be taken at any meeting of the Board of Directors or of any committee
 thereof may be taken without a meeting, if all members of the Board of
 Directors or committee, as the case may be, consent thereto in writing or by
 electronic transmission, and such writing or writings or transmission or
 transmissions are filed with the minutes of proceedings of the Board of
 Directors or committee. Such filing
 shall be in paper form if the minutes are maintained in paper form and shall be
 in electronic form if the minutes are maintained in electronic form. 
 
 Section 24. Fees and Compensation . Directors shall be entitled to such
 compensation for their services as may be approved by the Board of Directors,
 including, if so approved, by resolution of the Board of Directors, a fixed sum
 and expenses of attendance, if any, for attendance at each regular or special

 Board of Directors. Nothing herein
 contained shall be construed to preclude any director from serving the
 corporation in any other capacity as an officer, agent, employee, or otherwise
 and receiving compensation therefor. Directors need not be stockholders of the Corporation. No person shall qualify for service as a
 director of the Corporation if he or she is a party to any compensatory,

 her employer (not entered into in contemplation of the employer s investment in
 the Corporation or such employee s candidacy as a director) shall not be
 disqualifying under this Section 24; and provided, further, that agreements,
 arrangements, understandings, compensation or other payments in connection with
 candidacy or service as a director of the Corporation shall not be

 Corporation and that the director is free of any other relationship (with the Corporation
 and its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively, the " Company ") or any
 stockholder or otherwise) that would interfere with the exercise of independent

 INDEMNIFICATION 

 Section 44. Indemnification of Directors, Executive
 Officers, Other Officers, Employees and Other Agents . 

(a) (a) Directors and Executive Officers . The corporation shall indemnify its directors
 and executive officers (for the purposes of this Article XI, executive
 officers shall have the meaning defined in Rule 3b-7 promulgated under
 the 1934 Act) to the fullest extent not prohibited by the DGCL or any other
 applicable law; provided, however ,
 that the corporation may modify the extent of such indemnification by
 individual contracts with its directors and executive officers; and, provided,
 further, that the corporation shall not be required to indemnify any director
 or executive officer in connection with any proceeding (or part thereof)
 initiated by such person unless (i) such indemnification is expressly required
 to be made by law, (ii) the proceeding was authorized by the Board of Directors
 of the corporation, (iii) such indemnification is provided by the corporation,
 in its sole discretion, pursuant to the powers vested in the corporation under
 the DGCL or any other applicable law or (iv) such indemnification is required
 to be made under subsection (d). 
 
 (b) (b) Other Officers, Employees and Other Agents . The corporation shall have power to indemnify
 its non-executive officers, employees and other agents as set forth in the DGCL
 or any other applicable law. The Board
 of Directors shall have the power to delegate responsibility for determining
 whether any such non-executive officer, employee or other agent shall be given
 indemnification to such person or persons as the Board of Directors may
 designate. 
 
 (c) (c) Expenses . The corporation shall advance to any person
 who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened,
 pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
 administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that he is or was a
 director or executive officer of the corporation, or is or was serving at the
 request of the corporation as a director or executive officer of another
 corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, prior to
 the final disposition of the proceeding, promptly following request therefor,
 all expenses incurred by any director or executive officer in connection with
 such proceeding; provided, however ,
 that, if the DGCL requires, an advancement of expenses incurred by a director
 or executive officer in his or her capacity as a director or executive officer
 (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such
 indemnitee, including, without limitation, service to an employee benefit plan)
 shall be made only upon delivery to the corporation of an undertaking
 (hereinafter an " undertaking "), by or on behalf
 of such indemnitee, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be
 determined by final judicial decision (hereinafter a " final adjudication ")
 from which there is no further right to appeal that such indemnitee is not
 entitled to be indemnified for such expenses under this section or otherwise. 
 
 (d) (d) Enforcement . Without the necessity of entering into an
 express contract, all rights to indemnification and advances to directors and
 executive officers under this Bylaw shall be deemed to be contractual rights
 and be effective to the same extent and as if provided for in a contract
 between the corporation and the director or executive officer, as
 applicable. Any right to indemnification
 or advances granted by this Bylaw to a director or executive officer shall be
 enforceable by or on behalf of the person holding such right in any court of
 competent jurisdiction if (i) the claim for indemnification or advances is
 denied, in whole or in part, or (ii) no disposition of such claim is made
 within ninety (90) days of request therefor. 
 To the extent permitted by law, the claimant in such enforcement action,
 if successful in whole or in part, shall be entitled to be paid also the
 expense of prosecuting the claim. In
 connection with any claim for indemnification, the corporation shall be
 entitled to raise as a defense to any such action that the claimant has not met
 the standards of conduct that make it permissible under the DGCL or any other
 applicable law for the corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount
 claimed. Neither the failure of the
 corporation (including its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel or its
 stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such
 action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because
 he has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the DGCL or any
 other applicable law, nor an actual determination by the corporation (including
 its Board of Directors, independent legal counsel or its stockholders) that the
 claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to
 the action or create a presumption that claimant has not met the applicable
 standard of conduct. In any suit brought
 by a director or executive officer to enforce a right to indemnification or to
 an advancement of expenses hereunder, the burden of proving that the director
 or executive officer is not entitled to be indemnified, or to such advancement
 of expenses, under this section or otherwise shall be on the corporation. 
 
 (e) (e) Non-Exclusivity of Rights. The rights conferred on any person by this
 Bylaw shall not be exclusive of any other right which such person may have or
 hereafter acquire under any applicable statute, provision of the Certificate of
 Incorporation, Bylaws, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested
 directors or otherwise, both as to action in his or her official capacity and
 as to action in another capacity while holding office. The corporation is specifically authorized to
 enter into individual contracts with any or all of its directors, officers,
 employees or agents respecting indemnification and advances, to the fullest
 extent not prohibited by the DGCL, or by any other applicable law. 

15 

(f) Survival of Rights . The rights conferred on any person by this
 Bylaw shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director, officer,
 employee or other agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors
 and administrators of such a person. 
 
 (g) (g) Insurance . To the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL
 or any other applicable law, the corporation, upon approval by the Board of
 Directors, may purchase insurance on behalf of any person required or permitted
 to be indemnified pursuant to this section. 
 
 (h) (h) Amendments . Any repeal or modification of this section
 shall only be prospective and shall not affect the rights under this Bylaw in
 effect at the time of the alleged occurrence of any action or omission to act
 that is the cause of any proceeding against any agent of the corporation. 
 
 (i) (i) Saving Clause . If this Bylaw or any portion hereof shall be
 invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the
 corporation shall nevertheless indemnify each director and executive officer to
 the full extent not prohibited by any applicable portion of this section that
 shall not have been invalidated, or by any other applicable law. If this section shall be invalid due to the
 application of the indemnification provisions of another jurisdiction, then the
 corporation shall indemnify each director and executive officer to the full
 extent under any other applicable law. 
 
 (j) (j) Certain Definitions . For the purposes of this Bylaw, the following
 definitions shall apply: 
 (1)
