million of revolving credit commitments and matures in December of 2026 . The credit facility includes an expansion feature that permits the Company to increase the revolving credit commitments in an aggregate principal amount up to million, subject to approval by the administrative agent and certain customary terms and conditions. The credit facility contains certain customary restrictive loan covenants, including among others, financial covenants that apply a maximum leverage ratio, minimum interest coverage ratio, and maximum annual capital expenditures. The negative covenants limit, subject to various exceptions, the Company s ability to incur additional indebtedness, create liens on assets, merge, consolidate, liquidate or dissolve any part of the Company, sell assets, change fiscal year, or enter into certain transactions with affiliates and subsidiaries. The Company was in full compliance with the covenants as of September 30, 2024. The Company may voluntarily prepay revolving loans under the credit facility at any time and from time to time, without premium or penalty. No interim amortization payments are required to be made under the credit facility. The credit facility provided that once LIBOR ceased to exist in 2023, the benchmark rate for the loans outstanding automatically transferred from LIBOR to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR). In April 2023, the Company executed a second amendment to the credit facility to facilitate the conversion from LIBOR to SOFR and to set the base interest rate at SOFR plus 10 basis points. Up to million of the credit facility is available for the issuance of letters of credit, and any drawings under the letters of credit must be reimbursed within one business day. As of September 30, 2024, million in lett ers of credit were issued under the credit facility. Outstanding Borrowings 

The contractual annualized interest rate as of September 30, 2024 was .

During the nine months ended September 30, 2023 , the Company recorded ROU asset impairments of million related to closing the 10th floor of its offices located in San Francisco and one other smaller office location . The impairments are included in restructuring and related costs in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. As a result of the impairments, the ROU assets were required to be recorded at their estimated fair values as Level 3 non-financial assets. The fair values of the asset groups were determined using a discounted cash flow model, which required the use of estimates, including projected cash flows for the related assets, the selection of a discount rate used in the model, and regional real estate industry data.

(1) Revenue location is determined based on where the products and services are consumed. 

Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable includes amounts billed and currently due from customers. Since the only condition for payment of the Company s invoices is the passage of time, a receivable is recorded on the date an invoice is issued. Also included in accounts receivable are unbilled amounts resulting from revenue exceeding the amount billed to the customer, where the right to payment is unconditional. If the right to payment for services performed was conditional on something other than the passage of time, the unbilled amount would be recorded as a separate contract asset. There were contract assets as of September 30, 2024 or 2023. The majority of the Company s contracts are non-cancelable. However, for contracts that are cancelable by the customer, the Company does not record a receivable when it issues an invoice. The Company records accounts receivable on these contracts only up to the amount of revenue earned but not yet collected. In addition, since the majority of the Company s contracts are invoiced for annual periods, and payment is expected within from the transfer of products and services, the Company does not adjust its receivables or transaction prices for the effects of a significant financing component. Deferred Revenue The Company refers to contract liabilities as deferred revenue in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Payment terms in the Company s customer contracts vary, but generally require payment in advance of fully satisfying the performance obligation(s). Deferred revenue consists of billings in excess of revenue recognized. Similar to accounts receivable, the Company does not record deferred revenue for unpaid invoices issued on a cancelable contract. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recogniz ed m illion and million of revenue, respectively, related to its deferred revenue balance at the beginning of each such period. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recogn ized million and million of revenue, respectively, related to its deferred revenue balance at January 1 of each such period. Approxima tely million o f revenue is expected to be recognized during the next from remaining performance obligations as of September 30, 2024.

Provision for expected credit losses 

Write-offs 

() 

Balance at September 30, 2024 

When evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for expected credit losses, the Company makes judgments regarding the collectability of accounts receivable based, in part, on the Company s historical loss rate experience, customer concentrations, management s expectations of future losses as informed by current economic conditions, and changes in customer payment terms. If the expected financial condition of the Company s customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. If the expected financial condition of the Company s customers were to improve, the allowances may be reduced accordingly. Cost to Obtain Contracts The Company capitalizes commissions paid to sales representatives and related fringe benefits costs that are incremental to obtaining customer contracts. These costs are included in deferred commissions in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company accounts for these costs at a portfolio level as the Company s contracts are similar in nature and the amortization model used closely matches the amortization expense that would be recognized on a contract-by-contract basis. Costs to obtain a contract are amortized to earnings over the initial contract term, which is the same period the related revenue is recognized. Amortization expense related to deferred commissions for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 wa s mil lion and million, re spectively. Amortization expense related to deferred commissions for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 wa s m illion and million, respectively. The Company evaluates the recoverability of deferred commissions at each balance sheet date and there were impairments recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 .

segments: Research, Consulting, and Events. These segments, which are also the Company's reportable segments, are based on the management structure of the Company and how the chief operating decision maker uses financial information to evaluate performance and determine how to allocate resources. The Company s products and services are delivered through each segment as described below. The Research segment includes the revenues from all of the Company s research products as well as consulting revenues primarily from advisory services (such as speeches and advisory days) delivered by the Company s research organization. Research segment costs include the cost of the organizations responsible for developing and delivering these products in addition to the costs of the product management organization responsible for product pricing and packaging, and the launch of new products. During the third quarter of 2024, the Company realigned the reporting structure of its technology teams and as such certain technology costs are no longer reported within the Research segment, and are now reported within the line selling, marketing, administrative and other expenses. Prior period amounts have been recast to conform to the current presentation. The Consulting segment includes the revenues and the related costs of the Company s project consulting organization. The project consulting organization delivers a majority of the Company s project consulting revenue. The Events segment includes the revenues and the costs of the organization responsible for developing and hosting the Company's events. The Company evaluates reportable segment performance and allocates resources based on segment revenues and expenses. Segment expenses include the direct expenses of each segment organization and exclude selling and marketing expenses, general and administrative expenses, stock-based compensation expense, depreciation expense, adjustments to incentive bonus compensation from target amounts, amortization of intangible assets, restructuring and related costs, loss from sale of divested operation, interest expense, and other income. The accounting policies used by the segments are the same as those used in the consolidated financial statements.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS O F FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 Overview 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Words such as expects, believes, anticipates, intends, plans, estimates, or similar expressions are intended to identify these forward-looking statements. Reference is made in particular to our statements about changing stakeholder expectations, migration of our clients into our Forrester Decisions products, product development, holding hybrid events, possible acquisitions, future dividends, future share repurchases, future growth rates, operating income and cash from operations, future deferred revenue, future compliance with financial covenants under our credit facility, future interest expense, anticipated increases in, and productivity of, our sales force and headcount, the adequacy of our cash, and cash flows to satisfy our working capital and capital expenditures, and the anticipated impact of accounting standards. These statements are based on our current plans and expectations and involve risks and uncertainties. Important factors that could cause actual future activities and results to differ include, among others, our ability to retain and enrich subscriptions to, and licenses of, our Research products and services, our ability to fulfill existing or generate new consulting engagements and advisory services, our ability to generate and increase demand for the Events we host, any adverse economic conditions that result in a reduction in technology spending or demand for our products and services, our international operations expose us to a variety of operational risks which could negatively impact us, our ability to offer new products and services, the use of Generative AI in our business and by our clients and competitors, our dependence on key personnel, our ability to attract and retain qualified professional staff, our ability to respond to business and economic conditions and market trends, the impact of our outstanding debt, competition and industry consolidation, possible variations in our quarterly operating results, concentration of our stock ownership, the possibility of network disruptions and security breaches, our ability to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights, compliance with privacy laws, taxation risks, and any weakness identified in our system of internal controls. These risks are described more completely in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. We undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. 
 We derive revenues from subscriptions to our Research products and services, licensing electronic reprints of our Research, performing consulting projects and advisory services, and hosting events. We offer contracts for our Research products as either multi-year contracts or annual contracts, which are typically payable in advance on an annual basis. Subscription products are recognized as revenue over the term of the contract. Accordingly, a substantial portion of our billings are initially recorded as deferred revenue. Reprints include an obligation to deliver a customer-selected research document and certain usage data provided through an on-line platform, which represents two performance obligations. We recognize revenue for the performance obligation for the data portion of the reprint ratably over the license term. We recognize revenue for the performance obligation for the research document at the time of providing access to the document. Billings for licensing of reprints are initially recorded as deferred revenue. Clients purchase consulting projects and advisory services independently and/or to supplement their access to our subscription-based products. Consulting project revenues, which are based upon fixed-fee agreements, are recognized as the services are provided. Advisory service revenues, such as speeches and advisory days, are recognized when the service is complete or the customer receives the agreed upon deliverable. Billings attributable to consulting projects and advisory services are initially recorded as deferred revenue. Events revenues consist of ticket and sponsorship sales for a Forrester-hosted event. Billings for events are also initially recorded as deferred revenue and are recognized as revenue upon completion of each event. 
 Our primary operating expenses consist of cost of services and fulfillment, selling and marketing expenses, and general and administrative expenses. Cost of services and fulfillment represents the costs associated with the production and delivery of our products and services, including salaries, bonuses, employee benefits, and stock-based compensation expense for all personnel that produce and deliver our products and services, including all associated editorial, travel, and support services. Selling and marketing expenses include salaries, sales commissions, bonuses, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, travel expenses, promotional costs, and other costs incurred in marketing and selling our products and services. General and administrative expenses include the costs of the technology, operations, finance, and human resources groups and our other administrative functions, including salaries, bonuses, employee benefits, and stock-based compensation expense. Overhead costs such as facilities, net of sublease income, and annual fees for cloud-based information technology systems are allocated to these categories according to the number of employees in each group. 
 Our key metrics focus on our contract value ("CV") products. We are focusing on CV products as these products are our most profitable products and historically our contracts for CV products have renewed at high rates (as measured by our client retention and wallet retention metrics). 
 22 

We calculate CV at the foreign currency rates used for internal planning purposes each year. For comparative purposes, we have recast historical CV and wallet retention at the current year foreign currency rates and using the updated methodology as described on the investor relations section of our website. In addition, due to the divestiture of the FeedbackNow product line in the third quarter of 2024, we have recast our historical metrics to exclude FeedbackNow products and clients. We have included the recast metrics below for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and we have also provided recast metrics dating back to the third quarter of 2022, on the investor relations section of our website. 
 Contract value, client retention, wallet retention, and number of clients are metrics that we believe are important to understanding our research business. We define these metrics as follows: 
 Contract value (CV) is defined as the value attributable to all of our recurring research-related contracts. Contract value is calculated as the annualized value of all contracts in effect at a specific point in time, without regard to how much revenue has already been recognized. Contract value primarily consists of subscription-based products for which revenue is recognized on a ratable basis, except for the entitlements embedded in our subscription products, such as event tickets and advisory sessions, for which the revenue is recognized when the item is delivered. Contract value also includes our reprint products, as these products are used throughout the year by our clients and are typically renewed. 

Client retention represents the percentage of client companies (defined as all clients that buy a CV product) at the prior year measurement date that have active contracts at the current year measurement date. 

Wallet retention represents a measure of the CV we have retained with clients over a twelve-month period, including increases or decreases in retained client CV during the period. Wallet retention is calculated on a percentage basis by dividing the annualized contract value of our current clients, who were also clients a year ago, by the total annualized contract value from a year ago. 

Clients is calculated at the enterprise level as all clients that have an active CV contract. 

Client retention and wallet retention are not necessarily indicative of the rate of future retention of our revenue base. A summary of our key metrics is as follows (dollars in millions):

Contract value at September 30, 2024 decreased by 5 compared to the prior year period due to wallet retention being at 89 for the period (representing retention and enrichment of the prior year CV base) and new client acquisition not fully offsetting the net retention loss. Client retention and wallet retention were both flat at September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period. However, client retention increased by 1 percentage point and wallet retention was flat, compared to the prior quarter. The decrease in the number of clients from the prior year period is primarily attributable to 1) macroeconomic conditions affecting our client base including a) funding and budget pressure on our smaller technology clients and the technology industry in general, and b) the uncertain economic conditions during the past year caused by inflation, high interest rates, and geopolitical turbulence, and 2) the ongoing transition of our client base to our Forrester Decisions product platform that was launched in August 2021. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 78 of our overall CV was in our Forrester Decisions product platform. By the end of 2024, we anticipate that over 80 of our CV will be in our Forrester Decisions product platform. The remaining CV will represent non-Forrester Decisions CV products, primarily reprints, with less than 5 in our heritage research products. The ongoing macroeconomic conditions and product transition are anticipated to continue to pressure our key metrics through 2024. 
 Management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America GAAP ). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including but not limited to, those related to our revenue recognition, goodwill, intangible and other long-lived assets, and income taxes. Management bases its estimates on historical experience, data available at the time the estimates are made, and various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Our critical accounting estimates are described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Research revenues are recognized as revenue primarily on a ratable basis over the term of the contracts, which are generally 12 or 24-month periods. Research revenues decreased 4 and 5 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the prior year periods primarily due to the decrease in CV, as discussed above. From a product perspective, the decrease in revenues was primarily due to a decline in revenue from our reprint product and our other smaller and discontinued products. In addition, revenue from our subscription research products declined 1 and 2 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. 
 Consulting revenues decreased 17 and 21 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the prior year periods. The decrease in revenues during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was due to a decrease in delivery of consulting services due to lower client bookings. 
 Events revenues decreased 54 and 33 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the prior year periods. The decrease in revenues during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was due primarily to a decrease in sponsorship revenues and a decrease in event ticket revenue.

Cost of services and fulfillment expenses decreased 12 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period. The decrease was primarily due to (1) a 4.7 million decrease in compensation and benefit costs due to a decrease in headcount and incentive bonus costs and (2) a 0.9 million decrease in event expenses. 
 Cost of services and fulfillment expenses decreased 9 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period. The decrease was primarily due to (1) a 12.1 million decrease in compensation and benefit costs due to a decrease in headcount and incentive bonus costs, partially offset by an increase in benefit costs (mainly due to a benefit during 2023 resulting from the introduction of the flexible vacation and personal paid time off policy in the United States), (2) a 1.0 million decrease in event expenses, (3) a 0.6 million decrease in professional services costs primarily due to a decrease in contractor costs, and (4) a 0.5 million decrease in facilities costs.

Selling and marketing expenses decreased 4 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period. The decrease was primarily due to a 1.7 million decrease in compensation and benefit costs due to a decrease in headcount, commissions expense, and incentive bonus costs. 
 Selling and marketing expenses decreased 4 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period. The decrease was primarily due to a 5.7 million decrease in compensation and benefit costs due to a decrease in headcount, commissions expense, and incentive bonus costs, partially offset by an increase in benefit costs (mainly due to a benefit during 2023 resulting from the introduction of the flexible vacation and personal paid time off policy in the United States). This decrease was partially offset by a 1.2 million increase in professional services costs primarily due to an increase in consulting fees.

The fluctuation in general and administrative expenses was immaterial during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period. 
 General and administrative expenses decreased 14 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period. The decrease was primarily due to (1) a 5.4 million decrease in legal costs, due primarily to a 4.8 million provision for a legal settlement recorded in 2023 for a wage-related matter and related legal services and (2) a 2.5 million decrease in compensation and benefit costs due to a decrease in headcount and incentive bonus costs, partially offset by an increase in benefit costs (mainly due to a benefit during 2023 resulting from the introduction of the flexible vacation and personal paid time off policy in the United States). These decreases were partially offset by a 0.6 million increase in software costs. 
 Depreciation 
 Depreciation expense decreased by 0.3 million and 0.5 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the prior year periods due to certain software assets becoming fully depreciated. 
 Amortization of Intangible Assets 
 Amortization expense decreased by 0.6 million and 1.7 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the prior year periods due to a decrease in the amortization of trademark and technology intangible assets. 
 Restructuring and Related Costs 
 In May 2023, we implemented a reduction in our workforce of approximately 8 across various geographies and functions to better align our cost structure with our revised revenue outlook for the year, and to streamline our sales and consulting organizations to more efficiently go to market in support of driving contract value growth in the future. We recorded 7.5 million of severance and related costs for this action during the second quarter of 2023. In addition, we closed certain of our smaller offices both inside and outside the U.S. in order to reduce facility costs and better match our facilities to our hybrid work strategy. As a result of closing the offices, we recorded restructuring costs of 2.3 million, which included 1.3 million related to right-of-use asset impairments and accelerated amortization and 0.6 million related to impairments of leasehold improvements. We also incurred 0.7 million in contract termination costs. 
 26 

In February 2024, we implemented a reduction in our workforce of approximately 3 across various geographies and functions to better align our cost structure with the revenue outlook for the year. We recorded 0.7 million of severance and related costs for this action during the fourth quarter of 2023, and 2.8 million during the first quarter of 2024. We recorded a restructuring charge of 3.8 million during the first quarter of 2024 related to closing one floor of our offices in California, of which 3.2 million related to an impairment of a right-of-use asset and 0.6 million related to an impairment of leasehold improvements. We anticipate all of the severance and related costs for this plan to be paid during 2024. 
 During the third quarter of 2024, we recorded an additional restructuring charge of 0.7 million related to closing both floors of our offices located at 150 Spear Street, San Francisco, California, of which 0.4 million related to an impairment of the right-of-use assets and 0.3 million related to an impairment of leasehold improvements. Also during the third quarter of 2024, we recognized 0.2 million of expense from the write-off of foreign currency translation adjustments related to the liquidation of a small foreign operation. 
 Loss From Sale of Divested Operation 
 Loss from sale of divested operation of 1.8 million was attributable to the sale of our FeedbackNow product line in August 2024.

 Interest expense consists of interest on our borrowings. The fluctuation for interest expense was immaterial during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year periods. 
 Other Income, Net 
 Other income, net primarily consists of interest income, gains and losses on foreign currency, and gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts. Other income, net decreased by 0.1 million and increased by 1.1 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the prior year periods. The increase in other income, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to a 1.9 million increase in interest income, partially offset by a 0.9 million increase in foreign currency exchange losses.

The increase in the effective tax rate during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period is primarily due to the following discrete tax items during the nine months ended September 30, 2024: 1) tax expense from the disposition of assets related to the FeedbackNow product line of 3.5 million, 2) tax expense from the settlement of share-based awards of 1.7 million, 3) foreign withholding taxes due to the dissolution of a foreign subsidiary of 0.3 million, and 4) a valuation allowance recorded against non-realizable state NOL carryforwards due to the dissolution of a domestic subsidiary of 0.5 million. However, for the fourth quarter of 2024, we anticipate that our effective tax rate will be approximately 40 , resulting in a full year 2024 effective tax rate in a range of 135 to 270 . 
 Segment Results 
 We operate in three segments: Research, Consulting, and Events. These segments, which are also our reportable segments, are based on our management structure and how management uses financial information to evaluate performance and determine how to allocate resources. Our products and services are delivered through each segment as described below. 
 27 

The Research segment includes the revenues from all of our research products as well as consulting revenues primarily from advisory services (such as speeches and advisory days) delivered by our research organization. Research segment costs include the cost of the organizations responsible for developing and delivering these products in addition to the costs of the product management organization responsible for product pricing and packaging, and the launch of new products. During the third quarter of 2024, we realigned the reporting structure of its technology teams and as such certain technology costs are no longer reported within the Research segment, and are now reported within the line selling, marketing, administrative and other expenses. Prior period amounts have been recast to conform to the current presentation. 
 The Consulting segment includes the revenues and the related costs of our project consulting organization. The project consulting organization delivers a majority of our project consulting revenue. 
 The Events segment includes the revenues and the costs of the organization responsible for developing and hosting our events. 
 We evaluate reportable segment performance and allocates resources based on segment revenues and expenses. Segment expenses include the direct expenses of each segment organization and exclude selling and marketing expenses, general and administrative expenses, stock-based compensation expense, depreciation expense, adjustments to incentive bonus compensation from target amounts, amortization of intangible assets, restructuring and related costs, loss from sale of divested operation, interest expense, and other income. The accounting policies used by the segments are the same as those used in the consolidated financial statements.

Research segment revenues decreased 7 for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year periods. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, research product revenues within this segment decreased 4 and 5 , respectively, primarily due to the decrease in CV, as discussed above. From a product perspective, the decrease in revenues was primarily due to a decline in revenue from our reprint product and our other smaller and discontinued products. In addition, revenue from our subscription research products declined 1 and 2 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, consulting product revenues within this segment decreased 33 and 32 , respectively, primarily due to decreased delivery of consulting and advisory services by our research analysts due primarily to lower client bookings for these services. 
 Research segment expenses decreased 7 and 5 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the prior year periods. The decrease in expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to a 2.3 million decrease in compensation and benefit costs primarily due to a decrease in headcount. The decrease in expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to a 4.5 million decrease in compensation and benefit costs primarily due to a decrease in headcount. 
 Consulting segment revenues decreased 12 and 17 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the prior year periods. The decrease in revenues during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to a decrease in delivery of consulting services due to lower client bookings. 
 Consulting segment expenses decreased 11 and 15 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the prior year periods. The decrease in expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to a 1.3 million decrease in compensation and benefit costs primarily due to a decrease in headcount. The decrease in expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to (1) a 4.8 million decrease in compensation and benefit costs primarily due to a decrease in headcount and (2) a 0.6 million decrease in professional services primarily due to a decrease in contractor costs. 
 Event segment revenues decreased 54 and 33 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the prior year periods. The decrease in revenues was primarily due to a decrease in sponsorship revenues and a decrease in event ticket revenue. 
 Event segment expenses decreased 25 and 7 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the prior year periods. The decrease in expenses was primarily due to a decrease in event costs. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We have historically financed our operations primarily through funds generated from operations. Research revenues, which constituted approximately 73 of our revenues during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, are generally renewable and are typically payable in advance. We used 2.0 million of cash in operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and generated 9.8 million of cash from operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The 11.8 million decrease in cash from operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year period was primarily due to a 9.9 million decrease in net income (loss), partially offset by the changes in non-cash items affecting net income (loss), and an increase in cash used for working capital. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we generated cash from investing activities of 4.8 million primarily from 6.0 million in proceeds from the sale of the FeedbackNow product line and 1.6 million in net maturities and sales of marketable investments, partially offset by 2.7 million of purchases of property and equipment, primarily consisting of computer software. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we generated cash from investing activities of 6.3 million primarily from 10.2 million in net maturities of marketable investments, partially offset by 3.9 million of purchases of property and equipment, primarily consisting of computer software . 
 We used 13.0 million of cash from financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to 13.0 million for purchases of our common stock and 2.5 million in taxes paid related to net share settlements of restricted stock units, partially offset by 2.4 million of net proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our stock-based incentive plans. We used 18.2 million of cash in financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to 15.0 million of discretionary repayments on our revolving credit facility, 4.1 million for purchases of our common stock, and 2.6 million in taxes paid related to net share settlements of restricted stock units, partially offset by 3.5 million of net proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our stock-based incentive plans. As of September 30, 2024, our remaining stock repurchase authorization was approximately 82.9 million. 
 We have a credit facility that provides up to 150.0 million of revolving credit commitments. The credit facility has a balance of 35.0 million at September 30, 2024 and matures in December of 2026. The credit facility permits us to increase the revolving credit commitments in an aggregate principal amount up to 50.0 million, subject to approval by the administrative agent and certain customary terms and conditions. 
 29 

The credit facility contains certain customary restrictive loan covenants, including among others, financial covenants that apply a maximum leverage ratio, minimum interest coverage ratio, and maximum annual capital expenditures. The negative covenants limit, subject to various exceptions, our ability to incur additional indebtedness, create liens on assets, merge, consolidate, liquidate or dissolve any part of the company, sell assets, change fiscal year, or enter into certain transactions with affiliates and subsidiaries. We were in full compliance with the covenants as of September 30, 2024 and expect to continue to be in compliance through the next 12 months. 
 Additional future contractual cash obligations extending over the next 12 months and beyond primarily consist of operating lease payments. We lease office space under non-cancelable operating lease agreements (refer to Note 6 Leases in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information). The remaining duration of non-cancelable office space leases ranges from less than 1 year to 7 years. As of September 30, 2024, remaining non-cancelable lease payments are due as follows: 4.0 million in 2024, 26.4 million within 2025 and 2026, 8.8 million within 2027 and 2028, and 6.2 million beyond 2028. 
 In addition to the contractual cash commitments included above, we have other payables and liabilities that may be legally enforceable but are not considered contractual commitments. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents, and marketable investments of 114.9 million. This balance includes 81.0 million held outside of the U.S. If the cash outside of the U.S. is needed for operations in the U.S., we would be required to accrue and pay U.S. state taxes and may be required to pay withholding taxes to foreign jurisdictions to repatriate these funds. However, our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds outside of the U.S. and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these funds for our U.S. operations. We believe that our current cash balance and cash flows from operations will satisfy working capital, financing activities, and capital expenditure requirements for the next twelve months and to meet our known long-term cash requirements. 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 Refer to Note 1 Interim Consolidated Financial Statements in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements including the expected dates of adoption and effects on results of operations and financial condition.

 ITEM 4. CON TROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Securities Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, our management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based upon their evaluation and subject to the foregoing, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance as of that date. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, which has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
