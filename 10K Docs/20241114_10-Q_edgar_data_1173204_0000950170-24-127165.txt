Our cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable and accrued expenses are financial instruments and are recorded at cost in the consolidated balance sheets. The estimated fair values of these financial instruments approximate their carrying amounts because of their short-term nature. Equity Investment in Metaverse The Company has an equity investment in A Metaverse Company Metaverse ), a publicly traded Chinese entertainment company, formerly Starrise Media Holdings Limited, whose ordinary shares are listed on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong. After a period of time when trading in Metaverse's ordinary shares had been halted, the resumption of active trading status in November 2023 represented renewed availability of quoted, unadjusted prices in active markets for identical assets, upon which the Company can execute a sale and readily access pricing information at the measurement date. Accordingly, the Company has presented the fair value of its Metaverse shares held as of March 31, 2024 within the Level 1 grouping.

Total Revenue 

The Company's Streaming and digital revenue pertains to its OTT business, including the licensing, service, advertising, and subscription revenue related to the Company's streaming business and partnerships. Base distribution revenue relates to non-streaming revenue, including Theatrical revenue and the sale of DVD's. Podcast and other revenue primarily relate to the Company's Bloody Disgusting Podcast Network. As the Company satisfies its performance obligations from these revenue sources, whether relating to the delivery of digital content, physical goods, or licensing, revenue is generally measured at a point in time. Other non-recurring revenue relates to the Company's legacy digital cinema operations, whose operations have run-off, still may generate non-recurring revenue from the sale of cinema assets or the recognition of variable consideration as the associated uncertainty associated with the revenue is resolved. The Company follows the five-step model established by Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 606, Revenue from contracts with customers ("ASC 606") when preparing its assessment of revenue recognition. Principal Agent Considerations Revenue earned from the delivery of digital content and physical goods may be recognized gross or net depending on the terms of the arrangement. We determine whether revenue should be reported on a gross or net basis based on each revenue stream. Key indicators that we use in evaluating gross versus net treatment include, but are not limited to, the following: which party is primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the specified good or service; and 

 which party has discretion in establishing the price for the specified good or service. 

 Shipping and Handling Shipping and handling costs are incurred to move physical goods (e.g., DVDs and Blu-ray Discs) to customers. We recognize all shipping and handling costs as an expense in direct operating expenses because we are responsible for delivery of the product to our customers prior to transfer of control to the customer.

Allowance for credit losses as at September 30, 2024 

Contract Liabilities We generally record a receivable related to revenue when we have an unconditional right to invoice and receive payment, and we record deferred revenue (contract liability) when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance, such as the sale of DVDs with future release dates, even if amounts are refundable. Amounts recorded as contract liabilities are generally not long-term in nature. The ending deferred revenue balance, including current and non-current balances as of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, was million and million, respectively.

Business Overview Cineverse Corp. Cineverse , us , our , "we", and Company refers to Cineverse Corp. and its subsidiaries unless the context otherwise requires) was incorporated in Delaware on March 31, 2000. Since our inception, we have played a role in the digital distribution revolution that continues to transform the media and entertainment landscape. The Company has a long legacy in using technology to transform the entertainment industry and played a pioneering role in transitioning movie screens from traditional analog film prints to digital distribution.

Net cash used in operating activities for the six months ended September 30, 2024 was 2.4 million, which included 1.7 million of incremental investment in our content portfolio via advances or minimum guarantee payouts. The Company is party to a Loan, Guaranty, and Security Agreement, as amended, with EWB providing for a 7.5 million Line of Credit Facility, guaranteed by substantially all of our material subsidiaries and secured by substantially all of our and our subsidiaries assets. The Line of Credit Facility bears interest at a rate equal to 1.5 above the prime rate, equal to 9.5 as of September 30, 2024. The Line of Credit Facility matures on September 15, 2025. As of September 30, 2024, 4.6 million was outstanding on the Line of Credit Facility, net of issuance costs of 180 thousand. On April 5, 2024, T3 Borrower, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into the T3 Loan Agreement with the T3 Lender, and the Company as guarantor. The T3 Loan Agreement provides for the T3 Loan with a principal amount not to exceed 3.7 million, and a maturity date of April 1, 2025, with a permitted extension of the term for 120 days under certain conditions. The T3 Loan bears no interest until the maturity date other than an interest advance equal to 576 thousand at the closing of the T3 Loan on April 5, 2024. The interest advance was recorded as a discount on the T3 Loan at inception and will be amortized to interest expense and increase the loan amount over its term. If the T3 Loan is extended as noted above, the T3 Loan will bear interest at a rate of 1.44 per month. The T3 Borrower may prepay the obligations under the T3 Loan, in full or in part, without penalty or premium. The proceeds under the T3 Loan Agreement are being used for the funding under the Company s distribution arrangements for the film titled Terrifier 3 (the Film ). The T3 Loan Agreement contains customary covenants, representation and warranties and events of default. The T3 Loan is presented as current within the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and has a balance of 3.1 million as of September 30, 2024. After the principal of the T3 Loan is paid in full, the T3 Lender will be entitled to receive 15 of all royalties earned by the Company on the Film under its distribution agreements for the Film until the T3 Lender has received 1.75 times the full commitment amount of 3.7 million, consisting of the principal amount plus interest and fees advanced to T3 Borrower, plus any extension interest. The T3 Loan is secured by a first priority interest in all of T3 Borrower s rights and interest in the Film and the distribution agreements, including the proceeds to the T3 Borrower from the distribution of the Film. We expect the T3 Loan to be fully paid off in December 2024 from Film proceeds. On May 3, 2024, the Company entered into a sales agreement (the 2024 Sales Agreement with A.G.P./Alliance Global Partners and The Benchmark Company, LLC (collectively, the Sales Agents ), pursuant to which the Company may offer and sell, from time to time, through the Sales Agents, shares of Common Stock. Shares of Common Stock may be offered and sold for an aggregate offering price of up to 15 million. The Sales Agents obligations to sell shares under the 2024 Sales Agreement are subject to satisfaction of certain conditions, including the continuing effectiveness of the Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-273098) (the Registration Statement filed by the Company with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC on June 30, 2023 and declared effective by the SEC on January 25, 2024, and other customary closing conditions.

The Company is not obligated to sell any shares under the 2024 Sales Agreement and has not sold any shares through the date of this report. The Company will continue to invest in content development and acquisition, from which it believes it will obtain an appropriate return on its investment. As of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, short term content advances were 10.8 million and 9.3 million, respectively, and content advances, net of current portion, were 1.5 million and 2.6 million, respectively. Our capital requirements will depend on many factors, and we may need to use existing capital resources and/or undertake equity or debt offerings, if necessary and opportunistically available, for further capital needs. We believe our cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024 and availability under our Line of Credit Facility will be sufficient to support our operations for at least twelve months from the filing of this report.

Critical Accounting Estimates Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP ).

On a regular basis, management reviews the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material.

Management has reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.

Selling, general and administrative expenses for the six months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 1.8 million compared to the same period of 2023. In comparison to the six months ended September 30, 2023, compensation expenses decreased by 0.7 million driven by a change in the Company's employment mix as a result of a greater investment in Cineverse Services India. Corporate expenses decreased by 0.7 million and other operating expenses decreased by 0.4 million primarily driven by the Company's continued focus on cost savings initiatives.

Interest Expense, Net For the six months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023, interest expense increased by 278 thousand from 490 thousand to 768 thousand primarily due to higher outstanding debt balances and increased interest rates in 2024. Adjusted EBITDA We define Adjusted EBITDA to be earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, merger and acquisition costs, restructuring, transition and acquisitions expense, net, goodwill impairment and certain other items. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of financial performance under GAAP and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. We use Adjusted EBITDA as a financial metric to measure the financial performance of the business because management believes it provides additional information with respect to the performance of its fundamental business activities. For this reason, we believe Adjusted EBITDA will also be useful to others, including our stockholders, as a valuable financial metric. We present Adjusted EBITDA because we believe that Adjusted EBITDA is a useful supplement to net income (loss) from continuing operations as an indicator of operating performance. We also believe that Adjusted EBITDA is a financial measure that is useful both to management and investors when evaluating our performance and comparing our performance with that of our competitors. We also use Adjusted EBITDA for planning purposes and to evaluate our financial performance because Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain incremental expenses or non-cash items, such as stock-based compensation charges, that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing operating performance. We believe that Adjusted EBITDA is a performance measure and not a liquidity measure, and therefore a reconciliation between net income (loss) from continuing operations and Adjusted EBITDA has been provided in the financial results. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) from operations as an indicator of performance or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as an indicator of cash flows, in each case as determined in accordance with GAAP, or as a measure of liquidity. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA does not take into account changes in certain assets and liabilities as well as interest and income taxes that can affect cash flows. We do not intend the presentation of these non-GAAP measures to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures should be read only in conjunction with our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Following is the reconciliation of our consolidated net (loss) income to Adjusted EBITDA (in thousands) :

Net Change in Cash and Cash Equivalents 

(2,738) 

1,468 

For the six months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in operating activities was primarily driven by loss from operations, excluding non-cash expenses such as depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation, and other changes in working capital. Specifically, the adjustments are primarily driven by net cash outflows related to content advances made to partners for which initial expenditures are generally recovered within six to twelve months and operating prepayments, partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable, the collection of the Company's ERTC claim, and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses. Operating cash flows are typically seasonally lower during the first two fiscal quarters and higher during our fiscal third and fourth quarters, resulting from revenues earned during the holiday season. Cash used in investing activities was used in the expenditures towards long-lived assets as well as the sale of equity securities. Cash provided by financing activities were primarily due to the receipt of funds from the T3 Loan offset by a net 1.6 million repayment of the Line of Credit Facility, 0.3 million net payment of deferred acquisition consideration and 0.2 million used to repurchase outstanding shares. For the six months ended September 30, 2023, net cash used in operating activities is primarily driven by loss from operations, excluding non-cash expenses such as depreciation, amortization, recovery for doubtful accounts and stock-based compensation, including capitalized content spend and other changes in working capital. Operating cash flows are typically seasonally lower during the first two fiscal quarters and higher during our fiscal third and fourth quarters, resulting from revenues earned during the holiday season. In addition, we made net advances of 5.3 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023, as part of the advances we make on theatrical releases and to certain home entertainment distribution clients for which initial expenditures are generally recovered within six to twelve months. Cash used in investing activities was used in the expenditures towards long-live intangible assets and fixed assets. Cash provided by financing activities pertained to the issuance of company equity, net of financing fees.
