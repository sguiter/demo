Later in 2023, the Company and the Landlord reached a settlement amending the terms of the Zabala Road Lease and reaching agreement on all rent-related issues. However, the Landlord declined to finalize the settlement agreement or honor the settlement terms related to rent. Then, on October 9, 2023, the Landlord terminated the Zabala Road Lease via a letter, which was served by its counsel on the Company. In October 2023, the Company filed a lawsuit for breach of contract and specific performance of the settlement agreement against the Landlord in order to enforce the settlement terms. The Landlord filed counterclaims against the Company, claiming damages of more than 36 million, which the Landlord claims are based on an analysis of accelerated rent due through the end of the term of the Zabala Road Lease, along with attorney s fees, improvements, and other undefined costs. In a separate lawsuit, the Landlord filed an unlawful detainer action, seeking possession of the Zabala Road property, one year of back rent, attorney s fees, and other damages. The unlawful detainer action concluded in January 2024 when the Company surrendered possession of the Zabala Road property to the Landlord. In July 2024, the court in the unlawful detainer action declined to award any monetary damages to the Landlord in connection with the unlawful detainer lawsuit, instead indicating that any damages related to the unlawful detainer claims would be decided in the lawsuit filed by the Company against the Landlord. The breach of contract litigation, along with the landlord's counterclaims, is continuing. The Company intends to vigorously defend itself against the claims made by the Landlord. However, no assurance can be provided as to whether or not the Company will prevail, and it may be required to pay significant monetary damages. It is difficult to evaluate the likely outcome of a trial at such an early stage and with competing claims and cross-claims. In addition, due to the early nature of the case, an estimate on a loss is not reasonably estimable. A putative class action was filed on behalf of all California consumers who purchased products made by Lowell Farms, Inc. in California. The case alleges that Lowell failed to accurately label its products with the THC identified by its testing laboratories, and that California consumers were thereby deceived into paying higher prices for Lowell s products than they otherwise would have. No trial has been scheduled in this matter. In addition, Plaintiff has not yet filed a motion for certification of a class despite a previous schedule to do so. Based on comments at the last court hearing, it is uncertain whether Plaintiff intends to bring a motion seeking certification of a class or proceed only on his individual claims, meaning Plaintiff would be relegated to his own damages, which is likely just a few hundred dollars and any applicable attorney s fees. Plaintiff served discovery requests limited to class certification issues to which Lowell responded, but the parties have not engaged in any merits discovery to date. It is difficult to evaluate any potential outcome before knowing whether Plaintiff intends to pursue class action certification and before any merits discovery. The Company is prepared to vigorously defend itself at the trial if a settlement is not reached. It is difficult to evaluate the likely outcome of a trial because Plaintiff has not articulated a theory of damages. In addition, because it is uncertain whether Plaintiff will pursue class-wide or only individual damages, it is not possible to reasonably estimate any loss. 17 Table of Contents LOWELL FARMS INC.

OVERVIEW OF THE COMPANY We are a California-based cannabis company with vertically integrated operations including extraction, processing, manufacturing, branding, packaging and wholesale distribution to retail dispensaries. We manufacture and distribute proprietary and a limited number of third-party brands throughout the State of California, one of the largest cannabis markets in the world. We also provide manufacturing, extraction and distribution services to several third-party cannabis and cannabis branding companies. We operate a 40,000 square foot processing facility in Monterey County, a 15,000 square foot manufacturing and laboratory facility in Salinas, California, a separate 21,000 square foot distribution and flower packing facility in Salinas, California and a warehouse depot in Los Angeles, California. On January 12, 2024, we surrendered possession of a 255,000 square foot greenhouse cultivation and warehouse facility. See Recent Developments. Effective October 1, 2024, we assumed operational management responsibilities for two retail cannabis dispensaries in Los Angeles, California. See Recent Developments. Product Offerings Our present product offerings include flower, pre-rolls, vape pens, oils, extracts, chocolate edibles, mints, gummies, topicals and tinctures. We sell our products under owned and third-party brands. Brands we own include the following: Cypress Cannabis (a premium flower brand) Flavor Extracts (crumble and terp sugar products): House Weed (a value driven flower, vapes and concentrates offering delivering a flavorful and potent experience) Moon (a range of high-potency, high-quality and high-value edibles) Humble Flower (a premium brand offering cannabis-infused topicals, pre-rolls, sublingual tablets) and Original Pot Company (baked edibles). We also exclusively manufacture and distribute Lowell Herb Co. and Lowell Smokes (premium packaged flower, pre-roll, concentrates, and vape products) 35s (a line of automated pre-rolls) and products for several other third party brands in California and provide third party extraction processing and distribution services and bulk extraction concentrates and flower to licensed manufacturers and distributors. 19 Table of Contents Processing and Manufacturing Operations We operate a 40,000 square foot processing facility in Monterey County in close proximity to our cultivation operations that provides drying, bucking, trimming, sorting, grading, and packaging operations for up to 250,000 pounds of wholesale cannabis flower annually. The facility processed nearly all the cannabis that we grew at our cultivation operations until we exited the cultivation facility as well as providing processing services for regional growers from primarily the Salinas Valley area. See the discussion below under Recent Developments . Our manufacturing facility is located in Salinas, California and houses our edible product operations and extraction and distillation operations. The edible product operations utilize internally produced cannabis oil, which can also be supplied from multiple external sources. Our manufacturing operations produce a wide variety of cannabis-infused products in our 15,000 square foot manufacturing facility in Salinas. Our products include chocolate confections, tinctures, baked goods, hard and soft non-chocolate confections, and topical lotions and balms. Lowell Farms utilizes modern commercial production equipment and employs food grade manufacturing protocols, including industry-leading standard operating procedures designed so that its products meet stringent quality standards. We have implemented updated compliance, packaging and labeling standards to meet the requirements of the California Medical and Adult-Use Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act with the advent of adult use legalization in California. We also operate an automated flower packaging line, an automated pre-roll line and a pre-roll assembly line for making finished goods in those respective categories with feedstock grown at our cultivation operations. Debt Settlement, Asset Sale and Licensing On October 6, 2023, the Company repurchased all of the 22,157 aggregate principal amount of outstanding Senior Secured Convertible Debentures together with the related warrants to purchase 10,627,483 subordinate voting shares of the Company and 4,324,845 common shares of Indus. Share amounts reflect the 1 for 10 reverse stock split effective August 31, 2023.

Technology Platform We maintain an automated, on-demand supply chain logistics platform, utilizing e-commerce, enterprise resource planning and other technology to manage product movement, order taking and logistics needs. Inventory Management We have comprehensive inventory management procedures, which we believe are compliant with the rules set forth by the California Department of Cannabis Control (formerly the California Department of Consumer Affairs Bureau of Cannabis Control) and all other applicable state and local laws, regulations, ordinances, and other requirements. These procedures ensure strict control over Lowell Farms cannabis and cannabis product inventory from cultivation or manufacture to sale and delivery to a licensed dispensary, distributor or manufacturer, or disposal as cannabis waste. Such inventory management procedures also include measures to prevent contamination and maintain the quality of the products cultivated, manufactured or distributed. 20 Table of Contents Sources, Pricing and Availability of Raw Materials, Component Parts or Finished Products We source flower for sale from multiple high quality and reliable growers. We have developed relationships with local cannabis growers whereby flower quantities are readily available at competitive prices should the sourcing need arise. We source our biomass needs from third-party suppliers. Biomass material is readily available from multiple sources at competitive prices. Lowell Farms manufactures substantially all cannabis oil and distillate needs from its internal extraction operations. A small amount of specialized cannabis oil is procured from multiple external sources at competitive prices. Lowell Farms manufactures all finished goods for its proprietary brands. Third-party distributed brand product is sourced directly from third-party partners. Recent Developments Surrender of Cultivation Facility On January 12, 2024, Cypress surrendered possession of the Zabala Road Property leased by Cypress pursuant to the Zabala Road Lease with the Landlord. Prior to vacating the premises on January 12, 2024, the Company had operated a cultivation facility, which included four greenhouses totaling approximately 255,000 square feet, on the Zabala Road Property. In January 2023, the Company s Board of Directors formed a strategic alternatives special committee of independent directors to explore, review and evaluate strategic and financial alternatives. As part of these efforts, Cypress entered into negotiations with the Landlord of the Zabala Road Property leased by Cypress pursuant to the Zabala Road Lease to restructure the terms of the Zabala Road Lease, which provided for an expiry date of December 31, 2027, subject to five 5-year extension options exercisable by Cypress. Later in 2023, the Company and the Landlord reached a settlement amending the terms of the Zabala Road Lease and reaching agreement on all rent-related issues. However, the Landlord declined to finalize the settlement agreement or honor the settlement terms related to rent. Then, on October 9, 2023, the Landlord terminated the Zabala Road Lease via a letter, which was served by its counsel on the Company. In October 2023, the Company filed a lawsuit for breach of contract and specific performance of the settlement agreement against the Landlord in order to enforce the settlement terms. The Landlord filed counterclaims against the Company, claiming damages of more than 36 million, which the Landlord claims are based on an analysis of accelerated rent due through the end of the term of the Zabala Road Lease, along with attorney s fees, improvements, and other undefined costs. In a separate lawsuit, the Landlord filed an unlawful detainer action, seeking possession of the Zabala Road property, one year of back rent, attorney s fees, and other damages. The unlawful detainer action concluded in January 2024, the court in the unlawful detainer action declined to award any monetary damages to the Landlord in connection with the unlawful detainer lawsuit, instead indicating that any damages related to the unlawful detainer claims would be decided in the lawsuit filed by the Company against the Landlord. The breach of contract litigation, along with the landlord's counterclaims, is continuing. The Company intends to vigorously defend itself against the claims made by the Landlord. However, no assurance can be provided as to whether or not the Company will prevail, and it may be required to pay significant monetary damages. It is difficult to evaluate the likely outcome of a trial at such an early stage and with competing claims and cross-claims. In addition, due to the early nature of the case, an estimate on a loss is not reasonable estimable. Retail Dispensaries Management Services Agreements On October 9, 2024, the Company announced that it entered into management services agreements with two cannabis retail dispensaries located in Los Angeles, California. Under the terms of the agreements, Lowell Farms will assume operational management of the retail stores, with an option to acquire equity ownership through a non-binding letter of intent. The management services agreements commenced as of October 1, 2024, and terminate upon the earlier to occur of (i) the Company s acquisition of the equity interests of the retail dispensaries, (ii) by mutual agreement of the applicable parties, or (iii) upon the occurrence of certain other customary circumstances specified in the management services agreements. There can be no assurance that the Company will enter into definitive agreements to acquire the equity ownership of the retail stores in a timely fashion, or at all. Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial and Performance Measures The Company has provided certain supplemental non-GAAP financial measures in this MD A. Where the Company has provided such non-GAAP financial measures, we have also provided a reconciliation below to the most comparable GAAP financial measure. These supplemental non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered superior to, as a substitute for or as an alternative to, and should only be considered in conjunction with, the GAAP financial measures presented herein. 21 Table of Contents In this MD A, reference is made to adjusted EBITDA and working capital which are not measures of financial performance under GAAP. The Company calculates each as follows: EBITDA is net income (loss), excluding the effects of income taxes (recovery) net interest expense depreciation and amortization and adjusted EBITDA also includes unrealized foreign currency gains/losses share-based compensation expense and other transactional and special expenses, such as out-of-period insurance and tax recoveries and acquisition costs and expenses related to the markup of acquired finished goods inventory, which are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are not what we consider as typical of our continuing operations. Management believes this measure provides useful information as it is a commonly used measure in the capital markets and as it is a close proxy for repeatable cash generated by operations. We use adjusted EBITDA internally to understand, manage, make operating decisions related to cash flow generated from operations and evaluate our business. In addition, we use adjusted EBITDA to help plan and forecast future periods. Working capital is current assets less current liabilities. Management believes the calculation of working capital provides additional information to investors about the Company s liquidity. We use working capital internally to understand, manage, make operating decisions related to cash flow required to fund operational activity and evaluate our business cash flow needs. In addition, we use working capital to help plan and forecast future periods. These measures are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. The table below reconciles Net loss to Adjusted EBITDA for the periods indicated: Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, September 30, September 30, (in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Net loss (3,629 (20,170 (7,316 (24,283 Interest expense 2 1,594 17 4,404 Provision for income taxes 403 - 403 - Depreciation and amortization in cost of goods sold (2) 416 1,405 2,012 3,834 Depreciation and amortization in operating expenses (2) 98 102 293 317 Depreciation and amortization in other income (expense) (2) 691 - 1,381 - EBITDA (1) (2,019 (17,069 (3,210 (15,728 Investment and currency (gains)/ losses - 2 - 30 Goodwill impairment - 92 - 193 Share-based compensation 7 (157 43 (157 Debt repurchase charges (4) - 14,025 - 14,025 Other charges (3) (69 1,723 (1,905 (2,161 Adjusted EBITDA (1) (2,081 (1,384 (5,072 (3,798 (1) Non-GAAP measure (2) For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, includes 58 and 595, respectively related to interest charges on operating leases recorded in cost of goods sold, 4 and 12, respectively related to interest charges on operating leases recorded in operating expenses and 407 and 819, respectively related to interest charges on operating leases recorded in other income (expense).

(4) Comprised of 13,793 of impairment charges on intangible assets and 232 of legal expenses incurred in the three and nine month periods ending September 30, 2023 related to the debt settlement and asset sale. All charges were included in other income (expense) on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss). RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 Revenue We derive our revenue from sales of extracts, distillates, branded and packaged cannabis flower, pre-rolls, concentrates and edible products to retail licensed dispensaries and bulk flower, biomass and concentrates to licensed manufacturers and distributors in the state of California. In addition, we distribute proprietary and several third-party brands throughout the state of California, and we provide fee services for drying and processing third-party product for licensed cultivators in the State of California. In October 2023, the Company sold the rights to the Lowell Smokes brand. The Company recognizes revenue upon delivery of goods to customers since at this time performance obligations are satisfied. The Company classifies its revenues into the following major categories: Consumer Packaged Goods CPG revenue, Bulk revenue, Lowell Farm Services revenue, and Licensing revenue. CPG products are primarily sales of proprietary and exclusively licensed brands of the Company. Bulk product includes revenue from flower, biomass and distillates sales. Lowell Farm Services revenue is related to our processing facility that provides drying, bucking, trimming, sorting, grading, and packaging services. Licensing revenue includes fees from licensing the Lowell Smokes brand and sales of packaging and support services associated with non-California based activities which is now discontinued. 22 Table of Contents Revenue by Category Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023: Three Months Ended September 30, September 30, (in thousands) 2024 2023 Change Change CPG 3,244 4,369 (1,125 -26 Bulk - 1,196 (1,196 -100 Lowell Farm Services - 455 (455 -100 Licensing - 192 (192 -100 Net revenue 3,244 6,212 (2,968 -48 CPG revenues decreased 1.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period of the prior year, primarily as a result of reduced sales volumes of packaged flower and pre-rolls. The reduction in revenue is partially driven by additional procedures to manage credit risk by only selling to credit worthy customers as well as managing the business as it shifts to procuring cannabis raw material from suppliers as the Company shifts away from self-grown cannabis raw material. This change in strategy temporarily reduced available inventory as the Company transitioned to new suppliers. Lowell brand revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 2.0 million and represented 63 of CPG revenues compared to 3.1 million in revenue and 72 of CPG sales in the same period in the prior year. The Company continues to expand its portfolio of distributed brands which generated 0.8 million in revenue during the current period, compared to 0.9 million in the same period of the prior year. There were no bulk sales in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1.2 million in the same period in the prior year. The decline during the year was the result of the Company shifting to procuring cannabis raw material from suppliers, as opposed to utilizing self-grown flower. This decision has enabled the Company to strategically purchase cannabis raw material to match demand for the CPG market but has limited the available cannabis raw material for bulk sales. During the current period, the Company was focused on managing the procurement of third party flower for CPG products, as opposed to third party processing. No licensing revenues were generated in 2024 reflecting the sale of the Lowell Smokes brand in October 2023. Cost of Sales, Gross Profit and Gross Margin Cost of goods sold consists of direct and indirect costs of production processing and distribution, and includes amounts paid for direct labor, raw materials, packaging, operating supplies, and allocated overhead, which includes allocations of right of use asset depreciation, insurance, managerial salaries, utilities, and other expenses, such as employee training, cultivation taxes and product testing. The Company manufactures for several brands and processes for cultivators that do not have the capability, licensing or capacity to process their own products. The fees earned for these activities absorb fixed overhead in manufacturing and generates service revenue. Our focus in 2024 is expected to be on flower, pre-rolls and on processing third party product at our processing facility. With the exit from the cultivation facility during early 2024, we will be able to react quickly to the demands of the market to better source our production needs and better control spending on third party purchased flower to manage cash outflows on flower and CPG manufacturing. We are focusing on improving our technology workflow to enable us to match production more closely with demand, executing smaller, more frequent production runs to lower inventory working capital, optimize efficiencies and expedite product getting to the market faster.

Gross profit was adversely affected during the period by expenses incurred as a result of the transition away from the cultivation facility in early 2024. As the Company finalizes recording the exit from the cultivation facility, these expenses are not expected to recur and the non-revenue generating expenses have unfavorably impacted gross profit and margin in the current period. Further impacting gross margin is a reduction in CPG volumes generating high fixed costs per unit and increased depreciation expense related to operating lease classification of existing leases. 23 Table of Contents Total Operating Expenses Total operating expenses consist primarily of costs incurred at our corporate offices personnel costs selling, marketing, and other professional service costs including legal and accounting and licensing costs. Sales and marketing expenses consist of selling costs to support our customer relationships, including investments in marketing and brand activities and corporate infrastructure required to support our ongoing business. Selling costs as a percentage of retail revenue are expected to decrease as our business continues to grow due to efficiencies associated with scaling the business. We expect to incur periodic transaction costs related to expansion efforts and to continue to invest where appropriate in the general and administrative function to support the increasing complexity of the cannabis business.

The current year reflects a 0.2 million gain on the sale of assets and processing facility expenses of 0.7 million, offset by sublease income of 0.1 million, since the facility was unused due to the exit from cultivation activities in the previous quarter. During the current period, the Company classifies leases as operating leases, with interest expense reflected in cost of goods sold and in other expense for the unused processing facility. Other income in the prior year primarily reflects a 13.8 million impairment charge, a 1.7 million charge related to a one time, non-recurring yield and processing variance on the Company s processing facility and 232 of legal expenses incurred on the debt repurchase transaction.

Our primary source of liquidity has been funds generated by financing activities. Our ability to fund our operations, to make planned capital expenditures, to make scheduled lease payments depends on our future operating performance and cash flows, and ability to obtain equity or debt financing, which are subject to prevailing economic conditions, as well as financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. Cash generated from ongoing operations have not been sufficient to fund operations and, in particular, to fund the Company s short term capital investments into manufacturing and cultivation expansions or to fund growth initiatives in the long-term. The Company raised additional funds from a 9.0 million sale leaseback transaction during the quarter ended June 30, 2023. At September 30, 2024, we had 0.3 million in cash and cash equivalents and (1.9) million of working capital, compared to 2.3 million of cash and cash equivalents and 3.5 million of working capital at December 31, 2023. The Company is focused on improving its balance sheet by improving accounts receivable collections, right-sizing inventories and increasing gross profits. We have taken a number of steps to improve our cash position and to continue to fund operations and capital expenditures including: Focusing on collection of principal balances only; Scaled back our investment in and support for non-core brands; Reduced spending on marketing and brand development activities focusing primarily on growing Lowell and owned brands; Restructured our organization and identified operating, selling and administrative expense cost efficiencies; Focusing Lowell Farm Services on revenue and cash flow generation, and potential flower sourcing through processing third party flower while reducing labor and overhead expenses; We reduced headcount and eliminated our seasonal workforce as we focus on necessary infrastructure to support our current operations; In 2023, re-negotiating leases on facility space, including leasing more economically feasible facilities in Los Angeles and selling and leasing back our processing facility; and In January 2024, exited our cultivation facility to take advantage of profitably sourcing flower from multiple third party sources.

The change was primarily driven by the loss from operations improving 0.1 million in the current year period. A net unfavorable impact of 1.7 million in net operating assets and liabilities was realized in the current year period compared to the prior year period being offset by non-recurring items in both periods. The Company recorded 1.0 million of operating lease payments during the current period. Cash used in investing activities The Company did not make any new investments into long-lived fixed assets during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 but did generate 0.6 million in proceeds from asset sales in the current period.. Cash used in financing activities Net cash used in financing activities were nominal for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was associated with principal payments on lease obligations of 0.1 million which compare to 1.6 million in principal payments on lease obligations in the prior year period. This change was due to a reduction in lease payments after the Company exited its cultivation facility in 2023, as well as reclassifying existing leases as operating leases. The prior year period also included 9.0 million in proceeds from a sale and leaseback. 29 Table of Contents Working Capital and Cash on Hand The following table presents the Company s cash on hand and working capital position as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023: September 30, December 31, Change (in thousands) 2024 2023 Working capital (1) (1,927 3,475 (5,402 -155 Cash and cash equivalents 438 2,311 (1,873 -81 _________________ (1) Non-GAAP measure - see Non-GAAP Financial Measures in this MD A. (Total current assets less total current liabilities) At September 30, 2024, we had 0.3 million in cash and cash equivalents and (1.9) million of working capital, compared to 2.3 million of cash and cash equivalents and 3.5 million of working capital at December 31, 2023. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents was primarily due to unfavorable changes in operating assets and liabilities. The Company s future working capital is expected to be significantly impacted by the growth in operations, continuing margin improvement, net positive cash flows from our new retail management services agreements, ability to manage the growing complexity of the cannabis business and the success of capital raising efforts which are primarily associated with our retail management services activities. CHANGES IN OR ADOPTION OF ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS This MD A should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2023. Also see Note 1 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-Q for changes of adoption of accounting pronouncements. 30 Table of Contents CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and revenue and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods. Significant judgments, estimates and assumptions that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the unaudited consolidated financial statements are described below. Estimated Credit Losses - Accounts receivable are recorded at invoiced amounts and when credit terms are extended to customers, management performs a periodic assessment of whether accounts receivable will be collected. A reserve is booked against doubtful accounts and determined based on factors such as credit worthiness of the customer, past performance with the customer, the age of the receivable and the customer s ability to pay outstanding amounts. Estimated Useful Lives and Depreciation of Property and Equipment - Depreciation of property and equipment is dependent upon estimates of useful lives which are determined through the exercise of judgment. The assessment of any impairment of these assets is dependent upon estimates of recoverable amounts that take into account factors such as economic and market conditions and the useful lives of assets. Estimated Useful Lives and Amortization of Intangible Assets - Amortization of intangible assets is recorded on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which do not exceed the contractual period, if any. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized at the acquisition date fair values as defined by accounting standards related to fair value measurements. Fair Value of Investments in Private Entities - The Company uses discounted cash flow model to determine fair value of its investment in private entities. In estimating fair value, management is required to make certain assumptions and estimates such as discount rate, long term growth rate and, estimated free cash flows. Share-Based Compensation - The Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options and warrants granted. In estimating fair value, management is required to make certain assumptions and estimates such as the expected life of units, volatility of the Company s future share price, risk free rates, future dividend yields and estimated forfeitures at the initial grant date. Changes in assumptions used to estimate fair value could result in materially different results. Deferred Tax Asset and Valuation Allowance - Deferred tax assets, including those arising from tax loss carry-forwards, requires management to assess the likelihood that the Company will generate sufficient taxable earnings in future periods in order to utilize recognized deferred tax assets. Assumptions about the generation of future taxable profits depend on management s estimates of future cash flows. In addition, future changes in tax laws could limit the ability of the Company to obtain tax deductions in future periods. To the extent that future cash flows and taxable income differ significantly from estimates, the ability of the Company to realize the net deferred tax assets recorded at the reporting date could be impacted. 31 Table of Contents FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FINANCIAL RISK The Company s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities current portion of long-term debt and long-term debt. The carrying values of these financial instruments approximate their fair values. Financial instruments recorded at fair value are classified using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used to make the measurements. The hierarchy is summarized as follows: Level 1 - Quoted prices (unadjusted) that are in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2 - Inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (prices) for similar assets or liabilities in active markets or indirectly (derived from prices) for identical assets or liabilities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions Level 3 - Inputs for assets or liabilities that are not based upon observable market data The Company has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments and other risks to which it is exposed and assess the impact and likelihood of those risks. These risks include: market, credit, liquidity, asset forfeiture, banking and interest rate risk. Credit Risk Credit risk is the risk of a potential loss to the Company if a customer or third party to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations. The maximum credit exposure at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 is the carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. All cash and cash equivalents are placed with U.S. and Canadian financial institutions. The Company provides credit to its customers in the normal course of business and has established credit evaluation and monitoring processes to mitigate credit risk but has limited risk as a significant portion of its sales are transacted with cash. Liquidity Risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations associated with financial liabilities. The Company manages liquidity risk through the management of its capital structure. The Company s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure that it will have sufficient liquidity to settle obligations and liabilities when due. 32 Table of Contents In addition to the commitments outlined in Note 14, the Company has the following contractual obligations at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023: Maturity: September 30, December 31, (in thousands) 2024 2023 Accounts payable and Other accrued liabilities 5,481 6,257 Market Risk Strategic and operational risks arise if the Company fails to carry out business operations and/or to raise sufficient equity and/or debt financing. These strategic opportunities or threats arise from a range of factors that might include changing economic and political circumstances and regulatory approvals and competitor actions. The risk is mitigated by consideration of other potential development opportunities and challenges which management may undertake. Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or the future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate as a result of changes in market interest rates. The Company s interest-bearing loans and borrowings are all at fixed interest rates therefore, the Company is not exposed to interest rate risk on these financial liabilities. The Company considers interest rate risk to be immaterial. Price Risk Price risk is the risk of variability in fair value due to movements in equity or market prices. Cannabis is a developing market and subject to volatile and possibly declining prices year over year, including volatility in bulk flower pricing, as a result of increased competition and other factors. Because adult-use cannabis is a newly commercialized and regulated industry in the State of California, historical price data is either not available or not predictive of future price levels. There may be downward pressure on the average price for cannabis. There can be no assurance that price volatility will be favorable or in line with expectations. Pricing will depend on general factors including, but not limited to, the number of licenses granted by the local and state governments, the supply such licensees are able to generate, activity by unlicensed producers and sellers and consumer demand for cannabis. An adverse change in cannabis prices, or in investors beliefs about trends in those prices, could have a material adverse outcome on the Company and its valuation. Asset Forfeiture Risk Because the cannabis industry remains illegal under U.S. federal law, any property owned by participants in the cannabis industry which are either used in the course of conducting such business, or are the proceeds of such business, could be subject to seizure by law enforcement and subsequent civil asset forfeiture. Even if the owner of the property were never charged with a crime, the property in question could still be seized and subject to an administrative proceeding by which, with minimal due process, it could be subject to forfeiture. Banking Risk Notwithstanding that a majority of states have legalized medical marijuana, there has been no change in U.S. federal banking laws related to the deposit and holding of funds derived from activities related to the marijuana industry. Given that U.S. federal law provides that the production and possession of cannabis is illegal, there are arguments that financial institutions cannot accept for deposit funds from businesses involved with the marijuana industry and legislative efforts to provide greater certainty to financial institutions have not been successful. Consequently, businesses involved in the marijuana industry often have difficulty accessing the U.S. banking system and traditional financing sources. The inability to open bank accounts with certain institutions may make it difficult to operate the business of the Company, its subsidiaries and investee companies, and leaves their cash holdings vulnerable. 33 Table of Contents OUTSTANDING SHARE DATA As of November 12, 2024, the Company had the following securities issued and outstanding: Number of Shares (in thousands) (on an as converted basis) Issued and Outstanding Subordinate voting shares 18,150 Class B shares (1) 881 Super voting shares 20 Reserved for Issuance Options 1,189 Warrants 226 20,466 (1) Class B shares reserved for conversion to Subordinate voting shares. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide the information requested by this Item. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer, of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act)). Based on the evaluation of these disclosure controls and procedures, the Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible to report any changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the period to which this report relates that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Management believes that there have not been any changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the period to which this report relates that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. There were no significant changes to our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 34 Table of Contents PART II - OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings Zabala Road Lease On January 12, 2024, Cypress surrendered possession of the Zabala Road Property leased by Cypress pursuant to the Zabala Road Lease with the Landlord. Prior to vacating the premises on January 12, 2024, the Company had operated a cultivation facility, which included four greenhouses totaling approximately 255,000 square feet, on the Zabala Road Property. In January 2023, the Company s Board of Directors formed a strategic alternatives special committee of independent directors to explore, review and evaluate strategic and financial alternatives. As part of these efforts, Cypress entered into negotiations with the Landlord of the Zabala Road Property leased by Cypress pursuant to the Zabala Road Lease to restructure the terms of the Zabala Road Lease, which provided for an expiry date of December 31, 2027, subject to five 5-year extension options exercisable by Cypress. Later in 2023, the Company and the Landlord reached a settlement amending the terms of the Zabala Road Lease and reaching agreement on all rent-related issues. However, the Landlord declined to finalize the settlement agreement or honor the settlement terms related to rent. Then, on October 9, 2023, the Landlord terminated the Zabala Road Lease via a letter, which was served by its counsel on the Company. In October 2023, the Company filed a lawsuit for breach of contract and specific performance of the settlement agreement against the Landlord in order to enforce the settlement terms. The Landlord filed counterclaims against the Company, claiming damages of more than 36 million, which the Landlord claims are based on an analysis of accelerated rent due through the end of the term of the Zabala Road Lease, along with attorney s fees, improvements, and other undefined costs. In a separate lawsuit, the Landlord filed an unlawful detainer action, seeking possession of the Zabala Road property, one year of back rent, attorney s fees, and other damages. The unlawful detainer action concluded in January 2024 when the Company surrendered possession of the Zabala Road property to the Landlord. In July 2024, the court in the unlawful detainer action declined to award any monetary damages to the Landlord in connection with the unlawful detainer lawsuit, instead indicating that any damages related to the unlawful detainer claims would be decided in the lawsuit filed by the Company against the Landlord. The breach of contract litigation, along with the landlord's counterclaims, is continuing. The Company intends to vigorously defend itself against the claims made by the Landlord. However, no assurance can be provided as to whether or not the Company will prevail, and it may be required to pay significant monetary damages. It is difficult to evaluate the likely outcome of a trial at such an early stage and with competing claims and cross-claims. In addition, due to the early nature of the case, an estimate on a loss is not reasonably estimable. Potency and Labeling A putative class action was filed on behalf of all California consumers who purchased products made by Lowell Farms, Inc. in California. The case alleges that Lowell failed to accurately label its products with the THC identified by its testing laboratories, and that California consumers were thereby deceived into paying higher prices for Lowell s products than they otherwise would have. No trial has been scheduled in this matter. In addition, Plaintiff has not yet filed a motion for certification of a class despite a previous schedule to do so. Based on comments at the last court hearing, it is uncertain whether Plaintiff intends to bring a motion seeking certification of a class or proceed only on his individual claims, meaning Plaintiff would be relegated to his own damages, which is likely just a few hundred dollars and any applicable attorney s fees. Plaintiff served discovery requests limited to class certification issues to which Lowell responded, but the parties have not engaged in any merits discovery to date. It is difficult to evaluate any potential outcome before knowing whether Plaintiff intends to pursue class action certification and before any merits discovery. The Company is prepared to vigorously defend itself at the trial if a settlement is not reached. It is difficult to evaluate the likely outcome of a trial because Plaintiff has not articulated a theory of damages. In addition, because it is uncertain whether Plaintiff will pursue class-wide or only individual damages, it is not possible to reasonably estimate any loss. There are no other legal proceedings material to the Company to which the Company or a subsidiary thereof is a party or of which any of their respective property is the subject matter, nor are there any such proceedings known to the Company to be contemplated, and there have been no such legal proceedings during the Company s most recently completed financial year or the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Item 1A. Risk Factors There were no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 . Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds During the three months ended September 30, 2024 there were no unregistered sales nor repurchases of equity related securities identified, outside of those already reported. Item 5. Other Information Securities Trading Plans of Directors and Executive Officers During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, none of our directors or executive officers adopted or terminated a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan or a non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement (as defined in Item 408(c) of Regulation S-K). 35 Table of Contents Item 6.
