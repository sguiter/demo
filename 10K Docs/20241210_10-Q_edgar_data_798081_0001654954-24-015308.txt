When used in this Form 10-Q or in any other presentation, statements which are not historical in nature, including the words anticipate, estimate, should, expect, believe, intend, project , plan, seek, will, may, might, would, could and similar expressions, are intended to identify forward-looking statements. They also include statements containing a projection of sales, earnings or losses, capital expenditures, dividends, capital structure or other financial terms. The forward-looking statements in this Form 10-Q are based upon our management s beliefs, assumptions and expectations of our future operations and economic performance, taking into account the information currently available to us. These statements are not statements of fact. Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, some of which are not currently known to us that may cause our actual results, performance or financial condition to be materially different from the expectations of future results, performance or financial condition we express or imply in any forward-looking statements. Some of the important factors that could cause our actual results, performance or financial condition to differ materially from expectations are: we are subject to risk as a result of our international manufacturing operations and are subject to the risk of doing business in foreign countries, particularly in China and Vietnam, which could affect our ability to manufacture or sell our products, obtain products from foreign suppliers or control the costs of our products; a terrorist attack, other geopolitical crisis, or widespread outbreak of an illness or other health issue, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, could negatively impact our domestic and/or international operations; our results of operations could be negatively affected by potential fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; we have manufacturing and other operations in China which may be adversely affected by tariff wars and other trade maneuvers; our results of operations may vary widely from quarter to quarter; disruption in our supply chain, manufacturing or distribution operations could adversely affect our business; climate change and other sustainability matters may adversely affect our business and operations; some of our sales are to foreign buyers, which exposes us to additional risks; we deal in countries where corruption is an obstacle; we are exposed to U.S. and foreign tax risks; because we do not have long-term commitments from many of our customers, we must estimate customer demand, and errors in our estimates could negatively impact our inventory levels and net sales; we face competition from other companies, a number of which have substantially greater resources than we do; our operations are substantially dependent upon key personnel; cybersecurity incidents could disrupt business operations, result in the loss of critical and confidential information and adversely impact our reputation and results of operations; we may be subject to product liability claims, and insurance coverage could be inadequate or unavailable to cover these claims; environmental laws and regulations may subject us to significant liabilities; provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and by-laws and Delaware law could make a merger, tender offer or proxy contest difficult; we may not achieve the expected benefits from strategic acquisitions, investments, joint ventures, capital investments and other corporate transactions that we have pursued or may pursue; we may need additional funds, and if we are unable to obtain these funds, we may not be able to expand or operate our business as planned; adverse developments affecting the financial services industry, including events or concerns involving liquidity, defaults or non-performance by financial institutions or transactional counterparties, could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations; rapid technological change could negatively affect sales of our products, inventory levels and our performance; and the other factors referenced in this Form 10-Q, including, without limitation, in the section entitled Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the factors described under Risk Factors disclosed in our fiscal 2024 Form 10-K. 25 Table of Contents We believe these forward-looking statements are reasonable; however, you should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements which are based on current expectations. Furthermore, forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements after the date of this Form 10-Q, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required by law. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking events discussed in this Form 10-Q might not occur. We qualify any and all of our forward-looking statements entirely by these cautionary factors.

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in the Plan shall limit or affect a Participant s right, where applicable, to communicate or cooperate with, provide information to, or to file or participate in an investigative proceeding conducted by, the Securities and Exchange Commission or any federal, state or local government agency as provided for, protected under or warranted by whistleblower or other provisions of applicable law or regulation. 9. Claims Procedure; Resolution of Disputes . Any claim by a Participant with respect to the Plan, including without limitation eligibility, participation, contributions, benefits or other aspects of the operation of the Plan shall be first made in writing to a person designated by the Administrator from time to time for such purpose. If the designated person receiving a claim believes that the claim should be denied, he or she shall notify the Participant in writing of the denial of the claim within ninety (90) days after his or her receipt thereof. This period may be extended an additional ninety (90) days in special circumstances and, in such event, the Participant shall be notified in writing of the extension, the special circumstances requiring the extension of time and the date by which the Administrator expects to make a determination with respect to the claim. If the extension is required due to the Participant s failure to submit information necessary to decide the claim, the period for making the determination will be tolled from the date on which the extension notice is sent until the date on which the Participant responds to the Plan s request for information. 7 If a claim is denied in whole or in part, or any adverse benefit determination is made with respect to the claim, the Participant will be provided with a written notice setting forth (a) the specific reason or reasons for the denial making reference to the pertinent provisions of the Plan or of Plan documents on which the denial is based, (b) a description of any additional material or information necessary to perfect or evaluate the claim, and an explanation of why such material or information, if any, is necessary, and (c) notice that the Participant has the right to request review of the decision. The notice shall also provide an explanation of the Plan s claims review procedure and the time limits applicable to such procedure, as well as a statement of the Participant s right to bring a civil action under Section 502(a) of ERISA following an adverse benefit determination on review. If a Participant is not notified (of the denial or an extension) within ninety (90) days from the date the Participant notifies the Plan s Administrator, the Participant may request a review of the application as if the claim had been denied. A Participant may appeal the denial of a claim by submitting a written request for review to the Administrator within sixty (60) days after written notification of denial is received. Receipt of such denial shall be deemed to have occurred if the notice of denial is sent via first class mail to the Participant s last shown address on the books of the Company. Such period may be extended by the Administrator for good cause shown. The claim will then be reviewed by the Administrator. In connection with this appeal, the Participant (or his or her duly authorized representative) may (i) be provided, upon written request and free of charge, with reasonable access to (and copies of) all documents, records, and other information relevant to the claim, and (ii) submit to the Administrator written comments, documents, records, and other information related to the claim. If the Administrator deems it appropriate, it may hold a hearing as to a claim. If a hearing is held, the Participant shall be entitled to be represented by counsel. The review by the Administrator will take into account all comments, documents, records, and other information the Participant submits relating to the claim. The Administrator will make a final written decision on a claim review, in most cases, within sixty (60) days after receipt of a request for a review. In some cases, the claim may take more time to review, and an additional processing period of up to sixty (60) days may be required. If that happens, the Participant will receive a written notice of that fact, which will also indicate the special circumstances requiring the extension of time and the date by which the Administrator expects to make a determination with respect to the claim. If the extension is required due to the Participant s failure to submit information necessary to decide the claim, the period for making the determination will be tolled from the date on which the extension notice is sent to the Participant until the date on which the Participant responds to the Plan s request for information. The Administrator s decision on the claim for review will be communicated to the Participant in writing. If an adverse benefit determination is made with respect to the claim, the notice will include: (1) the specific reason(s) for any adverse benefit determination, with references to the specific Plan provisions on which the determination is based; (2) a statement that the Participant is entitled to receive, upon request and free of charge, reasonable access to (and copies of) all documents, records and other information relevant to the claim; and (3) a statement of the Participant s right to bring a civil action under Section 502(a) of ERISA. A Participant may not start an arbitration proceeding to obtain benefits until after he or she has requested a review and a final decision has been reached on review, or until the appropriate timeframe described above has elapsed since the Participant filed a request for review and the Participant has not received a final decision or notice that an extension will be necessary to reach a final decision. These procedures must be exhausted before a Participant (or any beneficiary) demands arbitration seeking payment of benefits, as set forth below. 8 After a Participant has exhausted the administrative remedies set forth in this Section 9, all further claims with respect to the Plan, including without limitation eligibility, participation, contributions, benefits or other aspects of the operation of the Plan, shall be resolved by binding arbitration, to be held at an office closest to Lakeland s principal offices in accordance with the rules and procedures of the American Arbitration Association. Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Pending the resolution of any arbitration or court proceeding, Lakeland shall continue payment of all amounts and benefits due to a Participant hereunder. All reasonable costs and expenses of any arbitration or court proceeding (including fees and disbursements of counsel) shall be promptly paid on the Participant s behalf by Lakeland; provided , however , that no such expense reimbursement shall be made if and to the extent the arbitrator(s) determine(s) that any of the Participant s dispute assertions or defenses were in bad faith or frivolous. In addition, no action may be started more than two years after the date on which the applicable appeal was denied. If there is no decision on appeal, no action may be started more than two (2) years after the time when the Administrator should have decided the appeal. 10. Administration of the Plan . In accordance with Section 7(a), the Administrator (a) may, in its sole and absolute discretion and on such terms and conditions as it may provide, delegate in writing to one or more officers of the Company all or any portion of its authority or responsibility with respect to the Plan; and (b) has the authority to act for the Company (in a non-fiduciary capacity) as to any matter pertaining to the Plan; provided , however , that any Plan amendment or termination or any other action that reasonably could be expected to increase materially the cost of the Plan must be approved by the Compensation Committee. 11. Amendment and Termination . The Company reserves the right to amend or terminate, in whole or in part, any or all of the provisions of the Plan by action of the Compensation Committee at any time and for any reason, with or without notice, provided that any such amendment or termination that would materially and adversely affect the rights of any Participant shall not to that extent be effective without the consent of the affected Participant. 12. Effect of Plan on Other Benefits . Except as specifically provided in the Plan, the existence of the Plan shall not be interpreted to prohibit or restrict a Participant s participation in any other employee benefit or other plans or programs in which the Participant may participate from time to time. 13. Not an Employment Agreement; Rights Forfeitable . The Plan is not a contract of employment between any Participant and Lakeland. Lakeland may terminate a Participant s employment at any time, subject to the terms hereof or any other agreement that might exist between a Participant and Lakeland. 9 14. Assignability; Binding Nature . For purposes of the Plan, the Company shall include any and all successors or assignees, whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise, to all or substantially all the business or assets of the Company, and such successors and assignees shall perform the Company s obligations under the Plan, in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company, would be required to perform if no such succession or assignment had taken place. Any such successor and/or assignee shall be required to expressly assume, in writing, the terms and obligations of the Plan. In the event the surviving entity in any transaction to which the Company is a party is a subsidiary of another entity, then the ultimate parent entity of such surviving entity shall cause the surviving entity to perform the Plan in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform if no such succession or assignment had taken place. In such event, the term Company as used in the Plan, means the Company, as defined herein, and any successor or assignee (including the ultimate parent entity) to the business or assets of the Company, which by reason hereof becomes bound by the terms and provisions of the Plan. 15. Governing Law/Jurisdiction . To the extent legally required, the Code and ERISA shall govern the Plan and, if any provision hereof is in violation of any applicable requirement thereof, the Company reserves the right to retroactively amend the Plan to comply therewith. To the extent not governed by the Code and ERISA the Plan shall be governed by and construed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware without reference to principles of conflict of laws. 16. Severability . In case any one or more of the provisions, subsections, or sentences contained in the Plan shall, for any reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect the other provisions of the Plan, and the Plan shall be construed as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never been contained herein. Moreover, if any one or more of the provisions contained in the Plan shall for any reason be held to be excessively broad as to duration, geographical scope, activity or subject, it shall be construed by limiting and reducing it, so as to be enforceable to the extent compatible with the applicable law as it shall then appear. 17. Withholding. The Company shall have the right to make such provisions as it deems necessary or appropriate to satisfy any obligations it may have to withhold federal, state or local income or other taxes incurred by reason of payments or reimbursements pursuant to the Plan. In lieu thereof, subject to Code Section 409A, the Company shall have the right to withhold the amounts of such taxes from any other sums due or to become due from the Company to the Participant upon such terms and conditions as the Administrator may prescribe. 18. Payments to Incompetent Persons . Any benefit payable to or for the benefit of a minor, an incompetent person or other person incapable of receipting therefor shall be deemed paid when paid to such person s guardian or to the party providing or reasonably appearing to provide for the care of such person, and such payment shall fully discharge the Company, the Compensation Committee and all other parties with respect thereto. 19. Non-Alienation of Benefits. The Payments payable under the Plan shall not be subject to alienation, transfer, assignment, garnishment, execution or levy of any kind, and any attempt to cause any Payments to be so subjected shall not be recognized. 10 20. Code Section 409A . It is intended that the provisions of the Plan comply with, or be exempt from, Section 409A of the Code and the regulations and guidance promulgated thereunder (collectively Code Section 409A ), and all provisions of the Plan (or of any award of compensation, including equity compensation or benefits) shall be construed in a manner consistent with the requirements for avoiding taxes or penalties under Code Section 409A. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall have no liability with regard to any failure to comply with Code Section 409A. A termination of employment shall not be deemed to have occurred for purposes of any provision of the Plan providing for the payment of any amounts or benefits, which are subject to Code Section 409A, upon or following a termination of employment unless such termination is also a separation from service within the meaning of Code Section 409A (and the guidance issued thereunder) and, for purposes of any such provision of the Plan, references to a resignation, termination, termination of employment, retirement or like terms shall mean separation from service. For purposes of Code Section 409A, the Participant s right to receive any installment payments pursuant to the Plan shall be treated as a right to receive a series of separate and distinct payments. Whenever a payment under the Plan specifies a payment period with reference to a number of days e.g. , payment shall be made within thirty (30) days following the date of termination ), the actual date of payment within the specified period shall be within the sole discretion of the Company. For purposes of Code Section 409A, any expenses eligible for reimbursement in one taxable year shall not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement in any other taxable year, the reimbursement of an eligible expense shall be made no later than the end of the calendar year after the calendar year in which such expense was incurred and the right to reimbursement shall not be subject to liquidation or exchange for any other benefit. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Plan, if the Participant is deemed on the date of Termination to be a specified employee within the meaning of that term under Section 409A(a)(2)(B) of the Code, then with regard to any payment or the provision of any benefit that is considered nonqualified deferred compensation under Section 409A of the Code payable on account of a separation from service, such payment or benefit shall not be made or provided until the date which is the earlier of (a) the expiration of the six (6)-month period measured from the date of such separation from service of the Participant, and (b) the date of the Participant s death, to the extent required under Section 409A of the Code. 21. Headings and Captions . The headings and captions herein are provided for reference and convenience only. They shall not be considered part of the Plan and shall not be employed in the construction of the Plan. 22. Electronic Communication and Administration. Unless prohibited by applicable law, all announcements, notices and other communications regarding the Plan may be made by the Company by electronic means as determined by the Company in its sole discretion. 23. Not Part of Compensation Package and No Acquired Rights. The Payments payable hereunder are provided solely as a payment for involuntary termination under the circumstances described herein (i.e., termination by the Company without Cause or resignation by the Participant for Good Reason in connection with a Change in Control) and shall not constitute part of a Participant s employment compensation package. Unless required by applicable law, the payments under the Plan are not part of normal or expected compensation for purposes of calculating any severance, resignation, termination pay, redundancy, end of service payments, long-service awards, bonus, incentive pay, pension, or retirement benefits or similar payments and does not create any acquired rights. 24. Personal Information. By participating in the Plan, each Participant hereunder shall consent to the holding and processing of personal information provided by such Participant to the Company, any affiliate of the Company, trustee or third-party service provider, for all purposes relating to the operation of the Plan and to the extent necessary for such operation.
