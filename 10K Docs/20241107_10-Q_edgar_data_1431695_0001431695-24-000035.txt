SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains express or implied forward-looking statements that are based on our management s belief and assumptions and on information currently available to our management. All statements other than statements of historical fact contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including statements regarding our future results of operations or financial condition, business strategy, and plans and objectives of management for future operations, are forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as anticipate, believe, contemplate, continue, could, estimate, expect, forecast, if, intend, likely, may, plan, potential, predict, project, seek, should, target, will, or would or the negative of these words or other similar terms or expressions. 
 Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions. Actual results may differ materially from the forward-looking statements we make. Factors that may cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to: 
 our expectations regarding our revenue, expenses, and other operating results, including overall transaction volumes, average revenue per unit, active locations, dollar-based net revenue retention, gross merchandise volume, and gross payment volume; 
 our ability to acquire new customers and successfully retain existing customers; 
 our ability to develop and release new products and services and the success of any new products, including the continued growth of Olo Pay; 
 our ability to develop and release successful enhancements, features, and modifications to our existing products and services; 
 our ability to increase usage of our platform and upsell and cross sell additional modules, including to our emerging enterprise customers; 
 our ability to attain or sustain our profitability; 
 future investments in our business, our anticipated capital expenditures, and our estimates regarding our capital requirements; 
 our ability to compete effectively with existing competitors and new market entrants; 
 our ability to repurchase shares at all or at the times or in the amounts we desire, and the results of our share repurchase program; 
 the costs and success of our sales and marketing efforts, and our ability to promote our brand; 
 our ability to identify, recruit, and retain skilled personnel; 
 our ability to effectively manage our growth, including any international expansion; 
 our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of past or future investments, strategic transactions, or acquisitions, and the risk that the integration of these acquisitions may disrupt our business and management; 
 our ability to protect our intellectual property rights and any costs associated therewith; 
 the growth rates of the markets in which we compete; 
 our ability to successfully combine and integrate the businesses that we acquire, and to realize the synergies and anticipated strategic, financial, and other benefits from such acquisitions; 
 the effects of geopolitical instability, public health crises, macroeconomic conditions such as inflation and fluctuating interest rates, shifts in consumer preferences, and overall market uncertainty; 
 our ability to successfully defend or resolve any current or future litigation matters, and to discharge those matters without significant financial penalty or payments, restrictions on our business and operations, or other remedies; and 
 other risks and uncertainties, including those listed in the section entitled Risk Factors. 

You should not rely on forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. We have based the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q primarily on our current expectations and projections about future events and trends that we believe may affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. These statements are based on information available to us as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. While we believe that the information provides a reasonable basis for these statements, that information may be limited or incomplete. Our statements should not be read to indicate that we have conducted an exhaustive inquiry into, or review of, all relevant information. 
 The outcome of the events described in these forward-looking statements is subject to risks, assumptions, uncertainties, and other factors described elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and those listed in the section entitled Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and in our subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all risks and uncertainties that could have an impact on the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The results, events, and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements may not be achieved or occur, and actual results, events, or circumstances could differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. 
 The forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q relate only to events as of the date on which the statements are made. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or to reflect new information or the occurrence of unanticipated events, except as required by law. We may not actually achieve the plans, intentions, or expectations disclosed in our forward-looking statements, and you should not place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements.

 Contract Balances 
 Contract Assets 
 Professional services revenue is generally recognized ratably over the implementation period, beginning on the commencement date of each contract. Platform revenue is recognized as the services are delivered. Under ASC Topic 606, we record a contract asset when revenue recognized on a contract exceeds the billings. Our standard billing terms are monthly; however, the billings may not be consistent with the pattern of recognition, based on when services are performed. Contract assets were million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Unearned Revenue 
 Unearned revenue primarily consists of billings or payments received in advance of revenue recognition from subscription services and is recognized as revenue when transfer of control to customers has occurred. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized million of revenue related to contracts that were included in unearned revenue at December 31, 2023. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our remaining performance obligations were approximately million, approximately of which we expect to recognize as revenue over the next , and substantially all of the remaining revenue will be recognized thereafter over the next to months. These amounts only include contracts subject to a guaranteed fixed amount or the guaranteed minimum under variable contracts. Unrecognized revenue under contracts disclosed above do not include: (1) contracts with an original expected term of one year or less; (2) contracts for which variable consideration is determined based on the customer s subsequent sale or usage; or (3) agreements for which our right to invoice corresponds with the value provided to the customer.

 Our assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include long-lived assets and finite-lived intangibles, which are considered to be Level 3 inputs. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of million related to a portion of our internal-use software that was non-recoverable. This amount was recorded in research and development expenses within the condensed consolidated statement of operations. In addition, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of million related to our operating lease right-of-use assets, as we committed in June 2024 to our plan to abandon our prior office space, and we relocated our corporate headquarters back to One World Trade Center in July 2024. This amount was recorded in general and administrative expenses within the condensed consolidated statement of operations.

As of September 30, 2024, we had outstanding borrowings under the line of credit, and amounts have been drawn against any of our letters of credit. 
 In April 2024, we further amended the Second Amended and Restated LSA (the Second Amendment with Banc of California (formerly known as Pacific Western Bank) to set compliance thresholds for 2024. The Second Amendment did not change any other financial or non-financial covenants, and we remained in compliance with all required covenants upon execution of the Second Amendment.

 million of our Class A common stock (the Stock Buyback Program ). We completed this Stock Buyback Program in the second quarter of 2024. 
 On April 30, 2024, the Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to million of our Class A common stock (the 2024 Buyback Program ). Under the 2024 Buyback Program, we may repurchase shares of our Class A common stock from time to time on a discretionary basis through open market repurchases, privately negotiated transactions, block purchases, or other means, and such repurchases will be structured to occur in compliance with applicable securities laws. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased, if any, will be determined by the Board of Directors or a committee established by the Board of Directors, depending on a variety of factors, including the Class A common stock price, trading volume, market conditions, our cash flow and liquidity profile, the capital needs of the business, and other considerations. We expect to fund repurchases with existing cash on hand. The 2024 Buyback Program has no expiration date and may be modified, suspended, or terminated at any time by the Board of Directors at its discretion. 
 In addition, open market repurchases of common stock could be made pursuant to our trading plans established pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), which would permit us to repurchase common stock at a time that we might otherwise be precluded from doing so under insider trading laws or self-imposed trading restrictions.

 The total fair value of RSUs vested during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was million. Future stock-based compensation expense for unvested RSUs awarded as of September 30, 2024 was approximately million and is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of years. 
 Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units 
 In February 2023, we made grants to executives in the form of PSUs 2023 PSUs that will vest over based on the achievement of specified financial targets at the end of a performance period, subject to the executive s continuous service. The target number of shares underlying the 2023 PSUs was determined based on the higher of (a) the -trading day average price preceding the grant date or (b) the floor price as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors for the calendar year. Based on the actual financial metrics achieved relative to the target financial metrics for the year ended December 31, 2023, the number of PSUs issued were of the target PSUs. Accordingly, shares vested for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 upon meeting the time-based vesting requirement. The remaining eligible shares will vest according to the time-based service requirements, subject to the applicable executive s continued service as of each vesting date. The fair value of the 2023 PSUs is calculated based on the stock price on the date of grant. 
 In March 2024, we made additional PSU grants to executives 2024 PSUs that will vest over approximately based upon achievement of either (a) certain stock price targets or (b) our target total shareholder return TSR ), relative to the TSR of companies in the Russell 2000 Index over the specified performance period, in each case, subject to the executive s continuous service through the last day of the applicable performance period. Depending on achievement of the market-based metrics, the number of PSUs issued could range from to of the target PSUs. The fair value of the 2024 PSUs is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model on the date of the grant. 
 Stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service period using either the straight-line method or the accelerated attribution method (depending on the award), and is adjusted based on actual forfeitures as necessary.

 Employee Stock Purchase Plan 
 The employee stock purchase plan ESPP current offering period began in June 2024 and ends in December 2024. Pursuant to the evergreen provisions of the ESPP, the Board of Directors approved an automatic increase of additional shares of Class A common stock reserved and available for issuance under the ESPP effective as of January 1, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, a total of shares are available for issuance to employees under the ESPP.

 9.) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We recorded a provision for income taxes resulting in an effective tax rate of ) for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is driven primarily by adjustments to the full valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets, adjustments for share-based compensation, and state and local taxes. We maintain a full valuation allowance on our net federal and state deferred tax assets as we have concluded that it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will not be realized. 
 We evaluated the available evidence supporting the realization of our deferred tax assets, including the amount and timing of future taxable income, and determined that it is more likely than not that our net deferred tax assets will not be realized. Due to uncertainties surrounding the realization of the deferred tax assets, we maintain a full valuation allowance against substantially all of our net deferred tax assets. When we determine that we will be able to realize some portion or all of

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded million in recoveries under this insurance coverage, which was recorded within general and administrative expenses. 
 On May 4, 2023, Cashondra Floyd, an alleged Olo stockholder, derivatively and on behalf of us as a nominal defendant, filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against certain of our directors and officers (the Floyd Derivative Defendants ), captioned Floyd v. Glass, et al. (Case No. 1:23-cv-03770). On May 25, 2023, the plaintiff voluntary dismissed her complaint and refiled in the Court of the Chancery of the State of Delaware (C.A. No. 2023-0560-KSJM) (the Floyd Derivative Complaint ). The Floyd Derivative Complaint alleges that, between at least August 10, 2021 and August 11, 2022, the Floyd Derivative Defendants caused, or failed to prevent, our alleged issuance of materially false and misleading statements concerning our business relationship with the restaurant brand Subway and our publicly disclosed active locations counts. The Floyd Derivative Complaint asserts claims for breaches of fiduciary duty, aiding and

 and to take appropriate measures to the best of their ability to ensure that repurchases pursuant to the 2024 Buyback Program do not cause The Raine Group s ownership of our outstanding voting stock to exceed . The Scarantino Plaintiff subsequently agreed that the Board Resolutions would render the Scarantino Complaint moot. On June 12, 2024, the Scarantino Defendants moved to dismiss the Scarantino Complaint. On June 21, 2024, the parties filed a stipulation and proposed order dismissing the Scarantino Complaint with prejudice, which the Court granted on June 24, 2024. The Court retained jurisdiction of the lawsuit solely for the purpose of adjudicating an application for attorneys fees in connection with the claims asserted in the Scarantino Complaint. On August 2, 2024, the Court entered a Stipulation and Order providing that the Scarantino Plaintiff s action will be dismissed with prejudice and the case will be closed, subject to the Company filing an affidavit with the Court confirming that a notice of settlement has been issued. The Company filed an affidavit with the Court on August 6, 2024. 
 We recorded million of litigation-related expenses related to this matter for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. This amount was recorded in general and administrative expenses within the condensed consolidated statement of operations. 
 We have also received, and may in the future continue to receive, other claims from third parties asserting, among other things, infringement of their intellectual property rights. Future litigation may be necessary to defend ourselves or our customers by determining the scope, enforceability, and validity of third-party proprietary rights or to establish our proprietary rights. Defending such proceedings is costly and can impose a significant burden on management and employees. The results of any current or future litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, and regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources, and other factors. 
 Leases 
 In June 2024 we committed to a plan to abandon our office lease located at 99 Hudson St, New York, New York before the expiration of the lease term and relocate our corporate headquarters back to One World Trade Center. We recorded an impairment of operating lease right-of-use assets totaling million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 in connection with the abandonment of the former office space. This amount was recorded in general and administrative expenses within the condensed consolidated statement of operations. 
 In March 2023, we abandoned our office lease located at 26 Broadway, New York, New York, resulting in a reduction of million to operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities, respectively. On April 18, 2023, we entered into an agreement with our landlord that provided for an early termination of our office lease located at 26 Broadway, New York, New York. 
 Sublease income was million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Sublease income was million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the subtenant of our corporate headquarters at One World Trade Center surrendered the premises back to us, and in connection with this, we recorded a lease termination benefit of million within general and administrative expenses.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The discussion contains forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements with respect to our transaction volumes, our net revenue retention, our costs and expenses, and new and existing customer adoption and growth of modules and multi-modules, that are based on the beliefs of management, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, our management. Actual results could differ materially from those discussed in or implied by forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, particularly in the section entitled Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements, and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, on February 21, 2024, and our other filings with the SEC. 
 
 Overview 
 We are Olo, a leading open SaaS platform for restaurants. We provide restaurant brands with an enterprise-grade, open SaaS platform that powers their digital ordering, delivery, and payment programs and enables them to collect, analyze, and act on data to drive more meaningful guest experiences. Our platform and application programming interfaces, or APIs, seamlessly integrate with a wide range of solutions, unifying disparate technologies across the restaurant ecosystem. Leading restaurant brands trust Olo for its capabilities, reliability, security, scalability, and interoperability. Our platform currently handles, on average, more than two million orders per day, and more than 85 million guests have transacted on our platform over the last year. As of September 30, 2024, our customer base included over 700 restaurant brands, representing approximately 85,000 active locations, across all industry service models, including quick service, fast casual, casual dining, family dining, and coffee and snack food. 
 As a result of our ability to meet restaurant brands growing needs, gross merchandise volume, or GMV, which we define as the gross value of orders processed through our platform, has increased on an annual basis, reaching more than 26 billion during the year ended December 31, 2023, and gross payment volume, or GPV, which we define as the gross volume of payments processed through Olo Pay, has reached 1 billion during the year ended December 31, 2023. Management uses GMV and GPV metrics to assess demand for our products. We also believe these metrics provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business. 
 Restaurants are an incredibly complex segment of the retail industry. Restaurant operators must manage the intricacies of food production for just-in-time consumption and comply with strict health and safety regulations while providing a high-quality and consistent guest experience that engenders loyalty and trust. Most restaurant brands, which we define as a specific restaurant brand or restaurant chain, do not have the expertise or the resources to develop their own solutions to manage on-demand digital commerce and are more acutely challenged because their in-store technology consists of a fragmented set of legacy solutions, many of which were developed before the internet. At the same time, delivery service providers, or DSPs, and ordering aggregators have catalyzed digital demand, but pose new challenges for restaurant brands through lower long-term profitability, increased complexity, disintermediation of the restaurant s direct relationship with the guest and, increasingly, directly competitive food offerings. Due to its unique complexities and challenges, the restaurant industry has historically been one of the lowest-penetrated on-demand digital commerce segments of the retail industry, with digital orders accounting for only 16 of total restaurant industry orders in 2023, according to data from Circana (formerly known as The NPD Group). 
 Our open SaaS platform is purpose-built to meet the complex needs of restaurants and align with the interests of the restaurant industry. We have developed our platform in collaboration with many of the leading restaurant brands in the United States. We believe our platform is the only independent open SaaS platform for restaurants to enable hospitality with modern solutions across three product suites: 
 Order . A suite of solutions powering restaurant brands on-demand commerce operations, enabling digital ordering, delivery, and channel management; 

20 

Table Of Contents 

 Pay . A fully-integrated, frictionless payment platform, enabling restaurants to grow and protect their digital business through an improved guest payment experience, offering advanced fraud prevention designed to improve authorization rates for valid transactions, and increase basket conversion; and 
 Engage . A suite of restaurant-centric marketing solutions optimizing Guest Lifetime Value, or LTV, by leveraging data to strengthen and enhance the restaurants direct guest relationships. 
 The key milestones in our corporate history are the following: 
 2005: Olo Founder and CEO Noah Glass accepted 0.5 million in Series A funding to start Mobo. 
 2010: We began rebranding as Olo and shifted our focus to enterprise customers. 
 2015: We launched Dispatch, our first significant product extension. 
 2017: We launched Rails and surpassed 1 billion in GMV. 
 2021: We completed our IPO, executed our first acquisition, and surpassed 20 billion in GMV. 
 2022: We announced commercial availability of Olo Pay, and surpassed 23 billion in GMV and 250 million in GPV. 
 2023: We surpassed 26 billion in GMV and 1 billion in GPV. 
 We continually invest in architectural improvements so that our system can scale in tandem with our continued growth. Additionally, both internal and external security experts frequently test our system for vulnerabilities. To our knowledge, we have never experienced a material breach of customer or guest data. Our open SaaS platform integrates with over 400 restaurant technology solutions including point-of-sale, or POS, systems, aggregators, DSPs, ordering service providers, or OSPs, payment processors, user experience, or UX, and user interface, or UI, providers, and loyalty programs, giving our customers significant control over the configuration and features of their distinct digital offering. 
 Our contracts typically have initial terms of three years or longer, with continuous one-to-two-year automatic renewal periods, providing visibility into our future financial performance. We have a highly efficient go-to-market model as a result of our industry thought leadership, partnership approach with our restaurant customers, and experienced enterprise sales, customer success, and deployment teams. Unlike other enterprise software businesses, where the sales team works to add a single location or division and expand to others, we generally enter into relationships at the brand s corporate level and strive to secure exclusivity across all locations. This enables us to deploy our modules across all new and existing brand locations without any additional sales and marketing costs and upsell new offerings to the brand itself, rather than each individual location. Our dollar-based net revenue retention exceeded 120 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. See the section below entitled Key Factors Affecting Our Performance for additional information on how we calculate dollar-based net revenue retention. 
 We refer to our business model as a transactional SaaS model, as it includes both subscription and transaction-based revenue streams, and we designed it to align with our customers success. Our model allows our customers to forego the cost of building, maintaining, and securing their own digital ordering and delivery platforms and to retain direct relationships with their guests while maximizing profitability. Our hybrid-pricing model provides us with a predictable revenue stream and enables us to further grow our revenue as our customers increase their digital order volume. We generate subscription revenue primarily from our Ordering, Switchboard, Kiosk, Catering, Virtual Brands, Sync, Guest Data Platform, or GDP, Marketing, Sentiment, and Host modules. In addition, a portion of our customers purchase an allotment of monthly orders for a fixed monthly fee and pay us an additional fee for each excess order, which we also consider to be subscription revenue. Our transaction revenue primarily includes revenue generated from our Dispatch, Rails, Network, Virtual Brands, and Olo Pay modules. In most cases, we also charge aggregators, channel partners, and other service providers in our ecosystem on a per transaction basis for access to our Rails and Dispatch modules.

 Key Factors Affecting Our Performance 
 Expand Within Our Existing Customer Base 
 Our large base of enterprise customers and transactional SaaS revenue model represent an opportunity for further revenue expansion from the sale of additional modules and the addition of new restaurant locations. A key factor to our success in executing our expansion strategy will be our ability to retain our existing and future restaurant customers. Our long-term, direct digital ordering contracts with our customers provide us the opportunity to form unique trusted partnerships with our restaurant brands, further enhancing our ability to satisfy and retain our customers. Our contracts typically have initial terms of three years or longer, with continuous one-to-two-year automatic renewal periods, providing visibility into our future performance. 
 One indication of our ability to grow within our customer base, through the development of our products that our customers value, is our average revenue per unit. We calculate our average revenue per unit by dividing the total platform revenue in a given period by the average active locations in that same period. We believe this demonstrates our ability to grow within our customer base through the development of our products that our customers value. Our ability to retain and increase revenue from existing customers will depend on a number of factors, including fluctuations in our customers spending levels, our customers ability to deploy our modules, fluctuations in the number of transactions processed by our customers on the platform, the average number of active locations, and the ability of our customers to switch to a competitor or develop their own internal platform solutions. As previously disclosed, Wingstop Inc. rolled out an initiative to develop their own technology solution in the second quarter of 2024, while continuing to use Olo s API for Voice orders. The change to the Wingstop Inc. relationship has not been, and we believe will continue to not be, material to our business, results of operations, or financial condition. 
 The following summarizes our average revenue per unit and approximate number of active locations for the three months ended, or as of, each of the dates presented. 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Average Revenue Per Unit 850 742 Ending Active Locations 85,000 78,000 
 Another metric used to demonstrate the propensity of our customers to continue to work with and expand their relationship with us over time is our dollar-based net revenue retention, which compares our revenue from the same set of active customers in one period to the prior year period. An active customer is a specific restaurant brand that utilizes one or more of our modules in a given quarterly period. We calculate dollar-based net revenue retention as of a period-end by starting with the revenue, defined as platform revenue, from the cohort of all active customers as of 12 months prior to such period-end, or the prior period revenue. We then calculate the platform revenue from these same customers as of the current period-end, or the current period revenue. Current period revenue includes any expansion and is net of contraction or attrition over the last 12 months, but excludes platform revenue from new customers in the current period. We then divide the total current period revenue by the total prior period revenue to arrive at the point-in-time dollar-based net revenue retention. We believe that net revenue retention is an important metric to our investors, demonstrating our ability to retain our customers and expand their use of our modules over time, proving the stability of our revenue base and the long-term value of our customer relationships. 
 For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, net revenue retention exceeded 120 . We have maintained a net revenue retention in excess of 100 throughout the past several years, and expect to continue this trend in the near term as customers continue to adopt additional product modules such as Olo Pay, GDP, Marketing, Sentiment, and Host. 
 We believe that, in the near term, average revenue per unit and net revenue retention will be greater drivers of growth than total active locations. This is due to the potential opportunity for further multi-module penetration and continued growth in digital ordering across our existing customer base. Additionally, because multi-module penetration can vary across active locations, fluctuations in active locations may not be a clear indication of performance. An example of this would be when a brand has transitioned from our platform and the associated total revenue or revenue per unit of that brand is not material or less than our average.

 Enable Higher Transaction Volume 
 Transaction revenue will continue to be an important source of our growth. We intend to continue to work with our existing restaurant customers to enable higher transaction volume at their locations that utilize our products. Higher transaction volumes may enable us to generate additional subscription and transaction revenue. As on-demand digital commerce grows to represent a larger share of total food consumption, we expect to significantly benefit from this secular trend as we capture a portion of this increased on-demand digital commerce order volume. Not only does our software create the opportunity to drive more orders for our customers, but we also expect the industry s secular tailwinds to help increase transaction order volume as more guests order food through digital means, including on- and off-premise. As transaction volume increases, the subscription revenue we receive from certain subscription-based modules may also increase as customers subscribe for higher tier ordering packages to enable more transactions. Additionally, as we continue to expand our product offerings and improve our current software, we also believe that we may be able to increase our share of the transaction revenue that flows through our platform. Specifically, in February 2022, we announced the general availability of our payment solution, Olo Pay, which we believe can continue to increase our ability to generate transactional revenue. Our ability to increase transaction volume is dependent on, among other factors, macroeconomic conditions, as well as the continued shift to digital ordering for food consumption and our ability to capture a meaningful portion of that shift. 
 Add New Large Multi-Location and High-Growth Restaurant Brands 
 We believe there is a substantial opportunity to continue to grow our customer base across the U.S. restaurant industry, adding to our over 700 existing brands across approximately 85,000 active locations as of September 30, 2024. We define an active location as a unique restaurant location that is utilizing or subscribed to one or more of our modules in a quarterly period (depending on the module). Given this definition, active locations in any one quarter may not reflect: (i) the future impact of new customer wins as it can take some time for their locations to go live with our platform, or (ii) the customers who have indicated their intent to reduce or terminate their use of our platform in future periods. Of further note, not all of our customer locations may choose to utilize our products, and while we aim to deploy all of a customer s locations, not all locations may ultimately deploy. We intend to continue to drive new customer growth by leveraging our brand and experience within the industry and expanding our sales and marketing efforts. We have also historically pursued and will continue to target the most well-capitalized, fastest-growing restaurant brands in the industry. Our ability to attract new customers will depend on a number of factors, including our ability to innovate, the effectiveness and pricing of our new and existing modules, the growth of digital ordering, and the success of our marketing efforts. 
 Investment in Innovation and Growth 
 We have invested and intend to continue to invest in expanding the functionality of our current platform and broadening our capabilities to address new market opportunities, particularly around payments, data analytics, and on-premise dining. We also intend to continue to invest in enhancing awareness of our brand and developing more modules, features, and functionality that expand our capabilities to facilitate the extension of our platform to new use cases and industry verticals. We believe this strategy will provide new avenues for growth and allow us to continue to deliver differentiated, high-value outcomes to both our customers and stockholders. Specifically, we intend to invest in research and development to expand our existing modules and build new modules, sales and marketing to promote our modules to new and existing customers and in existing and expanded geographies, professional services to ensure the success of our customers implementations of our platform, and other operational and administrative functions to support our expected growth and requirements as a public company. For example, as Olo Pay continues to scale and we realize expanded Olo Pay adoption, we may experience increased processing and personnel-related costs. We expect our total operating expenses will increase over time and, in some cases, have short-term negative impacts on our operating margin. We also intend to continue to evaluate strategic acquisitions and investments in businesses and technologies to drive product and market expansion. Our future success is dependent, in part, on our ability to successfully develop, market, and sell new and existing modules to new and existing customers. 
 Grow Our Ecosystem 
 We plan to expand our current ecosystem of third-party partners to better support our customers. Our platform is highly configurable and deeply embedded into our customers disparate existing infrastructures. Our platform seamlessly integrates with technology providers across the restaurant ecosystem, including most POS systems, DSPs, OSPs, aggregators, payment processors, loyalty programs, on-premise ordering providers, kitchen display systems, labor management providers, inventory management providers, and reservation and customer relationship management platforms. We believe that we can leverage these unique partnerships to deliver additional value to our customers. We see opportunity to further broaden our partnership group and build upon the integrations we currently offer. We plan to continue to invest and expand our ecosystem 
 
 23 

Table Of Contents 

 of compatible third-party technology providers to allow us to service a broader network of restaurant brands. We believe that these technology partnerships make us a critical component for restaurant brands looking to enhance their digital ordering and delivery platforms. We intend to continue to invest in building functionality that further integrates our platform with additional third-party technology providers, which would expand our capabilities and facilitate the extension of our platform to new use cases and industry verticals. Our future success is dependent on our ability to continue to integrate with third-party technology providers in the restaurant ecosystem. 
 Expand Our Longer-Term Market Opportunity 
 While we have not made any significant investments in this area to date, we believe there is an opportunity to partner with small- and medium-sized businesses to enable their on-demand digital commerce presence. Additionally, as many of our customers operate internationally, we believe there is a significant opportunity to expand the usage of our platform outside of the United States. We also believe that our platform can be applied to other commerce verticals, beyond the restaurant industry, that are undergoing a similar digital transformation to deliver real-time experiences and on-demand fulfillment to guests. For example, we currently partner with a number of grocery chains who use our Ordering module to help their guests order ready-to-eat meals and may potentially expand these or other partnerships in the future. We anticipate that our operating expenses will increase as a result of these initiatives and, in some cases, have short-term negative impacts on our operating margin.

 Components of Results of Operations 
 Revenue 
 We generate revenue primarily from platform fees and professional services. 
 Platform 
 Platform revenue primarily consists of fees that provide customers access to one or more of our modules and standard customer support. Our contracts typically have initial terms of three years or longer, with continuous one-to-two-year automatic renewal periods. We generally bill monthly in arrears. A majority of our platform revenue is derived from our Order solutions, which consist of our Ordering, Dispatch, Rails, Switchboard, Network, Virtual Brands, Kiosk, Catering, and Sync modules. We also generate platform revenue from our Olo Pay module, which became commercially available during 2022, as well as from our Engage solutions, which consist of our GDP, Marketing, Sentiment, and Host modules. 
 Professional Services and Other 
 Professional services and other revenue primarily consists of fees paid to us by our customers for the implementation of our platform. The majority of our professional service fees are billed on a fixed fee basis upon execution of our agreement. 
 Cost of Revenue 
 Platform 
 Platform cost of revenue primarily consists of costs directly related to our platform services, including expenses for customer support and infrastructure personnel, including salaries, taxes, benefits, bonuses, and stock-based compensation, which we refer to as personnel costs, third-party software licenses, hosting, amortization of capitalized internal-use software and developed technology, payment processing, and allocated overhead. We expect platform cost of revenue to increase in absolute dollars in order to support additional customer and transaction volume growth on our platform. 
 Professional Services and Other 
 Professional services and other cost of revenue primarily consists of the personnel costs of our deployment team associated with delivering these services and allocated overhead. 
 Gross Profit 
 Gross profit, or revenue less cost of revenue, has been, and will continue to be, affected by various factors, including revenue fluctuations, our mix of revenue associated with various modules, the timing and amount of investments in personnel, increased hosting capacity to align with customer growth, and third-party licensing costs. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Our operating expenses consist of research and development, general and administrative, sales and marketing expenses, and restructuring charges. Personnel costs are the most significant component of operating expenses. 
 Research and Development 
 Research and development expenses primarily consist of engineering and product development personnel costs and allocated overhead costs. Research and development costs exclude capitalized internal-use software development costs, as they are capitalized as a component of property and equipment, net and amortized to platform cost of revenue over the term of their estimated useful life. We anticipate investments in this area to increase on an absolute dollar basis, but to decrease as a percentage of revenue over time, as we balance growth initiatives and investments in innovative solutions to support our customers rapidly evolving needs. 
 
 25 

Table Of Contents 

 General and Administrative 
 General and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel costs and contractor fees for finance, legal, human resources, information technology, and other administrative functions. In addition, general and administrative expenses include amortization of trademarks, travel-related expenses, and allocated overhead. We also incur additional general and administrative expenses as a result of operating as a public company. We expect that our general and administrative expenses will continue to grow on an absolute dollar basis while declining as a percentage of revenue as we continue to scale our operations over time. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 Sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of sales, marketing, and other personnel costs, commissions, general marketing, amortization of customer relationships, promotional activities, and allocated overhead costs. Sales commissions earned by our sales force are deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected benefit period. We plan to continue to invest in sales and marketing by expanding our go-to-market activities, including sponsoring additional marketing events and trade shows. We expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase on an absolute dollar basis, but decline as a percentage of revenue, over time. 
 Restructuring Charges 
 Restructuring charges are comprised of severance costs, payroll taxes, benefits, and stock-based compensation expense associated with the accelerated vesting of equity awards. These charges were incurred as a result of our completed workforce reductions in the third quarter of 2024 and the second quarter of 2023. 
 Other Income, Net 
 Other income, net consists primarily of income earned on our investments and money-market funds in cash and cash equivalents, partially offset by interest expense related to our credit facility. 
 Provision for Income Taxes 
 Provision for income taxes primarily relates to U.S. state income taxes where we conduct business.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 General 
 As of September 30, 2024, our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments in marketable securities, totaling 391.9 million, which was held for working capital purposes and to fund repurchases of our Class A common stock (as described more fully below), as well as the available balance of our revolving line of credit, described further below. 
 We have financed our operations primarily through payments received from customers and sales of our equity securities. 
 On September 7, 2022, the Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to 100 million of our Class A common stock, or the Stock Buyback Program. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 4,173,999 shares of our Class A common stock for approximately 22.2 million under the Stock Buyback Program, completing this program. 
 On April 30, 2024, the Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to 100 million of our Class A common stock, or the 2024 Buyback Program. Under the 2024 Buyback Program, we may repurchase shares of our Class A common stock from time to time on a discretionary basis through open market repurchases, privately negotiated transactions, block purchases or other means, and such repurchases will be structured to occur in compliance with applicable securities laws. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased, if any, will be determined by the Board of Directors or a committee established by the Board of Directors, depending on a variety of factors, including the Class A common stock price, trading volume, market conditions, our cash flow and liquidity profile, the capital needs of the business, and other considerations. We expect to fund repurchases with existing cash on hand. The 2024 Buyback Program has no expiration date and may be modified, suspended, or terminated at any time by the Board of Directors at its discretion. We have not made any repurchases under the 2024 Buyback Program. 
 We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, and amounts available under our outstanding credit facility will be sufficient to support our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to, our obligation to repay any balance under our credit facility if we were to borrow against the facility in the future, our platform revenue growth rate, receivable and payable cycles, and the timing and extent of investments in research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses. 
 Credit Facility 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 68.6 million of commitments available under the Second Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement with Banc of California (formerly known as Pacific Western Bank), after consideration of 1.4 million in our letter of credit on the lease of our corporate headquarters at One World Trade Center. As of September 30, 2024, we had no outstanding borrowings under the line of credit , and no amounts have been drawn against any of our letters of credit.

Table Of Contents 

 Operating Activities 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by operating activities was 30.4 million, primarily due to a net loss of 0.3 million adjusted for non-cash charges of 47.4 million, partially offset by a net decrease attributable to our operating assets and liabilities of 16.8 million. The non-cash adjustments primarily relate to stock-based compensation charges of 31.8 million, depreciation and amortization expense of 10.4 million, and provision for expected credit losses of 3.8 million. The net decrease attributable to our operating assets and liabilities was primarily driven by a decrease in accrued expenses of 20.2 million related primarily to the relief of a liability related to a legal settlement, payment of fees owed to delivery service providers, vendors, and the payment of accrued compensation offset by a decrease in accounts receivable of 10.6 million. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash provided by operating activities was 12.4 million, primarily due to a net loss of 42.5 million adjusted for non-cash charges of 51.5 million, and a net decrease attributable to our operating assets and liabilities of 21.3 million. The non-cash adjustments primarily related to stock-based compensation charges of 41.3 million and depreciation and amortization expense of 7.3 million, and a charge related to a charitable donor-advised fund of 1.1 million. The net decrease attributable to our operating assets and liabilities was primarily driven by an increase in accounts receivable of 23.6 million due primarily to higher days sales outstanding for the period, driven in part by a change in billing timing. This was partially offset by an increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities of 7.2 million related primarily to higher fees owed to delivery service providers and a liability related to cash received on behalf of the subtenant of our corporate headquarters at One World Trade Center in advance of certain future rental obligations that were due from the subtenant. 
 Investing Activities 
 Cash used in investing activities was 17.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to 7.6 million of net purchases of investments and 9.5 million for the development of capitalized internal-use software to support further product development. 
 Cash used in investing activities was 18.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to 8.3 million of net purchases of investments and 10.0 million for the development of capitalized internal-use software to support further product development. 
 Financing Activities 
 Cash used by financing activities was 18.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily driven by 22.2 million of stock repurchases under the Stock Buyback Program, partially offset by 3.6 million of net proceeds from the exercise of stock options and purchases under the employee stock purchase plan. 
 Cash used by financing activities was 32.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily driven by 43.1 million of stock repurchases under the Stock Buyback Program, partially offset by 10.2 million of net proceeds from the exercise of stock options and purchases under the employee stock purchase plan. 
 
 Material Cash Requirements 
 There were no material changes in our material cash requirements during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from the obligations and commitments disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 21, 2024. See Note 11 Leases and Note 16 Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources included in Part II, Item 8 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, for additional information regarding our material cash requirements.

 Certain Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 We report our financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. To supplement our financial statements, we provide investors with non-GAAP operating income and free cash flow, each of which is a non-GAAP financial measure, and certain key performance indicators, including GMV, GPV, net revenue retention, average revenue per unit, and active locations. 
 Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures and key performance indicators, in conjunction with financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP for planning purposes, including in the preparation of our annual operating budget, as a measure of our core operating results and the effectiveness of our business strategy, and in evaluating our financial performance. These measures provide consistency and comparability with past financial performance as measured by such non-GAAP figures, facilitate period-to-period comparisons of core operating results, and assist shareholders in better evaluating us by presenting period-over-period operating results without the effect of certain charges or benefits that may not be consistent or comparable across periods or compared to other registrants similarly named non-GAAP financial measures and key performance indicators. 
 We adjust our GAAP financial measures for the following items to calculate non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin: stock-based compensation expense (non-cash expense calculated by companies using a variety of valuation methodologies and subjective assumptions) and related payroll tax expense, equity expense related to charitable contributions of our Class A common stock (non-cash expense), certain litigation-related expenses, net of recoveries (which relate to legal and other professional fees associated with litigation-related matters that are not indicative of our core operations and are not part of our normal course of business), loss on disposal of assets, capitalized internal-use software and intangible amortization (non-cash expense), non-cash impairment charges, restructuring charges, certain severance costs, and transaction costs (typically incurred within one year of the related acquisition). Management believes that it is useful to exclude certain non-cash charges and non-core operational charges from our non-GAAP financial measures because: (1) the amount of such expenses in any specific period may not directly correlate to the underlying performance of our business operations and we believe does not relate to ongoing operational performance; and (2) such expenses can vary significantly between periods. 
 Free cash flow represents net cash provided by or used in operating activities, reduced by purchases of property and equipment and capitalization of internal-use software. Free cash flow is a measure used by management to understand and evaluate our liquidity and to generate future operating plans. Free cash flow excludes items that we do not consider to be indicative of our liquidity and facilitates comparisons of our liquidity on a period-to-period basis. Management believes providing free cash flow provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating the strength of our liquidity and future ability to generate cash that can be used for strategic opportunities or investing in our business from the perspective of our management and Board of Directors. 
 Our use of non-GAAP financial measures and key performance indicators has limitations as an analytical tool, and these measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of financial results as reported under GAAP. Because our non-GAAP financial measures and key performance indicators are not calculated in accordance with GAAP, they may not necessarily be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, equity, revenue, expenses, and related disclosures. We base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ from those estimates. 
 
 There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to those disclosed under the heading Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 21, 2024.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. 
 We are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily a result of exposure to potential changes in interest rates. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes and have not used any derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk exposure. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Our primary market risk exposure is changing interest rates in connection with our investments and the Second Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement with Pacific Western Bank (now known as Banc of California). Interest rate risk is highly sensitive due to many factors, including U.S. monetary and tax policies, U.S. and international economic factors, and other factors beyond our control. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, advances under the formula revolving line of the Second Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement bear interest equal to the greater of (A) the Prime Rate then in effect; or (B) 3.25 . As of September 30, 2024, advances under the term loans bear interest equal to the greater of (A) 0.25 above the Prime Rate then in effect; or (B) 3.50 . As of September 30, 2024, we had no outstanding borrowings under our credit facility. 
 
 Our interest-earning instruments also carry a degree of interest rate risk. Our cash and cash equivalents have a relatively short maturity, and are therefore relatively insensitive to interest rate changes. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 272.2 million. We invest in money market funds, U.S. and municipal government agency securities, corporate bonds and notes, certificates of deposit, and commercial paper. Our current investment policy seeks first to preserve principal, second to provide liquidity for our operating and capital needs, and third to maximize yield without putting our principal at risk. As of September 30, 2024, we invested 142.2 million of our cash and cash equivalents in money market funds. We also invested 119.7 million in other securities, of which 77.5 million was classified as short-term. Because the majority of our investment portfolio is short-term in nature, we do not believe an immediate 10 increase in interest rates would have a material effect on the fair market value of our portfolio, and therefore we do not expect our results of operations or cash flows to be materially affected by a sudden change in market interest rates. 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Risks 
 Our revenue and costs are generally denominated in U.S. dollars and are not subject to foreign currency exchange risk. However, to the extent we commence generating revenue outside of the United States that is denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, our results of operations could be impacted by changes in exchange rates. A hypothetical 10 strengthening or weakening in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the foreign currencies in which our revenues and expenses are denominated would not result in a material impact to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 Inflation Risk 
 Inflation has remained at historically high levels in the U.S. and overseas, resulting in rising transportation, wages, and other costs. The primary inflation factors affecting our business are increased cost of labor and overhead costs. However, we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. If our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. Our inability or failure to do so could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or Exchange Act), as of September 30, 2024. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act, during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 
 Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

 PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 A description of our legal proceedings is included in and incorporated by reference to Note 10 Commitments and Contingencies of the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 Investing in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including the section titled Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes, as well as in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 21, 2024 and our other filings with the SEC, before making any investment decision with respect to our securities. The risks and uncertainties described below and in our other filings with the SEC, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 21, 2024, may not be the only ones we face. If any of the risks actually occur, our business could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the market price of our Class A common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment. 
 
 The following description includes risk factors associated with our business previously disclosed in Part I, Item 1A of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, filed with the SEC on May 7, 2024, our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, filed with the SEC on July 31, 2024, and new risk factors and material changes to risk factors associated with our business previously disclosed in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 21, 2024, under the heading Risk Factors. 
 
 Legal, Regulatory, Compliance, and Reputational Risks 
 
 We and our third-party partners and service providers transmit and store personal information of our customers and guests. We anticipate that Olo, or our third-party partners and service providers, may be the target of future cybersecurity attacks which may result in personal information, confidential information, or credit card information being compromised or accessed without or beyond authorization, which could interrupt our business, result in our reputation being harmed, and expose us to liability and loss of business. 
 
 Our business involves the collection, transmission, and storage of the personal information and confidential information of our partners, our customers and their guests, and guests with whom we have a direct relationship. Cybersecurity incidents or data breaches can originate either externally, such as through our customers, our third-party partners, or service providers, or internally. There may in the future be successful attempts by third parties to obtain unauthorized access to the personal information of our partners, our customers, and guests. This information could also be exposed through human error, malfeasance, or otherwise. The unauthorized disclosure, unauthorized access, or compromise of this information could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Even if such a cybersecurity incident or data breach does not arise out of our actions or inactions, or directly impact our business, the resulting guest concern arising from a customer, partner, or service provider cybersecurity incident or data breach could negatively affect our customers and our business. 
 
 We do not proactively monitor or control our customers content uploaded to our platform(s) or on our servers, or information made available through third-party integrations that our customers use in connection with our platform, which may include personal information or confidential information. We integrate with a number of third-party partners in order to meet our customers needs, and although we contractually require our customers to ensure the security of such partners, a cybersecurity incident or data breach of one of these providers could become negatively associated with our brand or our assistance in responding to such a breach could tie up our internal resources. Additionally, we use service providers to help deliver services to our customers and guests. These service providers may handle or store personal information, credit card information, or confidential information. By the nature of the integrations and the constantly evolving techniques used to obtain access, compromise, or interrupt the integrity of systems, we could get drawn into any resulting lawsuits. We are also subject to federal, state, provincial, and other laws regarding cybersecurity and data protection. Although we have taken measures to monitor and protect our systems within our control and ensure that those third parties which have access to our platform maintain adequate security, we cannot guarantee that these measures will protect our systems from a security incident in the 
 43 

Table Of Contents 

 future. Some jurisdictions have enacted laws requiring companies to notify affected individuals or government agencies of data breaches involving certain types of personal information and our agreements with customers and partners require us to notify them in the event of certain security incidents. Additionally, an increasing number of jurisdictions, as well as our contracts with certain customers, require us to maintain industry-standard or reasonable measures to safeguard personal information or confidential information. This includes safeguards related to credit card information and sensitive authentication data which is transmitted through our platform. We are required by card networks and our contracts with payment processors to adhere to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards. 
 
 Our failure to comply with legal, regulatory or contractual requirements, and the rules of payment card networks and self-regulatory organizations cybersecurity or data protection requirements could lead to significant fines and penalties imposed by regulators and card networks, as well as claims by our customers, guests or other relevant stakeholders. These claims could force us to spend money in defense or settlement of these proceedings, result in the imposition of monetary liability or injunctive relief, divert management s time and attention, increase our costs of doing business, and materially adversely affect our reputation and the demand for our platform. In addition, if our security measures fail to protect personal information or confidential information, including payment information, adequately, we could be liable to our partners, our customers, and guests for their losses as well as for statutory damages. As a result, we could be subject to fines, face regulatory or other legal action, and our customers could lose their confidence with us, which all could negatively impact our business. There can be no assurance that the limitations of liability in our contracts would be enforceable or adequate or would otherwise protect us from any such liabilities or damages with respect to any particular claim. We also cannot be sure that our existing insurance coverage and coverage for errors and omissions will continue to be available on acceptable terms or be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims, or that our insurers will not deny coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceeds our available insurance coverage or changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases, or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 
 
 Payment transactions processed on our platform and through the Olo Pay module may subject us to regulatory requirements and the rules of payment card networks, and other risks that could be costly and difficult to comply with or could harm our business. 
 
 We began commercially offering Olo Pay in the first quarter of 2022. In connection with this offering, the payment card networks require us to comply with payment card network operating rules, including special operating rules that apply to us as a payment service provider that provides payment processing-related services to merchants and payment processors. The payment card networks set these network rules and they have discretion to interpret them and change them, including in ways that may limit our ability to offer Olo Pay. We have also agreed, via our contracts with our payment processing partners, to comply with certain contractual obligations in addition to the payment card network operating rules. Through our offering of Olo Pay, we have agreed to reimburse our payment processor partners for fines they are assessed by payment card networks as a result of any rule violations by us or our customers. We are also required to reimburse guests for chargebacks not funded by our customers. Any changes to or interpretations of the network rules that are inconsistent with the way we and the payment processors and customers currently operate may require us to make changes to our business that could be costly or difficult to implement. If we fail to make such changes or otherwise resolve the issue with the payment card networks, they could fine us, cancel or suspend our registration as a payment service provider, or prohibit us from processing payment cards on their networks, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. In addition, violations of the network rules or any failure to maintain good standing with the payment processing partners and payment card networks as a payment service provider could impact our ability to facilitate payment card transactions on our platform, increase our costs, or otherwise harm our business. If we were unable to facilitate payment card transactions on our platform or were limited in our ability to do so, our business would be materially and adversely affected. 
 
 If we fail to comply with the rules and regulations adopted by the payment card networks, we could also be in breach of our contractual obligations to our payment processors, financial institutions, customers, or partners. Such failure to comply may subject us to fines, penalties, damages, higher transaction fees, and civil liability, and could eventually prevent us from processing or accepting payment cards or could lead to a loss of payment processor partners. In the event that we are found to be in violation of any of these legal or regulatory requirements, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be harmed. 
 
 Currently, we substantially rely on a limited number of third-party payment processors to facilitate payments made by guests and payments made to customers through the Olo Pay module. While we may develop payment processing relationships with other payment processors, we expect to continue to rely on a limited number of payment processors for the foreseeable future. In the event that any of our third-party payment processors fail to maintain adequate levels of support, experience 
 44 

Table Of Contents 

 interrupted operations, do not provide high quality service, increase the fees they charge us, discontinue their lines of business, terminate their contractual arrangements with us, or cease or reduce operations, we may suffer additional costs and be required to pursue new third-party relationships, which could materially disrupt our operations and our ability to provide our products and services, and could divert management s time and resources. In addition, such incidents could result in periods of time during which our platform cannot function properly, and therefore may not collect payments from customers and their guests, which could adversely affect our relationships with our customers and our business, reputation, brand, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 
 We believe the licensing and registration requirements of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network and state agencies that regulate banks, money service businesses, money transmitters, and other providers of electronic commerce services do not apply to us. One or more governmental agencies may conclude that, under its statutes or regulations, we are engaged in activity requiring licensing or registration. In that event, we may be subject to monetary penalties and adverse publicity and may be required to cease doing business with residents of those jurisdictions until we obtain the requisite license or registration. 
 
 We have also recently become a payment facilitator. As a payment facilitator, we must comply with additional provisions of the payment card network operating rules and additional contractual obligations. In addition to the risks described above, being a payment facilitator means that we may be contractually required to assume more risk on behalf of our customers that use Olo Pay. Specifically, we may be contractually obligated to manage fraud costs to the extent they are facilitated by our customers through Olo Pay. In addition, we have implemented a process to evaluate the risk posed by potential losses, including but not limited to losses resulting from data security incidents, instances of fraud, and increased chargebacks by our customers and potential customers to minimize the risk of onboarding or supporting customers that pose elevated risk of such potential losses. We may be subject to liability from losses caused by such elevated risk customers. Failure to meet the obligations imposed on payment facilitators could adversely affect our customer relationships, business, reputation, brand, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 
 Employee Related Risks 
 
 If we cannot maintain our corporate culture as we grow, our success and our business and competitive position may be harmed. 
 
 We believe that a key contributor to our success to date has been our corporate culture, which is based on transparency, innovation, and entrepreneurial spirit. Any failure to preserve our culture could negatively affect our ability to retain and recruit personnel, which is critical to our growth, and to effectively focus on and pursue our corporate objectives. In June 2023 and September 2024, we announced workforce reductions impacting approximately 11 and 9 of our workforce, respectively, as part of our efforts to reorganize our business units to better focus our investments on customer needs and to support our long-term growth objectives, or Restructuring Plans. The workforce reductions may make it more difficult to preserve our company culture and may negatively impact employee morale. In addition, anticipated headcount growth and our policy permitting all of our employees, inclusive of those local to our New York City headquarters, to elect whether to work remotely or from the office may make it difficult to maintain important aspects of our culture. If we fail to maintain our corporate culture, or if we are unable to retain or hire key personnel, our business and competitive position may be harmed. 
 
 If we are unable to hire, retain, and motivate qualified personnel, our business may be adversely affected. 
 
 Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to continue to attract and retain highly skilled personnel. Competition for certain of these personnel is substantial, especially for engineers experienced in designing and developing SaaS or on-demand digital commerce applications, products managers and designers, and experienced enterprise sales professionals. 
 
 Further, our ability to increase our customer base, especially among restaurant brands, small-to-medium businesses, potential international customers, and other customers we may pursue, or to achieve broader market acceptance of our platform will depend, in part, on our ability to effectively organize, focus, and train our sales, marketing, and customer success personnel. 
 
 Our ability to convince restaurant brands to use our platform or adopt additional modules will depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain sales personnel with experience selling to large enterprises. We believe that there is significant competition for experienced sales professionals with the skills and technical knowledge that we require. Our ability to achieve revenue growth in the future will depend, in part, on our ability to recruit, train, and retain a sufficient number of experienced sales professionals, particularly those with experience selling to restaurant brands or large enterprises. In addition, even if we 
 45 

Table Of Contents 

 are successful in hiring qualified sales personnel, new hires require significant training and experience before they achieve full productivity, particularly for sales efforts targeted at restaurant brands and new territories. Our recent hires and planned hires may not become as productive as quickly as we expect and we may be unable to hire or retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals in the future in the markets where we do business. 
 
 In the past we have experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, difficulty in hiring employees with appropriate qualifications. In many markets, competition for qualified individuals is substantial and we may be unable to identify and attract a sufficient number of individuals to meet our growing needs, especially in markets where our brand is less established. As a result, because we aim to hire top talent, we may be required to pay higher wages or provide increased levels of benefits. Our commitment to taking care of our team may cause us to incur higher labor costs compared to other technology companies. We also place a heavy emphasis on the qualification and training of our team members, and spend a significant amount of time and money training our team members. Any inability to recruit and retain qualified individuals may result in higher turnover and increased labor costs, and could compromise the quality of our service, all of which could adversely affect our business. Many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have. If we hire employees from competitors or other companies, their former employers may attempt to assert that these employees or we have breached their legal obligations, resulting in additional costs and a diversion of our time and resources. The workforce reductions we have implemented as part of our Restructuring Plans may negatively impact our ability to attract, integrate, retain, and motivate highly qualified employees, and may harm our reputation with current or prospective employees. In addition, prospective and existing employees often consider the value of the equity awards they receive in connection with their employment. Capital markets have been volatile, which may cause the perceived value of our equity awards to decline and cause prospective employees to believe there is limited upside to the value of our equity awards, which would adversely affect our ability to recruit and retain key employees. If we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business and future growth prospects could be harmed. 
 
 Risks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock 
 
 We may not realize the anticipated long-term stockholder value of our stock buyback programs, and any failure to repurchase our Class A common stock after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our stock price. Share repurchases could also increase the volatility of our stock price and diminish our cash reserves. 
 
 We have authorized stock buyback programs in the past and may authorize other stock buyback programs in the future to repurchase shares of our Class A common stock. On April 30, 2024, the Board of Directors authorized the 2024 Buyback Program. Such repurchases may be made from time to time on a discretionary basis through open market repurchases, privately negotiated transactions, block purchases, or other means, and will be structured to occur in compliance with applicable securities laws. The 2024 Buyback Program does not have an expiration date or obligate us to repurchase any specific dollar amount or acquire any specific number of shares. Further, the 2024 Buyback Program may be modified, suspended or terminated at any time by the Board of Directors at its discretion. 
 
 Any failure to repurchase our Class A common stock after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our reputation and investor confidence in us and may negatively impact our stock price. 
 
 The existence of our stock buyback programs could cause our stock price to trade higher than it otherwise would. Although the programs are intended to enhance long-term stockholder value, there is no assurance they will do so because the market price of our Class A common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares and short-term stock price fluctuations could reduce the effectiveness of the programs. 
 
 Repurchasing our Class A common stock will reduce the amount of cash we have available to fund working capital, capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, or business opportunities, and other general corporate purposes, and we may fail to realize the anticipated long-term stockholder value of our stock buyback programs. Furthermore, the timing and amount of any repurchases, if any, will be subject to liquidity, market and economic conditions, compliance with applicable legal requirements such as Delaware surplus and solvency tests, and other relevant factors.
