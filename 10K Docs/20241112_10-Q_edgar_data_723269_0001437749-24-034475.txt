Level 1 Valuations based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access. Valuation adjustments and block discounts are not applied to Level 1 instruments. Since valuations are based on quoted prices that are readily and regularly available in an active market, valuation of these products does not entail a significant degree of judgment. 

Level 2 Valuations based on one or more quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly. 

Level 3 Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. 

In all cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls has been determined based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. 

The Company s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis include cash, accounts payable, accrued expenses, and interest payable given their short-term nature. Furthermore, the fair value of the Company s notes payable are initially measured at fair value given that they are estimated based on current rates that would be available for debt of similar terms. 

The following tables provide information about the Company s financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 by the fair value hierarchy:

The following table presents additional information about Level 3 assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis for nine months ended September 30, 2024. Both observable and unobservable inputs may be used to determine the fair value of positions that the Company has classified within the Level 3 category.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULT OF OPERATIONS 

SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

Certain of the statements in this document that are not historical facts, including, without limitation, statements of future expectations, projections of financial condition and results of operations, statements of future economic performance and other forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of the Company to differ materially from those contemplated in such forward-looking statements. In addition to the specific matters referred to herein, important factors which may cause actual results to differ from those contemplated in such forward-looking statements include (i) the results of the Company s efforts to implement its business strategy; (ii) actions of the Company s competitors and the Company s ability to respond to such actions; (iii) changes in governmental regulation, tax rates and similar matters; and (iv) other risks detailed in the Company s other filings with the SEC 

USE OF ESTIMATES AND CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and related disclosure. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to non-marketable securities. We base our estimates on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions. These estimates and judgments are reviewed by management on an ongoing basis and by our board of directors at the end of each quarter prior to the public release of our financial results. 

As of the date of the filing of this quarterly report, we believe there have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates during the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared to those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014 as filed with the SEC. Additional information about these critical accounting policies may be found in the "Management's Discussion Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" section included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 

Total loss decreased from 620 to 127 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to September 30, 2023. This increase was due to a smaller Mark to Market loss. Operating expenses for three months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 22,309 a decrease of 44,949 or 67 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in officer incentive stock options amortization, as a portion of options previously granted are now fully vested. 

Nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 

Total income was 86,515 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 88,975 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was due to a realized gain on a stock sale as well as a dividend payment during 2024. Operating expenses for nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 133,244, a decrease of 90,457 or 40 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was due to a decrease in officer incentive stock options amortization during 2024 as well as a decrease in general and administrative expenses. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

The Company has a line of credit arrangement with First Republic Bank with a borrowing limit of 350,000 with interest based upon the lender s prime rate plus 4.5 . Interest is currently payable monthly at 7.75 . The line is guaranteed by William R. Hambrecht, Chief Executive Officer, Director. The line of credit is due on demand and is secured by all of the Company s business assets. At September 30, 2024 the outstanding balance under the line was 348,843.

The Company may obtain additional equity or working capital through additional bank borrowings, debt conversion to common stock, and public or private sales of equity securities. The Company may also borrow additional funds from Mr. William R. Hambrecht. There can be no assurance, however, that such additional financing will be available on terms favorable to the Company, or at all. 

Trends and Uncertainties 

Termination of Historical Business Lines 

Since winding down the Company s traditional lines of business, Management and the Board of Directors have been seeking appropriate business opportunities for the Company. The Company s cash assets are invested in corporate securities and demand deposit accounts. If the Company does not find an operating entity to combine with, and if its assets are not invested in certain types of securities (primarily government securities), it may be deemed to be an investment company under the terms of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

We are a Smaller Reporting Company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are not required to provide the information under this item. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) as of September 30, 2024 in connection with the filing of the Annual Report on Form 10K. Based on that evaluation our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, in light of the material weakness described below, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in rules and forms of the SEC and is accumulated and communicated to our management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Notwithstanding the material weakness, our company s financial statements in this Form 10Q fairly present in all material respects, the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of our company as of and for the periods presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

Management s Report on Internal Controls over Financial Reporting 

The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements. 

All internal controls over financial reporting, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of controls. Therefore, even effective internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Further, because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting may vary over time.

Table of Contents 

Our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024. In making its assessment of internal control over financial reporting, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control Integrated Framework. Based on our evaluation, management concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective based on those criteria, because of the existence of the following material weaknesses: 

1) 

The Company does not have an independent Audit Committee; however the Company is exploring forming one. 

2) 

Our limited number of employees which is a structural issue, results in the Company s inability to have a sufficient segregation of duties within its accounting and financial reporting activities. 

These absences constitute material weaknesses in the Company s corporate governance structure. 

This quarterly report does not include an attestation report of the Company s independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting because the Company is a smaller reporting company.
