 revenue streams, company-operated restaurant revenue and franchise related revenue. Company-operated restaurant revenue Revenues from the operation of company-operated restaurants are recognized as food and beverage products are delivered to customers and payment is tendered at the time of sale. The Company presents sales, net of sales-related taxes and promotional allowances. The Company offers a loyalty rewards program, which awards points to a customer for dollars spent. Customers earn points for each dollar spent and points can be redeemed for multiple redemption options. If a customer does not earn or use points within a period, their account is deactivated and all points expire. When a customer is part of the rewards program, the obligation to provide future discounts related to points earned is considered a separate performance obligation, to which a portion of the transaction price is allocated. The performance obligation related to loyalty points is deemed to have been satisfied, and the amount deferred in the balance sheet is recognized as revenue, when the points are transferred to a reward and redeemed, the reward or points have expired, or the likelihood of redemption is remote. A portion of the transaction price is allocated to loyalty points, if necessary, on a pro-rata basis, based on stand-alone selling price, as determined by menu pricing and loyalty points terms. As of September 25, 2024 and December 27, 2023, the revenue allocated to loyalty points that have not been redeemed was million and million, respectively, which is reflected in the Company s accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets within other accrued expenses and current liabilities. The Company expects the loyalty points to be redeemed and recognized over a period. The Company sells gift cards to its customers in the restaurants and through selected third parties. The gift cards sold to customers have no stated expiration dates and are subject to actual and/or potential escheatment rights in several of the jurisdictions in which the Company operates. Furthermore, due to these escheatment rights, the Company does not recognize breakage related to the sale of gift cards due to the immateriality of the amount remaining after escheatment. The Company recognizes income from gift cards when redeemed by the customer. Unredeemed gift card balances are deferred and recorded as other accrued expenses on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. Franchise and franchise advertising fee revenue Franchise revenue consists of franchise royalties, initial franchise fees, license fees due from franchisees, IT support services, and rental income for subleases to franchisees. Franchise advertising fee revenue consists of advertising contributions received from franchisees. These revenue streams are made up of the following performance obligations: Franchise license - inclusive of advertising services, development agreements, training, access to plans and help desk services. Discounted renewal option. Hardware services. 
 The Company satisfies the performance obligation related to the franchise license over the term of the franchise agreement, which is typically . Payment for the franchise license consists of three components, a fixed-fee related to the franchise/development agreement, a sales-based royalty fee and a sales-based advertising fee. The fixed fee, as determined by the signed development and/or franchise agreement, is due at the time the development agreement is entered into, and/or when the franchise agreement is signed, and does not include a finance component. The sales-based royalty fee and sales-based advertising fee are considered variable consideration and will continue to be recognized as revenue as such sales are earned by the franchisees. Both sales-based fees qualify under the royalty constraint exception, and do not require an estimate of future transaction price. Additionally, the Company is utilizing the practical expedient available under ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers Topic 606

 renewal. This performance obligation is satisfied over the renewal term, typically or , while payment is fixed and due at the time the renewal is signed. The Company purchases hardware, such as scanners, printers, cash registers and tablets, from third party vendors, which it then sells to franchisees. As the Company is considered the principal in this relationship, payment for the hardware is considered revenue, and is received upon transfer of the goods from the Company to the franchisee. As of September 25, 2024, there were performance obligations related to hardware services that were unsatisfied or partially satisfied.

The Company receives area development fees from franchisees when they execute multi-unit area development agreements. Initial franchise and license fees, or franchise renewal fees, are received from franchisees upon the execution of, or renewal of, a franchise agreement. Revenue is recognized from these agreements as the underlying performance obligation is satisfied, which is over the term of the agreement.

 facility and equipment leases that are classified as finance leases. Restaurants are operated under lease arrangements that generally provide for a fixed base rent and, in some instances, contingent rent based on a percentage of gross operating profit or net revenues in excess of a defined amount. Additionally, a number of the Company s leases have payments that increase at pre-determined dates based on the change in the consumer price index. For all leases, the Company also reimburses the landlord for non-lease components, or items that are not considered components of a contract, such as CAM, property tax and insurance costs. While the Company determined not to separate lease and non-lease components, these payments are based on actual costs, making them variable consideration and excluding them from the calculations of the ROU asset and lease liability. The initial terms of land and restaurant building leases are generally , exclusive of options to renew. These leases typically have 5-year renewal , which have generally been excluded in the calculation of the ROU asset and lease liability, as they are not considered reasonably certain to be exercised, unless there have been significant leasehold improvements that have a useful life that extend past the original lease term. Furthermore, there are no value guarantees and no restrictions imposed by the lease. During the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 25, 2024, the Company reassessed the lease terms on and restaurants, respectively, due to certain triggering events, such as the addition of significant leasehold improvements with useful lives that extend past the current lease expiration, the decision to terminate a lease, or the decision to renew. As a result of the reassessment, an additional million and million of ROU asset and lease liabilities for the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 25, 2024, respectively, were recognized and will be amortized over the new lease term.

This reassessment resulted in an additional million and million of ROU asset and lease liabilities for the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 27, 2023, respectively, which were recognized and will be amortized over the new lease term. Additionally, as the Company adopted all practical expedients available under Topic 842, no reallocation between lease and non-lease components was necessary. The Company also subleases facilities to certain franchisees and other non-related parties which are also considered operating leases. Sublease income also includes contingent rental income based on net revenues. The vast majority of these leases have rights to extend terms via fixed rental increases. However, none of these leases have early termination rights, the right to purchase the premises or any residual value guarantees. The Company does not have any related party leases. During the thirty-nine weeks ended September 25, 2024, the Company did t record any non-cash impairment charges. During the thirty-nine weeks ended September 27, 2023, the Company recorded a less than million non-cash impairment charge related to the carrying value of ROU assets of restaurant in California. See Note 1, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Impairment of Property and Equipment and ROU Assets for additional information. Equipment Leases of equipment primarily consist of restaurant equipment, copiers and vehicles. These leases are fixed payments with no variable component. Additionally, no optional renewal periods have been included in the calculation of the ROU asset, there are no value guarantees and no restrictions imposed. Significant Assumptions and Judgments In applying the requirements of Topic 842, the Company made significant assumptions and judgments related to determination of whether a contract contains a lease and the discount rate used for the lease.

Market Trends and Uncertainties On September 28, 2023, Governor Newsom signed AB 1228 into law in California, which repealed and replaced the Fast Food Accountability and Standards Recovery Act (FAST Act) on January 1, 2024. Pursuant to AB 1228, the minimum wage at fast food restaurants that are part of brands which have more than 60 establishments nationwide was increased to 20 an hour on April 1, 2024, and a Fast Food Council created by AB 1228 will have limited power to approve annual wage increases until 2029. Under the law, the Fast Food Council will also have the power to develop and propose minimum standards for fast food workers, including standards for working hours, working conditions, and health and safety. As a result of AB 1228, we have experienced an increase in our labor and regulatory compliance costs and we expect these costs will continue to increase for the remainder of fiscal 2024 and that our results of operations and profitability will be adversely affected if we are not able to implement other measures to counter these increased costs. Additionally, we have experienced inflationary pressures affecting our operations in certain areas such as food cost, labor costs, construction costs and other restaurant operating costs. We have been able to substantially offset these inflationary and other cost pressures through various actions, such as increasing menu prices, managing menu mix, and productivity improvements. However, we expect these inflationary and other cost pressures to continue into the remainder of fiscal 2024 and we may not be able to offset cost increases in the future. Seasonality 

 29 

Table of Contents 
 Seasonal factors and the timing of holidays cause our revenue to fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Our revenue per restaurant is typically lower in the first and fourth quarters due to reduced January and December traffic and higher in the second and third quarters. As a result of seasonality, our quarterly and annual results of operations and our key performance indicators described below, such as company-operated restaurant revenue and comparable restaurant sales, may fluctuate. Growth Strategies and Outlook As of September 25, 2024, we had 496 locations in seven states. In fiscal 2023, we opened two new company-operated restaurants in Nevada, and our franchisees opened three new restaurants, one in California, one in Colorado and one in Utah. Additionally, we completed the sale of 18 restaurants within California, Utah and Texas to existing franchisees during fiscal 2023. For the thirty-nine weeks ended September 25, 2024, we opened one new company-operated restaurant in California, and our franchisees opened one new restaurant in California. Additionally, during the thirty-nine weeks ended September 25, 2024, we completed the sale of one restaurant in California to an existing franchisee. We plan to continue to expand our business, drive restaurant sales growth, and enhance our competitive positioning, by executing the following five key strategies: Brand That Wins; Hospitality Mindset; Digital First; Winning Unit Economics; and Drive Unit Growth Again with National Expansion. 
 To increase comparable restaurant sales, we plan to increase customer frequency, attract new customers, and improve per-person spend. The success of these growth plans is not guaranteed. Highlights and Trends Revenue Overview For the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 25, 2024, our total revenue was 120.4 million and 358.7 million, respectively. For the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 25, 2024, our company-operated restaurant revenue was 101.2 million and 300.6 million, respectively, and our franchise and franchise advertising fee revenue was 19.2 million and 58.1 million, respectively. Comparable Restaurant Sales For the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 25, 2024, system-wide comparable restaurant sales increased by 2.7 and 4.1 , respectively, from the comparable period in the prior year. For company-operated restaurants, comparable restaurant sales for the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 25, 2024 increased by 2.8 and 3.2 , respectively. For company-operated restaurants, the quarter s change in comparable restaurant sales consisted of an 11.3 increase in average check size, partially offset by a 7.6 decrease in transactions , and the year-to-date change in comparable restaurant sales consisted of a 7.5 increase in average check size, partially offset by a 4.0 decrease in transactions .

Restaurant Remodeling During the thirty-nine weeks ended September 25, 2024, we completed five company-operated restaurant remodels and 35 franchise remodels. Considering our efforts to finalize our new prototype design, we currently expect to complete 2-4 company-operated restaurant remodels and 5-10 franchise remodels for the remainder of fiscal 2024. The cost of our restaurant remodels varies depending on the scope of the work required, but on average the investment is 0.3 million to 0.4 million per restaurant. Loco Rewards Our Loco Rewards loyalty program offers rewards that incentivize customers to visit our restaurants more often each month. Customers earn points for each dollar spent and points can be redeemed for multiple redemption options. If a customer does not earn or use points within a one-year period, their account is deactivated and all points expire. When a customer is part of the rewards program, the obligation to provide future discounts related to points earned is considered a separate performance obligation, to which a portion of the transaction price is allocated. The performance obligation related to loyalty points is deemed to have been satisfied, and the amount deferred in the balance sheet is recognized as revenue, when the points are transferred to a reward and redeemed, the reward or points have expired, or the likelihood of redemption is remote. A portion of the transaction price is allocated to loyalty points on a pro-rata basis, based on stand-alone selling price, as determined by menu pricing and loyalty point s terms. In addition, customers can earn additional points and free entr es for a variety of engagement activities. As points are available for redemption past the quarter earned, a portion of the revenue associated with the earned points will be deferred until redemption or expiration. As of September 25, 2024 and December 27, 2023, the revenue allocated to loyalty points that had not been redeemed was 0.8 million and 0.7 million, respectively, which is reflected in our accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets within other accrued expenses and current liabilities. We had over 4.1 million loyalty program members as of September 25, 2024.

 Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates The preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under current circumstances in making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources. We evaluate our estimates on an on-going basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Accounting policies are an integral part of our condensed consolidated financial statements. A thorough understanding of these accounting policies is essential when reviewing our reported results of operations and our financial position. Management believes that our critical accounting policies and estimates involve the most difficult management judgments, due to the sensitivity of the methods and assumptions used. For a summary of our critical accounting policies and a discussion of our use of estimates, see Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates in Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 27, 2023. There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies or uses of estimates since our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 27, 2023. Key Financial Definitions Revenue Our revenue is derived from three primary sources: company-operated restaurant revenue, franchise revenue, which is comprised primarily of franchise royalties and, to a lesser extent, franchise fees and sublease rental income, and franchise advertising fee revenue. See Note 10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements above for further details regarding our revenue recognition policy. Food and Paper Costs Food and paper costs include the direct costs associated with food, beverage and packaging of our menu items. The components of food and paper costs are variable in nature, change with sales volume, are impacted by menu mix, and are subject to increases or decreases in commodity costs. Labor and Related Expenses Labor and related expenses include wages, payroll taxes, workers compensation expense, benefits, and bonuses paid to our restaurant management teams. Like other expense items, we expect labor costs to grow proportionately as our restaurant revenue grows. Factors that influence labor costs include minimum wage and payroll tax legislation, state labor laws (which, in California, may include AB 1228), overtime, wage inflation, the frequency and severity of workers compensation claims, health care costs, and the performance of our restaurants. Occupancy Costs and Other Operating Expenses Occupancy costs include rent, common area maintenance CAM ), and real estate taxes. Other restaurant operating expenses include the costs of utilities, advertising, credit card processing fees, restaurant supplies, repairs and maintenance, and other restaurant operating costs. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses are comprised of expenses associated with corporate and administrative functions that support the development and operations of our restaurants, including compensation and benefits, travel expenses, stock compensation costs, legal and professional fees, and other related corporate costs. Also included are pre-opening costs, and expenses above the restaurant level, including salaries for field management, such as area and regional managers, and franchise field operational support.

 Franchise Expenses Franchise expenses are primarily comprised of rent expenses incurred on properties leased by us and then sublet to franchisees, expenses incurred in support of franchisee information technology systems, and the franchisee s portion of advertising expenses. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization primarily consists of the depreciation of property and equipment, including leasehold improvements and equipment. Loss (Gain) on Disposal of Assets Loss (gain) on disposal of assets includes the loss or gain on disposal of assets related to retirements and replacement or write-off of leasehold improvements or equipment. Impairment and Closed-Store Reserves We review long-lived assets such as property, equipment, and intangibles on a unit-by-unit basis for impairment when events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. We determine if there is impairment at the restaurant level by comparing undiscounted future cash flows from the related long-lived assets to their respective carrying values and record an impairment charge when appropriate. In determining future cash flows, significant estimates are made by us with respect to future operating results of each restaurant over its remaining lease term, including sales trends, labor rates, commodity costs and other operating cost assumptions. If assets are determined to be impaired, the impairment charge is measured by calculating the amount by which the asset s carrying amount exceeds its fair value. This process of assessing fair values requires the use of estimates and assumptions, including our ability to sell or reuse the related assets and market conditions, which are subject to a high degree of judgment. If these assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets and these charges could be material. When we close a restaurant, we will evaluate the right of use ROU asset for impairment, based on anticipated sublease recoveries. The remaining value of the ROU asset is amortized on a straight-line basis, with the expense recognized in closed-store reserve expense, in addition to property tax and CAM charges for closed restaurants. Interest Expense, Net Interest expense, net, consists primarily of interest on our outstanding debt. Debt issuance costs are amortized at cost over the life of the related debt. Provision for Income Taxes Provision for income taxes consists of federal and state taxes on our income.

 Company-Operated Restaurant Revenue For the quarter ended September 25, 2024, company-operated restaurant revenue decreased 1.5 million, or 1.5 , from the comparable period in the prior year. The decrease in company-operated restaurant revenue was mainly due to a 5.3 million decrease related to the 19 company-operated restaurants sold by us to our existing franchisees during or subsequent to the third quarter of 2023. This company-operated restaurant revenue decrease was partially offset by an increase in company-operated comparable restaurant revenue of 2.7 million, or 2.8 as well as 0.5 million of additional sales from restaurants opened during or after the third quarter of 2023 The company-operated comparable restaurant sales increase consisted of an 11.3 increase in average check size due to increases in menu prices, partially offset by a 7.6 decrease in transactions. Year-to-date, company-operated restaurant revenue decreased 3.8 million, or 1.3 , from the comparable period in the prior year. The decrease in company-operated restaurant revenue was mainly due to a 15.7 million decrease related to the 19 company-operated restaurants sold by us to our existing franchisees during or subsequent to the first quarter of 2023. This company-operated restaurant revenue decrease was partially offset by 2.0 million of additional sales from restaurants opened during or after the first quarter of 2023 as well as an increase in company-operated comparable restaurant revenue of 9.3 million, or 3.2 . The company-operated comparable restaurant sales increase consisted of a 7.5 increase in average check size due to increases in menu prices, partially offset by a 4.0 decrease in transactions. Franchise Revenue For the quarter ended September 25, 2024, franchise revenue increased 1.1 million, or 10.5 , from the comparable period in the prior year. This increase was primarily due to a franchise comparable restaurant sales increase of 2.7 , three franchise-operated restaurant openings and 19 company-operated restaurants sold by us to our existing franchisees in each case, during or subsequent to the third quarter of 2023. Year-to-date, franchise revenue increased 4.3 million, or 14.3 , from the comparable period in the prior year. This increase was primarily due to a franchise comparable restaurant sales increase of 4.6 , four franchise-operated restaurant openings and 19 company-operated restaurants sold by us to our existing franchisees in each case, during or subsequent to the first quarter of 2023. Franchise Advertising Fee Revenue For the quarter ended September 25, 2024, franchise advertising fee revenue increased 0.4 million, or 6.0 , from the comparable period in the prior year. Year-to-date, franchise advertising fee revenue increased 1.9 million, or 8.5 , from the comparable period in the prior year. As advertising fee revenue is a percentage of franchisees revenue, both the quarter and year-to-date period fluctuations were due to the increases and decreases noted in franchise revenue above. Food and Paper Costs For the quarter ended September 25, 2024, food and paper costs decreased 2.2 million, or 7.8 . Year-to-date, food and paper costs decreased 6.2 million, or 7.4 , from the comparable period in the prior year. The decrease in food and paper costs for the quarter and year-to-date resulted primarily from a 1.5 million and 4.5 million reduction, respectively, related to the sale of 19 company-operated locations to franchisees, coupled with the 

 35 

Table of Contents 
 decline in transactions referenced above, partially offset by commodity inflation. For the quarter, food and paper costs as a percentage of company-operated restaurant revenue were 25.1 , down from 26.8 in the comparable period of the prior year. Year-to-date, food and paper costs as a percentage of company-operated restaurant revenue were 25.5 , down from 27.2 in the comparable period of the prior year. The percentage decrease for both the quarter and year-to-date period was primarily due to an increase in menu pricing and lower discounting, partially offset by commodity inflation. Labor and Related Expenses For the quarter ended September 25, 2024, labor and related expenses decreased 0.3 million, or 1.1 , from the comparable period in the prior year. The decrease in labor and related expenses for the quarter was primarily due to a 1.9 million reduction in labor-related costs resulting from the 19 company-operated restaurants sold by us to our existing franchisees during or subsequent to the third quarter of 2023 as well as a 2.0 million reduction related to improved labor efficiencies. The decrease in labor and related expenses for the quarter ended September 25, 2024 from the comparable period in the prior year was partially offset by a 3.7 million increase due to higher wage rates during fiscal 2024 and 2023 primarily as a result of legislative increases in the California state minimum wage, which became effective April 1, 2024. Year-to-date, labor and related expenses decreased 0.7 million, or 0.7 , from the comparable period in the prior year. The decrease for the year-to-date period was due primarily to a 5.8 million reduction in labor related costs resulting from the 19 company-operated restaurants sold by us to our existing franchisees during or subsequent to the first quarter of 2023 and as well as 4.3 million reduction related to improved labor efficiencies. The decrease in labor and related expenses for the year was partially offset by a 8.7 million increase due to higher wage rates during fiscal 2024 and 2023 primarily as a result of legislative increases in the California state minimum wage, which became effective April 1, 2024, as well as a 0.7 million increase in other labor-related costs. For the quarter ended September 25, 2024, labor and related expenses as a percentage of company-operated restaurant revenue were 32.4 , up from 32.2 in the comparable period in the prior year. The percentage change for the quarter was driven by the higher wage rates, partially offset by higher menu prices and improved labor efficiencies . Year-to-date labor and related expenses as a percentage of company-operated restaurant revenue were 32.0 , up from 31.8 in the comparable period in the prior year primarily d ue to the higher wage rates , partially offset by the increase in menu pricing and improved labor efficiencies. Occupancy and Other Operating Expenses For the quarter ended September 25, 2024, occupancy and other operating expenses decreased 1.2 million, or 4.4 , from the comparable period in the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to a 1.7 million decrease in utilities, repairs and maintenance costs and other operating expense primarily driven by the sale of 19 company-operated locations to existing franchisee during or subsequent to the third quarter of 2023, partially offset by a 0.5 million increase in other operating expenses and the two new company restaurant openings. Year-to-date, occupancy and other operating expenses decreased 3.1 million, or 4.0 , from the comparable period in the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to a 4.8 million decrease in utilities, repairs and maintenance costs and other operating expense primarily driven by the sale of 19 company-operated locations during or subsequent to the first quarter of 2023 to existing franchisees, partially offset by a 1.3 million increase in other operating expenses and the three new company restaurant openings. For the quarter ended September 25, 2024, occupancy and other operating expenses as a percentage of company-operated restaurant revenue were 25.8 , down from 26.6 in the comparable period in the prior year . Year-to-date, occupancy and other operating expenses as a percentage of company-operated restaurant revenue were 24.8 , down from 25.5 in the comparable period of the prior year. Both the quarter and year-to-date period decreases resulted from the cost decreases highlighted above. General and Administrative Expenses For the quarter ended September 25, 2024, general and administrative expenses increased 2.3 million, or 24.9 , from the comparable period in the prior year. The increase for the quarter was primarily due to a 1.9 million increase in

 labor- related costs, primarily related to an increase in estimated management bonus expense and a 0.4 million increase in other general and administrative expenses. Year-to-date, general and administrative expenses increased 3.7 million, or 11.7 , from the comparable period in the prior year. The increase for the year-to-date period was due primarily to a 2.5 million increase in labor-related costs, primarily related to an increase in estimated management bonus expense, a 0.6 million increase in executive transition costs and a 0.6 million increase in other general and administrative expenses. For the quarter ended September 25, 2024, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue were 9.5 , up from 7.6 in the comparable period of the prior year. Year-to-date, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue were 9.8 , up from 8.8 in the comparable period of the prior year. The percentage increase for both the quarterly and year-to-date periods is primarily due to the cost increases discussed above. Franchise Expenses For the quarter ended September 25, 2024, franchise expenses increased 0.9 million, or 9.4 , from the comparable period in the prior year . Year-to-date, franchise expenses increased 3.9 million, or 13.7 , from the comparable period in the prior year. The increase for both quarterly and year-to-date periods was due to an increase in advertising expenses, primarily resulting from higher franchise revenue, higher franchise services expense and higher rent expense for locations sub-leased to franchisees that have a portion of the rent based on a percentage of revenue generated. Loss (Gain) on Disposition of Restaurants During the thirty-nine weeks ended September 25, 2024, we completed the sale of one restaurant within California to an existing franchisee due to an expiring lease term on April 30, 2024. This sale resulted in cash proceeds of 0.1 million and a net loss on sale of restaurant of less than 0.1 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 25, 2024. During the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 27, 2023, we completed the sale of 17 and 18 restaurants, respectively, within California, Utah and Texas to existing franchisees. During the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 27, 2023, these sales resulted in cash proceeds of 7.5 million and 7.7 million, respectively, and a net gain on sale of restaurant of 4.9 million and 5.0 million, respectively . We determined that these restaurant dispositions represent multiple element arrangements, and as a result, the cash consideration received was allocated to the separate elements based on its relative standalone selling price. Cash proceeds included upfront consideration for the sale of the restaurant and franchise fees. The cash consideration per restaurant related to franchise fees is consistent with the amounts stated in the related franchise agreements, which are charged for separate standalone arrangements. We initially defer and subsequently recognize the franchise fees over the term of the franchise agreement. Since the date of their sale, these restaurants are now included in the total number of franchised El Pollo Loco restaurants. Impairment and Closed-Store Reserves During the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 25, 2024, we did not record any non-cash impairment charges. During both the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 27, 2023, we recorded non-cash impairment charges of 1.0 million, primarily related to the carrying value of the ROU assets of one restaurant in California and the carrying value of the long-lived assets of one restaurant in Nevada . Given the inherent uncertainty in projecting results for newer restaurants in newer markets, we are monitoring the recoverability of the carrying value of the assets of several restaurants on an ongoing basis. For these restaurants, if expected performance is not realized, an impairment charge may be recognized in future periods, and such charge could be material. When a restaurant is closed, we will evaluate the ROU asset for impairment, based on anticipated sublease recoveries. The remaining value of the ROU asset is amortized on a straight-line basis, with the expense recognized in closed-store reserve expense. Additionally, any property tax and CAM payments relating to closed restaurants are included within closed-store expense. During both the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 25, 2024 and September 27, 2023, we recognized less than 0.1 million of closed-store reserve expense related to the amortization of ROU assets, property taxes and CAM payments for our closed locations.

 Interest Expense, Net For the quarter ended September 25, 2024, interest expense, net, increased 0.2 million from t he comparable period in the prior year. For the year-to-date period, interest expense, net, increased 1.3 million from the comparable period in the prior year . Both the quarter and year-to-date period increase in interest expense was primarily related to the higher outstanding balances on our 2022 Revolver (as defined below) as well as the higher interest rates in the fiscal 2024 periods versus t he comparable periods in the prior year . Income Tax Receivable Agreement On July 30, 2014, we entered into the income tax receivable agreement (the TRA ). The TRA calls for us to pay to our pre-IPO stockholders 85 of the savings in cash that we realize in our taxes as a result of utilizing our net operating losses NOLs and other tax attributes attributable to preceding periods. For the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 25, 2024, we did not record any income tax receivable agreement income or expense, and for both the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 27, 2023, we recorded income tax receivable agreement expense of 0.1 million. On May 29, 2024, we terminated most of the obligations under the TRA, with respect to any payments or obligations owed to the FS Equity Partners V, L.P. and FS Affiliates V, L.P. (together, the Sellers thereunder in exchange for a payment to the Sellers of 398,896. As of September 25, 2024, an immaterial amount of obligations owed remained outstanding on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. Provision for Income Taxes For the quarter ended September 25, 2024, we recorded an income tax provision of 2.4 million, reflecting an estimated effective tax rate of 28.1 . For the quarter ended September 27, 2023, we recorded an income tax provision of 3.0 million, reflecting an estimated effective tax rate of approximately 24.4 . For the year-to-date period ended September 25, 2024, we recorded an income tax provision of 7.8 million, reflecting an estimated effective tax rate of approximately 28.3 . For the year-to-date period ended September 27, 2023, we recorded an income tax provision of 7.7 million, reflecting an estimated effective tax rate of approximately 26.5 The difference between the 21.0 statutory rate and our effective tax rate of 28.3 for the year-to-date period ended September 25, 2024 is primarily a result of state taxes , the impact of non-tax deductible executive compensation expense, a tax shortfall related to equity compensation deductible for tax as compared to the cumulative amount recorded as stock-based compensation expense, partially offset by a Work Opportunity Tax Credit benefit . Key Performance Indicators To evaluate the performance of our business, we utilize a variety of financial and performance measures. These key measures include company-operated restaurant revenue, system-wide sales, comparable restaurant sales, restaurant contribution, restaurant contribution margin, new restaurant openings, EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA. System-Wide Sales System-wide sales are neither required by, nor presented in accordance with GAAP. System-wide sales are the sum of company-operated restaurant revenue and sales from franchised restaurants. Our total revenue in our condensed consolidated statements of income is limited to company-operated restaurant revenue and franchise revenue from our franchisees. Accordingly, system-wide sales should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our results as reported under GAAP. Management believes that system-wide sales are an important figure for investors, because they are widely used in the restaurant industry, including by our management, to evaluate brand scale and market penetration. System-wide sales does not include the 10 licensed stores in the Philippines.

Thirteen Weeks Ended Thirty-Nine Weeks Ended (Dollar amounts in thousands) September 25, 2024 September 27, 2023 September 25, 2024 September 27, 2023 Company-operated restaurant revenue 101,178 102,703 300,638 304,477 Franchise revenue 11,330 10,255 34,329 30,046 Franchise advertising fee revenue 7,887 7,441 23,757 21,894 Total Revenue 120,395 120,399 358,724 356,417 Franchise revenue (11,330) (10,255) (34,329) (30,046) Franchise advertising fee revenue (7,887) (7,441) (23,757) (21,894) Sales from franchised restaurants 178,794 166,052 532,830 488,117 System-wide sales 279,972 268,755 833,468 792,594 Company-Operated Restaurant Revenue Company-operated restaurant revenue consists of sales of food and beverages in company-operated restaurants net of promotional allowances, employee meals, and other discounts. Company-operated restaurant revenue in any period is directly influenced by the number of operating weeks in such period, the number of open restaurants, and comparable restaurant sales. Comparable Restaurant Sales Comparable restaurant sales reflect year-over-year sales changes for comparable company-operated, franchised, and system-wide restaurants. A restaurant enters our comparable restaurant base the first full week after it has operated for fifteen months. Comparable restaurant sales exclude restaurants closed during the applicable period. At September 25, 2024 and September 27, 2023, there were 482 and 470 comparable restaurants, 168 and 181 company-operated restaurants, and 314 and 289 franchised restaurants, respectively. Comparable restaurant sales indicate the performance of existing restaurants, since new restaurants are excluded. Comparable restaurant sales growth can be generated by an increase in the number of meals sold and/or by increases in the average check amount, resulting from a shift in menu mix and/or higher prices resulting from new products or price increases. Because other companies may calculate this measure differently than we do, comparable restaurant sales as presented herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Management believes that comparable restaurant sales is a valuable metric for investors to evaluate the performance of our store base, excluding the impact of new stores and closed stores. Restaurant Contribution and Restaurant Contribution Margin Restaurant contribution and restaurant contribution margin are neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. Restaurant contribution is defined as company-operated restaurant revenue less company restaurant expenses which includes food and paper cost, labor and related expenses and occupancy and other operating expenses, where applicable. Restaurant contribution therefore excludes franchise revenue, franchise advertising fee revenue and franchise expenses as well as certain other costs, such as general and administrative expenses, franchise expenses, depreciation and amortization, asset impairment and closed-store reserve, loss on disposal of assets and other costs that are considered corporate-level expenses and are not considered normal operating costs of our restaurants. Accordingly, restaurant contribution is not indicative of overall Company results and does not accrue directly to the benefit of stockholders because of the exclusion of certain corporate-level expenses. Restaurant contribution margin is defined as restaurant contribution as a percentage of net company-operated restaurant revenue. Restaurant contribution and restaurant contribution margin are supplemental measures of operating performance of our restaurants, and our calculations thereof may not be comparable to those reported by other companies. Restaurant contribution and restaurant contribution margin have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation, or superior to, or as substitutes for the analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Management uses restaurant contribution and restaurant contribution margin as key metrics to evaluate the profitability of incremental sales at our restaurants, to evaluate our restaurant performance across periods, and to evaluate our restaurant financial performance compared with our competitors. Management believes that restaurant contribution and restaurant contribution margin are important tools for investors, because they are widely-used metrics within the restaurant industry to evaluate restaurant-level productivity, efficiency, and performance. Management further believes restaurant level

 operating margin is useful to investors to highlight trends in our core business that may not otherwise be apparent to investors when relying solely on GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of restaurant contribution and restaurant contribution margin to company-operated restaurant revenue is provided below:

Before a new restaurant opens, we and our franchisees incur pre-opening costs, as described below. New restaurants often open with an initial start-up period of higher-than-normal sales volumes, which subsequently decrease to stabilized levels. New restaurants typically experience normal inefficiencies in the form of higher food and paper, labor, and other direct operating expenses and, as a result, restaurant contribution margins are generally lower during the start-up period of operation. The average start-up period after which our new restaurants revenue and expenses normalize is approximately fourteen weeks. When we enter new markets, we may be exposed to start-up times and restaurant contribution margins that are longer and lower than reflected in our average historical experience. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA EBITDA represents net income (loss) before interest expense, provision (benefit) for income taxes, depreciation, and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents net income (loss) before interest expense, provision (benefit) for income taxes, depreciation, amortization, and other items that we do not consider representative of on-going operating performance, as identified in the reconciliation table below.

Table of Contents 
 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as presented in this report are supplemental measures of our performance that are neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not measurements of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to net income, operating income, or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP, or as alternatives to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. In addition, in evaluating EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future we will incur expenses or charges such as those added back to calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. Our presentation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation, or as substitutes for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are (i) they do not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments, (ii) they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs, (iii) they do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debt, (iv) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements, (v) they do not adjust for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in our statements of cash flows, (vi) they do not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of our on-going operations, and (vii) other companies in our industry may calculate these measures differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from such non-GAAP financial measures. We further compensate for the limitations in our use of non-GAAP financial measures by presenting comparable GAAP measures more prominently. We believe that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period by isolating the effects of some items that vary from period to period without any correlation to core operating performance or that vary widely among similar companies. These potential differences may be caused by variations in capital structures (affecting interest expense), tax positions (such as the impact on periods or companies of changes in effective tax rates or NOLs) and the age and book depreciation of facilities and equipment (affecting relative depreciation expense). We also present EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA because (i) we believe that these measures are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry, (ii) we believe that investors will find these measures useful in assessing our ability to service or incur indebtedness, and (iii) we use EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA internally for a number of benchmarks, including to compare our performance to that of our competitors.

(b) Loss (gain) on disposal of assets includes the loss or gain on disposal of assets related to retirements and replacement or write-off of leasehold improvements or equipment. (c) Includes costs related to impairment of property and equipment and ROU assets and closing restaurants. During the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 25, 2024, we did not record any non-cash impairment charges. During both the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 27, 2023, we recorded non-cash impairment charges of 1.0 million, primarily related to the carrying value of the ROU assets of one restaurant in California and the carrying value of the long-lived assets of one restaurant in Nevada . During both the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 25, 2024 and September 27, 2023, we recognized less than 0.1 million of closed-store reserve expense related to the amortization of ROU assets, property taxes and CAM payments for our closed locations. (d) During the thirty-nine weeks ended September 25, 2024, we completed the sale of one restaurant within California to an existing franchisee due to an expiring lease term on April 30, 2024. This sale resulted in cash proceeds of 0.1 million and a net loss on sale of restaurant of less than 0.1 million for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 25, 2024. During the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 27, 2023, we completed the sale of 17 and 18 restaurants, respectively, within California, Utah and Texas to existing franchisees. These sales resulted in cash proceeds of 7.5 million and 7.7 million, respectively, during the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 27, 2023 a and a net gain on sale of restaurant of 4.9 million and 5.0 million, respectively. (e) On July 30, 2014, we entered into the TRA.

 (h) During fiscal 2022, one of our restaurants incurred damage resulting from a fire. In fiscal 2023, we incurred costs directly related to the fire of less than 0.1 million. We received 0.4 million in cash, net of the insurance deductible, from the insurance company during fiscal 2023, for which we recognized gains of 0.2 million, related to the reimbursement of property and equipment and expenses incurred and 0.2 million related to the reimbursement of lost profits. The gain on recovery of insurance proceeds for the reimbursement of property and equipment and expenses and the reimbursement of lost profits, net of the related costs is included in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of income, for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 27, 2023, as a reduction of company restaurant expenses. (i) Includes costs associated with the transition of our former CEO, such as severance, executive recruiting costs and stock-based compensation costs. (j) On March 8, 2024, we made the decision to eliminate and restructure certain positions in the organization, which resulted in one-time costs of approximately 0.6 million. On April 13, 2023 the Company made the decision to eliminate and restructure certain positions in the organization, which resulted in one-time costs of approximately 1.1 million. (k) Pre-opening costs are a component of general and administrative expenses, and consist of costs directly associated with the opening of new restaurants and incurred prior to opening, including management labor costs, staff labor costs during training, food and supplies used during training, marketing costs, and other related pre-opening costs. These are generally incurred over the three to five months prior to opening. Pre-opening costs also include occupancy costs incurred between the date of possession and the opening date for a restaurant. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary sources of liquidity and capital resources have been cash provided from operations, cash and cash equivalents, and our 2022 Revolver (defined below) . Our primary requirements for liquidity and capital are new restaurants, existing restaurant capital investments (remodels and maintenance), legal defense costs, lease obligations, interest payments on our debt, working capital and general corporate needs. Our working capital requirements are not significant, since our customers pay for their purchases in cash or by payment card (credit or debit) at the time of sale. Thus, we are able to sell many of our inventory items before we have to pay our suppliers. Our restaurants do not require significant inventories or receivables. We believe that these sources of liquidity and capital are sufficient to finance our continued operations, including planned capital expenditures, for at least the next 12 months from the issuance of the condensed consolidated financial statements. The following table presents summary cash flow information for the periods indicated (in thousands): 

Thirty-Nine Weeks Ended (Amounts in thousands) September 25, 2024 September 27, 2023 Net cash provided by (used in) Operating activities 41,146 32,509 Investing activities (14,437) (7,412) Financing activities (26,102) (31,775) Net increase (decrease) in cash 607 (6,678) Operating Activities For the thirty-nine weeks ended September 25, 2024, net cash from operating activities increased by approximately 8.6 million from the comparable period of the prior year. This change was due to favorable working capital fluctuations and higher profitability compared to the same period in the prior year. 

 43 

Table of Contents 
 Investing Activities For the thirty-nine weeks ended September 25, 2024, net cash used in investing activities increased by 7.0 million from the comparable period of the prior year. This change was primarily due to the cash proceeds of 7.7 million received during the thirty-nine weeks ended September 27, 2023 related to the sale of 18 company-operated restaurants to existing franchisees. Financing Activities For the thirty-nine weeks ended September 25, 2024, net cash used in financing activities changed by 5.7 million from the comparable period of the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to repurchases of shares of our common stock of 19.3 million during the thirty-nine weeks ended September 25, 2024 compared to repurchases of shares of our common stock of 46.6 million during the thirty-nine weeks ended September 27, 2023. The change was offset by an 8.0 million in net pay downs on the 2022 Revolver during the thirty-nine weeks ended September 25, 2024 compared to a 14.0 million in net borrowings during the thirty-nine weeks ended September 27, 2023. Debt and Other Obligations We, as a guarantor, are a party to a credit agreement (the 2022 Credit Agreement among our wholly-owned subsidiary, El Pollo Loco, Inc. EPL ), as borrower, and our direct subsidiary, EPL Intermediate, Inc. Intermediate ), as a guarantor, Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, swingline lender, and letter of credit issuer, the lenders party thereto, and the other parties thereto, which provides for a 150.0 million five-year senior secured revolving credit facility (the 2022 Revolver ). The 2022 Revolver, which is available pursuant to the 2022 Credit Agreement, includes a sub limit of 15.0 million for letters of credit and a sub limit of 15.0 million for swingline loans. The 2022 Revolver and 2022 Credit Agreement will mature on July 27, 2027. The obligations under the 2022 Credit Agreement and related loan documents are guaranteed by us and Intermediate. The obligations of our company, EPL and Intermediate under the 2022 Credit Agreement and related loan documents are secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of their respective assets. Under the 2022 Revolver, we are restricted from making certain payments such as cash dividends or share repurchases, except that it may, inter alia, (i) pay up to 1.0 million per year to repurchase or redeem our qualified equity interests held by our past or present officers, directors, or employees (or their estates) upon death, disability, or termination of employment, (ii) pay under its TRA, and (iii) so long as no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing, (a) make non-cash repurchases of equity interests in connection with the exercise of stock options by directors, officers and management, provided that those equity interests represent a portion of the consideration of the exercise price of those stock options, (b) pay up to 0.5 million in any 12 month consecutive period to redeem, repurchase or otherwise acquire equity interests of any subsidiary that is not a wholly-owned subsidiary from any holder of equity interest in such subsidiary, (c) pay up to 2.5 million per year pursuant to stock option plans, employment agreements, or incentive plans, (d) make up to 5.0 million in other restricted payments per year, and (e) make other restricted payments, subject to its compliance, on a pro forma basis, with (x) a lease-adjusted consolidated leverage ratio not to exceed 4.25 times and (y) the financial covenants applicable to the 2022 Revolver. Borrowings under the 2022 Credit Agreement (other than any swingline loans) bear interest, at the borrower s option, at rates based upon either the secured overnight financing rate SOFR or a base rate, plus, for each rate, a margin determined in accordance with a lease-adjusted consolidated leverage ratio-based pricing grid. The base rate is calculated as the highest of (a) the federal funds rate plus 0.50 , (b) the published Bank of America prime rate, or (c) Term SOFR with a term of one-month SOFR plus 1.00 . For Term SOFR loans, the margin is in the range of 1.25 to 2.25 , and for base rate loans the margin is in a range of 0.25 to 1.25 . Borrowings under the 2022 Revolver may be repaid and reborrowed. The interest rate range under the 2022 Revolver was 6.52 to 6.95 and 6.52 to 6.96 for the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 25, 2024 , respectively, and 6.74 to 6.93 and 5.69 to 8.50 for the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 27, 2023, respectively. The 2022 Credit Agreement contains certain customary financial covenants, subject to certain exceptions. We were in compliance with the financial covenants as of September 25, 2024. At September 25, 2024, we had 76.0 million in outstanding borrowings under the 2022 Revolver and one letter of credit in the amount of 9.8 million outstanding, and as a result, we had 64.2 million in borrowing availability.

 During the year ended December 28, 2022, we refinanced and terminated our credit agreement (the 2018 Credit Agreement among EPL, as borrower, we and the Intermediate, as guarantors, Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, swingline lender, and letter of credit issuer, the lenders party thereto, and the other parties thereto, which provided for a 150.0 million five-year senior secured revolving credit facility (the 2018 Revolver and entered into the 2022 Credit Agreement. See Note 4, Long-term debt for additional information. Material Cash Requirements Our material cash requirements as of September 25, 2024 have not changed materially since those disclosed under Material Cash Requirements in Part II, Item 7 of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 27, 2023. Our material cash requirements relate mostly to future (i) debt payments, including expected interest expense, calculated based on current interest rates, (ii) restaurant operating lease payments, (iii) purchasing commitments for chicken, (iv) restaurant finance lease payments, and (v) capital expenditures . Share Repurchases Share Repurchase Program On November 2, 2023, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program Share Repurchase Program under which we are authorized to repurchase up to 20,000,000 of shares of our common stock. Under the Share Repurchase Program, we are permitted to repurchase our common stock from time to time, in amounts and at prices that we deemed appropriate, subject to market conditions and other considerations. Pursuant to the Share Repurchase Program, we are authorized to effect repurchases using open market purchases, including pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 trading plans, and/or through privately negotiated transactions. The repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any particular number of shares. The repurchase program will terminate on March 31, 2025. Further, on December 4, 2023, we repurchased 1.5 million shares for a total purchase price of 12.6 million under the Stock Repurchase Agreement with FS Equity Partners V, L.P. and FS Affiliates V, L.P. Following completion of this repurchase, approximately 7.4 million of our common stock remained available for repurchase under the Share Repurchase Program at December 27, 2023. For the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 25, 2024, we repurchased 92,043 and 431,926 shares of common stock, respectively, under the Share Repurchase Program, using open market purchases, for total consideration of approximately 1.1 million and 4.3 million, respectively. Following completion of these repurchases, approximately 3.1 million of our common stock remained available for repurchase under the Share Repurchase Program at September 25, 2024. Other Share Repurchases In addition, on May 29, 2024, we repurchased 1,534,303 shares for a total purchase price of 15.0 million under the Stock Repurchase Agreement with FS Equity Partners V, L.P. and FS Affiliates V, L.P. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Interest Rate Risk On July 27, 2022, we refinanced the 2018 Revolver and entered into the 2022 Credit Agreement, which provides for a 150 million five-year senior secured revolving facility. In connection with the refinancing, the 2018 Credit Agreement was terminated. We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on our debt, which bears interest, at SOFR plus a margin between 1.25 and 2.25 . As of September 25, 2024, we had outstanding borrowings of 76.0 million under our 2022 Revolver, 9.8 million of letters of credit in support of our insurance programs, and the applicable margin on outstanding borrowings under 2022 Revolver was 1.5 . A 1.0 increase in the effective interest rate applied to our 2022 Revolver borrowings would result in a pre-tax interest expense increase of 0.8 million on an annualized basis. 

 45 

Table of Contents 
 During the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 25, 2024, we paid down 11.0 million and 22.0 million, respectively, on our 2022 Revolver and the outstanding balance as of September 25, 2024 was 76.0 million. During the thirty-nine weeks ended September 25, 2024, we borrowed 14.0 million on the 2022 Revolver. Borrowings under the 2022 Credit Agreement (other than any swingline loans) bear interest, at the borrowers option, at rates based upon either SOFR or a base rate, plus, for each rate, a margin determined in accordance with a lease-adjusted consolidated leverage ratio-based pricing grid. If future rates based upon SOFR are higher than SOFR rates as currently determined, we may experience potential increases in interest rates on our variable rate debt, which could adversely impact our interest expense, results of operations and cash flows. Inflation Inflation has an impact on food, paper, construction, utility, labor and benefits, general and administrative, and other costs, all of which can materially impact our operations. In general, we have been able to substantially offset cost increases resulting from inflation by increasing menu prices, managing menu mix, improving productivity, or making other adjustments. We may not be able to offset cost increases in the future. In addition, we have a substantial number of hourly employees who are paid wage rates at or based on the applicable federal, state, or local minimum wage, and increases in the minimum wage will increase our labor costs. Commodity Price Risk We are exposed to market price fluctuation in food product prices. Given the historical volatility of certain of our food product prices, including chicken, other proteins, grains, produce, dairy products, and cooking oil, these fluctuations can materially impact our food and beverage costs. While our purchasing commitments partially mitigate the risk of such fluctuations, there is no assurance that supply and demand factors such as disease or inclement weather will not cause the prices of the commodities used in our restaurant operations to fluctuate. In periods when the prices of commodities drop, we may pay higher prices under our purchasing commitments. In rapidly fluctuating commodities markets, it may prove difficult for us to adjust our menu prices in accordance with input price fluctuations. Therefore, to the extent that we do not pass along cost increases to our customers, our results of operations may be adversely affected. At this time, we do not use financial instruments to hedge our commodity risk. Item 4. Controls and Procedures. Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our disclosure controls and procedures are based on assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives. Because of their inherent limitations, we cannot guarantee that our disclosure controls and procedures will succeed in achieving their stated objectives in all cases, that they will be complied with in all cases, or that they will prevent or detect all misstatements. Our management has evaluated, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective, at the reasonable assurance level, as of September 25, 2024. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting No changes in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during the quarter ended September 25, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
