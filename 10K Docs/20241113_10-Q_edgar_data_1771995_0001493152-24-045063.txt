Management s
discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

Organizational
History of the Company and Overview 

American
Picture House Corporation aka American Picture House Pictures plans to be a premiere entertainment company with a focus on feature
films, limited series, and content-enhancing technologies. APHP is managed by astute financiers and supported by seasoned creatives.
To date, the Company has provided general consulting services to entertainment industry-based clients. These clients were interested
in our entertainment industry expertise and general business knowledge. The services provided included the strategy, development, and
procurement of materials including; business plans, financial projections, and corporate marketing materials for the entertainment industry.
The Company has refocused its efforts and will no longer be providing these services to independent clients. Going forward, APHP plans
to partner with filmmakers, showrunners, content developers and strategic technology partners to develop, package, finance, and produce
high-quality feature films and television shows with broad-market appeal. The Company s management, Board of Directors and advisors
have had relationships with major studios due to many of them having worked within the entertainment industry on many films and shows
in a variety of specialties including: writing, producing, directing, casting, sales, and licensing. Although these relationships have
not yet yielded results to APHP to date, the Company anticipates it will be able to access these relationships to benefit the Company
in its future endeavors. 

The
Company intends to specialize in mid-budgeted productions where more than 100 of the budget can be collateralized by a film s
or show s intellectual property IP ), unsold licensing sales projections, pre-sold licensing contracts, incentive
agreements, tax rebates, and grants. The Company s management and advisors will use these assets to limit risk and guarantee greater
profitability. The IP (e.g., the book rights, script, screenplay, etc.) of a particular film or show usually has a quantifiable value,
especially if such IP was written by a recognized author or by a WGA Writers Guild of America writer and further enhanced
by the addition of competent producers, proven directors and directors of photography, and talented actors. While the IP itself has value,
the previously mentioned elements plus the addition of factors like choosing favorable filming locales to film in (that provide monetary
and/or tax incentives) and formulating lean budgets, enable third party financiers to quantify a film s or show s value and
this quantifiable-value can be utilized to secure additional equity investors and or be utilized to secure loans. Through the development
of a strong package, APHP can limit its overall financial exposure, mitigate financial risk, and reduce the equity required from the
Company to produce a film or show Loans and additional equity, are usually only secured for films that have a package that has strong
elements and additional factors; therefore, a reduction in equity combined with third-party participation also is expected to increase
profitability to the Company. 

The
Company will strive to become synonymous with creative ability, financial sophistication, and leading-edge technology. The Company has
optioned IP with the intent to co-finance and co-produce feature films and limited series shows. 

Filmmaking
Stages and Our Strategy 

To
understand our business strategy, it is useful to think of filmmaking in five stages - often with different teams involved at different
stages: 

Development:
 The first stage in which the ideas for the film are created, rights to books/plays are acquired and the screenplay is written. Financing
 for the project has to be sought and obtained; 

Pre-Production:
 Arrangements and preparations are made for the shoot, such as hiring cast and film crew, selecting locations and constructing sets; 

Production:
 The raw footage and other elements for the film are recorded during the film shoot; 

Post-Production:
 The images, sound, and visual effects of the recorded film are edited and combined into a finished product; and 

Distribution:
 The completed film is distributed, marketed, and screened in cinemas and/or released to video or steaming services.

 Table of Contents 

Our
Strategy to Build Value 

Our
business strategy is to purchase and/or option entertainment properties e.g., book rights, screenplays, scripts,
 etc. ). that have had some level of financial investment in the development stage before we acquire the entertainment property
where the initial owner or development team decided to stop development for financial or other reasons after making a substantial investment
in development. For this investment, we may share with the original team rights to revenue from the acquired entertainment properties.
This strategy will allow the Company to reduce our initial cash outlay when acquiring intellectual properties, allows us to allocate
more funds in moving the entertainment property up the filmmaking chain, gives us assistance and goodwill from the original development
team, and reduces our financial risks. 

Our
strategy requires us to make an informed assessment that our management team has the ability to move the script forward where the initial
team failed while allowing APHP to capitalize on the initial investment. 

We
seek to build value in our entertainment properties by many means, including the following: 

Hiring
 other qualified Writers Guild of America WGA writers to further develop, polish, or re-write entertainment properties; 

Securing
 or attaching quality talent e.g., producers, director, actors, etc.); 

Determining
 pre-sales values; 

Securing
 some pre-sales (mostly in international markets) ; 

Securing
 financial and banking relations; 

Hiring
 a talent agency, retaining attorneys; 

Determining
 shooting locations, including the best place to obtain financial incentives and/or grants; 

Developing
 a comprehensive budget and devising financing strategy; 

Securing
 a completion bond; and 

Developing
 production and marketing materials e.g., look-book, location scouting, poster-design, etc.). 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Our
management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements,
which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. The preparation of
these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses
during the reported period. In accordance with GAAP, we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions
that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or
conditions. 

Our
significant accounting policies are fully described in Note 2 to our financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly
Report, and we believe those accounting policies are critical to the process of making significant judgments and estimates in the preparation
of our financial statements. 

COVID-19
Update 

To
date, the COVID-19 pandemic has not had a material impact on the Company, particularly due to our current lack of operations. The pandemic
may, however, have an impact on our ability to evaluate and acquire an operating entity through a reverse merger or otherwise.

4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

(a) 
 Disclosure
 Controls and Procedures . 

Our
management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our
disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September
30, 2024, or the Evaluation Date. Based on such evaluation, those officers have concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, our disclosure
controls and procedures are ineffective in recording, processing, summarizing and reporting, on a timely basis, information required
to be included in periodic filings under the Exchange Act and that such information is not accumulated and communicated to management,
including our principal executive and financial officers, in a manner sufficient to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure,
due to lack of sufficient internal accounting personnel, segregation of duties, lack of sufficient internal controls (including IT general
controls) that encompass the Company as a whole with respect to entity and transactions level controls in order to ensure complete documentation
of complex and non-routine transactions and adequate financial reporting. 

Management
has identified corrective actions to remediate such material weaknesses, and subject to fundraising, which includes hiring additional
employees. Management intends to implement procedures to remediate such material weaknesses during the fiscal year 2024; however, the
implementation of these initiatives may not fully address any material weakness or other deficiencies that we may have in our disclosure
controls and procedures.

1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

We
may from time to time be involved in various claims and legal proceedings of a nature we believe are normal and incidental to our business.
These matters may include product liability, intellectual property, employment, personal injury cause by our employees, and other general
claims. Aside from the following, we are not presently a party to any legal proceedings that, in the opinion of our management, are likely
to have a material adverse effect on our business. Regardless of outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense
and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors.

Legal Proceeding(s).

case under any law or to the appointment of a receiver, liquidator, assignee, custodian, trustee, sequestrator (or other similar official)
of the Corporation or of any substantial part of its property, or make an assignment for the benefit of its creditors, or admit in writing
its inability to pay its debts generally as they become due, or if a decree or order for relief in respect of the Corporation shall be
entered by a court having jurisdiction in the premises in an involuntary case under the U.S. Federal bankruptcy laws or any other applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency or similar law resulting in the appointment of a receiver, liquidator, assignee, custodian, trustee, sequestrator
(or other similar official) of the Corporation or of any substantial part of its property, or ordering the winding up or liquidation

be regarded as a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation. Neither the consolidation or merger of the Corporation with

funds available for distribution to the Series A Preferred Stock to (b) the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding.

at any time commencing after the Issuance Date; The Holder shall effect conversions by sending a conversion notice (the Notice
of Conversion in the manner set forth herein. Each Notice of Conversion shall specify the number of shares of Series A Preferred
Stock to be converted. The date on which such conversion is to be effected (the Conversion Date shall be on the date the

returned to the Corporation for cancellation. 

(2)
Not later than ten (10) Business Days after the Conversion Date, the Corporation will deliver to the Holder (a) a certificate or certificates
representing the number of shares of Common Stock being acquired upon the conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock and (b) once received
from the Corporation, the Series A Preferred Stock in principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Series A Preferred Stock
not converted; provided, however, that the Corporation shall not be obligated to issue certificates evidencing the shares of Common Stock
issuable upon conversion of any Series A Preferred Stock until the Series A Preferred Stock are either delivered for conversion to the
Corporation or any transfer agent for the Series A Preferred Stock or Common Stock, or the Holder notifies the Corporation that such
Series A Preferred Stock certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and provides an agreement reasonably acceptable to the Corporation
to indemnify the Corporation from any loss incurred by it in connection therewith. In the case of a conversion pursuant to a Notice of
Conversion, if such certificate or certificates are not delivered by the date required under this section, the Holder shall be entitled,
by providing written notice to the Corporation at any time on or before its receipt of such certificate or certificates thereafter, to
rescind such conversion, in which event the Corporation shall immediately return the Series A Preferred Stock tendered for conversion. 

(3)

number of shares, (iii) combine outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, or (iv) issue by reclassification
of shares of Common Stock any shares of capital stock of the Corporation, the Conversion Ratio designated herein shall be multiplied
by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock of the Company outstanding before such event and of
which the denominator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding after such event. Any adjustment made pursuant to this
section shall become effective immediately after the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such dividend
or distribution and shall become effective immediately after the effective date in the case of a subdivision, combination or reclassification. 

(b)
If the Corporation, at any time while Series A Preferred Stock are outstanding, shall distribute to all holders of Common Stock (and
not to Holders of Series A Preferred Stock) evidences of its indebtedness or assets or rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase
any security, then in each such case the Conversion Price at which each Series A Preferred Stock shall thereafter be convertible shall
be determined by multiplying the Conversion Ratio in effect immediately prior to the record date fixed for determination of stockholders
entitled to receive such distribution by a fraction of which the denominator shall be the Per Share Market Value of Common Stock determined
as of the record date mentioned above, and of which the numerator shall be such Per Share Market Value of the Common Stock on such record
date less the then fair market value at such record date of the portion of such assets or evidence of indebtedness so distributed applicable
to one outstanding share of Common Stock as determined by the Board of Directors in good faith. Such adjustment shall be made whenever
any such distribution is made and shall become effective immediately after the record date mentioned above. 

(c)
All calculations under this Article XIV shall be made to the nearest 1/1,000th of a cent or the nearest 1/1,000th of a share, as the
case may be. Any calculation resulting in a fraction shall be rounded up to the next cent or share. 

(d)
Whenever the Conversion Ratio is adjusted pursuant to this section, the Corporation shall within ten (10) days after the determination
of the new Fixed Conversion Ratio mail and fax to the Holder and to each other Holder of Series A Preferred Stock, a notice setting forth
the Fixed Conversion Ratio after such adjustment and setting forth a brief statement of the facts requiring such adjustment. 

(e)
In case of any reclassification of the Common Stock, any consolidation or merger of the Corporation with or into another person, the
sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation or any compulsory share exchange pursuant to which the
Common Stock is converted into other securities, cash or property, then each holder of Series A Preferred Stock then outstanding shall
have the right thereafter to convert such Series A Preferred Stock only into the shares of stock and other securities and property receivable
upon or deemed to be held by holders of Common Stock following such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer or share
exchange (except in the event the property is cash, then the Holder shall have the right to convert the Series A Preferred Stock and
receive cash in the same manner as other stockholders), and the Holder shall be entitled upon such event to receive such amount of securities
or property as the shares of the Common Stock into which such Series A Preferred Stock could have been converted immediately prior to
such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer or share exchange would have been entitled. The terms of any such consolidation,
merger, sale, transfer or share exchange shall include such terms so as to continue to give to the holder the right to receive the securities
or property set forth in this section upon any conversion following such consolidation, merger, sale, transfer or share exchange. This
provision shall similarly apply to successive reclassifications, consolidations, mergers, sales, transfers or share exchanges. 

(f)
If:

the Corporation shall declare a dividend (or any other distribution) on its Common Stock; or 

(ii)
the Corporation shall declare a special nonrecurring cash dividend on or a redemption of its Common Stock; or

the Corporation (other than a subdivision or combination of the outstanding shares of Common Stock), any consolidation or merger to which

exchange whereby the Common Stock is converted into other securities, cash or property; or 

(v)
the Corporation shall authorize the voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation; 

then
the Corporation shall cause to be filed at each office or agency maintained for the purpose of conversion of Series A Preferred Stock,
and shall cause to be mailed and faxed to the Holders of Series A Preferred Stock at their last addresses as it shall appear upon the
Series A Preferred stock register, at least thirty (30) calendar days prior to the applicable record or effective date hereinafter specified,

warrants, or if a record is not to be taken, the date as of which the holders of Common Stock of record to be entitled to such dividend,
distributions, redemption, rights or warrants are to be determined, or (y) the date on which such reclassification, consolidation, merger,
sale, transfer, share exchange, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up is expected to become effective, and the date as of which it is
expected that holders of Common Stock of record shall be entitled to exchange their shares of Common Stock for securities or other property
deliverable upon such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer, share exchange, dissolution, liquidation or winding-up;
provided, however, that the failure to mail such notice or any defect therein or in the mailing thereof shall not affect the validity

Holder for any documentary stamp or similar taxes that may be payable in respect of the issue or delivery of such certificate, provided

delivery of any such certificate upon conversion in a name other than that of the Holder and the Corporation shall not be required to
issue or deliver such certificates unless or until the person or persons requesting the issuance thereof shall have paid to the Corporation
the amount of such tax or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Corporation that such tax has been paid.

stockholder may designate. Proof of such designation may be made by presentation of a certified copy of the bylaws or other instrument
of the corporate stockholder. In the absence of any such designation, or in case of conflicting designation by the corporate stockholder,

in that order, authority to vote such shares.

of such shares into his name. Shares standing in the name of a trustee may be voted by him, either in person or by proxy, but no trustee
shall be entitled to vote shares held by him in trust without a transfer of such shares into his name. 

(f)
Shares standing in the name of a receiver may be voted by such receiver, and shares held by or under the control of a receiver may be
voted by such receiver without the transfer thereof into his name if authority to do so is contained in an appropriate order of the court
by which such receiver was appointed.

the pledgee, and thereafter the pledgee or his nominee shall be entitled to vote the shares so transferred.

to redeem such shares has been deposited with a bank or trust company with irrevocable instruction and authority to pay the redemption
price to the holders thereof upon surrender of certificates therefor, such shares shall not be entitled to vote on any matter and shall
not be deemed to be outstanding shares. 

Section
9. Proxies .

from the date thereof unless otherwise provided in the proxy. Every proxy shall be revocable at the pleasure of the stockholder executing
it, except as otherwise provided by law. 

(c)
The authority of the holder of a proxy to act shall not be revoked by the incompetence or death of the stockholder who executed the proxy
unless, before the authority is exercised, written notice of an adjudication of such incompetence or of such death is received by the
corporate officer responsible for maintaining the list of stockholders. 

(d)
If a proxy for the same shares confers authority upon two or more persons and does not otherwise provide, a majority of them present
at the meeting, or if only one is present, then that one, may exercise all the powers conferred by the proxy; but if the proxy
holders present at the meeting are equally divided as to the right and manner of voting in any particular case, the voting of
such shares shall be prorated.

with the Corporation at its registered office as provided by law. These documents shall be subject to the same right of examination by
a stockholder of the Corporation, in person or by agent or attorney, as are the books and records of the Corporation and shall also be
subject to examination by any holder of record of voting trust certificates, either in person or by agent or attorney, at any reasonable
time for any proper purpose. 

Section
11. Stockholders Agreements . Two or more stockholders of the Corporation may enter a written agreement, signed by the parties
thereto, providing for the exercise of voting rights in the manner provided in the agreement or relating to any phase of the affairs
of the Corporation as provided by law. Nothing therein shall impair the right of the Corporation to treat the stockholders of record
as entitled to vote the shares standing in their names. 

Section

of stockholders of the Corporation, or any action which may be taken at any annual or special meeting of such stockholders, may be taken
without a meeting, without prior notice and without a vote, if a consent in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed
by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such
action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted. If any class of shares is entitled to vote thereon
as a class, such written consent shall be required of the holders of a majority of the shares of each class of shares entitled to vote
as a class thereon and of the total shares entitled to vote thereon. 

(b)
Within ten (10) days after obtaining such authorization by written consent, notice shall be given to those stockholders who have not
consented in writing. The notice shall fairly summarize the material features of the authorized action and, if the action be a merger,
consolidation or sale or exchange of assets for which dissenters rights are provided under law, the notice shall contain a clear
statement of the right of stockholders dissenting therefrom to be paid the fair value of their shares upon compliance with further provisions
of the law regarding the rights of dissenting stockholders. 

Section

share so transferred to stated capital shall be disclosed to the stockholders receiving such dividend concurrently with the payment thereof.

No dividend payable in shares of any class shall be paid to the holders of shares of any other class unless the Articles of Incorporation

(a)
The Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed
action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the
Corporation) by reason of the fact that he is or was a Director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving
at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust
or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and
reasonably incurred by him in connection with such action, suit or proceeding, including any appeal thereof, if he acted in good faith
and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation, and with respect to any criminal
action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. The adverse termination of any action, suit or proceeding
by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not of itself create a presumption
that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner in which he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests
of the Corporation, and with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful. 

(b)
The Corporation shall indemnify any person who was or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action
or suit by or in the right of the Corporation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that he is or was a Director,
officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee
or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against expenses (including attorneys fees)
actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if he acted in good faith
and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Corporation; provided, however, that no indemnification
shall be made in respect to any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable for negligence or
misconduct in the performance of his duty to the Corporation unless and only to the extent that the court in which such action or suit
was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all circumstances of the case,
such person is firmly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which such court shall deem proper. 

Page 14 of 17 pages 

(c)
To the extent that a Director, officer, employee, or agent of the Corporation has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense
of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in subsections (a) and (b), or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, he shall
be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys fees) actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection therewith. 

(d)
Any indemnification under subsections (a) or (b) (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Corporation only as authorized in the
specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the director, officer, employee or agent is proper in the circumstances because
he has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in subsections (a) or (b). Such determination shall be made: 

(1)
By the Board of Directors by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of Directors who were not parties to such action, suit or proceeding,
or 

(2)
If such a quorum is not obtainable, or even if obtainable, a quorum of disinterested Directors so directs, by independent legal counsel
in a written opinion, or 

(3)
By the stockholders by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of stockholders who were not parties to such action, suit or proceeding. 

(e)
Expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred in defending a civil or criminal action, suit or proceeding may be paid by the Corporation
in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding as authorized in the manner provided in subsection (d) upon receipt
of an undertaking by or on behalf of the Director, officer, employee or agent to repay such amount, unless it shall ultimately be determined
that he is entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized in this section. 

Section
2. Other Indemnification . The indemnification provided by these Articles shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to
which those indemnified may be entitled under any Bylaw, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested Directors, under Wyoming law
or otherwise, both as to actions in his official capacity and as to actions in another capacity while holding such position and shall
continue as to a person who has ceased to be a Director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors
and administrators of such a person. 

Section
3. Liability Insurance . The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a Director,
officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer, employee
or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted against him and

to us to make a Loan Disbursement. You and the Business Representative represent and warrant that all account information or other related

Business Representative s Guarantee of Borrower s Contractual Covenants and Payment Obligations 

You,
as the Business Representative, understand and agree that you are entering into this Loan Agreement on behalf of the Borrower and you
are executing a Personal Guarantee (the Personal Guarantee ), in your individual capacity. Business Representative personally
and unconditionally guarantees the performance of all of the covenants of Borrower in this Loan Agreement including, but not limited
to, the Borrower Contractual Covenants herein and Borrower s payment obligations herein. Specifically, Business Representative
guarantees payment of all amounts owed by Borrower and that such payments will be made strictly in accordance with the terms of any and
all Loans of Borrower. Business Representative s guarantee of payment hereunder is independent of the Borrower s obligation
of payment and a separate claim may be brought against the Business Representative to enforce this Loan Agreement, whether or not any
claim is made against Borrower. The liability of Business Representative hereunder is primary, direct, irrevocable, continuing, absolute
and unconditional. The Business Representative waives any right to require us to proceed first against the Borrower before recovering
damages from the Business Representative. The Business Representative hereby expressly waives and surrenders any defenses to Business
Representative s liability hereunder, it being the purpose and intent of the parties hereto that the obligations of the Business
Representative hereunder are absolute and unconditional and without right of set off or deduction. 

If
one or more of the terms of this Personal Guarantee or its application shall be held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, such terms
shall nevertheless remain valid, legal, and enforceable in all such other respects and shall not affect any other provision hereof, but
instead, this Personal Guarantee shall be construed as if such invalid, illegal, or unenforceable term had never been contained herein.

How We Apply Your Payments 

With
regard to all Loans listed on your monthly statement, payments received will be applied first to Fees to the extent included in your
Total Minimum Monthly Payment due, then to Loans listed on your monthly statement, in order of the oldest loan first, then the second
oldest loan, and so on; provided, however, that if one or more of your Loans is delinquent, we may apply payments first to delinquent
Loans at our sole discretion. With respect to any particular loan, payment will be applied as described in the Loan Agreement associated
with that loan. When repaying Loans in full, Loans must be repaid in the order of the oldest loan first, then the second oldest loan,
and so on. 

With
respect to this Loan, payment will be applied first to any Fees associated with this Loan, then to Costs, and finally to principal, to
the extent included in your Total Minimum Monthly Payment due. Payments will be applied based on Fees and Costs posted as of the day
of payment application which may be different from the Fees and Costs listed on your monthly statement. Any amount received in excess
of your Total Minimum Monthly Payment due will be applied in the same order as your Total Minimum Monthly Payment. Any payment in excess
of the Total Minimum Monthly Payment due does not relieve you of your obligation to make your next scheduled Total Minimum Monthly Payment. 

We
will apply your payments as described above even if you provide an instruction or notation with your payment. 

12.
Fees 

You
may incur one or more Late Fee(s) (together, Fees ).

 any Fees) is greater than 500 but less than or equal to 5,000;

Credit Reports and Reporting to Credit Reporting Agencies 

You
and the Business Representative authorize us to verify your and his/her information and obtain reports from commercial and consumer reporting
agencies or other third parties, and from our affiliates, as applicable, from time to time as permitted by applicable law. You and Business
Representative agree that we may investigate your and his/her ability to pay and obtain information about you and Business Representative
from other sources. You and Business Representative authorize us and our affiliates to share information we have about you and Business
Representative at any time for marketing and administrative purposes as permitted by law and you and Business Representative agree that
we will use such information for any purposes, subject to applicable law and pursuant to our privacy practices as described in Section
19 Privacy, PATRIOT ACT . Upon request, we will tell you and Business Representative if we have received a consumer report and
the name and address of the agency that provided it. 

You
and Business Representative agree that we may provide information about your loan to credit reporting agencies. For example, we may tell
a credit reporting agency if you fail to make a payment or fail to comply with any other term of this Loan Agreement, or otherwise default
on your loan. This may have a negative impact on your credit reports. 

If
you believe information we provided to a credit reporting agency is incorrect, write to us at: American Express Credit Bureau Unit, P.O.
Box 981537, El Paso, TX 79998-1537. When you write to us, tell us the specific information you believe is incorrect. 

You

to any (a) investigation undertaken by or on your behalf as permitted by this Loan Agreement or (b) disclosure of information as permitted
by this Loan Agreement. You and Business Representative also agree that we may release information if we believe it is required to comply
with any governmental or legal process, whether or not such release is actually required, or when it is necessary or desirable in connection
with a transaction or investigating a loss or potential loss. 

18.
Usury Savings Clause 

It
is the intention of parties hereto to comply strictly with applicable laws and accordingly, in no event and upon no contingency will
we ever be entitled to receive, collect, or apply payments as interest in excess of the maximum rate of interest which we may lawfully
charge under applicable law Maximum Rate ). In the event that we ever receive, collect, or apply payments as interest in
excess of the Maximum Rate, such amount which, but for this provision, would be excessive interest, will be applied to the reduction
of the principal balance owed hereunder; and if said principal balance, and all lawful interest thereon, is paid in full, any remaining
excess will forthwith be paid to you, or another party lawfully entitled thereto. In determining whether or not the interest or fees
paid or payable, under any specific contingency, exceeds the highest rate which we may lawfully charge under applicable law from time
to time in effect, the parties will, to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, characterize any non-principal payment as
a reasonable loan charge, rather than as interest. Any provision hereof or of any other agreement between the parties, that operates
to bind, obligate, or compel you to pay interest in excess of such Maximum Rate will be construed to require the payment of the Maximum
Rate only. The provisions of this section will be given precedence over any other provision contained herein or in any other agreement
between the parties that is in conflict with the provisions of this section.

27.
Governing Law 

Utah
law and federal law govern this Loan Agreement and your Loan. They govern without regard to internal principles of conflicts of law.
You and the Business Representative agree that this Loan Agreement is made and performed in the State of Utah. You and the Business Representative
agree that: (i) we are located in Utah; (ii) we make all credit decisions from our home office in Utah; and (iii) the Loan hereunder
is made in Utah (that is, no binding contract will be formed until we receive and accept your signed Loan Agreement in Utah). This Loan
Agreement will only be valid when signed by you and the Business Representative and accepted by us at our home office in Utah. 

28.
Claims Resolution 

For
this section, you and us includes any corporate parents, subsidiaries, affiliates or related persons or entities
and you also includes Business Representative. Claim means any current or future claim, dispute or controversy
relating to your Loan(s), this Loan Agreement, or any agreement or relationship you have or had with us, except for the validity, enforceability
or scope of the Arbitration provision. Claim includes but is not limited to: (1) initial claims, counterclaims, crossclaims and third-party
claims; (2) claims based upon contract, tort, fraud, statute, regulation, common law and equity; (3) claims by or against any third party
using or providing any product, service or benefit in connection with any loan; and (4) claims that arise from or relate to (a) any loan
created under any of the agreements, or any balances on any such loan, (b) advertisements, promotions or statements related to any loans,
goods or services financed under any loans or terms of financing, and (c) your application for any loan. You may not sell, assign or
transfer a claim. 

Sending
a Claim Notice 

Before
beginning a lawsuit, mediation or arbitration, you and we agree to send a written notice (a claim notice) to each party against whom
a claim is asserted, in order to provide an opportunity to resolve the claim informally or through mediation. Go to https://www.americanexpress.com/en-us/business/blueprint/claim/claim-form.pdf
 for a sample claim notice. The claim notice must describe the claim and state the specific relief demanded. Notice to you may be
provided by your billing statement or sent to your billing address. Notice to us must include your name, address and Account number and
be sent to American Express ADR c/o CT Corporation System, 28 Liberty Street, New York, New York 10005. If the claim proceeds to arbitration,
the amount of any relief demanded in a claim notice will not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator rules. 

Mediation 

In
mediation, a neutral mediator helps parties resolve a claim. The mediator does not decide the claim but helps parties reach agreement.
Before beginning mediation, you or we must first send a claim notice. Within 30 days after sending or receiving a claim notice, you or
we may submit the claim to JAMS (1-800-352-5267, jamsadr.com) or the American Arbitration Association AAA (1-800-778-7879,
adr.org) for mediation. We will pay the fees of the mediator. All mediation- related communications are confidential, inadmissible in
court and not subject to discovery. 

All
applicable statutes of limitation will be tolled from the date you or we send the claim notice until termination of the mediation. Either
you or we may terminate the mediation at any time. The submission or failure to submit a claim to mediation will not affect your or our
right to elect arbitration. 

Arbitration 

You
or we may elect to resolve any claim by individual arbitration. Claims are decided by a neutral arbitrator. If arbitration is chosen
by any party, neither you nor we will have the right to litigate that claim in court or have a jury trial on that claim. Further, you
and we will not have the right to participate in a representative capacity or as a member of any class pertaining to any claim subject
to arbitration. Arbitration procedures are generally simpler than the rules that apply in court, and discovery is more limited. The arbitrator s
authority is limited to claims between you and us alone. Claims may not be joined or consolidated unless you and we agree in writing.
An arbitration award and any judgment confirming it will apply only to the specific case and cannot be used in any other case except
to enforce the award. The arbitrator s decisions are as enforceable as any court order and are subject to very limited review by
a court. Except as set forth below, the arbitrator s decision will be final and binding. Other rights you or we would have in court
may also not be available in arbitration. 

Initiating
Arbitration 

Before
beginning arbitration, you or we must first send a claim notice. Claims will be referred to either JAMS or AAA, as selected by the party
electing arbitration. Claims will be resolved pursuant to this Arbitration provision and the selected organization s rules in effect
when the claim is filed, except where those rules conflict with this Loan Agreement. If we choose the organization, you may select the
other within 30 days after receiving notice of our selection. Contact JAMS or AAA to begin an arbitration or for other information. Claims
also may be referred to another arbitration organization if you and we agree in writing or to an arbitrator appointed pursuant to section
5 of the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. 1-16 FAA ). 

We
will not elect arbitration for any claim you file in small claims court, so long as the claim is individual and pending only in that
court. You or we may otherwise elect to arbitrate any claim at any time unless it has been filed in court and trial has begun or final
judgment has been entered. Either you or we may delay enforcing or not exercise rights under this Arbitration provision, including the
right to arbitrate a claim, without waiving the right to exercise or enforce those rights. 

Limitations
on Arbitration 

If
either party elects to resolve a claim by arbitration, that claim will be arbitrated on an individual basis. There will be no right or
authority for any claims to be arbitrated on a class action basis or on bases involving claims brought in a purported representative
capacity on behalf of the general public, other cardmembers or other persons similarly situated. 

Notwithstanding
any other provision and without waiving the right to appeal such decision, if any portion of these Limitations on Arbitration 
is deemed invalid or unenforceable, then the entire Arbitration provision (other than this sentence) will not apply. 

Arbitration
Procedures 

This
Arbitration provision is governed by the FAA. The arbitrator will apply applicable substantive law, statutes of limitations and privileges.
The arbitrator will not apply any federal or state rules of civil procedure or evidence in matters relating to evidence or discovery.
Subject to the Limitations on Arbitration , the arbitrator may otherwise award any relief available in court. You and we agree
that the arbitration will be confidential. You and we agree that we will not disclose the content of the arbitration proceeding or its
outcome to anyone, but you or we may notify any government authority of the claim as permitted or required by law. If your claim is for
 10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents, through a telephonic hearing,
or by an in-person hearing. At any party s request, the arbitrator will provide a brief written explanation of the award. The arbitrator s
award will be final and binding, subject to each party s right to appeal as stated in this section and/or to challenge or appeal
an arbitration award pursuant to the FAA. To initiate an appeal, a party must notify the arbitration organization and all parties in
writing within 35 days after the arbitrator s award is issued. The arbitration organization will appoint a three- arbitrator panel
to decide anew, by majority vote based on written submissions, any aspect of the decision objected to. The appeal will otherwise proceed
pursuant to the arbitration organization s appellate rules. Judgment upon any award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.
At your election, arbitration hearings will take place in the federal judicial district of your residence. 

Arbitration
Fees and Costs 

You
will be responsible for paying your share of any arbitration fees (including filing, administrative, hearing or other fees), but only
up to the amount of the filing fees you would have incurred if you had brought a claim in court. We will be responsible for any additional
arbitration fees. At your written request, we will consider in good faith making a temporary advance of your share of any arbitration
fees, or paying for the reasonable fees of an expert appointed by the arbitrator for good cause. 

Additional
Arbitration Awards 

If
the arbitrator rules in your favor for an amount greater than any final offer we made before the final hearing in arbitration, the arbitrator s
award will include: (1) any money to which you are entitled, but in no case less than 5,000; and (2) any reasonable attorneys 
fees, costs and expert and other witness fees. 

Your
Right to Reject Arbitration 

You
may reject this Arbitration provision by sending a written rejection notice to us at: American Express, P.O. Box 981556, El Paso, TX
79998. Go to https://www.americanexpress.com/en-us/business/blueprint/reject/reject-form.pdf for a sample rejection notice. Your
rejection notice must be mailed within 45 days after you execute your Loan Agreement. Your rejection notice must state that you reject
the Arbitration provision and include your name, address, Account number and personal signature. No one else may sign the rejection notice.
If your rejection notice complies with these requirements, this Arbitration provision and any other arbitration provisions in the Loan
Agreement(s) for any other currently open American Express loans you have will not apply to you and any claims subject to pending litigation
or arbitration at the time you send your rejection notice. Rejection of this Arbitration provision will not affect your other rights
or responsibilities under this Claims Resolution section or the Loan Agreement. Rejecting this Arbitration provision will not affect
your ability to use any benefit, product or service you may have with your Loan. 

Continuation 

This
section will survive termination of your Loan Agreement, voluntary payment of your Loan balance, any legal proceeding to collect a debt,
any bankruptcy and any sale of your Loan (in the case of a sale, its terms will apply to the buyer of your Loan). If any portion of this
Claims Resolution section, except as otherwise provided in the Limitations on Arbitration subsection, is deemed invalid or unenforceable,
it will not invalidate the remaining portions of this Claims Resolution section. 

29.
Entire Agreement 

This
Loan Agreement is a final expression of the agreement between you, the Business Representative and us governing your loan. There are
no unwritten oral agreements between the parties. This written Loan Agreement may not be contradicted by any alleged oral agreement.
You and the Business Representative may not amend the terms of this Loan Agreement without written agreement from us. We may amend this
Loan Agreement to comply with law or to update any names or contact information, definitions, references, or similar terms, only to the
extent such amendment is permitted by law, and you and the Business Representative acknowledge that you agree to such amendment upon
notice. All rights and obligations of us, our affiliates, you and the Business Representative concerning anything other than the loan
continue to be governed by the terms of the separate agreement governing such items, if any. In the event of any conflict between this
Loan Agreement and any separate agreement, this Loan Agreement shall prevail as it relates to your loan. You and the Business Representative
acknowledge that there are no third-party beneficiaries to this Loan Agreement.

and first agree in a signed record to keep such information confidential. You and the Business Representative will not issue any press
release or make any public announcement (or both) in respect of this Loan Agreement or us without our prior signed consent. In the event

AMERICAN PICTURE HOUSE CORPORATION 

 CODE
OF ETHICS AND BUSINESS CONDUCT 

 (Effective December 2021) 

Introduction 

The Board of Directors (the Board of American Picture House Corporation (together with its subsidiaries, the Company has adopted this Code of Ethics and
Business Conduct (the Code in order to: 

(a) Promote honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual or
apparent conflicts of interest; 

(b) Promote full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports and
documents that the Company files with, or submits to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC and in other public
communications made by the Company; 

(c) Promote compliance with applicable governmental laws, rules and regulations; 

(d) Promote the protection of Company assets, including corporate opportunities and
confidential information; 

(e) Promote fair dealing practices; 

(f) Deter wrongdoing; and 

(g) Ensure accountability for adherence to the Code. 

All directors, officers and employees
are required to be familiar with the Code, comply with its provisions and report any suspected violations as described below in the section
titled Reporting and Enforcement. 

Honest
and Ethical Conduct 

The Company s policy is to promote
high standards of integrity by conducting its affairs honestly and ethically. 

Each director, officer and employee
must act with integrity and observe the highest ethical standards of business conduct in his or her dealings with the Company s
customers, suppliers, partners, service providers, competitors, employees and anyone else with whom he or she has contact in the course
of performing his or her job. 

Conflicts
of Interest 

A conflict of interest occurs when
an individual s private interest (or the interest of a member of his or her family) interferes, or even appears to interfere, with
the interests of the Company as a whole. A conflict of interest can arise when an employee, officer or director (or a member of his or
her family) takes actions or has interests that may make it difficult to perform his or her work for the Company objectively and effectively.
Conflicts of interest also arise when an employee, officer or director (or a member of his or her family) receives improper personal benefits
as a result of his or her position in the Company. 

Loans by the Company to, or guarantees
by the Company of obligations of, employees or their family members are of special concern and could constitute improper personal benefits
to the recipients of such loans or guarantees, depending on the facts and circumstances. Loans by the Company to, or guarantees by the Company of obligations
of, any director or executive officer or their family members are expressly prohibited. 

1 | Page 

Whether or not a conflict of interest
exists or will exist can be unclear. Conflicts of interest should be avoided unless specifically authorized as described immediately below. 

Persons other than directors and executive
officers who have questions about a potential conflict of interest or who become aware of an actual or potential conflict should discuss
the matter with, and seek a determination and prior authorization or approval from, the Company s general counsel (the General
Counsel ). A supervisor may not authorize or approve conflict of interest matters or make determinations as to whether a problematic
conflict of interest exists without first providing the General Counsel with a written description of the activity and seeking the General
Counsel s written approval. If the supervisor is himself or herself involved in the potential or actual conflict, the matter should
instead be discussed directly with the General Counsel. 

Directors and executive officers must
seek determinations and prior authorizations or approvals of potential conflicts of interest exclusively from the Audit Committee (the
 Audit Committee of the Board. 

Compliance 

Employees, officers and directors
should comply, both in letter and spirit, with all applicable laws, rules and regulations in the cities, states and countries in which
the Company operates. 

Although not all employees, officers
and directors are expected to know the details of all applicable laws, rules and regulations, it is important to know enough to determine
when to seek advice from appropriate personnel. Questions about compliance should be addressed to the Company s legal department. 

No director, officer or employee may
purchase or sell any Company securities while in possession of material non-public information regarding the Company, nor may any director,
officer or employee purchase or sell another company s securities while in possession of material non-public information regarding
that company. It is against Company policies and illegal for any director, officer or employee to use material non-public information
regarding the Company or any other company to: 

(a) Obtain profit for himself or herself; or 

(b) directly or indirectly tip others who might make an investment decision
on the basis of that information. 

Disclosure 

The Company s periodic reports
and other documents filed with the SEC, including all financial statements and other financial information, must comply with applicable
federal securities laws and SEC rules. 

Each director, officer and employee who
contributes in any way to the preparation or verification of the Company s financial statements and other financial information
must ensure that the Company s books, records and accounts are accurately maintained. Each director, officer and employee must cooperate
fully with the Company s accounting and internal audit departments, as well as the Company s independent public accountants
and counsel. 

Each director, officer and employee who
is involved in the Company s disclosure process must: 

(a) be familiar with and comply with the Company s disclosure controls and procedures
and its internal control over financial reporting; and 

2 | Page 

(b) take all necessary steps to ensure that all filings with the SEC and all other public
communications about the financial and business condition of the Company provide full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure. 

Protection
and Proper Use of Company Assets 

All directors, officers and employees should
protect the Company s assets and ensure their efficient use. Theft, carelessness and waste have a direct impact on the Company s
profitability and are prohibited. 

All Company assets should be used only
for legitimate business purposes. Any suspected incident of fraud or theft should be reported to the General Counsel and/or Board for
investigation immediately. 

The obligation to protect Company assets
includes the Company s proprietary information. Proprietary information includes intellectual property such as trade secrets, patents,
trademarks, and copyrights, as well as business and marketing plans, engineering and manufacturing ideas, designs, databases, records
and any non-public financial data or reports. Unauthorized use or distribution of this information is prohibited and could also be illegal
and result in civil or criminal penalties. 

Corporate 
 Opportunities 

All directors, officers and employees
owe a duty to the Company to advance its interests when the opportunity arises. Directors, officers and employees are prohibited from
taking for themselves personally(or for the benefit of friends or family members) opportunities that are discovered through the use of
Company assets, property, information or position. Directors, officers and employees may not use Company assets, property, information
or position for personal gain (including gain of friends or family members). In addition, no director, officer or employee may compete
with the Company. 

Confidentiality 

Directors, officers and employees
should maintain the confidentiality of information entrusted to them by the Company or by its customers, suppliers or partners, except
when disclosure is expressly authorized or is required or permitted by law. Confidential information includes all non-public information
(regardless of its source) that might be of use to the Company s competitors or harmful to the Company or its customers, suppliers
or partners if disclosed. 

Fair 
 Dealing 

Each director, officer and employee
must deal fairly with the Company s customers, suppliers, partners, service providers, competitors, employees and anyone else with
whom he or she has contact in the course of performing his or her job. No director, officer or employee may take unfair advantage of anyone
through manipulation, concealment, abuse or privileged information, misrepresentation of facts or any other unfair dealing practice.
