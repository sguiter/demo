and in cash. The Company has not experienced any losses in such
accounts and believes it is not exposed to any significant credit risk on cash. 

Financial
instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk consist principally of cash deposits. Accounts at each
institution are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC up to . As of September 30, 2024 and
December 31, 2023, the Company had approximately and in excess of the FDIC insured limit, respectively. 

Accounting
for Crypto Assets 

The
cost basis of the Company s crypto assets is initially recorded at their fair value using the last close price of the day in the
UTC (Coordinated Universal Time) time zone on the date of receipt. 

Crypto
assets are measured at their fair respective fair market values at each reporting period end on the balance sheets and classified as
either Staked Crypto Assets or Crypto Assets to distinguish their nature within the respective balances.
Staked crypto assets are presented as current assets if their lock-up periods are less than 12 months, and as long-term other assets
if the lock-up extends beyond one year. The majority of our crypto assets are staked, typically with lock-up periods of less than 21
days, and are considered current assets in accordance with ASC 210-10-20, Balance Sheet , due to the Company s ability to
sell them in a liquid marketplace, as we have a reasonable expectation that they will be realized in cash or sold or consumed during
the normal operating cycle of our business to support operations when needed. 

The
classification of purchases and sales in the statements of cash flows is determined based on the nature of the crypto assets, which can
be categorized as productive (i.e. acquired for purposes of staking) or non-productive (e.g. bitcoin). Acquisitions
of non-productive crypto assets are treated as operating activities, while acquisitions of productive crypto assets are classified as
investing activities in accordance with ASC 230-10-20, Investing activities . Productive crypto assets staked with lock-up periods
of less than 12 months are listed as current assets in the Staked Crypto Assets line item on the balance sheet. Staked
crypto assets with lock-up periods exceeding 12 months are categorized as long-term other assets. Non-productive crypto assets are included
in the Crypto Assets line item on the balance sheet. 

Effective
January 1, 2023, the Company has elected to early adopt ASU No. 2023-08 , resulting in a material change in accounting principle
related to the Company s accounting treatment of crypto assets. The impacts of the change in accounting principle are discussed
further in Note 4. 

The
Company employs the specific identification method to determine the cost basis of our assets for the computation of gains and losses,
in accordance with ASC 350-60-50-2a. This method involves identifying and using the actual cost of each individual asset sold or disposed
of to calculate the gain or loss on its sale. Realized gains (losses) on sale of crypto assets are included in other income (expenses)
in the statements of operations. The Company recorded realized gains (losses) on crypto assets of approximately and for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and approximately and for the nine months ended
September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

The
provision of validating blockchain transactions is an output of the Company s ordinary activities. Each separate block creation
or validation under a smart contract with a network represents a performance obligation. The satisfaction of the performance obligation
for processing and validating blockchain transactions occurs at a point in time when confirmation is received from the network indicating
that the validation is complete, and the awards are available for transfer. At that point, revenue is recognized. 

Ethereum
Block Building (Builder+) 

The
Company participates in the Ethereum blockchain network by engaging in the construction of blocks block building containing
strategically bundled transactions from the Ethereum mempool and from searchers who connect to the Company s endpoint with the
intent of the Company s builder proposing their transactions. Revenue recognition for these activities, conducted through Builder+,
entails the recognition of gas fees (or transaction fees earned in exchange for successfully constructing blocks of bundled
transactions and having these blocks selected and proposed by a validator to the Ethereum network for validation and successfully finalized
on the network. 

These
gas fees are earned as a direct result of the Company s fulfillment of its performance obligations, which include the construction
of blocks by bundling transactions to maximize the value of the included fees and the proposal of that block by a Validator. Each constructed
block under a smart contract with the Ethereum network signifies a distinct performance obligation. 

As
part of the block construction and proposal process, the Company s Builder purchases block space through a fixed non-negotiable
fee paid to a Validator (a Validator Payment embedded in each proposed block. The Validator Payment, predetermined by
the Builder, is paid to Validators as compensation for selecting and proposing the Company s block to the network for validation.
The Validator Payment is intrinsically linked to the Company s performance obligations and is disbursed in the block constructed
by the Builder if our Builder s block is both selected by a Validator and successfully proposed to, and finalized on, the Ethereum
network; otherwise, our Validator Payment may be included in a subsequent block. The Validator Payment represents a direct and fixed
pre-determined cost. 

The
satisfaction of the performance obligation occurs at a point in time when the constructed block is both proposed by a Validator and successfully
finalized on the Ethereum network. At this juncture, the Company has fulfilled its obligations, and the gas fees associated with the
transactions included in the block become available and are transferred to the Company s digital wallet. 

The
Company recognizes revenue, reflecting the fair value of the total gas fees earned from the constructed block.

staking of the Company s crypto assets to BTCS nodes as well as Validator Fees earned from third parties asset delegations to our
nodes; and (3) block rewards generated by BTCS Builders.

Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may

. Income taxes are accounted for using an asset and liability
approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that
have been recognized in the Company s financial statements or tax returns. A valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred
tax assets if all, or some portion, of such assets will more than likely not be realized. Should they occur, the Company s policy
is to classify interest and penalties related to tax positions as income tax expense. Since the Company s inception, no such interest
or penalties have been incurred.

Presentation
of Ethereum Block Building Revenues and Costs ASC 606 

During
the second quarter of 2024, the Company elected to change its accounting principle related to the presentation of revenue and cost of
revenues associated with its Ethereum block-building operations, as conducted through Builder+. This change in accounting principle is
pursuant to ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers . 

Upon
re-evaluation, the Company determined that gas fees earned by our Ethereum block builders should be recognized as gross revenue. The
Validator Payments, which are fees paid to the validator nodes for the contractual rights to control transaction bundles within the blocks,
should be presented separately as cost of revenues. The Company previously presented the net amount of gas fees, after netting off the
Validator Payments made, as revenue. This change from a net to a gross presentation aligns more closely with the economic realities of
our business operations and the transaction structure within the Ethereum network. 

The
Company has retrospectively applied this change in accounting principle to the financial statements for the three months ended March
31, 2024, to ensure comparability across all periods presented. The effect of this change results in an increase in the presentation
of both revenues and cost of revenues by for the three months ended March 31, 2024. The effect of this change in accounting principle
is immaterial and does not impact the reported gross profit, net income (loss), or any balance sheet items for the current or prior periods. 

Cost of revenues 

Gross profit 

Based
on an analysis of ASC 250, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections , and Staff Accounting Bulletin 99, Materiality , the
Company has determined that the effect of this change was immaterial to the previously issued financial statements for the three months
ended March 31, 2024. 

The
Company elected to implement this change in accounting principle as it provides a more accurate and transparent view of our Ethereum
block-building operations. This change enhances stakeholders understanding of the operational performance and the financial aspects
of our block-building activities under Builder+.

The
Company did not make any transfers between the levels of the fair value hierarchy during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and
2023. 

Level
3 Valuation Techniques 

Level
3 financial assets consist of private equity investments for which there is no current public market for these securities such that
the determination of fair value requires significant judgment or estimation. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the
Company s Level 3 investments were carried at the original cost of the investments, with a value of .
The Company has elected to apply the measurement alternative under ASC 321, Investments Equity Securities , for these
investments. 

Level
3 financial liabilities consist of the warrant liabilities for which there is no current market for these securities such that the determination
of fair value requires significant judgment or estimation. 

Changes
in fair value measurements categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy are analyzed each period based on changes in estimates
or assumptions and recorded as appropriate. 

A
significant decrease in volatility or a significant decrease in the Company s stock price, in isolation, would result in a
significantly lower fair value measurement. Changes in the values of the warrant liabilities are recorded in change in fair value
of warrant liabilities in the Company s statements of operations. 

On
March 2, 2021, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement with certain purchasers which closed on March 4, 2021 pursuant
to which the Company sold an aggregate of (i) shares of Common Stock, and (ii) Common Stock warrants (the Warrants to purchase up to shares of Common Stock for gross proceeds of million in a private placement offering. 

The
Warrants require, at the option of the holder, a net-cash settlement following certain fundamental transactions (as defined in the Warrants)
at the Company. At the time of issuance, the Company maintained control of certain fundamental transactions and as such the Warrants
were initially classified in equity. As of September 30, 2024, the Company no longer maintained control of certain fundamental transactions
as they did not control a majority of shareholder votes. As such, the Company may be required to cash settle the Warrants if a fundamental
transaction occurs which is outside the Company s control. Accordingly, the Warrants are classified as liabilities. The Warrants
have been recorded at their fair value using the Black-Scholes valuation model, and will be recorded at their respective fair value at
each subsequent balance sheet date. This model incorporates transaction details such as the Company s stock price, contractual
terms, maturity, risk-free rates, as well as volatility. 

The
Warrants require the issuance of registered shares upon exercise, do not expressly preclude an implied right to cash settlement and are
therefore accounted for as derivative liabilities. The Company classifies these derivative warrant liabilities on the balance sheet as
a current liability.

The
risk-free interest rate was based on rates established by the Federal Reserve Bank. For the Warrants, the Company estimates expected
volatility, giving primary consideration to the historical volatility of its Common Stock. The general expected volatility is based on
the standard deviation of the Company s underlying stock price s daily logarithmic returns. The expected life of the warrants
was determined by the expiration date of the warrants. The expected dividend yield was based on the fact that the Company has not historically
paid dividends on its Common Stock and does not expect to pay recurring dividends on its Common Stock in the future.

amount under the 2021 Plan from shares to shares. 

Options 

The
following weighted-average assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of options granted on the deemed grant date during the nine
months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 for the Black-Scholes formula: 

Term (years) 

Expected stock price volatility 

Risk-free rate of interest 

Expected
Volatility : The Company uses historical volatility as it provides a reasonable estimate of the expected volatility. Historical volatility
is based on the most recent volatility of the stock price over a period of time equivalent to the expected term of the option. 

Risk-Free
Interest Rate : The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. treasury zero-coupon yield curve in effect at the time of grant for
the expected term of the option. 

Expected
Term : The Company s expected term represents the weighted-average period that the Company s stock options are expected
to be outstanding. The expected term is based on the expected time to post-vesting exercise of options by employees. The Company uses
historical exercise patterns of previously granted options to derive employee behavioral patterns used to forecast expected exercise
patterns. 

For
awards vesting upon the achievement of the market conditions which were met at the date of grant, compensation cost measured on the date
of grant was immediately recognized. For awards vesting upon the achievement of the market conditions which were not met at the date
of grant, compensation cost measured on the grant date will be recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on estimation
using a Monte-Carlo simulation.

Company
Overview 

BTCS
Inc. is a Nasdaq-listed U.S.-based blockchain technology company focused on blockchain infrastructure, with its primary operations currently
centered on the Ethereum network. Our core focus is on driving scalable growth through a diverse range of blockchain-focused technological
solutions, emphasizing Ethereum infrastructure, including block-building and validator node operations. 

Blockchain
Infrastructure 

BTCS s
core business centers on its blockchain infrastructure, which supports the validation of transactions and security of multiple proof-of-stake
(PoS) and delegated proof-of-stake (dPoS) blockchain networks. The Company manages a network of cloud-based validator nodes, which play
a key role in network consensus by performing transaction validation attestation activities and proposing new blocks.
Through these activities, BTCS earns native token rewards by staking its own crypto assets on validator nodes operated by BTCS and third
parties. 

Our
evaluation of blockchain networks involves comprehensive due diligence procedures, including assessments of blockchain quality, reward
potential, and the technical challenges associated with running validator nodes. Criteria for assessing blockchain quality encompass
factors such as i) market and on-chain statistics, ii) liquidity, iii) potential blockchain utility, iv) history and milestones, v) growth
and development roadmap, vi) use cases, vii) community interest, vii) quality of documentation, viii) decentralization, and ix) any other
publicly available information. 

Ethereum
Block Building Builder+ 

A
central focus of BTCS s current operations is its Ethereum block-building initiative, branded as Builder+, launched in 2024. Through
Builder+ we purchase block space and leverage advanced algorithmic processes to construct blocks for on-chain validation. The goal of
Builder+ is to maximize gas fee revenue by optimizing the contents and structure of each block. The Company aims to maximize the value
of gas fees earned by increasing the number of blocks we purchase while minimizing the payments to validators required for purchasing
block space. 

Builder+
is now a central driver of BTCS s growth strategy, reflecting the Company s emphasis on scalable and efficient revenue generation
through advanced blockchain technology. 

While
Builder+ currently operates within the Ethereum ecosystem, it has been designed to adapt to a broader blockchain landscape, allowing
for potential expansion to other networks in the future. This flexibility aligns with BTCS s strategic vision to maintain a robust
blockchain infrastructure that is not limited to any single network, even as Ethereum remains a primary area of focus. 

28 

Staking-as-a-Service 

BTCS s
non-custodial Staking-as-a-Service StaaS business model allows for crypto asset holders to earn token rewards by participating
in network consensus mechanisms through staking and delegating their crypto assets to Company operated validator nodes. As a non-custodial
validator operator, the Company receives a percentage of a crypto asset holders staking rewards generated as a validator node
fee, for our ministerial role in hosting the validator node. This creates an opportunity for scalable revenue and business growth with
limited additional costs. The Company s StaaS strategy provides a more accessible and cost-effective alternative for crypto asset
holders to participate in blockchain networks consensus mechanisms, promoting the growth and adoption of blockchain technology. 

A
StaaS provider maintains a ministerial role in validating transactions on a given dPoS network on behalf of its Delegators by (1) using
open-source software to stake the relevant crypto assets; (2) monitoring and maintaining the nodes it is operating to ensure the computers
remain online to validate transactions; and (3) verifying transactions on the network when required. 

As
a non-custodial StaaS provider, we do not hold or take possession of any Delegator funds, crypto assets, or crypto asset rewards at any
point during the staking or delegation process. Delegation does not involve the transfer of crypto asset ownership to a Validator. During
the process of staking, delegated crypto assets remain in the Delegator s digital wallets. The blockchain network calculates rewards
earned, which are then distributed directly to the Delegator s wallet. The blockchain network does not distribute any of the Delegator s
earned crypto rewards to BTCS. At no point does the Validator gain access, control, or custody of the original staked crypto assets or
the earned crypto rewards through staking to its node. Therefore, the Company does not have any exposure to the custodial risks that
a crypto exchange would have related to excessive redemptions or withdrawals of crypto assets, suspension of redemptions, or withdrawals.
Further, we do not issue or hold crypto assets on behalf of third parties and have no exposure to the risks an exchange would have with
respect to loans, rehypothecation, or margin. 

The
following table details the blockchain networks on which BTCS operates nodes that support third-party delegations as part of our staking-as-a-service
operations, including the amount of third-party crypto assets delegated to our non-custodial validator nodes, as of September 30, 2024:

Supporting
Platforms: ChainQ and StakeSeeker 

To
complement our core blockchain infrastructure, we have developed crypto-focused technology solutions aimed at increasing accessibility
and transparency within the blockchain ecosystem. These solutions include ChainQ , an AI-powered blockchain data and analytics
platform currently in beta, and StakeSeeker , a portfolio monitoring tool designed for cryptocurrency holders. 

ChainQ
simplifies the process of accessing and analyzing blockchain data, enabling deeper insights into on-chain activity. Through comprehensive
indexing of public blockchain data from our Blockchain Infrastructure operations, ChainQ is intended to provide an intuitive and straightforward
platform for users to access on-chain data. 

29 

StakeSeeker
is a personal finance software and education center with a comprehensive crypto dashboard providing tools for crypto asset holders to
connect, monitor, track, and analyze their crypto portfolios across exchanges and wallets in a single analytics platform. StakeSeeker
does not provide or facilitate direct, crypto asset delegation or transaction execution on our platform. The StakeSeeker platform is
currently free-to-use for registered users and is not currently generating revenue. The Company is not a broker-dealer or an investment
advisor and does not provide any such related services. 

Both
the ChainQ and StakeSeeker platforms contribute to the overall value BTCS offers within the blockchain space, supporting its infrastructure
operations and expanding user engagement and awareness. 

Strategic
Outlook 

Looking
forward, BTCS remains committed to enhancing its blockchain infrastructure capabilities, with a strong emphasis on its Ethereum block-building
operations. The Company is poised to leverage its expertise in validator node management and block-building optimization as it seeks
scalable opportunities within the rapidly evolving blockchain ecosystem. While Ethereum is currently the primary network for BTCS s
operations, the Company may expand its infrastructure to accommodate additional blockchain networks. 

BTCS
is dedicated to remaining at the forefront of blockchain innovation and staying adaptable to opportunities across the broader blockchain
ecosystem. This strategic agility positions BTCS to navigate the evolving blockchain landscape while maximizing its impact.

Revenues 

The
increase in revenue during the 2024 Quarter and 2024 Period as compared to the 2023 Quarter and 2023 Period is primarily due to the increase
in the block rewards earned from our Ethereum block-building activities during the 2024 Quarter and 2024 Period. The increase is also
partially due to the increase in fair value of our crypto assets earned as rewards for staking as the market prices of crypto assets
continued to be elevated during 2024 Period compared to 2023 Period. Although we believe the number of block rewards and tokens we earn
from staking and revenue recognized will increase as we continue to expand our blockchain infrastructure efforts, we recognize that volatility
in the crypto asset markets may impact the market prices of the crypto assets we earn from staking. 

As detailed
above, in the 2024 Quarter, the Company earned approximately 217 ETH from its Builder+ and Validator operations. During
the period from October 1, 2024 to November 12, 2024, the Company has earned approximately 541 ETH from its Builder+ and
Validator operations. As such, the Company expects its revenue to significantly increase in the fourth quarter. During this time
period, our associated costs of revenues have also increased at a larger percentage than our revenue growth, resulting in lower
gross margins. 

Cost
of Revenues 

The
increase in the cost of revenues during the 2024 Period as compared to the 2023 Period is due to the increase in Validator Payments made
to purchase block space as part of our Ethereum block-building activities during the 2024 Quarter and Period. These additional costs
are partially offset by the efficiencies realized in our blockchain infrastructure validating operating costs, including streamlining
of web service hosting fees and reduction of services provided by vendors. We believe our cost of revenues will increase as we continue
to ramp up our business, particularly our strategy to increase the number and value of block production, requiring additional purchases
of block space from Validators. 

Summary
of Accounting Principle Change in Ethereum Block Building Revenues and Costs 

During
the second Quarter of 2024, the Company implemented a change in accounting principle related to the presentation of revenues and
costs associated with our Ethereum bloc- building operations. This change, made under ASC 606, now presents gas fees earned as gross
revenue and Validator Payments as cost of revenues, rather than netting them against each other. This correction, applied
retrospectively, better reflects the economic substance of our transactions and provides enhanced transparency. The change does not
impact gross profit, net income, or balance sheet items, but it does result in increased reported revenues and costs for the three
months ended March 31, 2024. 

Operating
Expenses 

General
and administrative expenses consist of director compensation, legal and professional fees and other personnel and related costs. The
increase in the 2024 Period was primarily due to an increase of approximately 200,000 in proxy service fees related to our 2024 annual
meeting as well as a decrease of approximately 140,000 in legal fees and related administrative costs from the 2023 Period, driven primarily
by services surrounding the Series V Preferred Distribution and related listing on Upstream Exchange incurred during the first half of
2023. We are uncertain as to whether our future legal expenses related to the SEC s current investigation of the Company will have
a material impact on our operating expenses during the remainder of 2024, or thereafter. Additionally, we incurred higher accounting
fees related to our audits and Form S-3 registration during the 2024 Period, which is partially offset by other reduced costs resulting
from cost cutting measures for other professional fees during the 2024 Period. 

Research
and development expenses decreased slightly during the 2024 Period from the 2023 Period as the Company shifted efforts dedicated to
the beta release of our proprietary StakeSeeker platform in the 2023 Period to focus on the launch of Builder+ operations as well as
the further development of ChainQ, which launched in July 2024. We anticipate research and development costs to remain consistent as
we continue to expand on technological solutions in the blockchain sector with a focus on cost management of our third-party
development team. 

35 

Compensation
and related expenses increased during the 2024 Period resulting from the addition of employee headcount during the 2024 Quarter as well
as larger accruals for estimated performance bonuses for 2024. We believe our compensation expenses will increase from those reported
in the 2024 Period as the Company continues to utilize non-cash equity-based compensation incentives as a core part of our compensation
strategy and anticipate additional accruals for 2024 performance-based bonus incentives in future reporting periods and may bring on additional staff. 

Marketing
costs increased during the 2024 Period as the Company incurred costs associated with the purchase of transaction traffic to bolster Ethereum
block production as part of the ramp up of Builder+ operations. The Company may have additional expenditures for transaction traffic
in order to further increase Ethereum block-building activities. 

The
realized losses on crypto asset transactions increased during the 2024 Period as the Company sold certain crypto assets from our blockchain
infrastructure operations in order to fund operating activities. The Company may realize additional gains (losses) in the future resulting from the sale of crypto assets to meet operational and cash needs. 

Other
Income (Expenses) 

The
changes in other income for the 2024 Quarter and 2024 Period were primarily attributed to the recognition of the change in unrealized
appreciation on crypto assets resulting from the increase in the fair market value of the Company s crypto assets during the 2024
Period compared to the 2023 Period and the decrease in the fair market value of the Company s crypto assets during the 2024 Quarter.
Changes in the unrealized appreciation or depreciation of crypto assets are directly influenced by the volatility in crypto markets,
which can be challenging for management to predict. 

Furthermore,
the changes in other income for the 2024 Quarter was partially driven by the decrease in the fair value of warrant liabilities throughout
the period. This non-cash expense is influenced by the value of our stock price at the end of each quarter, a factor that we cannot predict. 

Net
income (loss) 

The
decrease in net income for the 2024 Period compared to the 2023 Period is primarily attributable to larger increases in fair value of
our crypto assets during the 2024 Period compared to the 2023 Period. The decrease in net loss for the 2024 Quarter compared to the 2023
Quarter is primarily attributable to the decline of crypto market prices during the 2024 Quarter, resulting in decreased values of our
crypto assets and reporting of unrealized depreciation in the 2024 Quarter. We acknowledge that our net income (loss) may exhibit significant
fluctuations due to the volatility in the crypto asset markets, impacting changes in the fair value of crypto assets during future reporting
periods. 

36 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

ATM
Financing 

On
September 14, 2021, the Company entered into an At-The-Market Offering Agreement (the ATM Agreement with H.C. Wainwright
 Co., LLC, as agent H.C. Wainwright ), pursuant to which the Company may offer and sell (assuming an effective registration
statement on Form S-3), from time-to-time, through H.C. Wainwright, shares of the Company s Common Stock having an aggregate offering
price of up to 98,767,500. From September 14, 2021 through November 12, 2024, the Company sold a total of 5,260,536 shares
of Common Stock under the ATM Agreement for aggregate total gross proceeds of approximately 19, 176 ,000 at an average selling price
of 3.65 per share, resulting in net proceeds of approximately 18,548,000 after deducting commissions and other transaction costs. 

As
a result of the SEC s baby shelf requirements, the Company is currently limited in its sales of Common Stock under the ATM Agreement
to one-third of its public float during the 12 calendar months immediately prior to the sale. As of the filing date of this Form 10-Q,
the Company would be limited in its sales under the ATM Agreement to approximately 2,618,000 of shares. 

After
the expiration of the Company s prior Form S-3, the Company filed a new Form S-3, which became effective October 4, 2024. 

Liquidit y 

The
Company s financial statements have been prepared assuming that it will continue as a going concern, which contemplates continuity
of operations, realization of assets, and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. 

Liquidity
is the ability of a company to generate funds to support its current and future operations, satisfy its obligations, and otherwise operate
on an ongoing basis. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had approximately 254,000 of cash and working capital of approximately 25,090,000. 

As
of November 12, 2024, the Company had approximately 1,466,000 of cash and cash equivalents and the fair market value of the Company s
liquid crypto assets was approximately 31,548,000. The Company has no outstanding debt. The Company believes that the existing cash
and liquid crypto assets held by us provide sufficient liquidity to meet working capital requirements, anticipated capital expenditures
and contractual obligations for at least the next 12 months. 

Certain
of our staked crypto assets may be locked up for varying durations, depending on the specific blockchain protocol, and we may be unable
to unstake them in a timely manner in order to liquidate to the extent desired. Lock-up periods for our staked crypto assets range from
several hours to nine months. During times of instability in the market of crypto assets, we may not be able to sell our crypto assets
at reasonable prices or at all. As a result, our crypto assets may not be able to serve as a source of liquidity for us to the same extent
as cash and cash equivalents. 

Cash
Flows 

Cash
used in operating activities was approximately 2,388,000 during the 2024 Period compared to approximately 2,693,000 for the 2023 Period.
The largest recurring non-cash adjustments to our operating cash flows consisted of approximately 1,888,000 in stock-based compensation
as well as approximately 1,752,000 of revenue earned in native token crypto assets. 

Cash
provided by investing activities was approximately 531,000 during the 2024 Period compared to cash used in investing activities of approximately
 186,000 for the 2023 Period. Net cash inflows from investing activities resulted from the sale of crypto assets. We anticipate similar
levels of crypto assets sales in future quarters to fund operating activities. 

Cash
provided by financing activities was approximately 653,000 during the 2024 Period compared to approximately 1,114,000 for the 2023
Period. The cash inflows from financing activities were entirely from proceeds of Common Stock sold pursuant to the ATM Agreement.
The Company plans to continue to raise proceeds from the sale of Common Stock to fund operations as needed. 

37 

Off
Balance Sheet Transactions 

As
of September 30, 2024, there were no off-balance sheet arrangements and we were not a party to any off-balance sheet transactions. We
have no guarantees or obligations other than those which arise out of normal business operations. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

We
discussed the material accounting policies that are critical in making the estimates and judgments in our Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, under the caption Management s Discussion and Analysis Critical Accounting
Policies and Estimates . There has been no material change in critical accounting policies or estimates during the period covered
by this report.

controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024.
