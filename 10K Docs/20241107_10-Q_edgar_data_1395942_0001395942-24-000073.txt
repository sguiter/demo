The other one quarter of the PRSUs vest if and to the extent that the Company's total shareholder return over relative to that of companies within the S P SmallCap 600 ("TSR PRSUs") exceeds certain levels. The weighted average grant date fair value of the Adjusted EBITDA PRSUs was per share, which was determined using the closing price of the Company's common stock on the dates of grant. The weighted average grant date fair value of the TSR PRSUs was per share and was developed with a Monte Carlo simulation using a multivariate Geometric Brownian Motion.

 In the first nine months of 2024, approximately million RSUs were granted to certain management members of the Company.

 Basic ) Diluted ) 
 The Company includes participating securities (Series A Preferred Stock) in the computation of income from continuing operations per share pursuant to the two-class method. The two-class method of calculating income from continuing operations per share is an allocation method that calculates earnings per share for common stock and participating securities. Under the two-class method, total dividends provided to the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock and undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities are subtracted from income from continuing operations in determining income attributable to common stockholders. 
 The effect of stock options and restricted stock on income from continuing operations per share-diluted is determined through the application of the treasury stock method, whereby net proceeds received by the Company based on assumed exercises are hypothetically used to repurchase our common stock at the average market price during the period. Stock options that would have an anti-dilutive effect on income from continuing operations per diluted share, unexercisable market options and PRSUs subject to performance conditions which have not yet been satisfied are excluded from the calculations. Approximately million, million and million service options were excluded from the calculation of diluted income from continuing operations per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the three months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, and all of the market options were excluded from the calculation for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the three months ended September 30, 2023. In addition, approximately million, million and million PRSUs were excluded from the calculation of diluted income from continuing operations per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the three months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, no potential common shares were included in the computation of diluted income from continuing operations per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, because to do so would have been anti-dilutive based on the period undistributed loss from continuing operations. Total options outstanding at September 30, 2024 and 2023 were million and million, respectively.

 In September 2024, AFC and AFC Funding Corporation entered into a First Amendment and Joinder (the "First Amendment") to the Tenth Amended and Restated Receivables Purchase Agreement. The First Amendment provides for, among other things, an extension of the facility's maturity date from January 31, 2026 to January 31, 2028.

 Proceeds from the revolving sale of receivables to the bank facilities are used to fund new loans to customers.

 Goodwill represents the excess cost over fair value of identifiable net assets of businesses acquired. The Company tests goodwill and indefinite-lived tradenames for impairment at the reporting unit level annually during the second quarter, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. When performing the impairment assessment, the fair value of the Company's reporting units are estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows (Level 3 inputs). impairment has been identified in 2024. 
 In the second quarter of 2023 the Company recorded non-cash goodwill impairment charges totaling million related to our U.S. Dealer-to-Dealer reporting unit and million related to our Europe reporting unit (both within the Marketplace

 The deferred tax benefits of million and million associated with the goodwill and tradename impairments in the second quarter of 2023, respectively, resulted in the U.S. being in a net deferred tax asset position.

 Credit Facilities 
 On June 23, 2023, we entered into the Credit Agreement, which replaced the Previous Credit Agreement, and provides for, among other things, the million Revolving Credit Facility. As a result of replacing the Previous Credit Agreement, we incurred a non-cash loss on the extinguishment of debt of million in the second quarter of 2023. The loss was the result of the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs associated with lenders that are not participating in the Revolving Credit Facility. On January 19, 2024, the Company and ADESA Auctions Canada Corporation, a subsidiary of the Company (the "Canadian Borrower") entered into the First Amendment Agreement (the "First Amendment") to the Credit Agreement. The First Amendment provides for, among other things, (i) a C million revolving credit facility in Canadian dollars (the "Canadian Revolving Credit Facility" and, together with the Revolving Credit Facility, "the Revolving Credit Facilities") and (ii) a C million sub-limit (the "Canadian Sub-limit") under the Company's existing Revolving Credit Facility for borrowings in Canadian dollars. The proceeds from the Canadian Revolving Credit Facility may be used to finance a portion of the Manheim Canada acquisition, to pay for expenses related to the First Amendment and for ongoing working capital and general corporate purposes. 
 The Revolving Credit Facility is available for letters of credit, working capital, permitted acquisitions and general corporate purposes. The Revolving Credit Facility also includes a million sub-limit for the issuance of letters of credit and a million sub-limit for swingline loans. 
 The obligations of the Company under the Revolving Credit Facility are guaranteed by certain of our domestic subsidiaries (the "Subsidiary Guarantors") and are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors, including but not limited to: (a) pledges of and first priority security interests in of the equity interests of certain of the Company's and the Subsidiary Guarantors' domestic subsidiaries and of the equity interests of certain of the Company's and the Subsidiary Guarantors' first tier foreign subsidiaries and (b) first priority security interests in substantially all other assets of the Company and each Subsidiary Guarantor, subject to certain exceptions.

 The obligations of the Canadian Borrower under the Canadian Revolving Credit Facility are guaranteed by certain of the Company s domestic and Canadian subsidiaries (the "Canadian Revolving Credit Facility Subsidiary Guarantors") and are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company, the Canadian Borrower and the Canadian Revolving Credit Facility Subsidiary Guarantors, subject to certain exceptions; provided, however, the Canadian Borrower and the other Canadian subsidiaries of the Company constituting the Canadian Revolving Credit Facility Subsidiary Guarantors shall guarantee and/or provide security for only the Canadian Secured Obligations (as defined in the Credit Agreement, as amended by the First Amendment). 
 Loans under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a rate calculated based on the type of borrowing (at the Company's election, either Adjusted Term SOFR Rate or Base Rate (each as defined in the Credit Agreement)) and the Company s Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement), with such rate ranging from to for Adjusted Term SOFR Rate loans and from to for loans. The Company also pay s a commitment fee between to basis points, payable , on the average daily unused amount of the Revolving Facility based on the Company s Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio. 
 Loans under the Canadian Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a rate calculated based on the type of borrowing (at the Canadian Borrower's election, either Adjusted Term CORRA Rate or Canadian Prime Rate (each as defined in the Credit Agreement, as amended by the First Amendment)) and the Company s Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio, with such rate ranging from to for Adjusted Term CORRA loans and from to for Canadian Prime Rate loans. Loans under the Canadian Sub-limit will bear interest at the Adjusted Term CORRA Rate plus a margin ranging from to based on the Company s Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio (the same margin as loans under the existing Revolving Credit Facility). The Canadian Borrower will also pay a commitment fee between to basis points, payable , on the average daily unused amount of the Canadian Revolving Credit Facility based on the Company s Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio. 
 Debt issuance costs are presented as a direct reduction from the amount of the related debt liability to arrive at the carrying amount. Unamortized debt issuance costs were million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, million and million was drawn on the Revolving Credit Facilities, respectively. In addition, we had related outstanding letters of credit in the aggregate amount of million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, which reduce the amount available for borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facilities. As of September 30, 2024 there was an additional million available for borrowing under the Revolving Credit Facilities. The Revolving Credit Facilities are classified as current debt based on the Company s past practice of using the Revolving Credit Facilities for short term borrowings. However, the terms of the Revolving Credit Facilities do not require repayment until maturity at June 23, 2028. 
 Senior Notes 
 On May 31, 2017, we issued million of senior notes due June 1, 2025. The Company pays interest on the senior notes semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year. The senior notes may be redeemed at par. The senior notes are guaranteed by the Subsidiary Guarantors. In June 2023, in connection with a previously announced offer to purchase, we prepaid million of the senior notes at par with proceeds from the Transaction. We incurred a loss on the extinguishment of the senior notes of million in the second quarter of 2023 primarily representative of the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the portion of the senior notes repaid, as well as purchase offer expenses. At September 30, 2024, the remaining million of senior notes are classified as current debt; at December 31, 2023 the senior notes were classified as long-term debt.

 million million). The lines of credit had an aggregate million and million of borrowings outstanding at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The lines of credit are secured by certain inventory and receivables at ADESA Europe subsidiaries. 
 Fair Value of Debt 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the estimated fair value of our long-term debt amounted to million and million, respectively. The estimates of fair value were based on broker-dealer quotes (Level 2 inputs) for our debt as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The estimates presented on long-term financial instruments are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that would be realized in a current market exchange.

 Fair Value Measurement of Investments 
 The Company invests in certain early-stage automotive companies and funds that relate to the automotive industry. We believe these investments have resulted in the expansion of relationships in the vehicle remarketing industry. The realized and unrealized gains and losses on these investment securities are shown in the table above. 
 ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement , defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had investment securities measured at fair value (based on quoted market prices for identical assets or Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy). Other investments held of million do not have readily determinable fair values and the Company has elected to apply the measurement alternative to these investments and present them at cost. Investments are reported in "Other assets" in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Realized and unrealized gains and losses are reported in "Other (income) expense, net" in the consolidated statements of income. 
 In late March 2023, one of the investees we presented at cost filed to reorganize its operations through the bankruptcy process. Based on this information, we recorded an other than temporary impairment of approximately million in "Other (income) expense, net" representing our entire equity investment in the company. In addition, we also had a note receivable with this investee for million, on which we recorded a credit impairment loss in "Other (income) expense, net" in the first quarter of 2023. 
 In the second quarter of 2023, the Company received million in connection with the early termination of a contractual arrangement with IAA. This amount was considered non-operating income and was recorded in "Other (income) expense, net" in the second quarter of 2023.

 Automotive Industry and Economic Impacts on our Business 
 We are dependent on the supply of used vehicles in the wholesale market, and our financial performance depends, in part, on conditions in the automotive industry. The automotive industry has experienced unprecedented market conditions, including global automotive production challenges. In recent years, these conditions have resulted in significant fluctuations in used vehicle values and declines in vehicle volumes in the wholesale market. More recently, new vehicle supply has begun to recover, and this has resulted in wholesale vehicle supply also starting to increase. 
 However, macroeconomic factors, including inflationary pressures, interest rates, volatility of oil and natural gas prices and declining consumer confidence continue to impact the affordability and demand for new and used vehicles. Declining economic conditions present a risk to our operations and the stability of the automotive industry. Given the nature of these factors, we cannot predict whether or for how long certain trends will continue, nor to what degree these trends will impact us in the future. 
 
 Overview 
 We are a leading digital marketplace for used vehicles, connecting sellers and buyers across North America and Europe to facilitate fast, easy and transparent transactions. Our business is divided into two reportable business segments, each of which is an integral part of the wholesale used vehicle remarketing industry: Marketplace and Finance. 
 The Marketplace segment serves a domestic and international customer base through digital marketplaces in the U.S., Canada and Europe and vehicle logistics center locations across Canada. Comprehensive private label remarketing solutions are offered to automobile manufacturers, captive finance companies and other commercial customers to offer vehicles digitally. Vehicles sold on our digital platforms are typically sold by commercial fleet operators, financial institutions, rental car companies, new and used vehicle dealers and vehicle manufacturers and their captive finance companies to dealer customers. We also provide value-added ancillary services including inbound and outbound transportation logistics, reconditioning, vehicle inspection and certification, titling, administrative and collateral recovery services. 
 Through AFC, the Finance segment provides short-term, inventory-secured financing, known as floorplan financing, primarily to independent dealer customers throughout the United States and Canada. In addition, AFC provides liquidity for customer trade-ins which encompasses settling lien holder payoffs. AFC also provides title services for their customers. These services are provided through AFC's digital servicing network as well as its physical locations throughout North America.

 Industry Trends 
 Wholesale Used Vehicle Industry 
 We believe the U.S. and Canadian wholesale used vehicle industry has a total addressable market of approximately 15 million vehicles, which can fluctuate depending on seasonality and a variety of other macro-economic and industry factors. This wholesale used vehicle industry consists of the commercial market (commercial sellers that sell to franchise and independent dealers) and the dealer-to-dealer market (franchise and independent dealers that both buy and sell vehicles). The Company supports the majority of commercial sellers in North America with our technology and we believe digital applications may provide an opportunity to expand the total addressable market for dealer-to-dealer transactions. The supply chain issues and market conditions facing the automotive industry in recent years, including the disruption of new vehicle production, low new vehicle supply and historically high used vehicle pricing have had a material impact on the wholesale used vehicle industry. More recently, new vehicle supply has begun to recover, and this has resulted in wholesale vehicle supply also starting to increase. 
 Automotive Finance 
 AFC works with independent dealer customers to improve their results by providing a comprehensive set of business and financial solutions that leverage its local presence of branches and in-market representatives, industry experience and scale, as well as OPENLANE affiliations. AFC's North American dealer base was comprised of approximately 14,200 dealers in 2023. 
 Key challenges for the independent dealer customers include demand for used vehicles, disruptions in pricing of used vehicle inventory, access to consumer financing, increased interest rates and increased used car retail activity of franchise and public dealerships (most of which do not utilize AFC or its competitors for floorplan financing). These same challenges, to the extent they occur, could result in a material negative impact on AFC's results of operations. A significant decline in used vehicle sales would result in a decrease in consumer auto loan originations and an increased number of dealers defaulting on their loans. In addition, volatility in wholesale vehicle pricing impacts the value of recovered collateral on defaulted loans and the resulting severity of credit losses at AFC. A decrease in wholesale used car pricing could lead to increased losses if dealers are unable to satisfy their obligations. 
 Seasonality 
 The volume of vehicles sold through our marketplaces generally fluctuates from quarter-to-quarter. This seasonality is caused by several factors including weather, the timing of used vehicles available for sale from selling customers, holidays, and the seasonality of the retail market for used vehicles, which affects the demand side of the auction industry. Wholesale used vehicle volumes tend to decline during prolonged periods of winter weather conditions. As a result, revenues and operating expenses related to volume will fluctuate accordingly on a quarterly basis. In North America, the fourth calendar quarter typically experiences lower used vehicle volume as well as additional costs associated with the holidays and winter weather. 
 In addition, changes in working capital vary from quarter-to-quarter as a result of the timing of collections and disbursements of funds to consignors from marketplace sales held near period end. 
 Sources of Revenues and Expenses 
 The vehicles sold on our marketplaces generate auction fees from buyers and sellers. The Company generally does not take title to these consigned vehicles and records only its auction fees as revenue ("Auction fees" in the consolidated statement of income (loss)) because it has no influence on the vehicle auction selling price agreed to by the seller and the buyer at the auction. The Company does not record the gross selling price of the consigned vehicles sold at auction as revenue. The Company generally enforces its rights to payment for seller transactions through net settlement provisions following the sale of a vehicle. Marketplace services such as inbound and outbound transportation logistics, reconditioning, vehicle inspection and certification, collateral recovery services and technology solutions are generally recognized at the time of service ("Service revenue" in the consolidated statement of income (loss)). The Company also sells vehicles that have been purchased, which represent approximately 2 of the total volume of vehicles sold. For these types of sales, the Company does record the gross selling price of purchased vehicles sold at auction as revenue ("Purchased vehicle sales" in the consolidated statement of income (loss)) and the gross purchase price of the vehicles as "Cost of services." AFC's revenue ("Finance-related revenue" in the consolidated statement of income (loss)) is comprised of interest and fee income, provision for credit losses and other revenues associated with our finance receivables.

Table of Contents 

 Although Marketplace revenues primarily include auction fees and service revenue, our related receivables and payables include the gross value of the vehicles sold. Trade receivables include the unremitted purchase price of vehicles purchased by third parties through our marketplaces, fees to be collected from those buyers and amounts due for services provided by us related to certain consigned vehicles. The amounts due with respect to the services provided by us related to certain consigned vehicles are generally deducted from the sales proceeds upon the eventual auction or other disposition of the related vehicles. Accounts payable include amounts due sellers from the proceeds of the sale of their consigned vehicles less any fees. 
 Our operating expenses consist of cost of services, selling, general and administrative and depreciation and amortization. Cost of services is composed of payroll and related costs, subcontract services, the cost of vehicles purchased, supplies, insurance, property taxes, utilities, service contract claims, maintenance and lease expense related to the auction sites and loan offices. Cost of services excludes depreciation and amortization. Selling, general and administrative expenses are composed of payroll and related costs, sales and marketing, information technology services and professional fees.

 Overview 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had revenue of 448.4 million compared with revenue of 416.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 8 . For a further discussion of revenues, gross profit and selling, general and administrative expenses, see the segment results discussions below. 
 Depreciation and Amortization 
 Depreciation and amortization decreased 2.6 million, or 10 , to 23.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 26.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in depreciation and amortization was primarily the result of assets that have become fully amortized. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense decreased 4.1 million, or 10 , to 35.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 39.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was attributable to a decrease in the average balance on the AFC securitization obligations, resulting in a decrease in interest expense of 3.5 million at AFC (to 30.7 million from 34.2 million). 
 Other (Income) Expense, Net 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had other income of 3.6 million compared with other expense of 1.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in other income was primarily attributable to an increase in foreign currency gains on intercompany balances of 2.0 million, a decrease in unrealized losses on investment securities of 0.5 million and a net decrease in other miscellaneous expense aggregating 2.8 million.

 Income Taxes 
 We had an effective tax rate of 31.6 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with an effective tax rate of 50.0 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 wa s unfavorably impacted by an increa se in the valuation allowance related to current year movement of the adjusted U.S. net deferred tax asset. The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was unfavorably impacted by an increase in the valuation allowance related to 2023 current year movement of the adjusted U.S. net deferred tax asset. 
 We recorded a 42.9 million and 36.4 million valuation allowance against the U.S. net deferred tax asset at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The realization of the net deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income to utilize these assets. Depending on our current and anticipated future earnings, we may release a significant portion of our valuation allowance in a future period if there is sufficient positive evidence which would result in a corresponding decrease to income tax expense in such period. The actual timing and amount of the valuation allowance to be released is uncertain. 
 Impact of Foreign Currency 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the three months ended September 30, 2023, the change in the Canadian dollar exchange rate decreased revenue by 1.6 million, operating profit by 0.3 million and had no impact on net income. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the three months ended September 30, 2023, the change in the euro exchange rate increased revenue by 0.8 million, operating profit by 0.1 million and had no impact on net income.

 Total Marketplace Revenue 
 Revenue from the Marketplace segment increased 37.7 million, or 12 , to 354.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 316.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in revenue was primarily attributable to the 6 increase in the number of vehicles sold. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, there was an increase in purchased vehicle sales and an increase in auction fees, partially offset by a decrease in service revenue (discussed below). The change in revenue included the impact of a decrease in revenue of 1.3 million due to fluctuations in the Canadian dollar exchange rate and an increase of 0.8 million due to fluctuations in the euro exchange rate. 
 The 6 increase in the number of vehicles sold was comprised of an 8 in crease in commercial volumes and a 3 in crease in dealer consignment volumes. The gross merchandise value ("GMV") of vehicles sold for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was approximately 6.7 billion and 6.0 billion, respectively.

 Auction Fees 
 Auction fees increased 11.1 million, or 11 , to 113.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 102.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The number of vehicles sold increased 6 . Auction fees per vehicle sold for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 14 , or 5 , to 315 , compared with 301 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in auction fees per vehicle sold reflects the mix of vehicles sold in the third quarter of 2024 and the impact of price increases. 
 Service Revenue 
 Service revenue decreased 5.8 million, or 4 , to 148.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 153.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of a decrease in transportation revenue of 6.4 million, of which 12.6 million related to a change in a key customer contract that resulted in the customer's third quarter of 2024 revenue being recorded on a net commission basis instead of a gross basis, as it was recorded in the third quarter of 2023. In addition, there was a net decrease in other miscellaneous service revenues aggregating 3.8 million, partially offset by increases in inspection service revenue of 2.8 million and reconditioning revenue of 1.6 million. 
 Purchased Vehicle Sales 
 The entire selling and purchase price of the vehicle is recorded as revenue and cost of services for purchased vehicles sold, which represent approximately 2 of total vehicles sold. Purchased vehicle sales increased 32.4 million, or 53 , to 93.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 60.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of an increase in purchased vehicles sold in Europe. 
 Gross Profit 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, gross profit from the Marketplace segment increased 1.8 million, or 2 , to 119.1 million, compared with 117.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Gross profit improvements were driven by a 10.8 million increase in auction and service volumes and 0.4 million from pricing. These improvements were partially offset by a 9.4 million decrease in gross profit resulting from a higher mix of commercial volumes. 
 Gross profit from the Marketplace segment was 33.6 of revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 37.0 of revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Excluding purchased vehicle sales, gross profit as a percentage of revenue was 45.6 and 45.8 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 On June 28, 2024, Canada enacted a new 3 Digital Services Tax Canadian DST on certain online revenues, including online marketplace service revenues, of companies with consolidated revenues of at least 750 million. The Company recorded 1.2 million of Canadian DST to cost of services in the third quarter of 2024, which was partially mitigated by corresponding price increases during the quarter. 
 Selling, General and Administrative 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses from the Marketplace segment decreased 7.1 million, or 7 , to 87.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 94.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of decreases in information technology costs of 3.1 million, professional fees of 1.7 million, compensation expense of 1.2 million and miscellaneous expenses aggregating 1.1 million.

 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Finance segment revenue decreased 5.6 million, or 6 , to 94.1 million, compared with 99.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in revenue was primarily the result of a 6 decrease in revenue per loan transaction. Revenue per loan transaction, which includes both loans paid off and loans curtailed, decreased 14, or 6 , primarily as a result of a decrease in interest yields and a decrease in vehicle values, partially offset by an increase in floorplan fee per unit and an increase in average portfolio duration. 
 The provision for credit losses increased to 2.1 of the average managed receivables for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.0 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The provision for credit losses is expected to be approximately 2 or under, on a long-term basis, of the average managed receivables balance. However, the actual losses in any particular quarter or year could deviate from this range. 
 Gross Profit 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, gross profit for the Finance segment decreased 5.7 million, or 7 , to 77.3 million, or 82.1 of revenue, compared with 83.0 million, or 83.2 of revenue, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in gross profit as a percent of revenue was primarily the result of the 6 decrease in revenue and a less than 1 increase in cost of services. 
 Selling, General and Administrative 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses for the Finance segment decreased 0.9 million, or 7 , to 11.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 12.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily as a result of decreases in information technology costs of 1.1 million and incentive-based compensation of 0.3 million, partially offset by increases in title handling costs of 0.3 million and other miscellaneous expenses aggregating 0.2 million.

 Overview 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had revenue of 1,296.5 million compared with revenue of 1,253.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 3 . For a further discussion of revenues, gross profit and selling, general and administrative expenses, see the segment results discussions below. 
 Depreciation and Amortization 
 Depreciation and amortization decreased 4.0 million, or 5 , to 72.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 76.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in depreciation and amortization was primarily the result of assets that have become fully amortized. 
 Goodwill and Other Intangibles Impairment 
 In the second quarter of 2023 the Company recorded non-cash goodwill impairment charges totaling 218.9 million related to our U.S. Dealer-to-Dealer reporting unit and 6.4 million related to our Europe reporting unit (both within the Marketplace segment). The goodwill impairment related to our U.S. Dealer-to-Dealer reporting unit was primarily driven by lower near-term and long-term revenue growth associated with a slower overall recovery in vehicle volumes. The goodwill impairment related to our Europe reporting unit was driven by combining two previously separate reporting units (ADESA U.K. and ADESA Europe) into a single reporting unit. Including ADESA U.K. in the reporting unit resulted in a reduction in the overall fair value of the combined reporting unit, resulting in an impairment charge. The impairment charges were reported as a component of "Goodwill and other intangibles impairment" in the consolidated statements of income (loss).

Table of Contents 

 In addition, the second quarter 2023 announcement of the rebrand to an OPENLANE branded marketplace from the ADESA branded marketplaces resulted in a non-cash impairment charge totaling 25.5 million (within the Marketplace segment). The impairment charge was reported as a component of "Goodwill and other intangibles impairment" in the consolidated statements of income (loss). 
 The deferred tax benefits of 52.5 million and 6.5 million associated with the goodwill and tradename impairments in the second quarter of 2023, respectively, resulted in the U.S. being in a net deferred tax asset position. Due to the three-year cumulative loss related to U.S. operations, we recorded a 42.9 million and 36.4 million valuation allowance against the U.S. net deferred tax asset at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense decreased 4.1 million, or 4 , to 112.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 116.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Interest expense decreased as a result of the partial repayment of senior note debt in 2023. In addition, AFC had a 1.4 million decrease in interest expense (to 95.2 million from 96.6 million) attributable to a decrease in the average balance on the AFC securitization obligations. 
 Other (Income) Expense, Net 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had other income of 2.9 million compared with 12.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in other income was primarily attributable to the receipt of 20.0 million in connection with the early termination of a contractual arrangement that occurred during the second quarter of 2023 and a net decrease in other miscellaneous income aggregating 1.9 million, partially offset by the 2023 impairment of an equity security and note receivable with the same investee aggregating 11.0 million and a 1.3 million contingent consideration valuation adjustment in 2023. 
 Loss on Extinguishment of Debt 
 In June 2023, we prepaid 140 million of the senior notes at par with proceeds from the Transaction. We incurred a loss on the extinguishment of the senior notes of 0.7 million in the second quarter of 2023 primarily representative of the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the portion of the senior notes repaid, as well as purchase offer expenses. In June 2023, we also entered into the Revolving Credit Facility and incurred a loss on extinguishment of approximately 0.4 million for the debt issuance costs associated with certain banks that are no longer a part of the facility. 
 Income Taxes 
 We had an effective tax rate of 35.2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with an effective tax rate of -0.4 resulting in expense on a pre-tax loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was unfavorably impacted by an increase in the valuation allowance related to current year movement of the adjusted U.S. net deferred tax asset. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was impacted by the goodwill and other intangibles impairment charges and resulting 59.0 million deferred tax benefit recorded with respect to the impairment of tax deductible goodwill and the impairment of other intangibles, partially offset by the 34.2 million deferred tax expense associated with the recording of valuation allowance against the U.S. net deferred tax asset. 
 We recorded a 42.9 million and 36.4 million valuation allowance against the U.S. net deferred tax asset at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The realization of the net deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income to utilize these assets. Depending on our current and anticipated future earnings, we may release a significant portion of our valuation allowance in a future period if there is sufficient positive evidence which would result in a corresponding decrease to income tax expense in such period. The actual timing and amount of the valuation allowance to be released is uncertain. 
 Impact of Foreign Currency 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the change in the Canadian dollar exchange rate decreased revenue by 2.9 million, operating profit by 0.7 million and net income by 0.2 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the change in the euro exchange rate increased revenue by 0.8 million and had no impact on operating profit and net income.

 Total Marketplace Revenue 
 Revenue from the Marketplace segment increased 51.6 million, or 5 , to 1,008.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 957.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in revenue was primarily attributable to the 8 increase in the number of vehicles sold. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there was an increase in purchased vehicle sales and auction fees, partially offset by the decrease in service revenue (discussed below). The change in revenue included the impact of a decrease in revenue of 2.3 million due to fluctuations in the Canadian dollar exchange rate and an increase of 0.8 million due to fluctuations in the euro exchange rate. 
 The 8 increase in the number of vehicles sold was comprised of a 20 increase in commercial volumes and a 4 decrease in dealer consignment volumes. The gross merchandise value ("GMV") of vehicles sold for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was approximately 20.5 billion and 18.4 billion, respectively. 
 Auction Fees 
 Auction fees increased 26.5 million, or 9 , to 331.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 305.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The number of vehicles sold increased 8 . Auction fees per vehicle sold for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 1, or 0 , to 302, compared with 301 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Service Revenue 
 Service revenue decreased 29.8 million, or 6 , to 445.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 475.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of a decrease in transportation revenue of 47.2 million, of which 55.0 million related to a change in a key customer contract that resulted in the customer's revenue for the first nine months of 2024 being recorded on a net commission basis instead of a gross basis, as it was recorded in the first nine months of 2023. In addition, there was a net decrease in other miscellaneous service revenues aggregating approximately 1.8 million, partially offset by increases in inspection service revenue of 8.2 million, repossession and remarketing fees of 4.9 million, reconditioning revenue of 3.4 million and key service revenue of 2.7 million.

 Purchased Vehicle Sales 
 The entire selling and purchase price of the vehicle is recorded as revenue and cost of services for purchased vehicles sold, which represent approximately 2 of total vehicles sold. Purchased vehicle sales increased 54.9 million, or 31 , to 231.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 176.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of an increase in purchased vehicles sold in Europe. 
 Gross Profit 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, gross profit from the Marketplace segment increased 3.4 million, or 1 , to 347.2 million, compared with 343.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Gross profit improvements were driven by a 24.2 million increase in auction and service volumes and 4.8 million from pricing. These improvements were partially offset by the Canadian DST, which represented a decrease of 13.2 million and a 12.4 million decrease in gross profit resulting from a higher mix of commercial volumes. 
 Gross profit from the Marketplace segment was 34.4 of revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 35.9 of revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The Canadian DST decreased gross profit as a percentage of revenue by 130 basis points for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Excluding purchased vehicle sales, gross profit as a percentage of revenue was 44.7 and 44.0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Excluding purchased vehicle sales, gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a change in a key customer contract (see discussion in "Service revenue" above), increased volumes, increased prices and cost savings initiatives, partially offset by the Canadian DST. 
 As a result of the Canadian DST being retroactive to January 1, 2022, the Company recorded 13.2 million of Canadian DST to cost of services for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Approximately 3.2 million, 5 million and 5 million relates to Canadian DST for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. During the third quarter of 2024, the Company increased its prices to prospectively mitigate the Canadian DST. 
 Selling, General and Administrative 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses from the Marketplace segment decreased 12.4 million, or 4 , to 276.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 288.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of decreases in compensation expense of 7.8 million, incentive-based compensation of 5.0 million, professional fees of 2.9 million, information technology costs of 1.8 million and other miscellaneous expenses aggregating 1.9 million, partially offset by increases in severance of 4.1 million, marketing costs of 1.5 million and stock-based compensation expense of 1.4 million.

 Revenue 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Finance segment revenue decreased 8.9 million, or 3 , to 287.9 million, compared with 296.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in revenue was primarily the result of a 4 decrease in revenue per loan transaction, partially offset by a 1 increase in loan transactions. Revenue per loan transaction, which includes both loans paid off and loans curtailed, decreased 10, or 4 , primarily as a result of a decrease in vehicle values, partially offset by an increase in interest yields and an increase in floorplan fee per unit. 
 The provision for credit losses increased to 2.2 of the average managed receivables for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 2.0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The provision for credit losses is expected to be approximately 2 or under, on a long-term basis, of the average managed receivables balance. However, the actual losses in any particular quarter or year could deviate from this range. 
 Gross Profit 
 For the nine months September 30, 2024, gross profit for the Finance segment decreased 9.7 million, or 4 , to 237.5 million, or 82.5 of revenue, compared with 247.2 million, or 83.3 of revenue, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in gross profit as a percent of revenue was primarily the result of a 2 increase in cost of services and the 3 decrease in revenue. The increase in cost of services of 0.8 million was primarily the result of increases in professional fees of 0.5 million, travel expenses of 0.4 million and other miscellaneous expenses aggregating 0.7 million, partially offset by a decrease in lot check expenses of 0.8 million. 
 Selling, General and Administrative 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses for the Finance segment decreased 0.1 million, or 0 , to 37.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 37.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 As of September 30, 2024, our sources of liquidity consisted of cash on hand, working capital and amounts available under our Revolving Credit Facilities. Our principal ongoing sources of liquidity consist of cash generated by operations and borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facilities. 
 September 30, December 31, September 30, (Dollars in millions) 2024 2023 2023 Cash and cash equivalents 132.1 93.5 110.3 Working capital 199.5 363.1 432.1 Amounts available under the Revolving Credit Facilities 
 349.3 133.3 247.3 Cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended 260.1 216.2 
 We regularly evaluate alternatives for our capital structure and liquidity given our expected cash flows, growth and operating capital requirements as well as capital market conditions. 
 
 Working Capital 
 A substantial amount of our working capital associated with our Marketplace segment is generated from the payments received for services provided. The majority of our working capital needs in the Marketplace segment are short-term in nature, usually less than a week in duration. Most of the financial institutions place a temporary hold on the availability of the funds deposited that generally can range up to two business days, resulting in cash in our accounts and on our balance sheet that is unavailable for use until it is made available by the various financial institutions. There are outstanding checks (book overdrafts) to sellers and vendors included in current liabilities. Because a portion of these outstanding checks for operations in the U.S. are drawn upon bank accounts at financial institutions other than the financial institutions that hold the cash, we cannot offset all the cash and the outstanding checks on our balance sheet. Changes in working capital vary from quarter-to-quarter as a result of the timing of collections and disbursements of funds to consignors from marketplace sales held near period end. 
 Approximately 84.1 million of available cash was held by our foreign subsidiaries at September 30, 2024. If funds held by our foreign subsidiaries were to be repatriated, state and local income tax expense and withholding tax expense would need to be recognized, net of any applicable foreign tax credits. 
 AFC offers short-term inventory-secured financing, also known as floorplan financing, to independent dealer customers. Financing is primarily provided for terms of 30 to 90 days. AFC principally generates its funding through the sale of its receivables. The receivables sold pursuant to the securitization agreements are accounted for as secured borrowings. For further discussion of AFC's securitization arrangements, see "Securitization Facilities." 
 Credit Facilities 
 On June 23, 2023, we entered into the Credit Agreement, which replaced the Previous Credit Agreement, and provides for, among other things, the 325 million Revolving Credit Facility. As a result of replacing the Previous Credit Agreement, we incurred a non-cash loss on the extinguishment of debt of 0.4 million in the second quarter of 2023. The loss was the result of the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs associated with lenders that are not participating in the Revolving Credit Facility. On January 19, 2024, the Company and ADESA Auctions Canada Corporation, a subsidiary of the Company (the "Canadian Borrower") entered into the First Amendment Agreement (the "First Amendment") to the Credit Agreement. The First Amendment provides for, among other things, (i) a C 175 million revolving credit facility in Canadian dollars (the "Canadian Revolving Credit Facility" and, together with the Revolving Credit Facility, "the Revolving Credit Facilities") and (ii) a C 50 million sub-limit (the "Canadian Sub-limit") under the Company's existing Revolving Credit Facility for borrowings in Canadian dollars. The proceeds from the Canadian Revolving Credit Facility may be used to finance a portion of the Manheim Canada acquisition, to pay for expenses related to the First Amendment and for ongoing working capital and general corporate purposes. 
 The Revolving Credit Facility is available for letters of credit, working capital, permitted acquisitions and general corporate purposes. The Revolving Credit Facility also includes a 65 million sub-limit for the issuance of letters of credit and a 60 million sub-limit for swingline loans. 
 Loans under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a rate calculated based on the type of borrowing (at the Company's election, either Adjusted Term SOFR Rate or Base Rate (each as defined in the Credit Agreement)) and the Company s Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement), with such rate ranging from 2.75 to 2.25 for Adjusted Term SOFR Rate loans and from 1.75 to 1.25 for Base Rate loans. The Company also pay s a

 commitment fee between 25 to 35 basis points, payable quarterly, on the average daily unused amount of the Revolving Facility based on the Company s Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio. 
 Loans under the Canadian Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a rate calculated based on the type of borrowing (at the Canadian Borrower's election, either Adjusted Term CORRA Rate or Canadian Prime Rate (each as defined in the Credit Agreement, as amended by the First Amendment)) and the Company s Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio, with such rate ranging from 3.00 to 2.50 for Adjusted Term CORRA loans and from 2.00 to 1.50 for Canadian Prime Rate loans. Loans under the Canadian Sub-limit will bear interest at the Adjusted Term CORRA Rate plus a margin ranging from 2.75 to 2.25 based on the Company s Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio (the same margin as loans under the existing Revolving Credit Facility). The Canadian Borrower will also pay a commitment fee between 25 to 35 basis points, payable quarterly, on the average daily unused amount of the Canadian Revolving Credit Facility based on the Company s Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 56.0 million and 137.0 million was drawn on the Revolving Credit Facilities, respectively. We had related outstanding letters of credit in the aggregate amount of 49.1 million and 54.7 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, which reduce the amount available for borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facilities. Our European operations have lines of credit aggregating 33.4 million 30 million) of which 10.7 million was drawn at September 30, 2024. 
 The obligations of the Company under the Revolving Credit Facility are guaranteed by certain of our domestic subsidiaries (the "Subsidiary Guarantors") and are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company and the Subsidiary Guarantors, including but not limited to: (a) pledges of and first priority security interests in 100 of the equity interests of certain of the Company's and the Subsidiary Guarantors' domestic subsidiaries and 65 of the equity interests of certain of the Company's and the Subsidiary Guarantors' first tier foreign subsidiaries and (b) first priority security interests in substantially all other assets of the Company and each Subsidiary Guarantor, subject to certain exceptions. 
 The obligations of the Canadian Borrower under the Canadian Revolving Credit Facility are guaranteed by certain of the Company s domestic and Canadian subsidiaries (the "Canadian Revolving Credit Facility Subsidiary Guarantors") and are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company, the Canadian Borrower and the Canadian Revolving Credit Facility Subsidiary Guarantors, subject to certain exceptions; provided, however, the Canadian Borrower and the other Canadian subsidiaries of the Company constituting the Canadian Revolving Credit Facility Subsidiary Guarantors shall guarantee and/or provide security for only the Canadian Secured Obligations (as defined in the Credit Agreement, as amended by the First Amendment). 
 Certain covenants contained within the Credit Agreement are critical to an investor s understanding of our financial liquidity, as the failure to maintain compliance with these covenants could result in a default and allow the lenders under the Credit Agreement to declare all amounts borrowed immediately due and payable. The Credit Agreement contains a financial covenant requiring compliance with a maximum Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio not to exceed 3.5 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter on which any loans under the Revolving Credit Facilities are outstanding. The Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio is calculated as Consolidated Total Debt (as defined in the Credit Agreement) divided by Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement) for the last four quarters. Consolidated Total Debt includes, among other things, term loan borrowings, revolving loans, finance lease liabilities and other obligations for borrowed money less Unrestricted Cash (as defined in the Credit Agreement). Consolidated EBITDA is EBITDA (earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization) adjusted to exclude, among other things, (a) gains and losses from asset sales; (b) unrealized foreign currency translation gains and losses in respect of indebtedness; (c) certain non-recurring gains and losses; (d) stock-based compensation expense; (e) certain other non-cash amounts included in the determination of net income; (f) charges and revenue reductions resulting from purchase accounting; (g) minority interest; (h) consulting expenses incurred for cost reduction, operating restructuring and business improvement efforts; (i) expenses realized upon the termination of employees and the termination or cancellation of leases, software licenses or other contracts in connection with the operational restructuring and business improvement efforts; (j) expenses incurred in connection with permitted acquisitions; (k) any impairment charges or write-offs of intangibles; and (l) any extraordinary, unusual or non-recurring charges, expenses or losses. Our Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio was negative at September 30, 2024. 
 In addition, the Credit Agreement and the indenture governing our senior notes (see Note 7, "Long-Term Debt" for addit ional information) contain certain limitations on our ability to pay dividends and other distributions, make certain acquisitions or investments, grant liens and sell assets, and the Credit Agreement contains certain limitations on our ability to incur indebtedness. The applicable covenants in the Credit Agreement affect our operating flexibility by, among other things, restricting our ability to incur expenses and indebtedness that could be used to grow the business, as well as to fund general corporate purposes. We wer e in compliance w ith the covena nts in the Credit Agreement and the ind enture governing our senior notes at September 30, 2024 .

 Senior Notes 
 On May 31, 2017, we issued 950 million of 5.125 senior notes due June 1, 2025. The Company pays interest on the senior notes semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year. The senior notes may be redeemed at par. The senior notes are guaranteed by the Subsidiary Guarantors. In June 2023, in connection with a previously announced offer to purchase, we prepaid 140 million of the senior notes at par with proceeds from the Transaction. We incurred a loss on the extinguishment of the senior notes of 0.7 million in the second quarter of 2023 primarily representative of the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the portion of the senior notes repaid, as well as purchase offer expenses. As of September 30, 2024 there was 210.0 million of senior notes outstanding, which are classified as current debt. 
 Liquidity 
 At September 30, 2024, the remaining 210.0 million of senior notes are classified as current debt. As of September 30, 2024, 56.0 million was drawn on the Revolving Credit Facilities and is classified as current debt based on the Company s past practice of using the Revolving Credit Facilities for short term borrowings. However, the terms of the Revolving Credit Facilities do not require repayment until maturity at June 23, 2028. 
 At September 30, 2024, cash totaled 132.1 million and there was an additional 349.3 million available for borrowing under the Revolving Credit Facilities (net of 49.1 million in outstanding letters of credit). Funds held by our foreign subsidiaries could be repatriated, at which point state and local income tax expense and withholding tax expense would need to be recognized, net of any applicable foreign tax credits. 
 The Company s auction volumes have been adversely impacted by the supply chain disruptions and associated challenges in the automotive industry. We expect to see an improvement in the used vehicle market in the coming years, which is expected to increase the volume of vehicles entering our auction platforms and have a positive impact on our operating results. We believe our sources of liquidity from our cash and cash equivalents on hand, working capital, availability under our Revolving Credit Facilities and ongoing sources of liquidity from cash generated by operations and borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facilities are sufficient to meet our operating needs for the foreseeable future. In addition, we believe the previously mentioned sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund our capital requirements and debt service payments for the foreseeable future. A lack of recovery in market conditions, or further deterioration in market conditions, could materially affect the Company's liquidity.

 AFC sells the majority of its U.S. dollar denominated finance receivables on a revolving basis and without recourse to AFC Funding Corporation. A securitization agreement allows for the revolving sale by AFC Funding Corporation to a group of bank purchasers of undivided interests in certain finance receivables subject to committed liquidity. The agreement expires on January 31, 2028. AFC Funding Corporation had committed liquidity of 2.0 billion for U.S. finance receivables at September 30, 2024. 
 In September 2024, AFC and AFC Funding Corporation entered into a First Amendment and Joinder (the "First Amendment") to the Tenth Amended and Restated Receivables Purchase Agreement. The First Amendment provides for, among other things, an extension of the facility's maturity date from January 31, 2026 to January 31, 2028. We capitalized approximately 10.6 million of costs in connection with the First Amendment. 
 We also have an agreement for the securitization of AFCI's receivables, which expires on January 31, 2028. AFCI's committed facility is provided through a third-party conduit (separate from the U.S. facility) and was C 300 million at September 30, 2024. In September 2024, AFCI entered into an Amendment No. 1 (the "Amendment No. 1") to the Receivables Purchase Agreement. The Amendment No. 1 incorporates and provides for, among other things, an extension of the facility's maturity date from January 31, 2026 to January 31, 2028. We capitalized approximately 1.1 million of costs in connection with the Amendment No. 1. The receivables sold pursuant to both the U.S. and Canadian securitization agreements are accounted for as secured borrowings. 
 AFC manage d total finance receiva bles of 2,211.5 million and 2,305.0 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. AFC's allowance for losses was 19.0 million and 23.0 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , 2,202.6 million and 2,296.4 million, respectively, of finance receivables and a cash reserve of 1 or 3 percent of the obligations collateralized by finance receivables served as security for the 1,549.2 million and 1,645.4 million of gross obligations collateralized by finance receivables at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively. The amount of the cash reserve depends on circumstances which are set forth in the securiti zation agreements. There were unamortized securitization issuance costs of approximately 20.4 million and 13.5 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. After t he occurrence of a termination event, as defined in the U.S.

 securitization agreement, the banks may, and could, cause the stock of AFC Funding Corporation to be transferred to the bank facility, though as a practical matter the bank facility would look to the liquidation of the receivables under the transaction documents as their primary remedy. 
 Proceeds from the revolving sale of receivables to the bank facilities are used to fund new loans to customers. AFC, AFC Funding Corporation and AFCI must maintain certain financial covenants including, among others, limits on the amount of debt AFC and AFCI can incur, minimum levels of tangible net worth, and other covenants tied to the performance of the finance receivables portfolio. The securitization agreements also incorporate the financial covenants of our Credit Agreement. At September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with the covenants in the securitization agreements. 
 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA 
 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, as presented herein, are supplemental measures of our performance that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP. They are not measurements of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered substitutes for net income (loss) or any other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP. 
 EBITDA is defined as net income (loss), plus interest expense net of interest income, income tax provision (benefit), depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is EBITDA adjusted for the items of income and expense and expected incremental revenue and cost savings, as described above in the discussion of certain restrictive loan covenants under "Credit Facilities." 
 Management believes that the inclusion of supplementary adjustments to EBITDA applied in presenting Adjusted EBITDA is appropriate to provide additional information to investors about one of the principal measures of performance used by our creditors. In addition, management uses EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate our performance. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the results as reported under GAAP. These measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

 Cash flow from operating activities (continuing operations) Net cash provided by operating activities (continuing operations) was 260.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , compared with 216.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Cash provided by continuing operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted primarily of cash earnings and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses, partially offset by an increase in trade receivables and other assets. Cash provided by continuing operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 consisted primarily of cash earnings and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses, partially offset by an increase in trade

 receivables and other assets. The increase in operating cash flow was primarily attributable to changes in operating assets and liabilities as a result of the timing of collections and the disbursement of funds to consignors for marketplace sales held near period-ends. 
 Changes in AFC s accounts payable balance are presented in cash flows from operating activities while changes in AFC s finance receivables are presented in cash flows from investing activities. Changes in these balances can cause variations in operating and investing cash flows. 
 Cash flow from investing activities (continuing operations) Net cash provided by investing activities (continuing operations) was 10.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , compared with net cash used by investing activities of 39.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The cash provided by investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily from a decrease in finance receivables held for investment, partially offset by purchases of property and equipment. The cash used by investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily from purchases of property and equipment. 
 Cash flow from financing activities (continuing operations) Net cash used by financing activities (continuing operations) was 264.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , compared with 312.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The cash used by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to a net decrease in obligations collateralized by finance receivables, repayments on lines of credit, dividends paid on the Series A Preferred Stock, repurchases and retirement of common stock and payments for debt issuance costs. The cash used by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to the early repayment of senior notes, repayments on lines of credit, dividends paid on the Series A Preferred Stock, repurchases and retirement of common stock, payments of contingent consideration and payments for debt issuance costs, partially offset by a net increase in obligations collateralized by finance receivables. 
 Cash flow from operating activities (discontinued operations) Net cash used by operating activities (discontinued operations) was 1.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with 0.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The cash used by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to the payment of an accrued obligation. 
 Cash flow from investing activities (discontinued operations) There were no investing activities (discontinued operations) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , compared with net cash provided by investing activities of 7.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 Cash flow from financing activities (discontinued operations) There were no financing activities (discontinued operations) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 Capital Expenditures 
 Capital expenditures for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 approximated 39.0 million and 39.8 million, respectively. Capital expenditures were funded from internally generated funds. We continue to invest in our core information technology capabilities and our service locations. Capital expenditures related to continuing operations are expected to be approximately 50 million to 55 million for fiscal year 2024. Future capital expenditures could vary substantially based on capital project timing, capital expenditures related to acquired businesses and the initiation of new information systems projects to support our business strategies. 
 
 Dividends 
 The Series A Preferred Stock ranks senior to the shares of the Company s common stock, par value 0.01 per share, with respect to dividend rights and rights on the distribution of assets on any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Company. The holders of the Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to a cumulative dividend at the rate of 7 per annum, payable quarterly in arrears. Dividends are payable in cash or in kind, or in any combination of both, at the option of the Company.

 Contractual Obligations 
 The Company's contractual cash obligations for long-term debt, interest payments related to long-term debt, finance lease obligations, operating leases and contingent consideration related to acquisitions are summarized in the table of contractual obligations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Since December 31, 2023, the contractual obligations of the Company have changed as follows: 
 In January 2024, the Company entered into the First Amendment to the Credit Agreement which provides for the Canadian Revolving Credit Facility (C 175 million), among other things. 
 Operating lease obligations change in the ordinary course of business. We lease most of our facilities, as well as other property and equipment under operating leases. Future operating lease obligations will continue to change if renewal options are exercised and/or if we enter into additional operating lease agreements. 
 See Notes 1 and 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, for additional information about the items described above. Our contractual cash obligations as of December 31, 2023, are discussed in the "Contractual Obligations" section of "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Our critical accounting estimates are discussed in the "Critical Accounting Estimates" section of "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Foreign Currency 
 Our foreign currency exposure is limited and arises from transactions denominated in foreign currencies, particularly intercompany loans, as well as from translation of the results of operations from our Canadian and, to a lesser extent, United Kingdom and Continental Europe subsidiaries. However, fluctuations between U.S. and non-U.S. currency values may adversely affect our results of operations and financial position. We have not entered into any foreign exchange contracts to hedge changes in the Canadian dollar, British pound or euro. Foreign currency gains on intercompany loans were approximately 3.2 million and 0.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and approximately 1.2 million and 0.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Canadian currency translation had no impact on net income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and negatively affected net income by approximately 0.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. A 1 change in the month-end Canadian dollar exchange rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 would have impacted foreign currency on intercompany loans by 0.1 million and net income by 0.1 million. A 1 change in the month-end euro exchange rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 would have impacted foreign currency on intercompany loans by 0.6 million and net income by 0.5 million. A 1 change in the average Canadian dollar exchange rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 would have impacted net income by approximately 0.3 million and 0.3 million, respectively. Currency exposure of our U.K. and European operations is not material to the results of operations. 
 Interest Rates 
 We are exposed to interest rate risk on our variable rate borrowings. Accordingly, interest rate fluctuations affect the amount of interest expense we are obligated to pay. We do not currently use interest rate contracts to manage our exposure to interest rate changes. 
 A sensitivity analysis of the impact on our variable rate corporate debt instruments to a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in short-term rates (SOFR/CORRA) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 would have resulted in an increase in interest expense of approximately 0.1 million and 0.5 million, respectively. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e). Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f), during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II 
 OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 We are involved in litigation and disputes arising in the ordinary course of business. Although the outcome of litigation cannot be accurately predicted, based on evaluation of information presently available, our management does not currently believe that the ultimate resolution of these actions will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
 Certain legal proceedings in which the Company is involved are discussed in Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and Part I, Item 3 of the same Annual Report. Unless otherwise indicated therein, all proceedings discussed in the Annual Report remain outstanding. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 Before deciding to invest in our Company, in addition to the other information contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and other information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I, "Item 1A. Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, prospects, results of operations and cash flows. In such case, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment. The risks described in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our ability to access capital and macroeconomic conditions and geopolitical events, are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.
