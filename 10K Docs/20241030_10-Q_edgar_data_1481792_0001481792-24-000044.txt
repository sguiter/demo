 The Company classifies interest rate swaps as Level 2 because the inputs into the valuation model are observable or can be derived or corroborated utilizing observable market data at commonly quoted intervals. 
 
 The active interest rate swap was highly effective as of September 30, 2024. No amount of ineffectiveness has been recorded into earnings related to the active interest rate swap. 
 
 Terminated Interest Rate Swap 
 
 The Company held a million interest rate swap, effective on March 29, 2019, that terminated on March 28, 2024. The terminated interest rate swap was previously designated as a cash flow hedge as it effectively converted the notional value of the Company s variable rate debt based on one-month LIBOR to a fixed rate, including a spread on underlying debt, and a monthly reset in the variable interest rate. However, the Company amended its Senior Secured Credit Facility during the second quarter of 2020, which added a LIBOR floor to the Company s variable rate debt, changing the critical terms of the hedged instrument. Due to this change in critical terms, the Company had elected to de-designate the swap as a cash flow hedge, resulting in future changes in fair value being recognized in interest expense. The balance of the accumulated other comprehensive loss attributable to the interest rate swap as of June 30, 2020 was then amortized to interest expense on a straight-line basis over the remaining life of the swap contract. Due to the Company s transition from LIBOR to SOFR during the first quarter of 2023, the interest rate swap s fixed swap rate was amended to be based on one-month term SOFR.

The purpose of entering into the contracts was to reduce the variability of cash flows from interest payments related to a portion of Quad s variable rate debt. The interest rate collars are designated as cash flow hedges as they effectively convert the notional value of the Company s variable rate debt based on one-month term SOFR to a fixed rate if that month s interest rate is outside of the collars floor and ceiling rates, including a spread on underlying debt, and a monthly reset in the variable interest rate.

 The Company has operations in countries that have transactions outside their functional currencies and periodically enters into foreign exchange contracts. These contracts are used to hedge the net exposures of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and are designated as either cash flow hedges or fair value hedges.

 Overview 

Business Overview 
 
 Quad is a global marketing experience (MX) company that helps brands make consumer connections, from household to in-store to online. The Company is focused on providing a better marketing experience for its clients, so they can focus on delivering the best customer experience to theirs. Quad does this with a suite of marketing solutions that is flexible, scalable and connected. Supported by state-of-the-art technology and data-driven intelligence, these solutions are designed to streamline the complexities of marketing and remove friction from wherever it occurs in the marketing journey. Quad tailors its solutions to its clients objectives, driving cost efficiencies, improving speed to market, strengthening marketing effectiveness, and delivering value on their investments. Quad employs approximately 13,000 people in 14 countries and serves approximately 2,700 clients including industry-leading blue-chip companies that serve both businesses and consumers across multiple industry verticals, with a particular focus on commerce, including retail, consumer packaged goods and direct to-consumer; financial services; and health. 
 
 As an MX company, Quad intends to expand its capabilities and develop its platform through executing on the three pillars of its growth strategy: 
 
 Deliver Integrated Service Excellence 
 
 Quad focuses on solving problems and removing pain points and sources of friction wherever a client experiences them in the marketing process. Quad seeks to become an invaluable strategic marketing partner by helping its clients successfully navigate today s constantly evolving media landscape through innovative, data-driven omnichannel solutions that are scalable and efficiently produced and deployed from household to in-store to online. A key component of Quad s client-facing strategy is to strengthen relationships at higher levels within a client s organization so the Company can better understand, anticipate and satisfy the organization s business objectives. 
 
 To serve clients disparate needs, Quad continues to make disciplined and compelling investments across its integrated marketing platform. These investments take many forms, including new equipment, technology and service capabilities. The Company also makes investments in its talent, such as hiring business professionals with transformation, innovation, and client-side marketing and consulting expertise to enhance its position as an MX company, as well as investments to attract new employees and increase existing employee engagement, retention and productivity. 
 
 As the Company has transformed its offering to better meet the needs of brands and marketers, it has also made strategic decisions to divest of businesses that could not be easily leveraged as part of its greater integrated marketing platform. These decisions free up cash flow for disciplined investments that the Company believes will lead to sustainable growth. 
 
 Accelerate Market Penetration 
 
 Quad s ability to acquire new and expand existing account relationships is critical to the Company s growth strategy. The Company has made significant strides in recent years, introducing a growing number of brands and marketers to its suite of solutions. The Company is particularly focused on expanding in key vertical industries where it believes the biggest opportunities for new business exist. These include commerce, including consumer packaged goods, direct-to-consumer and retail; financial services; and health. Key investments to accelerate market penetration include: 
 
 Fortifying business development efforts through strategic personnel hires in Sales, Sales Operations, Marketing and Agency Solutions to give the Company wider visibility as an MX company within its current client base, as well as with companies in its targeted growth verticals; 
 
 Expanding awareness of Quad s differentiated capabilities through a large-scale marketing and advertising effort centered on the campaign Built on Quad and 
 
 Providing brand visibility and thought leadership at global industry events, such as the Cannes Lions Festival of Creativity, the premier gathering of the global advertising and creative communications industry.

 Leverage Culture as an MX Company 
 
 The Company s culture continues to be a driver for growth as Quad accelerates its competitive position as an MX company. Core aspects of its unique culture are: 
 
 Walk in the shoes of clients: Quad delivers service excellence by encouraging all employees, regardless of job title, to prioritize listening to clients needs and challenges, and do what they can to make it easy to work with Quad at every touchpoint. 
 
 Empower employees: Quad continues to position itself as the workplace for the marketing industry s best talent and empowers its employees to think like owners and take responsibility for how they can help propel the business forward. By embracing employees unique perspectives and experiences, fostering a sense of belonging through inclusion, and providing growth opportunities through skill development and career advancement, Quad believes employees are more fully engaged in their day-to-day activities, producing better results for clients while helping grow the business. 
 
 Continuously improve: Through its foundation in manufacturing, Quad s has built a maker culture that embraces attention to detail, expert execution and a commitment to continuous improvement. All employees are encouraged to identify opportunities, however small, that can improve processes and create efficiencies. It s this long-standing commitment to continuous improvement that enables Quad to confidently identify and remove friction from clients workflows. 
 
 Collaborate to innovate: The close, personal relationships employees form with one another is a foundational aspect of Quad s culture. The Company recognizes that the more effectively teams work together across the entire organization, the better it can serve its clients. Accordingly, Quad encourages employees to connect and collaborate with others both inside and outside of their immediate department and/or business area. Integrated workflows and inter-departmental collaboration speed the Company s ability to innovate and evolve as an MX company. 
 
 Communicate a unified vision forward : The Company sends timely, transparent communications to all employees through a variety of channels to maintain employee engagement and connectivity, and maintain trust. These communication efforts not only detail matters of personal importance (e.g., total rewards), but also keep employees informed on business operations and the Company s strategic direction. By articulating the role that each business area plays in the Company s suite of interconnected solutions, Quad crafts a unified vision that everyone can rally behind. Communication channels include InsideQuad, the employee intranet; executive blogs and video logs (vlogs); executive town halls; department meetings; lunch and learn events; email; in-plant electronic and print signage; and in-home mailings. 
 
 Enhance Financial Strength and Create Shareholder Value 
 
 Quad follows a disciplined approach to maintaining and enhancing financial strength to create shareholder value. This strategy is centered on the Company s ability to drive profitable growth and maximize net earnings, Free Cash Flow, and operating margins; maintain consistent financial policies to ensure a strong balance sheet, liquidity level and access to capital; and retain the financial flexibility needed to strategically allocate and deploy capital as circumstances change. The priorities for capital allocation and deployment are balanced according to prevailing circumstances and what the Company thinks is best for shareholder value creation at any point in time. These priorities currently include using Free Cash Flow and cash proceeds from any asset sales to continue reducing debt while investing in scaling the business as an MX company to fuel net sales growth and drive profitability; and pursuing opportunities to return capital to shareholders through stock buybacks or dividends.

 To provide ongoing improvement in productivity and, ultimately, maximize operating margins, the Company applies holistic continuous improvement and lean enterprise methodologies to further streamline its processes and maximize operating margins. These same methodologies are applied to its selling, general and administrative functions. The Company continually works to lower its cost structure by consolidating manufacturing operations into its most efficient facilities, as well as realizing purchasing, mailing and logistics synergies by centralizing and consolidating print manufacturing volumes, and eliminating redundancies in its administrative and corporate operations. Quad believes that its focused efforts to be the high-quality, low-cost producer generates increased Free Cash Flow and allows the Company to maintain a strong balance sheet through debt reduction. The Company s disciplined financial approach also allows it to maintain sufficient liquidity and to reduce refinancing risk. The Company had total liquidity of 255.4 million as of September 30, 2024, which consisted of up to 242.9 million of unused capacity under its revolving credit agreement, which was net of 26.3 million of issued letters of credit, and cash and cash equivalents of 12.5 million. Total liquidity is reduced to 196.1 million under the Company s most restrictive debt covenants, as defined in the ninth amendment to its Senior Secured Credit Facility, effective October 18, 2024, that contained modifications to certain financial and operational covenants retroactive to September 30, 2024. Quad is proud of its strong and trusted banking relationships, which provide the Company with increased financial flexibility to make strategic investments to accelerate its growth and drive profitability as an MX company. 
 
 Segments 
 
 The Company s operating and reportable segments are aligned with how the chief operating decision-maker of the Company currently manages the business. The Company s operating and reportable segments, including their product and service offerings, and a Corporate category, are summarized below. 
 
 The United States Print and Related Services segment is predominantly comprised of the Company s United States printing operations and is managed as one integrated platform. This includes print execution and logistics for retail inserts, catalogs, long-run publications, special interest publications, journals, direct mail, directories, in-store marketing and promotion, packaging, newspapers, custom print products, as well as other commercial and specialty printed products, along with global paper procurement, and marketing and other complementary services, such as data intelligence and analytics, technology solutions, media planning, placement and optimization, creative strategy and content creation, as well as execution in non-print channels (e.g., digital and broadcast). This segment also includes the manufacture of ink. The United States Print and Related Services segment accounted for approximately 86 and 87 of the Company s consolidated net sales during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. 
 
 The International segment consists of the Company s printing operations in Europe and Latin America, including operations in England, France, Germany, Poland, Colombia, Mexico and Peru. This segment provides printed products and marketing and other complementary services consistent with the United States Print and Related Services segment. The International segment accounted for approximately 14 and 13 of the Company s consolidated net sales during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. 
 
 Corporate consists of unallocated general and administrative activities and associated expenses including, in part, executive, legal and finance, as well as certain expenses and income from frozen employee retirement plans, such as pension benefit plans. 

Key Performance Metrics Overview 
 
 The Company s management believes the ability to generate net sales growth, profit increases and positive cash flow, while maintaining the appropriate level of debt, are key indicators of the successful execution of the Company s business strategy and will increase shareholder value. The Company uses period-over-period net sales growth, EBITDA, EBITDA margin, net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, Free Cash Flow and Debt Leverage Ratio as metrics to measure operating performance, financial condition and liquidity. EBITDA, EBITDA margin, Free Cash Flow and Debt Leverage Ratio are non-GAAP financial measures (see the definitions of EBITDA, EBITDA margin and the reconciliation of net loss to EBITDA in the Results of Operations section below, and see the definitions of Free Cash Flow and Debt Leverage Ratio, the reconciliation of net cash provided by (used in) operating activities to Free Cash Flow, and the calculation of Debt Leverage Ratio in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section below).

Table of Contents 

 Net sales growth. The Company uses period-over-period net sales growth as a key performance metric. The Company s management assesses net sales growth based on the ability to generate increased net sales through increased sales to existing clients, sales to new clients, sales of new or expanded solutions to existing and new clients and opportunities to expand sales through strategic investments, including acquisitions. 
 
 EBITDA and EBITDA margin. The Company uses EBITDA and EBITDA margin as metrics to assess operating performance. The Company s management assesses EBITDA and EBITDA margin based on the ability to increase revenues while controlling variable expense growth. 
 
 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities. The Company uses net cash provided by (used in) operating activities as a metric to assess liquidity. The Company s management assesses net cash provided by (used in) operating activities based on the ability to meet recurring cash obligations while increasing available cash to fund debt service requirements, capital expenditures, cash restructuring requirements related to cost reduction activities, World Color Press single employer pension plan contributions, World Color Press MEPPs withdrawal liabilities, acquisitions and other investments in future growth, shareholder dividends and share repurchases. Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities can be significantly impacted by the timing of non-recurring or infrequent receipts or expenditures. 
 
 Free Cash Flow. The Company uses Free Cash Flow as a metric to assess liquidity and capital deployment. The Company s management assesses Free Cash Flow as a measure to quantify cash available for strengthening the balance sheet (debt and pension liability reduction), for strategic capital allocation and deployment through investments in the business (acquisitions and strategic investments) and for returning capital to the shareholders (dividends and share repurchases). The Company s priorities for capital allocation and deployment will change as circumstances dictate for the business, and Free Cash Flow can be significantly impacted by the Company s restructuring activities and other unusual items. 
 
 Debt Leverage Ratio. The Company uses the Debt Leverage Ratio as a metric to assess liquidity and the flexibility of its balance sheet. Consistent with other liquidity metrics, the Company monitors the Debt Leverage Ratio as a measure to determine the appropriate level of debt the Company believes is optimal to operate its business, and accordingly, to quantify debt capacity available for strengthening the balance sheet (debt and pension liability reduction), for strategic capital allocation and deployment through investments in the business (capital expenditures, acquisitions and strategic investments), and for returning capital to the shareholders (dividends and share repurchases). The Company s priorities for capital allocation and deployment will change as circumstances dictate for the business, and the Debt Leverage Ratio can be significantly impacted by the amount and timing of large expenditures requiring debt financing, as well as changes in profitability. 
 
 The Company remains disciplined with its debt leverage. The Company s consolidated debt and finance lease obligations decreased by 19.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to the following: (1) 46.5 million in proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment; (2) a 40.4 million reduction in cash and cash equivalents; (3) 22.2 million in proceeds from the sale of an investment; and (4) 14.9 million of debt and finance lease obligations reclassified as held for sale due to the Company s plan to sell the majority of its European operations, partially offset by the following: (1) 45.9 million in cash used in operating activities; (2) 45.7 million in purchases of property, plant and equipment; and (3) the 7.0 million payment in cash dividends. 

Overview of Trends Affecting Quad 
 
 As consumer media consumption habits change, advertising and marketing services providers face increased demand to offer end-to-end marketing services, from strategy and creative through execution. As new marketing channels emerge, these providers must expand their capabilities to create effective multichannel campaigns for their clients and providers face increased client demand to offer integrated, end-to-end marketing services (i.e., from strategy and creative through execution). These trends greatly influence Quad s ongoing efforts to help brands reduce the complexities of working with multiple agency partners and vendors, increase marketing process efficiency and maximize marketing effectiveness. 
 
 Competition in the commercial printing industry remains highly fragmented, and the Company believes that there are indicators of heightened competitive pressures. The commercial printing industry has moved toward a demand for shorter print runs, faster product turnaround and increased production efficiencies of products with lower page counts and increased complexity. This combined with increases in postage and paper costs as well as marketers increasing use of online marketing and communication channels has led to excess manufacturing capacity.

 The Company believes that a disciplined approach for capital management and a strong balance sheet are critical to be able to invest in profitable growth opportunities and technological advances, thereby providing the highest return for shareholders. Management balances the use of cash between deleveraging the Company s balance sheet (through reduction in debt and pension obligations), compelling investment opportunities (through capital expenditures, acquisitions and strategic investments) and returns to shareholders (through dividends and share repurchases). 
 
 The Company continues to make progress on integrating and streamlining all aspects of its business, thereby lowering its cost structure by consolidating its manufacturing platform into its most efficient facilities, as well as realizing purchasing, mailing and logistics efficiencies by centralizing and consolidating print manufacturing volumes and eliminating redundancies in its administrative and corporate operations. The Company has continued to evolve its manufacturing platform, equipping facilities to be product-line agnostic, which enables the Company to maximize equipment utilization. Quad believes that the large plant size of its key printing facilities allows the Company to drive savings in certain product lines (such as publications and catalogs) due to economies of scale and from investments in automation and technology. The Company continues to focus on proactively aligning its cost structure to the realities of the top-line pressures it faces in the printing industry through Lean Manufacturing and sustainable continuous improvement programs. The Company believes it will continue to drive productivity improvements and sustainable cost reduction initiatives into the future through an engaged workforce and ongoing adoption of the latest manufacturing automation and technology. Through this strategy, the Company believes it can maintain the strongest, most efficient print manufacturing platform to remain a high-quality, low-cost producer. 
 
 Integrated distribution with the United States Postal Service USPS is an important component of the Company s business. Any material change in the current service levels provided by the postal service could impact the demand that clients have for print services. The USPS continues to experience financial problems. The passing of the Postal Service Reform Act of 2022, signed in April 2022, gave the USPS considerable financial relief as well as significant other relief over the next ten years. While the legislative postal reform helps considerably, without decreased operational cost structures, increased efficiencies or increased volumes and revenues, these losses are expected continue into the future. As a result of these financial difficulties, the USPS has continued to adjust its postal rates and service levels. In September 2024, the USPS held a pre-filing conference to further reduce service standards. These changes will require an advisory opinion from the Postal Regulatory Commission PRC and the changes would not take effect until sometime in 2025. The USPS has also recently announced that it will not propose a price increase for January 2025. However, the available rate authority will roll forward to July 2025, and it is possible that additional postage price increases may be proposed. With postage increases that continue to exceed the Consumer Price Index CPI ), clients will continue to reduce mail volumes and explore the use of alternative methods for delivering a larger portion of their products, such as continued diversion to the internet, digital and mobile channels and other alternative media channels, in order to ensure that they stay within their expected postage budgets. 
 
 Federal statute requires the PRC to conduct reviews of the overall rate-making structure for the USPS to ensure funding stability. As a result of those reviews, the PRC authorized a five year rate-making structure that provides the USPS with additional pricing flexibility over the CPI cap, which has resulted in a substantially altered rate structure for mailers. The revised rate authority that is effective as a result of the rules issued by the PRC includes a higher overall rate cap on the USPS ability to increase rates from year to year. The USPS has used these additional rate authorities to implement twice a year increases. As noted, the USPS has announced they will forgo a price increase for January 2025, but they have also stated that they plan to continue twice a year price increases into the future. This will continue to lead to price spikes for mailers and may also reduce the incentive for the USPS to continue to take out costs and instead continue to rely on postage to cover the costs of an outdated postal service that does not reflect the industry s ability or willingness to pay. Given the significant amount of concern that has been expressed by the mailing industry, in April 2024, the PRC opened a proceeding to start the next rate system review, which is still underway. The Company believes the continued use of all available rate authority by the USPS will continue to increase the potential volume declines as rate predictability with respect to cost is no longer known for mailers. 
 
 The Company has invested significantly in its mail preparation and distribution capabilities to mitigate the impact of increases in postage costs, and to help clients successfully navigate the ever-changing postal environment. Through its data analytics, unique software to merge mail streams on a large scale, advanced finishing capabilities and technology, and in-house transportation and logistics operations, the Company manages the mail preparation and distribution of most of its clients products to maximize efficiency, to enable on-time and consistent delivery and to partially reduce these costs.

 The Company continues to face several other industry challenges that have been, and are expected to continue to, adversely impact the Company s results of operation. The Company continues to operate in a high interest rate environment, which is expected to continue through 2024. Additionally, the price and availability of paper has been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by paper mills permanent or temporary closures, and mills access to raw materials, conversion to produce other types of paper, and ability to transport paper produced. Postal rate increases, along with the previously described industry challenges, have led to reduced demand for printed products and has caused clients to move more aggressively into other delivery methods, such as the many digital and mobile options now available to consumers. This reduced volume has driven the Company to institute several cost saving measures through its restructuring program, including plant closures and headcount reductions. Through these cost saving measures and proceeds from asset sales, the Company has been able to maintain focus on its transformation into an MX company, with flexibility to invest into the growing business, as well as continuing to be advantageous in its efforts to return capital to shareholders and reduce debt. The Company is also dependent on its production personnel to print the Company s products in a cost-effective and efficient manner that allows the Company to obtain new clients and to drive sales from existing clients. The Company is unable to predict the full future impact these challenges will have on its business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations, but expects them to continue through 2024.

EBITDA and EBITDA Margin Consolidated 
 
 EBITDA is defined as net earnings (loss), excluding (1) interest expense, (2) income tax expense (benefit) and (3) depreciation and amortization. EBITDA margin represents EBITDA as a percentage of net sales. EBITDA and EBITDA margin are presented to provide additional information regarding Quad s performance. Both are important measures by which Quad gauges the profitability and assesses the performance of its business. EBITDA and EBITDA margin are non-GAAP financial measures and should not be considered alternatives to net earnings (loss) as a measure of operating performance, or to cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities as a measure of liquidity. Quad s calculation of EBITDA and EBITDA margin may be different from the calculations used by other companies, and therefore, comparability may be limited. 
 
 EBITDA and EBITDA margin for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, were as follows: Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 of Net Sales 2023 of Net Sales (dollars in millions) EBITDA and EBITDA margin (non-GAAP) 19.7 2.9 46.2 6.6

EBITDA and EBITDA Margin Consolidated 
 
 EBITDA is defined as net earnings (loss), excluding (1) interest expense, (2) income tax expense and (3) depreciation and amortization. EBITDA margin represents EBITDA as a percentage of net sales. EBITDA and EBITDA margin are presented to provide additional information regarding Quad s performance. Both are important measures by which Quad gauges the profitability and assesses the performance of its business. EBITDA and EBITDA margin are non-GAAP financial measures and should not be considered alternatives to net earnings (loss) as a measure of operating performance, or to cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities as a measure of liquidity. Quad s calculation of EBITDA and EBITDA margin may be different from the calculations used by other companies, and therefore, comparability may be limited. 
 
 EBITDA and EBITDA margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, were as follows: Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 of Net Sales 2023 of Net Sales (dollars in millions) EBITDA and EBITDA margin (non-GAAP) 79.5 4.0 121.2 5.6 
 
 EBITDA decreased 41.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to 35.1 million of increased restructuring, impairment and transaction-related charges, net and impacts from lower print volumes and marketing services sales, partially offset by impacts from improved manufacturing productivity and savings from other cost reduction initiatives.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 The Company utilizes cash flows from operating activities and borrowings under its credit facilities to satisfy its liquidity and capital requirements. The Company had total liquidity of 255.4 million as of September 30, 2024, which consisted of up to 242.9 million of unused capacity under its revolving credit agreement, which was net of 26.3 million of issued letters of credit, and cash and cash equivalents of 12.5 million. Total liquidity is reduced to 196.1 million under the Company s most restrictive debt covenants, as defined in the ninth amendment to its Senior Secured Credit Facility, effective October 18, 2024, that contained modifications to certain financial and operational covenants retroactive to September 30, 2024. There were 73.3 million of borrowings under the 342.5 million revolving credit facility as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 The Company believes its expected future cash flows from operating activities and its current liquidity and capital resources, are sufficient to fund ongoing operating requirements and service debt and pension requirements for both the next 12 months and beyond. 

Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024, Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Net cash used in operating activities increased 87.0 million, from 41.1 million provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 45.9 million used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. This increase was due to a 71.9 million increase in cash flows used in changes in operating assets and liabilities and a 15.1 million decrease in cash from earnings. 

Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024, Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Net cash provided by investing activities increased 79.3 million, from 57.4 million used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 21.9 million provided by investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was primarily due to the following: (1) a 38.6 million increase in proceeds from the sale of property, plant, and equipment; (2) a 22.2 million increase in proceeds from the sale of an investment; (3) a 13.8 million decrease in purchases of property, plant and equipment; (4) a 3.6 million decrease in cash used in other investing activities; (5) a 0.6 million decrease in loan to an unconsolidated entity; and (6) a 0.5 million decrease in cost investment in unconsolidated entities. 

Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024, Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Net cash used in financing activities increased 18.4 million, from 2.1 million provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 16.3 million used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase was primarily due to the following: (1) a 21.6 million decrease in net borrowings of debt and lease obligations; (2) a 6.9 million increase in the payment of cash dividends; and (3) a 0.4 million increase in equity awards redeemed to pay employees tax obligations. These increases were partially offset by a 10.2 million decrease in cash used for the purchase of treasury stock and a 0.3 million decrease in cash used for other financing activities. 

Free Cash Flow 
 
 Free Cash Flow is defined as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment. 
 
 The Company s management assesses Free Cash Flow as a measure to quantify cash available for (1) strengthening the balance sheet (debt reduction), (2) strategic capital allocation and deployment through investments in the business (acquisitions and strategic investments) and (3) returning capital to the shareholders (dividends and share repurchases). The priorities for capital allocation and deployment will change as circumstances dictate for the business, and Free Cash Flow can be significantly impacted by the Company s restructuring activities and other unusual items. 

55 

Table of Contents 

 Free Cash Flow is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered an alternative to cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities as a measure of liquidity. Quad s calculation of Free Cash Flow may be different from similar calculations used by other companies, and therefore, comparability may be limited. 
 
 Free Cash Flow for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was as follows: Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (dollars in millions) Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities (45.9) 41.1 Less: purchases of property, plant and equipment 45.7 59.5 Free Cash Flow (non-GAAP) (91.6) (18.4) 
 
 Free Cash Flow decreased 73.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to an 87.0 million increase in net cash used in operating activities, partially offset by a 13.8 million decrease in capital expenditures. See the Net Cash Provided by (Used In) Operating Activities section above for further explanations of the change in operating cash flows. 

Debt Leverage Ratio 
 
 The Debt Leverage Ratio is defined as total debt and finance lease obligations less cash and cash equivalents (Net Debt) divided by the trailing twelve months Adjusted EBITDA, comprised of the sum of the last twelve months of EBITDA (see the definition of EBITDA and the reconciliation of net loss to EBITDA in the Results of Operations section above) and restructuring, impairment and transaction-related charges, net. 
 
 The Company uses the Debt Leverage Ratio as a metric to assess liquidity and the flexibility of its balance sheet. Consistent with other liquidity metrics, the Company monitors the Debt Leverage Ratio as a measure to determine the appropriate level of debt the Company believes is optimal to operate its business, and accordingly, to quantify debt capacity available for strengthening the balance sheet through debt and pension liability reduction, for strategic capital allocation and deployment through investments in the business, and for returning capital to shareholders. The priorities for capital allocation and deployment will change as circumstances dictate for the business, and the Debt Leverage Ratio can be significantly impacted by the amount and timing of large expenditures requiring debt financing, as well as changes in profitability. 
 
 The Debt Leverage Ratio is a non-GAAP measure and should not be considered an alternative to cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities as a measure of liquidity. Quad s calculation of the Debt Leverage Ratio may be different from similar calculations used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited. 
 
 The Debt Leverage Ratio calculated below differs from the Total Leverage Ratio, the Total Net Leverage Ratio and Senior Secured Leverage Ratio included in the Company s debt covenant calculations (see Covenants and Compliance section below for further information on debt covenants). The Total Leverage Ratio included in the Company s debt covenants includes interest rate derivative liabilities and letters of credit as debt and excludes non-cash stock-based compensation expense from EBITDA. The Total Net Leverage Ratio includes and excludes the same adjustments as the Total Leverage Ratio, in addition to netting domestic unrestricted cash with debt. Similarly, the Senior Secured Leverage Ratio includes and excludes the same adjustments as the Total Leverage Ratio, in addition to the exclusion of the outstanding balance of the surety bonds from debt and netting domestic unrestricted cash with debt.

 (1) Financial information for the year ended December 31, 2023, is included as reported in the Company s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 22, 2024. 
 
 The Debt Leverage Ratio at September 30, 2024, increased 0.15x, compared to December 31, 2023, primarily due to a 20.5 million increase in Net Debt and a 6.6 million reduction in trailing twelve months Adjusted EBITDA. The Debt Leverage Ratio at September 30, 2024, is within management s desired target Debt Leverage Ratio range of 1.75x to 2.25x; however, the Company will operate at times above the Debt Leverage Ratio target range depending on the timing of compelling strategic investment opportunities, as well as seasonal working capital needs.

 As of September 30, 2024, the Company utilized a combination of debt instruments to fund cash requirements, including the following: 
 
 Senior Secured Credit Facility: 
 
 Revolving credit facility 73.3 million outstanding as of September 30, 2024); and 
 
 Term Loan A 403.9 million outstanding as of September 30, 2024); 
 
 Master Note and Security Agreement 1.5 million outstanding as of September 30, 2024).

 Covenants and Compliance 
 
 The Company s various lending arrangements include certain financial covenants (all financial terms, numbers and ratios are as defined in the Company s debt agreements). Among these covenants, the Company was required to maintain the following as of September 30, 2024, in accordance with the ninth amendment to its Senior Secured Credit Facility, effective October 18, 2024, that contained modifications to certain financial and operation covenants retroactive to September 30, 2024: 
 
 Total Leverage Ratio. On a rolling twelve-month basis, the Total Leverage Ratio, defined as consolidated total indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA, shall not exceed 3.50 to 1.00 (for the twelve months ended September 30, 2024, the Company s Total Leverage Ratio was 2.22 to 1.00). 
 
 If there is any amount outstanding on the Revolving Credit Facility or Term Loan A, or if any lender has any revolving credit exposure or Term Loan A credit exposure, the Company is required to maintain the following: 
 Senior Secured Leverage Ratio. On a rolling four-quarter basis, the Senior Secured Leverage Ratio, defined as the ratio of consolidated senior secured net indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA, shall not exceed 3.00 to 1.00 for any fiscal quarter ending on or after September 30, 2024 (for the twelve months ended September 30, 2024, the Company s Senior Secured Leverage Ratio was 2.19 to 1.00). 
 Interest Coverage Ratio. On a rolling twelve-month basis, the Interest Coverage Ratio, defined as consolidated EBITDA to cash consolidated interest expense, shall not be less than 3.00 to 1.00 (for the twelve months ended September 30, 2024, the Company s Interest Coverage Ratio was 4.07 to 1.00). 
 
 The Company was in compliance with all financial covenants in its debt agreements as of September 30, 2024. While the Company currently expects to be in compliance in future periods with all of the financial covenants, there can be no assurance that these covenants will continue to be met. The Company s failure to maintain compliance with the covenants could prevent the Company from borrowing additional amounts and could result in a default under any of the debt agreements. Such default could cause the outstanding indebtedness to become immediately due and payable, by virtue of cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions. 
 
 In addition to those covenants, the Senior Secured Credit Facility also includes certain limitations on acquisitions, indebtedness, liens, dividends and repurchases of capital stock. 
 
 If the Company s Total Leverage Ratio is greater than 2.75 to 1.00, the Company is prohibited from making greater than 60.0 million of dividend payments, capital stock repurchases and certain other payments, over the course of the agreement. If the Company s Total Leverage Ratio is above 2.50 to 1.00 but below 2.75 to 1.00, the Company is prohibited from making greater than 100.0 million of dividend payments, capital stock repurchases and certain other payments, over the course of the agreement. If the Total Leverage Ratio is less than 2.50 to 1.00, there are no such restrictions. As the Company s Total Leverage Ratio as of September 30, 2024, was 2.22 to 1.00, the limitations described above are not currently applicable. 
 
 If the Company s Senior Secured Leverage Ratio is greater than 3.00 to 1.00 or the Company s Total Net Leverage Ratio which, on a rolling twelve-month basis, is defined as consolidated net indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA, is greater than 3.50 to 1.00, the Company is prohibited from voluntarily prepaying any unsecured or subordinated indebtedness, with certain exceptions (including any mandatory prepayments on any unsecured or subordinated debt). If the Senior Secured Leverage Ratio is less than 3.00 to 1.00 and the Total Net Leverage Ratio is less than 3.50 to 1.00, there are no such restrictions. The limitations described above are not currently applicable, as the Company s Senior Secured Leverage Ratio was 2.19 to 1.00 and the Total Net Leverage Ratio was 2.19 to 1.00, as of September 30, 2024.

 Share Repurchase Program 
 
 On July 30, 2018, the Company s Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to 100.0 million of the Company s outstanding class A common stock. Under the authorization, share repurchases may be made at the Company s discretion, from time to time, in the open market and/or in privately negotiated transactions as permitted by federal securities laws and other legal requirements. The timing, manner, price and amount of any repurchase will depend on economic and market conditions, share price, trading volume, applicable legal requirements and other factors. The program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. 
 
 There were no share repurchases during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and the following repurchases occurred during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 2023 Shares of Class A common stock 952,057 2,360,105 Weighted average price per share 5.47 4.33 Total repurchases during the period (in millions) 5.2 10.2 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, there were 77.5 million of authorized repurchases remaining under the program. 

Risk Management 
 
 For a discussion of the Company s exposure to market risks and management of those market risks, see Item 3, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

New Accounting Pronouncements 
 
 See Note 19, New Accounting Pronouncements, to the condensed consolidated financial statements in Item 1, Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited), of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 The Company is exposed to a variety of market risks which may adversely impact the Company s results of operations and financial condition, including changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates, changes in the economic environment that would impact credit positions and changes in the prices of certain commodities. The Company s management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. These risk management strategies may not fully insulate the Company from adverse impacts due to market risks. 

Interest Rate Risk 
 
 The Company is exposed to interest rate risk on variable rate debt obligations and price risk on fixed rate debt and finance leases. The variable rate debt outstanding at September 30, 2024, was primarily comprised of 403.9 million outstanding on the Term Loan A. As of September 30, 2024, there was also 73.3 million outstanding on the revolving credit facility. In order to reduce the variability of cash flows from interest payments related to a portion of Quad s variable rate debt, the Company entered into two 75.0 million interest rate collars in February 2023, and a 50.0 million interest rate swap in April 2024, and has classified 200.0 million of the Company s variable rate debt as fixed rate debt. Including the impact of the 200.0 million interest rate hedges of variable rate to fixed rate debt, Quad had variable rate debt outstanding of 296.2 million (including debt classified as held-for-sale) at a current weighted average interest rate of 7.9 and fixed rate debt and finance leases outstanding of 221.5 million (including debt and finance leases classified as held-for-sale) at a current weighted average interest rate of 7.5 as of September 30, 2024. A hypothetical 10 increase in the market interest rates impacting the Company s current weighted average interest rate on variable rate debt obligations would not have a material impact on the Company s interest expense. In addition, a hypothetical 10 change in market interest rates would change the fair value of fixed rate debt at September 30, 2024, by approximately 0.3 million.

Table of Contents 

 Foreign Currency Risk and Translation Exposure 
 
 The Company is exposed to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations in certain countries in which it operates. The exposure to foreign currency movements is limited in most countries because the operating revenues and expenses of its various subsidiaries and business units are substantially in the local currency of the country in which they operate. To the extent revenues and expenses are not in the applicable local currency, the Company may enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge the currency risk. 
 
 Although operating in local currencies may limit the impact of currency rate fluctuations on the results of operations of the Company s non-United States subsidiaries and business units, rate fluctuations may impact the consolidated financial position as the assets and liabilities of its foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars in preparing the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheets. As of September 30, 2024, the Company s foreign subsidiaries had net current assets (defined as current assets less current liabilities) subject to foreign currency translation risk of 89.6 million. The potential decrease in net current assets as of September 30, 2024, from a hypothetical 10 adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates, would be approximately 9.0 million. This sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel shift in all major foreign currency exchange rates versus the U.S. dollar. Exchange rates rarely move in the same direction relative to the U.S. dollar due to positive and negative correlations of the various global currencies. This assumption may overstate or understate the impact of changing exchange rates on individual assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency. 
 
 The Company s hedging operations have historically not been material, and gains or losses from these operations have not been material to the Company s results of operations, financial position or cash flows. The Company does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. 
 
 These international operations are subject to risks typical of international operations, including, but not limited to, differing economic conditions, changes in political climate, potential restrictions on the movement of funds, differing tax structures, and other regulations and restrictions. Accordingly, future results could be adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors. 

Credit Risk 
 
 Credit risk is the possibility of loss from a client s failure to make payments according to contract terms. Prior to granting credit, each client is evaluated in an underwriting process, taking into consideration the prospective client s financial condition, past payment experience, credit bureau information and other financial and qualitative factors that may affect the client s ability to pay. Specific credit reviews and standard industry credit scoring models are used in performing this evaluation. Clients financial condition is continuously monitored as part of the normal course of business. Some of the Company s clients are highly leveraged or otherwise subject to their own operating and regulatory risks. Based on those client account reviews and the continued uncertainty of the global economy, the Company has established an allowance for credit losses of 21.3 million and 25.7 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 
 The Company has a large, diverse client base and does not have a high degree of concentration with any single client account. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company s largest client accounted for less than 5 of the Company s net sales. Even if the Company s credit review and analysis mechanisms work properly, the Company may experience financial losses in its dealings with clients and other parties. Any increase in nonpayment or nonperformance by clients could adversely impact the Company s results of operations and financial condition. Economic disruptions could result in significant future charges. 

Commodity Risk 
 
 The primary raw materials that the Company uses in its print business are paper, ink and energy. At this time, the Company s supply of raw materials are available from numerous vendors. The Company generally buys these raw materials based upon market prices that are established with the vendor as part of the procurement process. The price of such raw materials has fluctuated over time and has caused fluctuations in the Company s net sales and cost of sales. This volatility may continue and the Company may experience increases in the costs of its raw materials in the future as prices in the overall paper, ink and energy markets are expected to remain beyond its control. The price and availability of paper may also be adversely affected by paper mills permanent or temporary closures, and mills access to raw materials, conversion to produce other types of paper, and ability to transport paper produced. 

60 

Table of Contents 

 Approximately half of the paper used by the Company is supplied directly by its clients. For those clients that do not directly supply their own paper, the Company makes use of its purchasing efficiencies to supply paper by negotiating with leading paper vendors, uses a wide variety of paper grades, weights and sizes, and does not rely on any one vendor. In addition, the Company generally includes price adjustment clauses in sales contracts for paper and other critical raw materials in the printing process. Although these clauses generally mitigate paper price risk, higher paper prices and tight paper supplies, as well as changes in the United States import or trade regulations may have an impact on client demand for printed products. The Company s working capital requirements, including the impact of seasonality, are partially mitigated through the direct purchasing of paper by its clients. 
 
 The Company produces the majority of ink used in its print production, allowing it to control the quality, cost and supply of key inputs. Raw materials for the ink manufacturing process are purchased externally from a variety of vendors. The price and availability of ink and ink components may be adversely affected by the availability of component raw materials, labor and transportation. 
 
 The Company may not be able to fully pass on to clients the impact of higher electric and natural gas energy prices on its manufacturing costs, and increases in energy prices result in higher manufacturing costs for certain of its operations. The Company mitigates its risk through natural gas hedges when appropriate. In its logistics operations, however, the Company is able to pass a substantial portion of any increase in fuel prices directly to its clients. 
 
 To the extent the cost of other raw materials increase and the Company is not able to increase selling prices of its products, then the Company may experience margin declines. 
 
 Management believes a hypothetical 10 change in the price of paper and other raw materials would not have a significant direct impact on the Company s consolidated annual results of operations or cash flows; however, significant increases in commodity pricing or tight supply could influence future client demand for printed products. 

ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 The Company s management, with the participation of the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of the end of the period covered by this report and has concluded that, as of the end of such period, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
