 from those expressed in, or implied by, such forward-looking statements. Risks and uncertainties include without limitation the effect 
 of competitive and 
economic factors, and our 
reaction to those factors, 
the adequacy of

 Various factors, some of which 
are beyond Popular s control, could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in,

levels

in turn, 
among other 
things, our 
level of 
non-performing 
 assets, charge-offs and provision expense; 

changes in interest rates and market liquidity, 
which may reduce interest margins, impact funding sources, reduce loan 
 originations, affect

amount 
of

million of 
expenses, of 
which 

million 
was 
 reflected in income 
tax expense and 

million was reflected 
in other operating 
expenses, related to 
an out-of-period adjustment 
 associated with the Corporation s U.S. subsidiary s 
non-payment of taxes on certain intercompany 
distributions to the Bank Holding 
 Company 
(BHC) 
in 
Puerto 
Rico, 
a 
foreign 
corporation 
for 
U.S. 
tax 
purposes. 
The 
adjustment 
corrected 
errors 
for 
income 
tax 
 expense 
that 
should 
have 
been 
recognized 
of 

million 
and 

million 
in 
the 
years 
2023 
and 
2022, 
respectively, 
and 
an 
 aggregate 
of 

million, 
in 
the 
years 
prior 
to 
2022. 
The 

million 
recognized 
as 
other 
operating 
expense 
corresponded 
to 
 interest due up to March 31, 2024 on the related late payment of the 
withholding tax, of which approximately 

million correspond 
 to years 
prior to 
2022. As 
a result 
of this 
adjustment, the 
deferred tax 
asset related 
to NOL 
of the 
BHC and 
its 
related valuation 
 allowance was reduced by 

million. The Corporation evaluated the impact of the out-of-period 
adjustment and concluded it was 
 not material 
to any previously 
issued interim or 
annual consolidated financial statements 
and the adjustment 
is not expected 
to be 
 material to the year ending December 31, 2024.

 At 
September 
30, 
2024, 
the 
Corporation 
held 

million 
in 
restricted

funds 
deposited 
in 
money 
market 
 accounts, debt 
securities available for 
sale and 
equity securities (December

- 

million). 
The restricted 
assets held 
in 
 debt securities available for 
sale and equity securities 
consist primarily of assets 
held for the Corporation s 
non-qualified retirement 
 plans and fund deposits guaranteeing possible liens 
or encumbrances over the title of insured 
properties.

 The Corporation recognizes as assets the rights to service loans for others, 
whether these rights are purchased or result from asset 
 transfers such as sales and securitizations. These mortgage 
servicing rights MSRs are measured at 
fair value. 
 The 
Corporation 
uses 
a 
discounted 
cash 
flow 
model 
to 
estimate 
the 
fair 
value 
of 
MSRs. 
The 
discounted 
cash 
flow 
model 
 incorporates 
assumptions 
that 
market 
participants 
would 
use 
in 
estimating 
future 
net 
servicing 
income, 
including 
estimates 
of 
 prepayment speeds, discount rate, cost to service, escrow account earnings, contractual servicing fee income, prepayment and late 
 fees, among other considerations. Prepayment speeds are 
adjusted for the loans characteristics and portfolio behavior. 

 The following table presents the changes in MSRs measured using the 
fair value method for the nine months ended September 
30, 
 2024 and 2023.

 Residential mortgage loans serviced for others were

 Net mortgage servicing fees, a component of mortgage banking activities in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, include the 
 changes from period to period in the fair value of the MSRs, including changes due to collection / realization of expected cash flows. 
 The banking 
subsidiaries receive servicing 
fees based 
on a 
percentage of the 
outstanding loan balance. 
These servicing fees 
are 
 credited to income 
when they are 
collected. At September 
30, 2024, those 
weighted average mortgage servicing 
fees were 

(September

Under

agreements,

subsidiaries

At September 30, 2024, 
the Corporation serviced 

million in residential mortgage loans 
with credit recourse to 
the Corporation 
 (December 31, 2023 
- 

million). Also refer 
to Note 
19 to 
the Consolidated Financial 
Statements for information 
on changes in 
 the Corporation s liability of estimated losses related 
to loans serviced with credit recourse. 
 Under the GNMA 
securitizations, the Corporation, as 
servicer, has 
the right to 
repurchase (but not the 
obligation), at its 
option and 
 without 
GNMA s 
prior 
authorization, 
any 
loan 
that 
is 
collateral 
for 
a 
GNMA 
guaranteed 
mortgage-backed 
security 
when 
certain 
 delinquency 
criteria 
are 
met. 
At 
the 
time 
that 
individual 
loans 
meet 
GNMA s 
specified 
delinquency 
criteria 
and 
are 
eligible 
for 
 repurchase, the Corporation is deemed to have regained effective control over these loans if the Corporation was the pool issuer. At 
 September 
30, 
2024, 
the 
Corporation 
had 
recorded 

million 
in 
mortgage 
loans 
on 
its 
Consolidated 
Statements 
of 
Financial 
 Condition related to this 
buy-back option program (December 31, 
2023 - 

million). Loans in our serviced 
GNMA portfolio benefit 
 from payment forbearance programs but continue to reflect the 
contractual delinquency until the borrower repays deferred payments 
 or 
completes 
a 
payment 
deferral modification 
or 
other 
borrower assistance 
alternative. As 
long 
as 
the 
Corporation continues 
to 
 service the 
loans that 
continue to 
be collateral 
in a 
GNMA guaranteed 
mortgage-backed security, 
the MSR 
is recognized 
by the 
 Corporation. 

 During the nine months ended 
September 30, 2024, the Corporation repurchased approximately 

million (September 30, 2023 - 

million) of 
mortgage loans 
from its 
GNMA servicing 
portfolio. The 
determination to 
repurchase these 
loans was 
based on 
the 
 economic benefits of 
the transaction, which 
results in a 
reduction of the 
servicing costs for these 
severely delinquent loans, mainly 
 related 
to 
principal 
and 
interest 
advances. 
The 
risk 
associated 
with 
the 
loans 
is 
reduced 
due 
to 
their 
guaranteed 
nature. 
The 
 Corporation may 
place these 
loans under 
modification programs 
offered by 
FHA, VA 
or United 
States Department

changes in the carrying 
amount of goodwill for 
the quarter and nine 
months ended September 30, 
2024. During the 
 third quarter of 2023, the Corporation recorded an impairment of 

million as a result of its annual goodwill impairment test related 
 to 
its 
U.S. based 
equipment leasing 
subsidiary, 
Popular Equipment 
Finance PEF ), 
due to 
lower forecasted 
cash flows 
and an 
 increase in the rate used to discount cash flows. 
 The following table shows the changes in the carrying 
amount of goodwill for the nine months ended 
September 30, 2024 and 2023,

 to 
 
 for 
 the 2024 analysis. The Ibbotson Build-Up Method 
builds up a cost of equity 
starting with the rate of 
return of a risk-free asset (20-
 year U.S. Treasury 
note) and adds 
to it additional 
risk elements such as 
equity risk premium, size 
premium, industry risk 
premium, 
 and a 
specific geographic risk 
premium (as applicable). 
The resulting discount 
rates were 
analyzed in terms 
of reasonability given 
 the current market conditions.

The 
results 
of 
the 
BPPR 
annual 
goodwill 
impairment 
test 
as 
of 
July 
31, 
2024 
indicated 
that 
the 
estimated 
fair 
value 
using 
a 
 combination of 
valuation methodologies 
exceeded BPPR s 
equity value 
by 
approximately 

billion or 

compared to 

billion or 
 
 , for the annual goodwill impairment test completed as 
of July 31, 2023. PB s annual 
goodwill impairment test results 
 as 
of such 
dates indicated 
that the 
average estimated 
fair value 
using a 
combination of 
valuation methodologies 
exceeded PB s 
 equity 
value 
by 
approximately 

million 
or 
 
 , 
compared 
to 

million 
or 
 
 , 
for 
the 
annual 
goodwill 
impairment 
test 
 completed as of July 31, 2023. Accordingly, 

impairment was recognized for BPPR or PB. The goodwill balance of BPPR and PB, 
 as legal entities, represented approximately 
 
 of the Corporation s total goodwill balance as of 
the July 31, 2024 valuation date. 
 Furthermore, 
as 
part 
of 
the 
analyses, 
management 
performed 
a 
reconciliation 
of 
the 
aggregate 
fair 
values 
determined 
for 
the 
 reporting units to the market capitalization of the Corporation concluding that the 
fair value results determined for the reporting units 
 in the July 31, 2024 annual assessment were reasonable. 
 The goodwill 
impairment evaluation 
process requires 
the Corporation 
to 
make estimates 
and assumptions 
with regard 
to the 
fair 
 value 
of 
the 
reporting 
units. 
Actual 
values 
may 
differ 
significantly 
from 
these 
estimates. 
Such 
differences 
could 
result 
in 
future 
 impairment of goodwill that would, in turn, negatively 
impact the Corporation s results of operations and the 
reporting units where the 
 goodwill is recorded. Particularly for reporting units with recognized impairments or where the 
estimated fair value approximates the 
 equity value, 
future decreases 
in fair 
value estimates 
could result 
in additional 
impairment charges. 
Additionally, 
declines in 
the 
 Corporation s 
market 
capitalization and 
adverse economic 
conditions 
sustained 
over 
a 
longer 
period of 
time 
negatively 
affecting 
 forecasted earnings could increase the risk of goodwill 
impairment in the future. 

 A decline in 
the Corporation s stock 
price related to 
global and/or regional macroeconomic 
conditions, a deterioration in 
the Puerto 
 Rico 
or 
the 
U.S. 
economies, 
increases 
in 
the 
rate 
to 
discount 
future 
cash 
flows, 
and 
lower 
future 
earnings 
estimates 
could, 
 individually or 
in the 
aggregate, have a 
material impact on 
the determination of 
the fair value 
of our reporting 
units, which could 
in 
 turn 
result 
in 
an 
impairment of 
goodwill in 
the 
future. 
An 
impairment of 
goodwill would 
result 
in 
a non-cash 
expense, 
net 
of 
tax 
 impact. A charge to earnings related to a goodwill 
impairment would not materially impact regulatory 
capital calculations.

of goodwill and accumulated impairment losses 
by reportable segments.

 At September 30, 2024, 
Puerto Rico government deposits amounted 
to 

billion. Puerto Rico government deposits 
are interest 
 bearing accounts. 
These government 
deposits are 
indexed to 
short-term market 
rates and 
fluctuate in 
cost with 
changes in 
those 
 rates, in 
accordance with contractual 
terms. Public 
deposit balances are 
difficult to 
predict. For example, 
the receipt 
by the Puerto 
 Rico 
Government 
of 
hurricane 
recovery 
related 
Federal 
assistance 
and 
seasonal 
tax 
collections 
could 
increase 
public 
deposit 
 balances at BPPR. 
On the other hand, 
the amount and 
timing of reductions 
in balances are 
likely to be 
impacted by, 
for example, 
 the speed at 
which federal assistance 
is distributed, 
the financial condition, 
liquidity and cash 
management practices of the 
Puerto 
 Rico 
Government 
and 
its 
instrumentalities 
and

to 
 PROMESA or 
other 
actions 
mandated by 
the 
Fiscal 
Oversight and 
Management Board 
for Puerto 
Rico 
(the 
 Oversight Board ). 
 Generally, these deposits require that 
the bank pledge high credit quality securities as collateral, therefore, 
liquidity risk arising from 
 government deposit outflows are lower.

represents the 
 unamortized balance of the obligations 
undertaken in issuing the 
guarantees under the standby letters of 
credit. Management does 
 not anticipate any material losses related to these 
instruments. 
 From time to time, the Corporation securitized mortgage loans into guaranteed mortgage-backed securities subject to limited, and in 
 certain instances, lifetime credit 
recourse on the loans 
that serve as 
collateral for the 
mortgage-backed securities. The Corporation 
 has 
not sold 
any 
mortgage 
loans subject 
to 
credit 
recourse since 
2009. 
At 
September 
30, 2024, 
the Corporation 
serviced 

million 
(December 
31, 
2023 
- 

million) 
in 
residential 
mortgage 
loans 
subject 
to 
credit 
recourse 
provisions, 
principally 
loans 
 associated 
with 
FNMA 
and 
FHLMC 
residential 
mortgage 
loan 
securitization 
programs. 
In 
the 
event 
of 
any 
customer 
default, 
 pursuant to the credit recourse provided, 
the Corporation is required to repurchase the 
loan or reimburse the third party 
investor for 
 the incurred 
loss. The 
maximum potential 
amount of 
future payments 
that the 
Corporation would 
be required 
to 
make 
under the 
 recourse 
arrangements 
in 
the 
event 
of 
nonperformance 
by 
the 
borrowers 
is 
equivalent 
to 
the 
total 
outstanding 
balance 
of 
the 
 residential mortgage loans serviced with 
recourse and interest, if applicable. During 
the quarter and nine months 
ended September 
 30, 
2024, 
the 
Corporation 
repurchased 
approximately 

million 
and 

million, 
respectively, 
of 
unpaid 
principal 
balance 
in 
 mortgage loans subject 
to the credit 
recourse provisions (September 30, 
2023 
 - 

million and 

million, respectively). 
In the 
 event of 
nonperformance by the 
borrower, the 
Corporation has 
rights to 
the underlying 
collateral securing 
the mortgage 
loan. The 
 Corporation suffers ultimate losses on these loans when the proceeds from a foreclosure sale of the property underlying a defaulted 
 mortgage loan are 
less than the 
outstanding principal balance 
of the 
loan plus any 
uncollected interest advanced 
and the costs 
of 
 holding and 
disposing the 
related property. 
At September 
30, 2024, 
the Corporation s 
liability established 
to cover 
the estimated 
 credit loss exposure related to loans sold or serviced 
with credit recourse amounted to 

million (December 31, 2023 - 

million).

billion in mortgage loans for third-parties, including the loans serviced with credit recourse (December 31, 
 2023 - 

billion). The Corporation generally recovers funds advanced pursuant to these arrangements from 
the mortgage owner, 
 from liquidation proceeds when the mortgage 
loan is foreclosed or, 
in the case of FHA/VA 
loans, under the applicable FHA 
and 
 VA 
 insurance 
and guarantees 
programs. However, 
in the 
meantime, the 
Corporation must 
absorb the 
cost 
of the 
funds 
it 
advances 
 during the 
time the 
advance is 
outstanding. The 
Corporation must 
also bear 
the costs 
of attempting 
to collect 
on delinquent 
and 
 defaulted 
mortgage 
loans. 
In 
addition, 
if 
a 
defaulted 
loan 
is 
not 
cured, 
the 
mortgage 
loan 
would 
be 
canceled 
as 
part 
of 
the 
 foreclosure proceedings and the Corporation would 
not receive any future servicing income 
with respect to that loan. At 
September 
 30, 
2024, 
the 
outstanding 
balance 
of 
funds 
advanced 
by 
the 
Corporation under 
such 
mortgage 
loan 
servicing 
agreements 
was 
 approximately 

million 
(December 
31, 
2023 
- 

million). 
To 
the 
extent 
the 
mortgage 
loans 
underlying 
the 
Corporation s 
 servicing portfolio experience 
increased delinquencies, the Corporation 
would be required 
to dedicate additional 
cash resources to 
 comply with its obligation to advance funds as well 
as incur additional administrative costs related 
to increases in collection efforts.

 Business concentration 
 Since the Corporation s business activities are concentrated primarily in Puerto Rico, its results of operations and financial condition 
 are dependent 
upon the 
general trends 
of the 
Puerto Rico 
economy and, 
in particular, 
the residential 
and commercial 
real estate 
 markets. The concentration 
of the Corporation s 
operations in Puerto Rico 
exposes it to 
greater risk than other 
banking companies 
 with a wider geographic base. Its 
asset and revenue composition by geographical area 
is presented in Note 32 
to the Consolidated 
 Financial Statements. 

 Puerto 
Rico 
has 
faced 
significant 
fiscal 
and 
economic 
challenges 
for 
over 
a 
decade. 
In 
response 
to 
such 
challenges, 
the 
U.S. 
 Congress enacted the 
Puerto Rico Oversight 
Management and Economic 
Stability Act PROMESA in 
2016, which, among 
other 
 things, 
established 
the 
Oversight 
Board 
and 
a 
framework 
for 
the 
restructuring 
of 
the 
debts 
of 
the 
Commonwealth, 
its 
 instrumentalities 
and 
municipalities. 
The 
Commonwealth 
and 
several 
of 
its 
instrumentalities 
have 
availed 
themselves 
of 
debt 
 restructuring proceedings 
under PROMESA. 
As 
of the 
date of 
this report, 
while municipalities 
have been 
designated as 
covered 
 entities under PROMESA, no municipality has commenced, or has been authorized by the Oversight Board to commence, any such 
 debt restructuring proceeding under PROMESA. 
 At September 30, 2024, the Corporation s direct exposure to the Puerto Rico government and its instrumentalities and municipalities 
 totaled 

million, of which 

million were outstanding 

million and 

million at December 
31, 2023). Of 
the amount 
 outstanding, 

million 
consists 
of 
loans 
and 

million 
are 
securities 

million 
and 

million 
at 
December 31, 
2023). 
 Substantially all 
of the 
amount outstanding 
at September 
30, 2024 
and December 
31, 2023 
were obligations 
from various 
Puerto 
 Rico 
municipalities. 
In 
most 
cases, 
these 
were 
 general 
obligations 
of 
a 
municipality, 
to 
which 
the 
applicable 
municipality 
has 
 pledged 
its 
good 
faith, 
credit 
and 
unlimited 
taxing 
power, 
or 
 special 
obligations

million in bonds 
issued by HFA 
which are secured by 
second mortgage loans on 
Puerto Rico residential properties, 
and 
 for which HFA 
also provides insurance to 
cover losses in 
the event of 
a borrower default 
and upon the 
satisfaction of certain 
other 
 conditions (December 
31, 2023 
- 

million). In 
the event 
that the 
mortgage loans 
insured by 
HFA 
and held 
by the 
Corporation 
 directly or those serving as collateral for the HFA 
bonds default and the collateral is insufficient to satisfy the 
outstanding balance of 
 these loans, HFA s 
ability to honor its insurance will depend, among other factors, on the financial condition of HFA 
at the time such 
 obligations 
become 
due 
and 
payable. The 
Corporation does 
not consider 
the 
government guarantee 
when 
estimating the 
credit 
 losses 
associated 
with 
this 
portfolio. 
Although 
the 
Governor 
is 
currently 
authorized 
by 
local 
legislation 
to 
impose 
a 
temporary 
 moratorium on the financial obligations of the HFA, a moratorium on 
such obligations has not been imposed as of 
the date hereof. 

 BPPR s 
commercial loan 
portfolio also 
includes loans 
to 
private borrowers 
who 
are service 
providers, lessors, 
suppliers or 
have 
 other relationships with the government. These 
borrowers could be negatively affected by 
the Commonwealth s fiscal crisis and 
the 
 ongoing 
Title 
III 
proceedings 
under 
PROMESA. 
Similarly, 
BPPR s 
mortgage 
and 
consumer 
loan 
portfolios 
include 
loans 
to 
 government 
employees 
and 
retirees, 
which 
could 
also 
be 
negatively 
affected 
by 
fiscal 
measures 
such 
as 
employee 
layoffs 
or 
 furloughs or reductions in pension benefits. 

 In 
addition, 

billion 
of 
residential 
mortgages 
and 

million 
commercial 
loans 
were 
insured 
or 
guaranteed 
by 
the 
U.S. 
 Government 
or 
its 
agencies 
at 
September 
30, 
2024 
(compared 
to 

billion 
and 

million, 
respectively, 
at 
December 
31, 
 2023). The 
Corporation also had 
U.S. Treasury 
and obligations from 
the U.S. Government, 
its agencies or 
government sponsored 
 entities 
within the 
portfolio of 
available-for-sale and 
held-to-maturity securities 
as 
described in 
Note 5 
and 
6 to 
the Consolidated 
 Financial Statements. 
 At September 30, 2024, the Corporation had 
operations in the United States Virgin 
Islands (the USVI and had approximately 
 
 million 
in 
direct 
exposure 
to 
USVI 
government 
entities 
(December 
31, 
2023 
- 

million). 
The 
USVI 
has 
been 
experiencing 
a 
 number of 
fiscal and 
economic challenges 
that could 
adversely affect 
the ability 
of its 
public corporations 
and instrumentalities 
to 
 service their outstanding debt obligations. 

100 

million 
comprised 
of 
various 
retail 
and 
commercial 
clients, 
compared 
to 
a 
loan 
portfolio 
of 

million 
at 
 December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024, the Corporation 
had no significant exposure to a single borrower 
in the BVI. 
 FDIC Special Assessment 

 On 
November 
16, 
2023, 
the 
Federal 
Deposit 
Insurance 
Corporation FDIC 
approved 
a 
final 
rule 
that 
imposes 
a 
special 
 assessment (the FDIC 
Special Assessment to recover 
the losses to 
the deposit insurance 
fund resulting from 
the FDIC s use, 
in 
 March 2023, 
of the systemic 
risk exception to 
the least-cost resolution 
test under the 
Federal Deposit Insurance 
Act in 
connection 
 with the 
receiverships of 
several failed 
banks. In 
connection with 
this assessment, 
the Corporation 
recorded an 
expense of 

million, 

million net of tax, in the fourth quarter 
of 2023, representing the full amount of the 
assessment. 
 During the first quarter of 2024, the Corporation recorded an additional expense of 

million, 

million net of tax, to reflect the 
 FDIC's 
higher 
loss 
estimate 
which increased 
from 

billion, 
when 
approved, 
to 

billion 
during the 
quarter. 
The 
special 
 assessment amount and collection period may 
change as the estimated loss 
is periodically adjusted or if 
the total amount collected 
 varies.

to approximately 

million as 
 of 
September 
30, 
2024. 
In 
certain cases, 
management cannot 
reasonably 
estimate the 
possible 
loss 
at 
this 
time. 
Any 
estimate 
 involves significant judgment, given the 
varying stages of the 
Legal Proceedings (including the fact 
that many of them 
are currently 
 in preliminary stages), the 
existence of multiple 
defendants in several of 
the current Legal Proceedings 
whose share of liability 
has 
 yet to be determined, the numerous unresolved issues in 
many of the Legal Proceedings, and the inherent uncertainty 
of the various 
 potential 
outcomes 
of 
such 
Legal 
Proceedings. 
Accordingly, 
management s 
estimate 
will 
change 
from 
time-to-time, 
and 
actual 
 losses may be more or less than the current estimate. 

 While the 
outcome of 
Legal Proceedings 
is inherently 
uncertain, based 
on information 
currently available, 
advice of 
counsel, and 
 available 
insurance 
coverage, 
management 
believes 
that 
the 
amount 
it 
has 
already 
accrued 
is 
adequate 
and 
any 
incremental 
 liability arising from 
the Legal Proceedings 
in matters in 
which a loss 
amount can be 
reasonably estimated will not 
have a material 
 adverse effect 
on the Corporation s 
consolidated financial position. 
However, in 
the event 
of unexpected future 
developments, it is 
 possible that 
the ultimate 
resolution of 
these matters 
in a 
reporting period, if 
unfavorable, could have 
a material 
adverse effect 
on 
 the Corporation s consolidated financial position for that period. 

 Set forth below is a description of the Corporation s 
significant Legal Proceedings. 
 Insufficient Funds and Overdraft Fees Class Actions 
 Popular, Inc. Popular was named as a defendant on a putative class action complaint captioned Golden v. Popular, Inc. originally 
 filed in March 2020 
before the U.S. District Court for 
the Southern District of New 
York, seeking 
damages, restitution and injunctive 
 relief. Plaintiff alleged 
breach of contract, violation 
of the covenant of 
good faith and fair 
dealing, unjust enrichment and 
violation of 

101 

102 

statutory trusts which 
it created to 
issue trust preferred 
securities to the 
public. These trusts 
 are deemed to be variable interest entities VIEs since the equity investors at risk have no substantial decision-making rights. The 
 Corporation does not 
hold any variable 
interest in the 
trusts, and therefore, 
cannot be the 
trusts primary beneficiary. 
Furthermore, 
 the 
Corporation concluded 
that 
it did 
not 
hold 
a 
controlling financial 
interest 
in 
these 
trusts 
since the 
decisions 
of 
the 
trusts 
are 
 predetermined through 
the trust 
documents and the 
guarantee of 
the trust 
preferred securities is 
irrelevant since 
in substance 
the 
 sponsor is guaranteeing its own debt. 
 Also, the 
Corporation is 
involved with 
various special 
purpose entities 
mainly in 
guaranteed mortgage 
securitization transactions, 
 including 
GNMA 
and 
FNMA. 
 The 
Corporation 
has 
also 
engaged 
in 
securitization 
transactions 
with 
FHLMC, 
but 
considers 
its 
 exposure in the 
form of servicing 
fees and servicing 
advances not to be 
significant 
 at September 30, 
2024
 . 
 These special purpose 
 entities 
are 
deemed 
to 
be 
VIEs 
since 
they 
lack 
equity 
investments 
at 
risk. 
The 
Corporation s 
continuing 
involvement 
in 
these 
 guaranteed loan 
securitizations includes 
owning certain 
beneficial interests in 
the form 
of securities as 
well as 
the servicing 
rights 
 retained. The Corporation is not required to provide additional financial support to 
any of the variable interest entities to which it has 
 transferred 
the 
financial 
assets. 
The 
mortgage-backed 
securities, 
to 
the 
extent 
retained, 
are 
classified 
in 
the 
Corporation s 
 Consolidated 
Statements 
of 
Financial 
Condition 
as 
available-for-sale 
or 
trading 
securities. 
The 
Corporation 
concluded 
that, 
 essentially, 
these 
entities 
(FNMA 
and 
GNMA) 
control 
the 
design 
of 
their 
respective 
VIEs, 
dictate 
the 
quality 
and 
nature 
of 
the 
 collateral, require 
the underlying 
insurance, set 
the servicing 
standards via 
the servicing 
guides and 
can change 
them at 
will, and 
 can remove a 
primary servicer with cause, 
and without cause in 
the case of 
FNMA. Moreover, through 
their guarantee obligations, 
 agencies (FNMA and GNMA) have the obligation 
to absorb losses that could be potentially significant 
to the VIE. 
 The 
Corporation 
holds 
variable 
interests 
in 
these 
VIEs 
in 
the 
form 
of 
agency 
mortgage-backed 
securities 
and 
collateralized 
 mortgage obligations, including those securities originated by the Corporation and those acquired from 
third parties. Additionally, the 
 Corporation holds agency mortgage-backed securities 
and agency collateralized mortgage obligations 
issued by third party 
VIEs in 
 which 
it 
has 
no 
other 
form 
of 
continuing 
involvement. Refer 
to 
Note 
23 
to 
the 
Consolidated 
Financial 
Statements 
for 
additional 
 information on the debt securities outstanding at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, which are classified as available-for-
 sale and 
trading securities 
in the 
Corporation s Consolidated 
Statements of 
Financial Condition. In 
addition, the 
Corporation holds 
 variable 
interests 
in 
the 
form 
of 
servicing 
fees, 
since 
it 
retains 
the 
right 
to 
service 
the 
transferred 
loans 
in 
those 
government-
 sponsored special purpose entities SPEs and may also purchase the right to service loans in other government-sponsored SPEs 
 that were transferred to those SPEs by a third-party.

 Investment Companies 
 The 
Corporation, 
through 
its 
wholly 
owned 
subsidiary 
Popular 
Asset 
Management 
LLC PAM 
provided 
investment 
advisory 
 services to several investment companies registered under the Investment 
Company Act of 1940 in exchange for a 
fee. These fees 
 are calculated 
at an 
annual rate 
of the 
average net 
assets of 
the investment 
company, 
as defined 
in each 
agreement. Due 
to its 
 advisory 
role, 
the 
Corporation considers 
these 
investment companies 
as 
related 
parties. The 
Corporation, through 
its 
subsidiary 
 BPPR, also provides transfer agency services to 
investment companies considered affiliates up to the second 
quarter of 2024. 
 For 
the 
nine months 
ended September 
30, 
2024, administrative 
fees charged 
to 
these 
investment companies 
amounted to 

million (September 30, 2023 -

it 
has

billion) and 

million in deferred tax liabilities in the Other liabilities caption 
(December 31, 2023 - 

million), reflecting the aggregate deferred 
 tax assets or 
liabilities of individual 
tax-paying subsidiaries of the 
Corporation in their 
respective tax jurisdiction, Puerto 
Rico or the 
 United States. 

 At September 30, 
2024, the net 
deferred tax assets 
of the U.S. 
operations amounted to 

million with a 
valuation allowance of 
 approximately 

million, for 
net deferred 
tax 
assets after 
valuation allowance 
of 
approximately 

million. 
The 
Corporation 
 evaluates the 
realization of 
the deferred 
tax 
assets on 
a quarterly 
basis by 
taxing 
jurisdiction. The 
U.S. 
operation has 
sustained 
 profitability for 
the last 
three calendar 
years 
and for 
the 
period ended 
September 30, 
2024. These 
historical financial 
results are 
 objectively verifiable positive evidence, evaluated together with 
the positive evidence of stable credit metrics, in combination with the 
 length of 
the expiration 
of the 
NOLs. On 
the other 
hand, the 
Corporation evaluated 
the negative 
evidence accumulated 
over the 
 years, including 
financial results 
lower than 
expectations and 
challenges to 
the economy 
due to 
inflationary pressures 
and global 
 geopolitical uncertainty that 
have resulted in 
a trend 
of reduction of 
pre-tax income over 
the last 
three years. 
As of 
September 30, 
 2024, after weighting all positive and negative 
evidence, the Corporation concluded that it is more likely 
than not that approximately 

million of 
the deferred 
tax assets 
from the 
U.S. operations, 
comprised mainly 
of net 
operating losses, 
will be 
realized. The 
 Corporation 
based 
this 
determination 
on 
its 
estimated 
earnings 
available 
to 
realize 
the 
deferred 
tax 
assets 
for 
the 
remaining 
 carryforward period, together with the historical level 
of book income adjusted by permanent 
differences. Management will continue 
 to 
monitor 
and 
review 
the 
U.S. 
operation s 
results, 
including 
recent 
earnings 
trends, 
the 
pre-tax 
earnings 
forecast, 
any 
new 
tax 
 initiative, 
and 
other 
factors, 
including 
net 
income 
versus 
forecast, 
targeted 
loan 
growth, 
net 
interest 
income 
margin, 
changes 
in 
 deposit 
costs, 
allowance 
for 
credit 
losses, 
charge 
offs, 
NPLs 
inflows 
and 
NPA 
balances. 
Significant 
adverse 
changes 
or 
a 
 combination of changes in these factors could impact 
the future realization of the deferred tax assets. 
 At September 
30, 2024, the 
Corporation s net 
deferred tax assets 
related to its 
Puerto Rico 
operations amounted to 

million. 

 The 
Corporation s 
Puerto 
Rico 
Banking 
operation 
has 
a 
historical 
record 
of 
profitability. 
This 
is 
considered 
a 
strong 
piece 
of 
 objectively verifiable 
positive evidence 
that outweighs 
any negative 
evidence considered 
by Management 
in the 
evaluation of 
the 
 realization 
of 
the 
deferred 
tax 
assets. 
Based 
on 
this 
evidence 
and 
management s 
estimate 
of 
future 
taxable 
income, 
the 
 Corporation has concluded that it is more likely than not that such net deferred tax assets 
of the Puerto Rico Banking operations will 
 be realized. 
 The Holding Company operation has been in a cumulative 
loss position in recent years. 
Management expects these losses will be a 
 trend 
in 
future 
years. 
This 
objectively 
verifiable 
negative 
evidence is 
considered 
by 
Management strong 
negative 
evidence that 
 suggests that 
income in 
future years 
will be 
insufficient to 
support the 
realization of 
all deferred 
tax assets. 
After weighting 
of all 
 positive 
and 
negative evidence 
Management concluded, 
as 
of 
the reporting 
date, 
that 
it 
is 
more 
likely 
than 
not that 
the 
Holding 
 Company will not be 
able to realize any 
portion of the deferred tax 
assets. Accordingly, the 
Corporation has maintained a valuation 
 allowance on the deferred tax assets of 

million as of September 30, 2024. 
 The reconciliation of unrecognized tax benefits, excluding 
interest, was as follows:

129 

Balance at 
March 31 

Balance at 
June 30 

Balance at September 30 

million 
(December 
31, 
2023 
- 

million). 
The 
total 
interest 
expense 
recognized 
at 
September 
30, 
2024 
was 

thousand, 
 (September 30, 2023 

thousand). Management determined that at September 30, 2024 and 
December 31, 2023, there was 
 
 need to 
accrue for 
the payment 
of penalties. 
The Corporation s 
policy is 
to report 
interest related 
to unrecognized 
tax benefits 
in 
 income 
tax 
expense, 
while 
the 
penalties, 
if 
any, 
are 
reported 
in 
other 
operating 
expenses 
in 
the 
consolidated 
statements 
of 
 operations. 

 After consideration 
of the 
effect on 
U.S. federal 
tax of 
unrecognized U.S. 
state tax 
benefits, the 
total amount 
of unrecognized 
tax 
 benefits that if 
recognized, would affect 
the Corporation s effective 
tax rate, was 
approximately 

million at September 
30, 2024 
 (December 31, 2023 - 

million). 
 The amount of 
unrecognized tax benefits 
may increase or 
decrease in the 
future for various 
reasons including adding amounts 
for 
 current 
tax 
year 
positions, 
expiration 
of 
open 
income 
tax 
returns 
due 
to 
the 
statutes 
of 
limitation, 
changes 
in 
Management s 
 judgment about 
the level 
of uncertainty, 
status of 
examinations, litigation 
and legislative 
activity and 
the addition 
or elimination 
of 
 uncertain tax positions. 
The Corporation does not 
anticipate a reduction 
in the total 
amount of unrecognized tax 
benefits within the 
 next 12 months. 

 The 
Corporation and 
its subsidiaries 
file 
income tax 
returns in 
Puerto 
Rico, the 
U.S. federal 
jurisdiction, various 
U.S. states 
and 
 political subdivisions, and foreign jurisdictions. At September 30, 2024, the following years remain subject to examination in the U.S. 
 Federal jurisdiction: 2020 and thereafter; and in 
the Puerto Rico jurisdiction, 2018 and thereafter.

 As a financial services company, 
the Corporation s earnings are significantly affected 
by general business and economic conditions 
 in the 
markets which 
we serve. 
Lending and 
deposit activities 
and fee 
income generation 
are influenced 
by the 
level of 
business 
 spending and 
investment, consumer 
income, spending

non-traditional financial 
service 
providers 
and 
 technology 
companies 
that 
provide 
electronic 
and 
internet-based 
financial 
solutions 
and 
services, 
could 
adversely 
affect 
its 
 profitability. 
 The 
Corporation

monitors 
general 
business 
and 
economic 
conditions, 
industry-related 
indicators 
and

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 This Form 10-Q 
contains financial information 
prepared under accounting 
principles generally accepted in 
the United States U.S. 
 GAAP and 
non-GAAP financial 
measures. Management 
uses non-GAAP 
financial measures 
when it 
has determined 
that these 
 measures provide 
meaningful information 
about the 
underlying performance 
of the 
Corporation s ongoing 
operations. Non-GAAP 
 financial measures used by the Corporation may not be comparable to similarly named non-GAAP financial measures used by 
other 
 companies. 
 Adjusted net income - Non-GAAP Financial Measure 
 In 
addition 
to 
analyzing 
the 
Corporation s 
results 
on 
a 
reported 
basis, 
management 
monitors 
the 
 adjusted 
net 
income 
of 
the 
 Corporation and excludes the impact of certain transactions on the results of its operations. Management believes that the adjusted 
 net 
income 
provides 
meaningful 
information 
about 
the 
underlying 
performance 
of 
the 
Corporation s 
ongoing 
operations. 
The 
 adjusted net income is a non-GAAP financial measure. 
 The following table presents the 
adjusted net income for the 
nine months ended of September 30, 
2024. 
There were no non-GAAP 
 adjustments for the nine months ended September 
30, 2023.

 Net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measure 
 Net interest 
income on 
a taxable 
equivalent basis 
is a 
non-GAAP financial 
measure. Management 
believes that 
this presentation 
 provides meaningful information since it facilitates the comparison 
of revenues arising from taxable and tax-exempt sources. 
 The Corporation s 
interest earning 
assets include 
investment securities 
and loans 
that are 
exempt from 
income tax, 
principally in 
 Puerto 
Rico. The 
main sources 
of tax-exempt 
interest income 
are certain 
investments in 
obligations of 
the 
U.S. Government, 
its 
 agencies and 
sponsored entities, 
certain obligations 
of the 
Commonwealth of 
Puerto Rico 
and/or its 
agencies and 
municipalities, 
 and assets 
held by the 
Corporation s international banking 
entities. To 
facilitate the comparison 
of interest related 
to these 
assets, 
 net interest income has been converted to a taxable 
equivalent basis, using the applicable statutory 
income tax rates for each period 
 on those interest earning assets that are 
tax exempt. In addition, this measure is also 
impacted by a portion of interest cost 
that the 
 Puerto 
Rico 
tax 
law 
requires 
to 
be 
disallowed, 
based 
on 
an 
equal 
proportion 
of 
tax-exempt 
assets 
to 
total 
assets, 
and 
by 
an 
 allocation of general and 
administrative expenses attributed to 
exempt income, reducing the 
benefit of the tax 
exempt income. The 
 effective yield, on 
a taxable equivalent basis, 
will vary depending on 
the level of 
these expenses that are 
attributed to the 
available 
 exempt income. 
 Net interest income on 
a taxable equivalent basis, with 
its different components, along 
with the reconciliation to net 
interest income 
 (GAAP), for the 
quarter ended September 30, 
2024 as compared with 
the same period in 
2023, segregated by major categories 
of 
 interest earning assets and interest-bearing 
liabilities are included in Table 3 of the Operating Results Analysis section below. 
 Tangible Common Equity and Tangible Assets 
 Tangible 
common equity, 
tangible common equity ratio, 
tangible assets and tangible 
book value per common 
share are non-GAAP 
 financial measures. 
Tangible 
common equity 
ratio and 
tangible book 
value per 
common share 
in conjunction 
with more 
traditional 
 bank 
capital 
ratios 
are 
commonly 
used 
by 
banks 
and 
analysts 
to 
compare 
the 
capital 
adequacy 
of 
banking 
organizations 
with 
 significant amounts 
of goodwill 
or other 
intangible assets, 
typically stemming 
from the 
use of 
the purchase 
accounting method 
for 
 mergers and acquisitions. 
Tangible 
common equity, 
tangible assets and 
other related measures 
should not be 
used in 
isolation or 
 as 
a 
substitute 
for 
stockholders' 
equity, 
total 
assets 
or 
any 
other 
measure 
calculated 
in 
accordance 
with 
GAAP. 
Moreover, 
the 
 manner in which the Corporation calculates its tangible common 
equity, tangible assets and 
other related measures may differ from 
 that of other companies reporting measures with 
similar names. 
 Table 
10 provides 
a reconciliation of 
total stockholders equity 
to tangible common 
equity and total 
assets to tangible 
assets 
as of 
 September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023. 
 Financial highlights for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 

For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Corporation recorded net income of 155.3 million, compared to net income of 
 
136.6 
million 
for 
the 
same 
quarter of 
the 
previous year. 
Net 
interest margin 
for 
the 
third 
quarter of 
2024 
was 
3.24 , an 
 increase of 17 basis 
points when compared to 
3.07 for the same 
quarter of the previous 
year. The 
increase was mainly due 
 to 
higher 
yields 
in 
investment 
securities, 
mainly 
due 
to 
reinvestment 
of 
maturities 
in 
higher 
yielding 
U.S. 
Treasury 
 securities, and to 
higher average 
loan balances 
and higher 
yields in 
almost all 
loans portfolios, 
which was 
partially offset 
by 
 higher deposit 
costs, 
principally due 
to higher 
average volume 
and higher 
cost 
of interest-bearing 
deposits, 
mainly from 
the 
 Puerto Rico government and time deposits at PB. On a taxable equivalent basis, the net interest margin was 3.47 , compared 
 to 3.24 for the same quarter of the previous year. 

For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Corporation 
recorded a provision for credit losses of 71.4 million, 
compared to 
 45.1 million for 
the same quarter 
of the previous 
year. The 
increase in provision 
for credit losses 
was mainly reflected 
within 
 the commercial 
loan portfolio 
for both 
of the 
Corporation s segments. 
The increase 
was mainly 
due to 
net charge-offs 
in the 
 commercial loan 
portfolio during 
the third 
quarter of 
2024, compared 
to net 
recoveries recognized 
during the 
third quarter 
of 
 2023, and 
the changes 
in credit 
quality and 
macroeconomic variables. 
In the 
U.S. commercial 
portfolio, the 
release of 
 4.4 
 million was 
lower compared 
with the 
third quarter 
of 2023 
due to 
the impact 
of the 
new model 
for the 
U.S. commercial 
real 
 estate segment that was implemented during that 
quarter which resulted in a higher benefit. 

Non-interest 
income 
was 
 164.1 
million 
for 
the 
quarter, 
an 
increase 
of 
 4.5 
million 
when 
compared 
to 
the 
quarter 
ended 

139 
 September 30, 
2023
 , mainly 
due to 
higher other 
service fees, 
due to 
higher credit 
and debit 
card service 
fees as 
a result 
of 
 higher volume 
of transactions, 
partially offset 
by lower 
income from 
mortgage banking 
activities resulting 
from the 
fair value 
 adjustments of mortgage servicing rights. 

Operating 
expenses 
of 
 467.3 
million 
for 
the 
quarter 
were 
higher 
by 
 1.3 
million 
when 
compared 
to 
the 
quarter 
ended 
 September 30, 2023. 
Higher operating expenses 
were driven mainly 
by higher technology 
and software expenses, 
personnel 
 costs 
and 
regulatory 
examination 
fees 
included 
as 
other 
taxes, 
partially 
offset 
by 
lower 
professional 
fees 
and 
a 
goodwill 
 impairment charge related to our U.S. based leasing 
subsidiary recorded in 2023. 

Income tax 
expense of 
 42.5 million 
during the 
quarter was 
lower by 
 3.4 million 
compared to 
the quarter 
ended September 
 30, 2023, mainly due to higher exempt income. 

Total 
assets at September 30, 2024 amounted to 71.3 billion, compared to 70.8 billion, at 
December 31, 2023. The increase 
 was 
driven 
by 
loan 
growth, 
mainly 
in 
the 
commercial 
portfolio, 
and 
higher 
portfolio 
balance 
in 
available-for-sale AFS 
 securities, 
impacted 
by 
lower 
unrealized 
losses, 
and 
partially 
offset 
by 
a 
decrease 
in 
held-to-maturity HTM 
investment 
 securities driven by maturities of U.S. Treasury securities. 
 
 Total 
deposits at 
September 30, 
2024 increased 
by 50.3 
million when 
compared to 
deposits at 
December 31, 
2023, mainly 
 due to higher deposits in PB, mainly those captured 
via the online channel.

Stockholders equity 
as of 
September 30, 
2024 increased 
by 643.6 
million from 
the December

 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES / ESTIMATES 

 The accounting 
and reporting 
policies followed 
by the 
Corporation and 
its subsidiaries 
conform to 
generally accepted 
accounting 
 principles 
in 
the 
United 
States 
of 
America 
and 
general 
practices 
within 
the 
financial 
services 
industry. 
Various 
elements 
of 
the 
 Corporation s accounting policies, by 
their nature, are 
inherently subject to 
estimation techniques, valuation assumptions and 
other 
 subjective assessments. 
These estimates 
are made 
under facts 
and circumstances 
at a 
point in 
time and 
changes in 
those facts 
 and circumstances could produce actual results that 
differ from those estimates. 

 Management has discussed 
the development and 
selection of the 
critical accounting policies 
and estimates with 
the Corporation s 
 Audit 
Committee. 
The 
Corporation 
has 
identified 
as 
critical 
accounting 
policies 
those 
related 
to: 
(i) 
Fair 
Value 
Measurement 
of 
 Financial Instruments; (ii) Loans 
and Allowance for Credit 
Losses; (iii) Loans Acquired 
with Deteriorated Credit Quality; 
(iv) Income 
 Taxes; 
(v) Goodwill and 
Other Intangible Assets; and 
(vi) Pension and Postretirement 
Benefit Obligations. For a 
summary of these 
 critical 
accounting 
policies 
and 
estimates,

 OPERATING RESULTS ANALYSIS 
 NET INTEREST INCOME 
 Net interest income for 
the quarter ended September 
30, 2024 was 572.5 
million, compared to 534.0 
million in the same 
quarter 
 of 2023, 
an increase 
of 38.5 
million. Net 
interest income 
on a 
taxable equivalent 
basis for 
the third 
quarter of 
2024 was 
 612.9 
 million compared to 563.7 million in the third 
quarter of 2023, an increase of 49.2 million. 

 Net interest margin for the quarter 
was 3.24 compared to 3.07 in the 
third quarter of 2023 or an 
increase of 17 basis points. On 
 a taxable equivalent basis, net interest margin for the third quarter of 2024 was 3.47 , compared to 3.24 for the same quarter the 
 prior year. The main variances in net interest income on a taxable 
equivalent basis were: 

higher interest income from 
investment securities by 33.8 
million mainly driven higher 
yield by 48 
basis points, due to 
a 
 higher interest rate environment and reinvestment 
of investment maturities in higher yielding U.S. 
Treasury bills; 
 
 higher interest income from 
loans by 69.6 million 
resulting from higher balances in 
both PB and BPPR 
and across most 
 portfolios and higher yield on loans by 32 basis 
points when compared to the same quarter 
of 2023. 
 Partially offset by: 
 
 higher interest expense 
on interest-bearing deposits 
by 56.9 million 
driven by a 
higher cost of 
interest-bearing deposits 
 by 41 basis points 
due to higher average volume 
by 884.1 million and 
higher cost of market 
linked interest-bearing P.R. 
 Government deposits and higher volume of U.S. 
deposits, mainly those captured via the online channel. 
 Net interest income 
for the BPPR 
segment amounted to 
 488.0 million for 
the third quarter 
of 2024, compared 
to 453.9 million 
in 
 the third 
quarter of 
2023. Net interest 
margin increased to 
3.41 compared to 
3.14 in the 
third quarter of 
2023. The increase 
in 
 net interest income of 34.1 
million was driven by higher 
yields from earning assets and loan 
growth partially offset by the 
increase 
 in the 
cost of 
deposits, mainly 
from P.R. 
Government deposits. 
The cost 
of interest-bearing 
deposits increased 
29 basis 
points to 
 2.55 from 2.25 in 
the same quarter of 
2023. Total 
deposit costs for the quarter 
increased by 21 basis 
points, from 1.68 in the 
 third quarter of 2023 to 1.89 . 
 Net interest income for 
PB was 93.1 million 
for the quarter ended 
September 30, 2024, compared to 
 87.4 million during the 
third 
 quarter of 
2023, 
an 
increase of 
 5.7 million. 
Net interest 
margin 
decreased 17 
basis 
points to 
2.73 
when compared 
to 
2.90 
 during the third 
quarter of 2023. 
The decrease in 
net interest margin 
was mostly driven 
by higher balances 
and cost of 
deposits in 
 most 
of 
the 
interest-bearing 
categories, 
partially 
offset 
by 
the 
increase 
in 
loan 
volume 
and 
yield. 
The 
cost 
of 
interest-bearing 
 deposits was 3.80 compared to 3.31 in the third quarter of 2023, 
or an increase of 49 basis points. 
Total deposit cost was 3.35 
 compared to 2.84 , or a decrease of 51 basis 
points in the third quarter of 2023.

 Net interest income for the nine months 
ended September 30, 2024 was 1.7 billion, or 94.2 million higher than the same period in 
 2023. Taxable 
equivalent net interest income 
was 1.8 billion, 
an increase of 
 124.8 million when compared 
to the same 
period in 
 2023. 
Net 
interest 
margin 
was 
3.20 , 
an 
increase 
of 
six 
basis 
points 
when 
compared 
to 
3.14 
for 
the 
nine 
months 
ended 
 September 30, 
2023. The 
increase in 
net interest 
margin was 
mainly driven 
by a 
higher yield 
on earning 
assets due 
to a 
higher 
 interest rate environment. 
Net interest margin, 
on a taxable 
equivalent basis, for 
the nine months 
ended September 30, 2024, 
was 
 3.44 , an increase of 12 basis points when compared to the 3.32 for the same period of 
2023. The drivers of the variances in net 
 interest income for the nine-month period are: 

 Positive variances: 

higher interest 
income 
from 
investment securities 
by 
 156.8 million 
resulting from 
higher yield 
of 
the portfolio 
by 
62 
basis 
 points driven by the 
re-investment of maturities and deployment of 
liquidity to higher yield short-term 
Treasury bills, for which 
 interest is tax exempt in Puerto Rico; 

higher interest income from loans by 
 249.5 million reflecting higher interest income from commercial loans 
by 122.9 million 
 due 
to 
higher 
yield 
by 
37 
basis 
points 
related 
to 
higher 
rates 
in 
adjustable-rate 
loans 
and 
higher 
volume 
of 
 1.5 
billion, 
 increasing in BPPR and PB, and higher volume and 
yield across the rest of the portfolios as shown in 
Table 4; and 
 partially offset by: 

higher interest 
expense from 
deposits by 
 289.6 million 
mainly due 
to 
the increase 
in interest 
rates that 
has resulted 
in a 
 higher cost in most deposit 
categories in both BPPR and PB; 
but particularly from P.R 
Government deposits that are market-
 linked and PB online deposits.

 Provision for Credit Losses - Loans Held-in-Portfolio 
and Unfunded Commitments 
 For the quarter 
ended September 30, 
2024, the Corporation 
recorded a provision 
for credit losses 
related to loans 
held-in-portfolio 
 and unfunded commitments 
of 72.3 million, 
an increase of 
 27.1 million, compared to 
the same quarter 
of the previous 
year. The 
 provision for the loan portfolio increased by 29.3 million. Refer to Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details of the 
 movement of the allowance for credit losses. The drivers of 
the increase in the provision for loan losses by business 
segments when 
 comparing the third quarter of 2024, 
to the same quarter in 2023 were 
as follows: 

In the BPPR segment, 
the provision for credit losses increased 
by 23.1 million, to 77.1 million. The increase was mainly 
 reflected within the 
commercial loan portfolio 
driven by net 
charge-offs, instead of 
net recoveries for 
the same 
quarter in 
 2023, along with changes in credit quality and 
macroeconomic variables. 

In the Popular U.S. segment, 
a release of 4.4 million 
was recorded for the quarter ended 
September 30, 2024 driven by 
 changes in 
credit quality, 
and improvements in 
credit ratings 
related to 
the commercial 
portfolio. This release 
was lower 
 when 
compared 
to 
the 
same 
quarter 
in 
2023 
for 
which 
a 
release 
of 
 10.5 
million 
was 
recorded mainly 
driven 
by 
the 
 implementation of a new model for the U.S. 
commercial real estate portfolio based on more 
granular regional data. 
 For 
the 
nine 
months 
ended 
September 
30, 
2024, 
the 
Corporation 
recorded 
a 
provision 
for 
credit 
loss 
related 
to 
loans 
held-in-
 portfolio and unfunded commitments of 190.7 million, an increase of 59.9 million, compared to the nine months ended September 
 30, 2023. The provision 
for the loan portfolio increased 
by 63.0 million. The 
drivers of the increase in 
the provision for loan 
losses 
 by business segments when comparing the nine months 
ended September 30, 2024, to the same period 
in 2023 were as follows: 

In the BPPR segment, the provision for loan losses was of 186.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, 
 compared 
to 
 127.6 
million 
for 
the 
nine 
months 
ended 
September 
30, 
2023, 
attributable 
to 
higher 
reserves 
in 
the 
 commercial, auto leases and consumer portfolios due 
to loan growth, 
higher losses, and changes in credit quality. 

In 
the Popular 
U.S. segment, 
the provision 
for loan 
losses was 
an expense 
of 
 2.6 
million for 
the nine 
months ended 
 September 30, 2024, compared to 
a release of 1.3 
million for the same 
period in 2023. The 
higher provision was driven 
 by the 
reduction in reserves 
during the same 
period of 
2023 due to 
the implementation of 
a new 
model, based on 
more 
 granular regional data, for the U.S. commercial real 
estate portfolio. 
 At 
September 30, 
2024, the 
total 
allowance for 
credit 
losses for 
loans held-in-portfolio 
amounted to 
 744.3 million, 
compared to 
 729.3 
million 
as 
of 
December 
31, 
2023. 
The 
ratio 
of 
the 
allowance 
for 
credit 
losses 
to 
loans 
held-in-portfolio 
was 
2.06 
at 
 September 30, 
2024, compared 
to 
2.08 at 
December 31, 
2023. Refer 
to 
Note 8 
to 
the Consolidated 
Financial Statements, 
for 
 additional information 
on the 
Corporation s methodology 
to 
estimate its 
ACL. Refer 
to the 
Credit Risk 
section of 
this MD A 
for a 
 detailed analysis of net charge-offs, non-performing assets, 
the allowance for credit losses and selected loan 
losses statistics. 
 Provision for Credit Losses Investment Securities 
 The 
Corporation s 
provision 
for 
credit 
losses 
related 
to 
its 
investment 
securities 
held-to-maturity 
is 
related 
to 
the 
portfolio 
of 
 obligations from 
the Government 
of Puerto 
Rico, states 
and political 
subdivisions. At 
September 30, 
2024, the 
total allowance 
for 
 credit 
losses 
for 
this 
portfolio 
amounted 
to 
 5.4 
million, 
compared 
to 
 5.8 
million 
at 
December 
31, 
2023. 
Refer 
to 
Note 
6
 to 
 Consolidated Financial Statements
 for additional information on the ACL for this portfolio. 
 Non-Interest Income 
 Non-interest 
income 
amounted to 
 164.1 
million 
for 
the 
quarter ended 
September 
30, 
2024, compared 
to 
 159.5 million 
for 
the 
 same quarter of the previous year. The main factors that contributed 
to the variance in non-interest income were: 

higher other service fees by 5.3 million 
mainly due to higher credit and debit 
card service fees as a result 
of higher volume of 
 transactions; 
 partially offset by: 

lower income from mortgage banking activities by 
 2.7 million mainly due to a 
decrease in the fair value of 
mortgage servicing 
 rights MSRs ). 

145 
 Non-interest income amounted to 494.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 482.0 million for the 
 same period of the previous year. The main factors that contributed to 
the variance in non-interest income were: 

higher other service 
fees by 12.1 
million mainly due 
to an increase 
in debit and 
credit cards fees 
due to higher 
transactional 
 volume and higher income from the sale and 
administration of investment products; 
and 

higher 
service 
charges 
on 
deposit 
accounts 
by 
 3.5 
million 
mainly 
due 
to 
higher 
fees 
resulting 
mainly 
from 
non-balance 
 compensation in commercial deposits; 
 partially offset by: 

lower 
mortgage 
banking 
activities 
by 
 2.4 
million 
mainly 
due 
to 
a 
decrease 
in 
mortgage 
servicing 
fees 
due 
to 
higher 
 delinquencies in the serviced portfolio. 

146 
 Operating Expenses 
 Operating 
expenses 
amounted 
to 
 467.3 
million 
for 
the 
quarter 
ended 
September 
30, 
2024, 
an 
increase 
of 
 1.3 
million, 
when 
 compared with the same quarter of 2023. The 
variance in operating expenses was driven primarily 
by: 

higher 
technology 
and 
software 
expenses 
by 
 15.5 
million 
mainly 
due 
to 
higher 
IT 
consulting 
fees 
by 
 5.8 
million, 
higher 
 software amortization expense by 3.9 million and an 
increase of 2.9 million from network management 
services; 

higher other taxes expense by 9.2 million mainly due the reversal of an accrual of 
 8.2 million during the third quarter of 2023 
 related to regulatory examination fees in BPPR; 

higher personnel costs by 8.7 million mainly due to higher 
salaries by 8.2 million as a result of annual salary 
revisions and an 
 increase in headcount; 

higher 
business 
promotion 
expenses 
by 
 2.6 
million 
mainly 
due 
to 
higher 
donations 
granted 
during 
the 
quarter, 
higher 
 advertising costs and higher customer rewards programs 
expense in our credit card business; and 

lower other 
real estate 
owned (OREO) 
benefit by 
 2.5 million 
mainly due 
to lower 
gain on 
sale of 
mortgage and 
commercial 
 properties; 
 partially offset by: 

a goodwill 
impairment charge 
of 23.0 
million recorded 
during the 
third quarter 
of 2023 
in our 
U.S. based 
equipment leasing 
 subsidiary due to lower forecasted cash flows and 
an increase in the rate used to discount cash 
flows; 

lower professional fees by 11.8 million mainly due to a decrease in advisory 
expenses arising from corporate initiatives; 
and 

lower processing 
and transactional 
services expenses 
by 3.6 
million mainly 
due to 
lower point 
of service 
(POS) processing 
 fees,
 driven by a lower fee rate and higher 
incentive rebates in 2024. 
 Operating expenses 
amounted to 
 1.4 billion 
for the 
nine months 
ended September 
30, 2024, 
an increase 
of 53.1 
million when 
 compared with the 
same period of 
2023. Excluding the 
 6.4 million of 
interest accrued related 
to prior period 
tax withholdings and 
 the 14.3 million impact of the FDIC Special Assessment, total 
expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 
 by 32.4 million, when compared with the same 
period of 2023. The main drivers of 
the 32.4 million variance were: 

higher technology 
and software 
expenses by 
 33.8 million 
mainly due 
to higher 
IT professional 
fees by 
 11.2 
million, higher 
 software amortization expense by 9.7 million, an increase of 7.6 million from network management services and an increase 
 of 2.4 million in application processing and 
hosting services; 

higher personnel costs by 31.3 million mainly due to higher salaries by 15.9 million as a result of annual salary revisions and 
 an 
increase 
in 
headcount, 
an 
increase 
in 
restricted 
shares, 
commissions 
and 
incentive 
compensation 
by 
 9.6 
million 
and 
 higher payroll taxes and other compensation expenses 
by 5.3 million; 

higher other taxes expense by 6.2 million 
mainly due to an increase in 
municipal license tax and to the impact 
of the reversal 
 in 2023 of regulatory examination fees in BPPR, 
as mentioned above; 

higher 
promotion 
expenses 
by 
 5.0 
million 
mainly 
due 
to 
higher donations, 
advertising 
and 
sponsorship 
expenses 
by 
 3.0 
 million and higher customer rewards programs expense 
in our credit card business by 2.0 million; and 

higher operational losses by 4.6 million due to 
build up on reserves for operational losses; 
 partially offset by: 

lower 
professional 
fees 
by 
 28.7 
million 
mainly 
due 
to 
advisory 
expenses 
arising 
from 
corporate 
initiatives 
including 
those 
 related to the Corporation's transformation initiative 
incurred during the nine months ended September 
30, 2023; and 

147 
 
 A 
 goodwill impairment charge 
of 23.0 million 
recorded during the 
third quarter 
of 2023 
in our 
U.S. based equipment 
leasing 
 subsidiary due to lower forecasted cash flows and 
an increase in the rate used to discount cash 
flows;

 Income Taxes 
 For the quarter and nine months 
ended September 30, 2024, the Corporation recorded an income 
tax expense of 42.5 million and 
 138.5 million with an effective 
tax rate (ETR) of 
21.5 and 24.1 , respectively, 
compared to 45.9 million and 
 135.7 million with 
 an ETR 
of 25.1 and 
23.3 for the 
respective periods of 
2023. 
The lower 
income tax expense 
for the 
quarter ended September 
 30, 2024, compared 
to the same 
quarter of 
2023, is mostly 
due to the 
higher exempt income 
recorded for the 
current quarter. 
For 
 the nine 
months ended 
September 30, 
2024, the 
higher income 
tax reflects 
the tax 
withholding expense 
recorded during 
the first 
 quarter on 
certain intercompany 
distributions, amounting 
to 22.9 
million, out 
of which 
 16.5 million 
corresponded to 
years 2014-
 2023 and 6.5 
million was related 
to a 
distribution completed during the 
period ended March 
31, 2024; this 
negative variance was 
 partially offset 
by the 
lower income 
before tax, 
higher exempt 
income and 
other tax 
credits recorded 
this year, 
compared with 
the 
 same period of year 2023. 

 At September 
30, 2024, 
the Corporation 
had a 
net deferred 
tax asset 
amounting to 
 916 million, 
net of 
a valuation 
allowance of 
 451 million. The net deferred tax asset related 
to the U.S. operations was 250 million, net of 
a valuation allowance of 379 million. 
 Refer to 
Note 30 
to the 
Consolidated Financial 
Statements for 
a reconciliation 
of the 
statutory income 
tax rate 
to the 
effective tax 
 rate and additional information on the income 
tax expense and deferred tax asset balances. 
 REPORTABLE SEGMENT RESULTS 
 The Corporation s 
reportable segments 
for managerial 
reporting purposes 
consist of 
Banco Popular 
de Puerto 
Rico and 
Popular 
 U.S. A Corporate group 
has also been defined to support the reportable 
segments. 

148 
 For 
a 
description 
of 
the 
Corporation s 
reportable 
segments, 
including 
additional 
financial 
information 
and 
the 
underlying 
 management accounting process, refer to Note 32 
to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

 The Corporate group reported a net 
income of 0.5 million for the 
quarter ended September 30, 2024, compared with 
a net income 
 of 
 2.8 million 
for the 
same quarter 
of 
the previous 
year. 
For the 
nine months 
ended September 
30, 2024, 
the Corporate 
group 
 reported net loss of 
 21.7 million, compared to 
a net income 
of 8.8 million for 
the same period of 
the previous year. 
The negative 
 variance was mainly attributed to the 22.9 million adjustment to recognize the tax impact associated with prior period intercompany 
 distributions and 
the additional 
 6.5 million 
recognized for the 
tax impact related 
to intercompany 
distributions paid during 
the first 
 quarter of 2024. 

 Highlights on the earnings results for the reportable 
segments are discussed below: 
 Banco Popular de Puerto Rico 

 The Banco Popular 
de Puerto Rico 
reportable segment s net 
income amounted to 
 125.8 million for 
the quarter ended 
September 
 30, 2024, compared with 
net income of 122.7 
million for the same 
quarter of the previous year. 
The factors that contributed to 
the 
 variance in the financial results included the following: 

Higher net interest income by 34.1 million mainly 
due to: 

higher interest income from money market 
and investment securities by 4.9 million 
due to higher yields driven 
 by the reinvestment into higher interest rates U.S. 
Treasury securities; 
and 

higher interest income from loans by 53.6 million 
mainly due to higher average balances across all portfolios; 
 partially offset by 

higher interest expense on deposits by 23.9 million mainly due to the higher interest rate environment s impact 
 on the cost of P.R. Government deposits. 
 The net interest margin 
for the quarter ended 
September 30, 2024 was 3.41 
compared to 3.14 for the 
same quarter in the 
 previous year. 
The increase in 
net interest margin 
is driven by 
the earnings assets 
mix and the 
higher yields from 
investment 
 securities and loans, particularly commercial and consumer loans, due to the increase in rates; partially offset by 
higher cost of 
 deposits.

A 
provision for 
loan 
losses 
of 
 77.1 million, 
compared 
to 
a 
provision of 
 54.2 
million 
in 
quarter ended 
September 
30, 
 2023, higher by 
 22.9 million mainly 
in the commercial 
portfolio due to 
net charge offs 
as compared to 
net recoveries in 
 2023, and changes in credit quality in the commercial 
portfolio; 

Non-interest income was higher by 4.4 million mainly 
due to: 

higher other service 
fees by 4.3 
million due to 
higher interchange income from 
debit and credit 
card as result 
 of higher volume of transactions and higher ancillary 
fees; 
 partially offset by 

lower income 
from mortgage 
banking activities 
by 2.6 
million mainly 
due to 
an unfavorable 
variance of 
 2.0 
 million in the fair value adjustment of mortgage service 
rights; 

Higher operating expenses by 20.6 million mostly due 
to: 

149 

higher 
technology 
and 
software 
expenses 
by 
 9.9 
million 
mainly 
due 
to 
higher 
IT 
professional 
fees, 
higher 
 amortization of software costs and higher network management 
fees; 

higher other operating taxes by 9.4 million due 
to the accrual reversal in the quarter ended September 
30,2023 
 related to regulatory examination fees in BPPR by 
 8.2 million; 

higher personnel costs by 4.0 million driven by 
annual salary revisions, and an increase in headcount; 

lower net recoveries from 
OREO by 2.5 million 
mainly due to lower 
gain on sale 
of mortgage and commercial 
 properties; and 
 partially offset by 

lower 
processing 
and 
transactional 
services 
by 
 3.5 
million 
mainly 
due 
to 
a 
lower 
point 
of 
service POS 
 processing fees, driven by a lower fee rate and higher 
incentive rebates in 2024; and 

lower professional fees of 6.1 million mainly due 
to lower consulting fees related to corporate initiatives; 

Lower income tax expense by 10.8 million is mainly 
due to higher net exempt income. 

 For 
the 
nine months 
ended September 
30, 
2024, the 
BPPR segment 
recorded net 
income 
of 
 404.3 million 
compared 
to 
a 
net 
 income of 387.4 million for the same period of the previous year. The factors that contributed to the variance in the financial results 
 included the following: 

Higher net interest income by 92.8 million 
mainly due to: 

higher interest income from money market and investment 
securities by 77.5 million due to higher yields driven 
 by the re-investments of maturities and deployment 
of liquidity to higher yield U.S. Treasury securities; 
and 

higher interest 
income from 
loans by 
 183.0 million 
mainly due 
to higher 
average balances 
from commercial 
 and consumer loans, 
 partially offset by 

higher interest 
expense on 
deposits by 
 166.9 million 
mainly due 
to higher 
costs on 
the market-linked 
Puerto 
 Rico government deposits. 
 The net interest 
margin for the 
nine months ended September 
30, 2024 was 
3.38 compared to 
3.24 for the 
same period in 
the 
 previous 
year. 
The 
increase 
in 
net 
interest 
margin 
is 
driven 
by 
the 
earnings 
assets 
mix 
and 
the 
higher 
yields 
from 
investment 
 securities and loans, due to the increase in 
rates; partially offset by higher cost of deposits. 

An 
unfavorable variance 
of 
 58.8 
million 
on 
the 
provision for 
loan 
losses 
mainly 
attributable to 
higher reserves 
in 
the 
 commercial, auto leases and consumer portfolios 
due to loan growth, higher losses, and changes 
in credit quality; 

Non-interest income was higher by 11.1 million mainly due to: 

higher other service fees by 9.4 million mainly due to higher debit and credit card fees by 5.0 million as result 
 of higher volume of customer transactions; and 

higher 
service 
charges 
on 
deposit 
accounts 
by 
 3.6 
million 
mainly 
due 
to 
higher 
fees 
from 
non- 
balance 
 compensation in commercial deposits; 
 partially offset by 

150 

lower income 
from mortgage 
banking activities 
by 2.3 
million mainly 
due to 
an unfavorable 
variance of 
 2.0 
 million in the fair value adjustment of mortgage service 
rights. 

Higher operating expenses by 53.6 million mostly due 
to: 

higher 
personnel 
costs 
by 
 19.3 
million 
driven 
by 
annual 
salary 
revisions, 
an 
increase 
in 
headcount, 
an 
 increase in restricted shares, higher commissions and 
incentive compensation, and an increase in payroll 
taxes; 

higher technology and software expenses by 19.0 million mainly due to higher amortization of software, higher 
 IT consulting fees, higher network management fees 
and higher application and hosting services; 

higher 
FDIC 
deposit 
insurance 
expense 
by 
 15.1 
million 
due 
to 
 12.7 
million 
on 
FDIC 
Special 
Assessment 
 recorded in the first quarter of 2024; 

higher 
other 
operating 
expenses 
by 
 6.5 
million 
mostly 
due 
to 
higher 
charges 
from 
the 
Corporate 
segment 
 group; 

higher other operating taxes by 5.7 million due to reversal in the nine-month period ended September 30,2023 
 related to regulatory examination fees in BPPR by 
 8.2 million; 

higher business promotions by 4.0 million due to higher donations, 
advertising and sponsorship expenses, and 
 higher customer rewards expense in credit card business; 
 partially offset by 

lower professional 
fees of 
 17.5 million 
mainly due 
to 
lower advisory 
costs associated 
with several 
initiatives 
 including the Corporations transformation initiatives; 

higher net 
recoveries from 
OREO by 
 3.6 million 
mainly due 
to an 
increase in 
gain on 
sale of 
mortgage and 
 commercial properties; 

Lower income 
tax 
expense of 
 28.2 million 
is mainly 
due to 
higher net 
exempt income 
and 
higher tax 
credit 
recorded 
 during this period. 
 Popular U.S. 
 For 
the 
quarter 
ended 
September 
30, 
2024, 
the 
reportable 
segment 
of 
Popular 
U.S. 
reported 
a 
net 
income 
of 
 28.8 
million, 
 compared with a net income of 11.0 million for the same quarter of the 
previous year. The factors that contributed to the variance in 
 the financial results included the following: 

Higher net interest income by 5.7 million due 
to: 

higher interest 
income from 
loans by 
 14.3 million, 
mainly from 
growth in 
the commercial 
portfolio as 
well as 
 higher yields due to higher interest rates; and 

higher 
interest 
income 
from 
money 
market 
and 
investment 
securities 
by 
 17.9 
million 
due 
to 
higher 
yields, 
 mainly in money markets; 
 partially offset by: 

151 

higher interest 
expense on 
deposits by 
 27.3 million 
mainly 
due 
to 
higher interest 
rates 
and 
higher average 
 balances. 

 The 
net 
interest 
margin 
for 
the 
quarter ended 
September 
30, 
2024 
was 
2.73 compared 
to 
2.90 
for 
the 
same 
quarter in 
the 
 previous year driven by the higher cost of deposits. 

An unfavorable variance of 6.1 million on the provision for loan losses reflecting a release of the reserve for credit losses 
 of 
 4.4 
million 
for 
the 
third 
quarter 
of 
2024 
compared 
to 
a 
release 
of 
 10.5 
million 
recorded 
in 
the 
quarter 
ended 
 September 30, 2023; 

A favorable variance of 5.5 million in the reserve 
for unfunded commitments, mainly related to 
the construction portfolio; 

Lower operating expenses by 18.9 million mostly 
due to: 

the 
goodwill impairment 
charge 
related to 
our U.S. 
based leasing 
subsidiary of 
 23.0 million 
recorded in 
the 
 third 
quarter of 
2023, due 
to 
lower forecasted 
cash flows 
and 
an increase 
in the 
rate used 
to 
discount cash 
 flows; 
 partially offset by 

higher personnel costs and technology and software 
expenses by 3.6 million; 

Higher income tax expense by 7.1 million is related 
to higher income before tax. 
 For the 
nine months 
ended September 
30, 2024, 
the reportable 
segment of 
Popular U.S. 
recorded a 
net income 
of 53.6 
million, 
 compared with a net income of 51.3 million for the same period of the previous year. 
The factors that contributed to the variance in 
 the financial results included the following: 

Lower net interest income by 1.2 million due 
to: 

higher interest 
expense on 
deposits by 
 114.6 
million mainly 
due to 
higher interest 
rates and 
higher average 
 balance; 
 partially offset by 

higher interest 
income from 
loans by 
 61.0 million, 
mainly from 
growth in 
the commercial 
portfolio as 
well as 
 higher yields due to higher rates; and 

higher interest income 
from money market 
and investment securities 
by 49.6 million 
due to higher 
yields and 
 higher average balance. 
 The net interest margin for 
the nine months ended September 
30, 2024 was 2.64 compared to 
3.08 for the same quarter 
in the 
 previous year. 

An unfavorable variance of 3.8 million 
on the provision for loan losses reflecting 
a release mainly due to the reduction 
in 
 reserves in 2023 
due to the 
implementation of a 
new model, based 
on more granular 
regional performance, for 
the U.S. 
 commercial real estate portfolio; 

A favorable variance of 5.4 million in the reserve 
for unfunded commitments, mainly related to 
the construction portfolio; 

Lower operating expenses by 8.0 million mostly 
due to: 

the goodwill impairment 
charge related to 
our U.S. based 
leasing subsidiary of 
 23.0 million recorded in 
2023, 
 due to lower forecasted cash flows and an increase 
in the rate used to discount cash flows; 

152 

lower professional fees of 
 4.0 million mainly due 
to lower costs associated with 
corporate initiatives and lower 
 legal fees; 
 partially offset by: 

higher personnel costs by 2.1 million driven by 
higher annual salary revisions and increase in headcount; 

higher 
technology 
and 
software 
expenses 
by 
 5.5 
million 
mainly 
due 
to 
higher 
network 
management 
fees, 
 higher amortization of software costs and higher IT 
consulting fees; 

higher 
other 
operating 
expense 
by 
 5.7 
million 
mainly 
due 
to 
higher 
charges 
allocated 
from 
the 
Corporate 
 segment group; 
and 

higher FDIC deposit insurance expense by 5.3 
million mostly due to FDIC Special Assessment; 

Higher income tax expense by 7.7 million due 
to a higher net income before income tax. 
 FINANCIAL CONDITION ANALYSIS 

 Assets 
 The Corporation s total assets were 71.3 
billion at September 30, 2024, 
compared to 70.8 billion at December 
31, 2023. Refer to 
 the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition 
included in this report for additional information. 

 Money market investments and debt securities available-for-sale 
and held-to-maturity 
 Money market investments decreased by 
 468.1 million as of 
September 30, 2024, when 
compared to December 31, 
2023, driven 
 by lower 
deposits and 
loan growth. 
Debt securities available-for-sale 
increased 457.1 
million, mainly 
due to 
reinvestment of 
U.S. 
 Treasury Securities 
and the 
decrease in 
the unrealized 
losses of 
AFS securities 
of 329.0 million. 
Debt securities 
held-to-maturity 
 decreased by 
 328.7 million 
driven by 
maturities and 
paydowns, partially 
offset by 
the accretion 
of 133.8 
million of 
the discount 
 related to U.S. Treasury 
securities previously reclassified from the 
AFS to HTM.

 Loans 
 Refer to Table 
6 for a 
breakdown of the Corporation s 
loan portfolio. Also, refer 
to Note 7 in 
the Consolidated Financial Statements 
 for detailed information about the Corporation s loan portfolio 
composition and loan purchases and sales. 

 Loans held-in-portfolio 
increased by 
 1.1 billion 
to 36.2 
billion as 
of September 
30, 2024, 
compared to 
December 31, 
2023. The 
 BPPR portfolio increased by 1.2 billion, driven by the growth in the commercial, mortgage 
and auto loan portfolios, and the PB loan 
 portfolio decreased by 0.1 billion, due in part 
by commercial loans payoffs, offset by growth in the 
construction loan portfolio. 
 The Corporation s 
 5.2 billion 
non-owner occupied 
commercial real 
estate portfolio 
is comprised 
of 3.2 
billion in 
BPPR and 
 2.0 
 billion in Popular U.S. and 
is well diversified across a number 
of tenants in different industries 
and segments with exposure to retail 
 (34 
of 
non-owner 
occupied 
CRE), 
hotels 
(19 
and 
office 
space 
(14 
accounting 
for 
two 
thirds 
of 
the 
total 
exposure. 
The 
 approximate 708 million office space 
exposure represents only 2.0 of 
the total loan portfolio 
and is comprised mainly of 
mid-rise 
 properties with diversified tenants with average loan 
size of 2 million across both BPPR and Popular 
U.S. 
 Popular s 2.4 billion commercial multi-family 
portfolio represents approximately 7 of 
total loans and is 
concentrated in New York 
 Metro 1.5 
billion), South Florida 698 million) 
and Puerto Rico 192 
million). In the New York 
Metro region, the Corporation has 
 no exposure to rent controlled buildings. The 
rent stabilized units represent less than 
40 of the total units in 
the loan portfolio with 
 the majority originated after 2019.

and interest 
 payments from 
the fourth

 Total Deposits 
 The Corporation s deposits totaled 63.7 billion as of 
September 30, 2024, compared to 63.6 billion as 
of December 31, 2023. An 
 increase in the P.R. public sector, as well as an increase in interest-bearing deposits, were the main drivers of the 0.1 
billion 
 increase during the period. 

 Excluding 
P.R 
. 
public 
deposits, 
as 
of 
September 
30, 
2024, 
deposits 
amounted 
to 
 45.0 
billion, 
compared 
to 
 45.6 
billion 
as 
of 
 December 
31, 
2023. 
This 
 0.6 
billion 
decrease 
includes 
a 
reduction 
of 
approximately 
 0.9 
billion 
in 
low-cost 
interest-bearing 
 deposits, partially offset by a 0.5 billion increase 
in higher cost interest-bearing deposits, mainly related to time deposits in Popular 
 Bank. 

 In BPPR, deposit 
balances, excluding P.R 
public funds, have been 
impacted during 2023 and 
2024 by outflows driven 
by changes 
 in client 
behavior, 
mainly by 
commercial and 
affluent retail 
clients seeking 
products that 
provide for 
high rates 
in the 
current rate 
 environment, along with significant spending and use 
of balances including the retail client base, which 
had experienced an increase 
 in average deposit balances during the pandemic driven by federal incentives. Notwithstanding this decrease, average retail deposit 
 balances at BPPR are still higher than pre-pandemic 
levels. 
 As 
of 
September 
30, 
2024, 
the 
Puerto 
Rico 
public 
sector 
deposits 
amounted 
to 
 18.7 
billion, 
compared 
to 
 18.1 
billion 
as 
of 
 December 31, 2023. 
 Approximately 29 of the Corporation s deposits as of September 30, 2024 are funds deposited by the Government of Puerto Rico, 
 municipalities and government 
instrumentalities and corporations. P.R 
public sector deposit 
costs are indexed 
to changes in 
short-
 term market 
rates with 
a one-quarter lag, 
in accordance with 
contractual terms. 
During the second 
quarter of 
2024, approximately 
 800 million of low-cost government-related accounts 
managed by our fiduciary services group were 
repriced to market-linked rates. 

156 
 Fluctuations of public sector deposit balances are uncertain 
and difficult to predict. Factors that could impact these 
balances include, 
 but are not limited to, the receipt 
of funds by the Puerto Rico Government from federal 
disaster funding assistance (i.e. hurricane or 
 pandemic related funds) and other events such as seasonal tax collections, actions resulting 
from changes in the financial condition, 
 liquidity 
and 
cash 
management practices 
of 
the 
Puerto 
Rico 
Government and 
its 
instrumentalities, and/or 
the 
implementation of 
 fiscal 
and 
debt 
adjustment 
plans 
approved 
pursuant 
to 
PROMESA 
or 
other 
actions 
mandated 
by 
the 
Fiscal 
Oversight 
and 
 Management 
Board 
for 
Puerto 
Rico 
(the 
 Oversight 
Board ). 
These 
deposits 
require 
that 
the 
bank 
pledge 
high 
credit 
quality 
 securities as collateral; therefore, liquidity risks arising 
from deposit outflows are lower. 
 The volume and cost of public deposits at BPPR and the proportion of high-cost deposits in the U.S, directly impact the balance and 
 mix of earning assets and therefore represent a 
key factor in the Corporation s ability to expand its 
net interest margin.

2024 
compared 
to 
 1.1 
billion 
at 
December

The 
 decrease was mainly due 
to lower assets sold 
under agreements to repurchase and 
lower advances from the 
FHLB. Refer to Note

 CAPITAL 
 Regulatory Capital 
 The Corporation, BPPR and PB 
are subject to regulatory capital 
requirements established by the Federal Reserve Board. 
The risk-

ratio of 
at least 6.5 , 
a Tier

 Pursuant 
to 
the 
adoption 
of 
the 
CECL 
accounting 
standard 
on 
January 
1, 
2020, 
the 
Corporation 
elected 
to 
use 
the 
five-year 
 transition 
period option 
as 
provided in 
the 
final 
interim 
regulatory capital 
rules effective 
March 31, 
2020. 
The 
five-year 
transition 
 period provision delayed for two years the estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital, followed by a three-year transition period 
 to phase 
out the aggregate 
amount of 
the capital benefit 
provided during the 
initial two-year delay. 
As of September 
30, 2024, the 
 Corporation had phased-in 75 of 
the cumulative CECL deferral with 
the remaining impact to 
be recognized over the 
remainder of 
 the three-year transition period.

capital 
ratio 
as 
of 
September 
30, 
2024 
as 
 compared to December 31, 2023 was mainly 
due to the nine months period earnings, 
partially offset by higher risk weighted 
assets 
 driven by 
the increase 
in loans 
held-in-portfolio. The 
increase in 
the leverage 
capital ratio 
was mainly 
due to 
the period 
earnings, 
 partially offset by higher average assets.

 RISK MANAGEMENT 
 Market / Interest Rate Risk 
 The financial results and capital levels of the 
Corporation are constantly exposed to market, interest 
rate and liquidity risks. 
 Market risk 
refers to the 
risk of a 
reduction in the 
Corporation s capital due 
to changes in 
the market valuation 
of its assets 
and/or 
 liabilities. 

 Most of the assets 
subject to market valuation risk 
are debt securities classified as 
available-for-sale. Refer to Notes 5 
and 6 to the 
 Consolidated Financial 
Statements for 
further information 
on the 
debt 
securities available-for-sale 
and 
held-to-maturity portfolios. 
 Debt 
securities 
classified 
as 
available-for-sale 
and 
held-for-sale 
amounted 
to 
 17.2 
billion 
and 
 7.9 
billion, 
respectively, 
as 
of 
 September 
30, 
2024. 
Other 
assets 
subject 
to 
market 
risk 
include 
loans 
held-for-sale, 
which 
amounted 
to 
 6 
million, 
mortgage 
 servicing rights MSRs which amounted to 109 
million, and securities classified as trading , which 
amounted to 31 million, as of 
 September 30, 2024. 

 Interest Rate Risk IRR 
 The Corporation s net interest income is subject 
to various categories of interest rate risk, 
including repricing, basis, yield curve and 
 option risks. 
In managing 
interest rate 
risk, management may 
alter the 
mix of 
floating and 
fixed rate 
assets and 
liabilities, change 
 pricing 
schedules, 
adjust 
maturities 
through 
sales 
and 
purchases 
of 
investment 
securities, 
and 
enter 
into 
derivative 
contracts, 
 among other alternatives. 

 Interest 
rate 
risk 
management 
is 
an 
active 
process 
that 
encompasses 
monitoring 
loan 
and 
deposit 
flows 
complemented 
by 
 investment and funding 
activities. Effective management of 
interest rate risk begins 
with understanding the dynamic 
characteristics 
 of assets and 
liabilities and determining the 
appropriate rate risk position 
given line of 
business forecasts, management objectives, 
 market expectations and policy constraints. 
 Management utilizes various tools to assess IRR, including Net Interest 
Income NII simulation modeling, static gap analysis, and 
 Economic Value 
of Equity EVE ). The 
three methodologies 
complement each 
other and 
are used 
jointly in 
the evaluation 
of the 
 Corporation s IRR. NII 
simulation modeling is 
prepared for a 
five-year period, which 
in conjunction with 
the EVE analysis, 
provides 
 management a better view of long-term IRR. 
 Net interest 
income simulation analysis 
performed by legal 
entity and on 
a consolidated basis 
is a 
tool used 
by the 
Corporation in 
 estimating the 
potential change 
in net 
interest income 
resulting from 
hypothetical changes 
in interest 
rates. Sensitivity 
analysis is 
 calculated using a simulation model which incorporates 
actual balance sheet figures detailed by maturity 
and interest yields or costs. 

 Management assesses 
interest rate 
risk by 
comparing various 
NII simulations 
under different 
interest rate 
scenarios that 
differ in 
 direction of interest 
rate changes, the 
degree of change 
and the projected 
shape of the 
yield curve. For 
example, the types 
of rate 
 scenarios processed during the 
quarter include flat rates, 
implied forwards, and parallel 
and non-parallel rate shocks. 
Management 
 also performs analyses to isolate and measure basis 
and prepayment risk exposures. 

 The asset 
and liability 
management group 
performs validation 
procedures on 
various assumptions 
used as 
part of 
the simulation 
 analyses as well as validations 
of results on a 
monthly basis. In addition, the 
model and processes used to 
assess IRR are subject 
 to independent validations according to the guidelines 
established in the Model Governance and 
Validation policy. 
 The Corporation processes NII 
simulations under interest rate 
scenarios in which the 
yield curve is assumed 
to rise and 
decline by 
 the same magnitude 
(parallel shifts). The 
rate scenarios considered in 
these market risk 
simulations include instantaneous parallel 
 changes of -100, -200, 
+100, and +200 basis points 
during the succeeding twelve-month period. Simulation analyses 
are based on 
 many assumptions, 
including that 
the balance 
sheet remains 
flat, the 
relative levels 
of market 
interest rates 
across all 
yield curve 
 points 
and 
indexes, 
interest 
rate 
spreads, 
loan 
prepayments 
and 
deposit 
elasticity. 
Thus, 
they 
should 
not 
be 
relied 
upon 
as 
 indicative of actual results. Further, the estimates do not 
contemplate actions that management could take to respond to changes in 
 interest rates. Additionally, the Corporation is also subject to basis risk in the repricing of its assets and liabilities, including the basis 
 related to 
using different 
rate indexes 
for the 
repricing of 
assets and 
liabilities, as 
well as 
the effect 
of pricing 
lags which 
may be 
 contractual 
or 
due to 
historical differences 
in the 
timing 
of 
management responses 
to 
changes in 
the rate 
environment. By 
their 
 nature, these forward-looking computations are only estimates and may be different from 
what may actually occur in the future. The 
 following table 
presents the 
results of 
the simulations 
at September 
30, 2024 
and December 
31, 2023, 
assuming a 
static balance 
 sheet and parallel changes over flat spot rates over 
a one-year time horizon:

 As 
of 
September 
30, 
2024, 
NII 
simulations 
show 
the 
Corporation 
maintains 
an 
asset 
sensitive 
position 
that 
is 
slightly 
more 
 pronounced in the rising rates scenarios and closer to neutral 
in the declining scenarios as compared to the results as 
of December 
 31, 
2023. 
The 
primary 
reasons 
for 
the 
variation 
in 
sensitivity 
are 
changes 
in 
balance 
sheet 
composition 
primarily 
driven 
by 
an 
 increase in short-term U.S Treasury 
Bills T- 
Bills as well as 
higher loan balances, partially offset 
by an increase in market-linked 
 Puerto 
Rico 
public 
sector 
deposits 
and 
a 
reduction 
in 
overnight 
Fed 
Funds. 
These 
results 
suggest 
that 
fluctuations 
in 
the 
 Corporation s net interest income sensitivity are primarily driven by changes in the composition of the investment portfolio as well as 
 the 
level 
of 
loan 
balances. 
During 
the 
quarter 
ended 
on 
September 
30, 
2024, 
the 
Corporation 
began 
to 
reinvest 
some 
of 
the 
 proceeds of the 
maturing portfolio into U.S 
Treasury Notes with 
average maturities between 2 
to 3 years. 
Additionally, variations 
in 
 liability 
cost, 
primarily 
driven 
by 
Puerto 
Rico 
public 
sector 
deposits 
that 
represented 
 18.7 
billion 
or 
29 
of 
deposits 
as 
of 
 September 30, 
2024, as 
well as 
changes in 
the composition 
and mix 
of deposits, 
also 
impact the 
sensitivity profile. 
In the 
more 
 extreme declining rate scenarios, net interest income would be affected as the repricing of short-term assets and variable rate loans 
 slightly 
exceeds 
the 
benefit 
in 
cost 
reduction 
of 
these 
deposits. 
In 
rising 
rate 
scenarios, 
Popular s 
net 
interest 
income 
is 
also 
 impacted by its large proportion 
of Puerto Rico public sector 
deposit, however the repricing of assets 
as they either reset 
or mature 
 lead to an increase in net interest income. 
 The Corporation s 
loan and 
investment portfolios 
are subject 
to 
prepayment risk, 
which results 
from the 
ability of 
a third-party 
to 
 repay debt 
obligations prior 
to maturity. 
Prepayment risk 
also could 
have a 
significant impact 
on the 
duration of 
mortgage-backed 
 securities 
and 
collateralized 
mortgage 
obligations 
since 
prepayments 
could 
shorten 
(or 
lower 
prepayments 
could 
extend) 
the 
 weighted average life of these portfolios.
 Trading 

 The Corporation 
engages in 
trading activities 
in the 
ordinary course 
of business 
at its 
subsidiaries, BPPR 
and Popular 
Securities. 
 Popular Securities 
trading activities 
consist primarily 
of market-making 
activities to 
meet expected 
customers needs 
related to 
its 
 retail brokerage business, 
and purchases and sales of U.S. Government and 
government sponsored securities with the objective of 
 realizing gains 
from expected 
short-term price 
movements. BPPR s 
trading activities consist 
primarily of 
holding U.S. 
Government 
 sponsored 
mortgage-backed securities 
classified 
as 
 trading and 
hedging 
the 
related 
market 
risk 
with 
 TBA 
(to-be-announced) 
 market 
transactions. 
The 
objective 
is 
to 
derive 
spread 
income 
from 
the 
portfolio 
and 
not 
to 
benefit 
from 
short-term 
market 
 movements. In 
addition, BPPR 
uses forward 
contracts or 
TBAs to 
hedge its 
securitization pipeline. 
Risks related 
to variations 
in 
 interest rates 
and market volatility 
are hedged 
with TBAs 
that have 
characteristics similar to 
that of 
the forecasted security 
and its 
 conversion timeline. 
 At September 30, 2024, the Corporation held trading securities 
with a fair value of 31 million, representing approximately 0.04 
of 
 the Corporation s total assets, compared with 32 million and 
0.05 , respectively, at December 31, 2023. As shown in Table 12, the 
 trading 
portfolio 
consists 
principally 
of 
mortgage-backed 
securities 
and 
U.S. 
Treasuries, 
which 
at 
September 
30, 
2024 
were 
 investment grade securities.

 The Corporation s trading activities are limited by internal policies. 
For each of the three subsidiaries, the market risk 
assumed under 
 trading 
activities 
is 
measured 
by 
the 
5-day 
net 
value-at-risk VAR ), 
with 
a 
confidence 
level 
of 
99 . 
The 
VAR 
measures 
the 
 maximum estimated loss that may occur over a 
5-day holding period, given a 99 probability. 

 The Corporation s trading portfolio had a 5-day VAR of approximately 0.5 million for the last week in September 2024. 
VAR models 
 include 
assumptions and 
estimates thus 
actual 
results could 
differ 
from 
the 
outputs from 
these 
models 
and 
assumptions. Back-
 testing is performed on model 
results to compare actual results 
against maximum estimated losses, in order 
to evaluate model and 
 assumptions accuracy. 

 In the opinion of management, the size and composition 
of the trading portfolio does not represent 
a significant source of market risk 
 for the Corporation. 
 Liquidity Sources and Risk 
 The 
objective 
of 
effective 
liquidity 
management 
is 
to 
ensure 
that 
the 
Corporation 
has 
sufficient 
liquidity 
to 
meet 
all 
its 
financial 
 obligations, finance 
expected future 
growth, 
fund 
planned capital 
distributions and 
maintain a 
reasonable safety 
margin for 
cash 
 needs under 
both normal 
and stressed market 
conditions. The Board 
of Directors 
is responsible 
for establishing the 
Corporation s 
 tolerance for liquidity risk, 
including approving relevant risk limits and 
policies. The Board of 
Directors has delegated the monitoring 
 of these risks to the Board s Risk Management Committee 
and the Asset/Liability Management Committee. 

 An 
institution s liquidity 
may be 
pressured if, 
for example, 
it experiences 
a sudden 
and unexpected 
substantial cash 
outflow due 
 deposit 
outflows, 
whether due 
to 
a 
loss 
of confidence 
by 
depositors, or 
other 
reasons, including 
exogenous events 
such 
as 
the 
 COVID-19 pandemic, 
a downgrading 
of its 
credit rating, 
or some 
other event 
that causes 
counterparties to 
avoid exposure 
to the 
 institution. Factors 
that the 
Corporation does 
not control, 
such 
as the 
economic outlook, 
adverse ratings 
of its 
principal markets, 
 perceptions of the financial services industry and regulatory 
changes, could also affect its ability to obtain 
funding. 

 The Corporation 
has adopted 
policies and 
limits to 
monitor the 
Corporation s liquidity 
position and 
that of 
its banking 
subsidiaries. 
 Additionally, 
contingency funding 
plans are 
used to 
model various 
stressful events 
of different 
magnitudes and 
affecting different 
 time horizons 
that assist 
management in 
evaluating the size 
of the 
liquidity buffers 
needed if 
those stress 
events occur. 
However, 
 such models 
may not 
predict accurately 
how the 
market and 
customers might 
react to 
every event 
and are 
dependent on 
many 
 assumptions. 
 Deposits, including 
customer deposits, 
brokered deposits 
and public 
funds deposits, 
continue to 
be the 
most significant 
source of 
 funds for 
the Corporation, 
funding 89 
of the 
Corporation s total 
assets at 
September 30, 
2024 and 
90 at 
December 31, 
2023. 

 The 
ratio 
of 
total 
ending 
loans 
to 
deposits 
was 
57 
at 
September 
30, 
2024 
and 
55 
at 
December 
31, 
2023. 
In 
addition 
to 
 traditional deposits, the Corporation maintains borrowing 
arrangements, which amounted to approximately 
 1.0 billion in outstanding 
 balances 
at 
September 
30, 
2024 
(December 
31, 
2023 
- 
 1.1 
billion). 
A 
detailed 
description 
of 
the 
Corporation s 
borrowings, 
 including their terms, 
is included in 
Note 15 
to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Also, the 
Consolidated Statements of 
Cash 
 Flows in the accompanying Consolidated Financial 
Statements provide information on the Corporation s cash 
inflows and outflows.

 The importance of 
the Puerto Rico 
market for the 
Corporation is an 
additional risk factor 
that could affect 
its financing activities. 
In 
 the case 
of a 
deterioration in 
the outlook 
and/or credit 
ratings of 
its principal 
markets and/or 
due to 
regulatory changes 
and fiscal 
 conditions in 
Puerto Rico 
that are 
outside the 
control of 
the Corporation, 
the credit 
quality of 
the Corporation 
could be 
adversely 
 affected and result in higher credit costs. These adverse 
events could also affect the Corporation s ability to obtain 
funding. 
 To 
plan for the possibility of 
such a scenario, management adopted contingency 
plans to address events that could 
limit or partially 
 limit important 
sources of 
funds that 
are usually 
fully available 
for use. 
These plans 
call for 
using alternate 
funding mechanisms, 
 such as the 
pledging of certain 
asset classes and accessing 
secured credit lines 
and loan facilities 
put in place 
with the FHLB 
and 
 the 
FRB. The 
Corporation is 
subject to 
positive tangible 
capital 
requirements to 
utilize secured 
loan facilities 
with the 
FHLB that 
 could 
result 
in 
a 
limitation 
of 
borrowing 
amounts 
or 
maturity 
terms, 
even 
if 
the 
Corporation 
exceeds 
well-capitalized 
regulatory 
 capital levels. 

 The credit 
ratings of 
Popular s debt 
obligations are 
a relevant 
factor for 
liquidity because 
they impact 
the Corporation s 
ability to 
 borrow 
in 
the 
capital 
markets, 
its 
cost 
and 
access 
to 
funding 
sources. 
Credit 
ratings 
are 
based 
on 
the 
financial 
strength, 
credit 
 quality and 
concentrations in 
the loan 
portfolio, the 
level and 
volatility of 
earnings, capital 
adequacy, 
the quality 
of management, 
 geographic concentration 
in Puerto 
Rico, the 
liquidity of 
the balance 
sheet, the 
availability of 
a significant 
base of 
core retail 
and 
 commercial deposits, and the Corporation s ability to access 
a broad array of wholesale funding sources, 
among other factors. 

 Furthermore, 
various 
statutory 
provisions 
limit 
the 
amount 
of 
dividends 
an 
insured 
depository 
institution 
may 
pay 
to 
its 
holding 
 company without 
regulatory approval. A 
member bank must 
obtain the 
approval of 
the Federal 
Reserve Board 
for any 
dividend, if 
 the total of all dividends declared by the member 
bank during the calendar year would exceed 
the combined net income for that year 
 and the retained net income for 
the preceding two years, net of 
those years dividend activity, 
less any required transfers to surplus 
 or to a 
fund for the 
retirement of any 
preferred stock. In 
addition, a member 
bank may not 
declare or pay 
a dividend in 
an amount 
 greater 
than 
its 
undivided 
profits 
as 
reported 
in 
its 
Report 
of 
Condition and 
Income, 
unless 
the 
member 
bank 
has 
received 
the 
 approval of 
the Federal 
Reserve Board. A 
member bank also 
may not permit 
any portion of 
its permanent capital 
to be 
withdrawn 
 unless the withdrawal has been approved by 
the Federal Reserve Board. The ability of 
a bank subsidiary to up-stream dividends to 
 its BHC 
could thus 
be impacted 
by its 
financial performance 
and capital, 
including tangible 
and regulatory 
capital, thus 
potentially 
 limiting the 
amount of 
cash moving 
up to 
the BHCs 
from 
the banking 
subsidiaries. This 
could, 
in turn, 
affect 
the BHCs 
ability to 
 declare 
dividends 
on 
its 
outstanding 
common 
and 
preferred 
stock, 
repurchase 
its 
securities 
or 
meet 
its 
debt 
obligations, 
for 
 example. 
 The 
following 
sections 
provide 
further 
information 
on 
the 
Corporation s 
major 
funding 
activities 
and 
needs, 
as 
well 
as 
the 
risks 
 involved in these activities. 
 Banking Subsidiaries 
 Primary 
sources of 
funding 
for the 
Corporation s 
banking subsidiaries 
(BPPR and 
PB 
or, 
collectively, 
 the banking 
subsidiaries 
 include 
retail, 
commercial 
and 
public 
sector 
deposits, 
brokered 
deposits, 
unpledged 
investment 
securities, 
mortgage 
loan 
 securitization and, to a lesser extent, loan sales. 

 Refer to Table 8 in this MD A section for a breakdown of deposits by major types. Core deposits are generated 
from a large base of 
 consumer, corporate and 
public sector customers. Core deposits 
include certificates of deposit 
under 250,000, all interest-bearing 
 transactional deposit accounts, 
non-interest bearing deposits, 
and savings deposits. 
Core deposits exclude 
brokered deposits and 
 certificates 
of 
deposit 
over 
 250,000. 
Core 
deposits, 
excluding 
P.R. 
public 
funds 
that 
are 
fully 
collateralized, 
have 
historically 
 provided the Corporation 
with a sizable source 
of low-cost funds. P.R. 
public funds, while 
linked to market 
interest rates, provide 
a 
 stable source of funding 
with attractive earnings spread. Core 
deposits totaled 60.3 billion, or 
95 of total deposits, 
at September 
 30, 
2024, 
compared 
with 
 59.0 
billion, 
or 
93 
of 
total 
deposits, 
at 
December 
31, 
2023. 
Core 
deposits 
financed 
89 
of 
the 
 Corporation s earning assets at September 30, 2024, compared 
with 88 at December 31, 2023. 
 In addition, the Corporation maintains borrowing facilities with the FHLB and at the discount window of the Federal Reserve Bank of 
 New York (the FRB and has a considerable amount of collateral pledged 
that can be used to raise funds under these 
facilities. 

 During the third quarter of 2024 the 
Corporation had no material incremental use of its 
available liquidity sources. At September 30, 
 2024, the Corporation s available liquidity increased to 
 20.5 billion from 19.5 billion 
on December 31, 2023. The liquidity sources 
 of the Corporation at September 30, 2024 are 
presented in Table 13 below:

to 
the 
Consolidated 
Financial 
Statements 
for 
additional 
information 
of 
the 
Corporation s 
borrowing 
facilities 
 available through its banking subsidiaries. 

 The principal 
uses of 
funds for 
the banking 
subsidiaries include 
loan originations, 
investment portfolio 
purchases, loan 
purchases 
 and repurchases, repayment of outstanding obligations (including deposits), advances on certain serviced portfolios and operational 
 expenses. Also, the 
banking subsidiaries assume liquidity 
risk related to collateral 
posting requirements for certain 
activities mainly 
 in 
connection 
with 
contractual 
commitments, 
recourse 
provisions, 
servicing 
advances, 
derivatives 
and 
credit 
card 
licensing 
 agreements. 

 The banking 
subsidiaries maintain 
sufficient funding 
capacity to 
address large 
increases in 
funding requirements 
such as 
deposit 
 outflows. 
The 
Corporation has 
established 
liquidity 
guidelines 
that 
require 
the 
banking 
subsidiaries 
to 
have 
sufficient 
liquidity 
to 
 cover all short-term borrowings and a portion of deposits. 

 The Corporation s ability to compete 
successfully in the marketplace for 
deposits, excluding brokered deposits, depends on various 
 factors, including pricing, service, convenience 
and financial stability as 
reflected by operating results and 
financial condition, credit 
 ratings (by 
nationally recognized credit 
rating agencies), customer 
confidence, and 
importantly, 
FDIC deposit 
insurance coverage. 
 Deposits at all of the Corporation s banking subsidiaries are federally insured 
(subject to FDIC limits) and this is expected to mitigate 
 the potential effect of the aforementioned risks. 
 The distribution by maturity 
of certificates of deposit 
with denominations of 250,000 
and over at September 
30, 2024 is 
presented 
 in the table that follows:

 The Corporation had 
 1.7 billion in 
brokered deposits at September 
30, 2024, which 
financed approximately 
2 of its 
total assets 
 (December 31, 2023 - 
 1.7 billion and 2 , 
respectively). 
In the event that 
any of the Corporation s 
banking subsidiaries regulatory 
 capital 
ratios fall 
below those 
required by 
a 
well-capitalized institution 
or 
are 
subject 
to 
capital 
restrictions by 
the 
regulators, the 
 Corporation would be 
at risk that 
such banking subsidiary 
would not be 
able to raise 
or maintain brokered deposits 
and could also 
 face limitations 
on the 
rate paid 
on deposits, 
which may 
hinder the 
Corporation s ability 
to effectively 
compete in 
its retail 
markets 
 and could affect its deposit raising efforts. 

 Deposits from the public sector 
represent an important source of 
funds for the Corporation. 
As of September 30, 
2024, total Puerto 
 Rico 
public sector 
deposits were 
 18.7 billion, 
compared to 
 18.1 billion 
at December 
31, 2023. 
These deposits 
require that 
the 

166 
 bank pledges 
high credit quality securities as collateral; 
therefore, liquidity risks arising from public sector deposit outflows are lower 
 given 
that 
the 
bank 
receives 
its 
collateral 
in 
return. 
This, 
now 
unpledged, 
collateral 
can 
either 
be 
financed 
via 
repurchase 
 agreements 
or 
sold 
for 
cash. 
However, 
timing 
differences 
between the 
time 
the 
deposit 
outflow and 
when the 
bank 
receives 
its 
 collateral may occur. Additionally, 
the Corporation uses fixed-rate U.S. Treasury 
debt securities as collateral that have limited 
credit 
 risk, 
but 
are 
nonetheless 
subject 
to 
market 
value 
risk 
based 
on 
changes 
in 
the 
interest 
rate 
environment. 
When 
interest 
rates 
 increase, the value of this collateral decreases and could result in the Corporation having to provide additional collateral to cover the 
 same 
amount 
of 
deposit 
liabilities. 
This 
additional 
collateral 
could 
reduce 
unpledged 
securities 
otherwise 
available 
as 
liquidity 
 sources to the Corporation. 

 As of September 30, 2024, management believes that the banking subsidiaries had sufficient current and projected liquidity sources 
 to meet their anticipated cash flow 
obligations, as well as special 
needs and off-balance sheet commitments, in the 
ordinary course 
 of business. 
Management also believes that 
as of September 
30, 2024 its 
banking subsidiaries have sufficient 
liquidity current and 
 projected 
resources to 
address an 
event 
that 
would stress 
the 
Corporation s liquidity 
position. Although 
the 
banking subsidiaries 
 have 
historically 
been 
able 
to 
replace 
maturing 
deposits 
and 
advances, 
no 
assurance can 
be 
given 
that 
they 
would 
be 
able 
to 
 replace 
those 
funds 
in 
the 
future 
if 
the 
Corporation s 
financial 
condition 
or 
general 
market 
conditions 
were 
to 
deteriorate. 
The 
 Corporation s financial flexibility will be severely constrained if the banking 
subsidiaries are unable to maintain access to funding or if 
 adequate financing is not 
available to accommodate future financing 
needs at acceptable interest 
rates. The Corporation s banking 
 subsidiaries have to 
meet margin requirements 
on repurchase agreements 
and other collateralized 
borrowing facilities that 
include 
 certain required 
levels of 
cash deposits 
and qualifying 
securities. To 
the extent 
that the 
value of 
securities previously 
pledged as 
 collateral declines below such required 
amounts because of market changes, the 
Corporation is required to deposit additional 
cash 
 or securities 
to meet 
its margin 
requirements, thereby 
adversely affecting 
its liquidity. 
Finally, 
to the 
extent the 
Corporation relies 
 more heavily on more 
expensive funding sources in order 
to meet its future 
growth, revenues may not 
increase in a manner 
that is 
 proportionate to cover these costs. In this case, the Corporation s 
profitability would be adversely effected. 
 The Corporation 
monitors uninsured 
deposits under 
applicable FDIC 
regulations. 
Additionally, 
the Corporation 
monitors accounts 
 with balances over 250,000. 
While the Corporation has a 
diverse deposit base from retail, commercial, 
corporate and government 
 clients, 
as 
well 
as 
wholesale funding 
sources such 
as 
brokered deposits, 
it 
considers 
balance 
in 
excess 
of 
 250,000 to 
have a 
 higher 
potential 
liquidity 
risk. 
Table 
15 
reflects 
the 
aggregate 
balance 
in 
deposit 
accounts 
in 
excess 
of 
 250,000, 
including 
 collateralized public funds and deposits outside of the 
U.S. and its territories. 
Collateralized public funds, as presented in Table 
15, 
 represent public 
deposit balances 
from governmental 
entities in 
the U.S. 
and its 
territories, including 
Puerto Rico 
and the 
United 
 States Virgin Islands, collateralized based on such jurisdictions 
applicable collateral requirements. 

 On September 
30, 2024, 
deposits with 
balances in 
excess of 
 250,000, excluding 
foreign deposits 
(mainly deposits 
in the 
British 
 Virgin Islands) intercompany deposits and collateralized public funds, were 9.8 billion or

 are subject to various regulatory limits 
and authorization requirements that are further described 
below and that may limit the 
ability 
 of those subsidiaries to act as a source of 
funding to the BHCs. 
 The 
principal 
uses 
of 
these 
funds 
include 
the 
repayment 
of 
debt, 
and 
interest 
payments 
to 
holders 
of 
senior 
debt 
and 
junior 
 subordinated 
deferrable 
interest 
(related 
to 
trust 
preferred 
securities), 
the 
payment 
of 
dividends 
to 
common 
stockholders, 
 repurchases of the Corporation s securities and capitalizing its 
banking subsidiaries. 

 On 
July 
24, 
2024, 
the 
Corporation 
announced 
the 
authorization 
for 
a 
common 
stock 
repurchase 
of 
up 
to 
 500 
million. 
The 
 Corporation s planned common stock repurchases may 
be executed in open market 
transactions, privately negotiated transactions, 
 block trades or any other manner determined 
by the Corporation. The timing, quantity and price of 
such repurchases will be subject 
 to 
various factors, 
including market 
conditions, the 
Corporation s capital 
position and 
financial performance, 
the capital 
impact of 
 strategic initiatives and regulatory and tax considerations. The common stock repurchase program does not 
require the Corporation 
 to acquire 
a specific 
dollar amount 
or number 
of shares 
and may 
be modified, 
suspended or 
terminated at 
any time 
without prior 
 notice. During 
the quarter 
ended September 
30, 2024, 
the Corporation 
completed the 
repurchase of 
599,096 shares 
of common 
 stock 
for 
 58.8 million 
at 
an average 
price 
of 
 98.11 
per share, 
under the 
previously announced 
 500 million 
share 
repurchase 
 authorization. 

 The 
outstanding 
balance 
of 
notes 
payable 
at 
the 
BHCs 
amounted 
to 
 593 
million 
at 
September 
30, 
2024 
and 
 592 
million 
at 
 December 31, 2023. 

168 
 The contractual maturities of the BHCs notes payable 
at September 30, 2024 are presented in Table 16.

 (In thousands)

 Later years 
 198,366 
 Total 
 
 593,281 
 As of 
September 30, 
2024, the 
BHCs had 
cash and 
money markets 
investments totaling 
 689 million 
and borrowing 
potential of 
 165 million from its secured facility with BPPR. 
The BHCs 
liquidity position continues to be adequate with sufficient cash 
on hand, 
 investments and 
other sources of 
liquidity that are 
expected to be 
sufficient to 
meet all 
interest payments and 
dividend obligations 
 for the foreseeable future. 
Additionally, the Corporation s 
latest quarterly dividend was 0.62 per share 
or approximately 45 million 
 per quarter. 
 The BHCs have in 
the past borrowed in the 
corporate debt market primarily to finance 
their non-banking subsidiaries and refinance 
 debt obligations. The issuance of corporate debt as 
a source of funding is likely more 
costly due to the fact that 
two out of the three 
 principal credit 
rating agencies 
rate the 
Corporation below 
 investment grade , 
which affects 
the Corporation s 
cost 
and ability 
to 
 raise 
funds 
in 
the 
capital 
markets. 
Factors 
that 
the 
Corporation 
does 
not 
control, 
such 
as 
the 
economic 
outlook, 
interest 
rate 
 volatility, 
inflation, disruptions in 
the debt market, 
among others, could 
also affect 
its ability to 
obtain funding. The 
Corporation has 
 an 
automatic 
shelf 
registration 
statement 
filed 
and 
effective 
with 
the 
Securities 
and 
Exchange 
Commission, 
which 
permits 
the 
 Corporation to issue an unspecified amount of debt 
or equity securities. 
 Non-Banking Subsidiaries 
 The 
principal 
sources 
of 
funding 
for 
the 
non-banking 
subsidiaries 
include 
internally 
generated 
cash 
flows 
from 
operations, 
loan 
 sales, repurchase agreements, capital 
injections and borrowed funds 
from their direct 
parent companies or the 
holding companies. 
 The principal uses of funds for the non-banking 
subsidiaries include repayment of maturing debt, 
operational expenses and payment 
 of dividends to the 
BHCs. The liquidity needs 
of the non-banking subsidiaries 
are minimal since most 
of them are 
funded internally 
 from operating 
cash flows 
or from 
intercompany borrowings or 
capital contributions 
from their 
holding companies. 
During the 
nine 
 months 
ended 
September 
30, 
2024, 
Popular, 
Inc. 
made 
capital 
contributions 
of 
 1.3 
million 
to 
Popular 
Impact 
Fund, 
its 
wholly 
 owned subsidiary. 
 Dividends 
 During 
the 
nine 
months 
ended 
September 
30, 
2024, 
the 
Corporation 
declared 
cash 
dividends 
of 
 1.86 
per 
common 
share 
 outstanding 134.3 million in the aggregate). The dividends for the Corporation s Series A preferred 
stock amounted to 1.1 million. 
 On July 24, 2024, the corporation announced an increase in the Corporation s quarterly common stock dividend from 0.62 to 0.70 
 per share, commencing with 
the dividend payable in 
the first quarter of 
2025, subject to the 
approval by the Corporation s 
Board of 
 Directors. 
 During the nine months 
ended September 30, 2024, the 
BHCs received dividends and 
distributions amounting to 450 million 
from 
 BPPR, 
 50 
million 
from 
PNA 
and 
 23 
million 
from 
its 
other 
non-banking 
subsidiaries. Dividends 
from 
BPPR 
constitute 
Popular, 
 Inc. s primary 
source of 
liquidity. 
In addition, 
during the 
nine months 
ended September 
30, 2024, 
Popular International 
Bank Inc., 
 wholly 
owned 
subsidiary 
of 
Popular, 
Inc., 
received 
 19.4 
million 
in 
cash 
dividends 
and 
 2.9 
million 
in 
stock 
dividends 
from 
its 
 investment in BHD. 
 Other Funding Sources and Capital 
 In addition to cash reserves held at the FRB that totaled 6.5 billion 
at September 30, 2024, the debt securities portfolio provides an 
 additional 
source 
of 
liquidity, 
which 
may 
be 
realized 
through 
either 
securities 
sales, 
collateralized 
borrowings 
or 
repurchase 
 agreements. 
The 
Corporation s 
debt 
securities 
portfolio 
consists 
primarily 
of 
liquid 
U.S. 
government 
debt 
securities, 
U.S. 
 government 
sponsored 
agency 
debt 
securities, 
U.S. 
government 
sponsored 
agency 
mortgage-backed 
securities, 
and 
U.S. 
 government 
sponsored 
agency 
collateralized 
mortgage 
obligations 
that 
can 
be 
used 
to 
raise 
funds 
in 
the 
repo 
markets. 
The 
 availability 
of 
the 
repurchase 
agreement 
would 
be 
subject 
to 
having 
sufficient 
unpledged 
collateral 
available 
at 
the 
time 
the 
 transactions 
are 
consummated, 
in 
addition 
to 
overall 
liquidity 
and 
risk 
appetite 
of 
the 
various 
counterparties. 
The 
Corporation s 
 unpledged debt 
securities amounted 
to 
 4.2 
billion at 
September 30, 
2024 and 
 4.6 billion 
December 31, 
2023 as 
discussed in 

169 
 Table 
13. A substantial portion of these 
debt securities could be used to raise 
financing in the U.S. money markets 
or from secured 
 lending sources, 
subject to changes in their fair market value and customary adjustments 
(haircuts). 

 Additional liquidity may 
be provided through 
loan maturities, prepayments 
and sales. The 
loan portfolio can 
also be used 
to obtain 
 funding in the capital 
markets. Mortgage loans and some 
types of consumer loans, 
have secondary markets which the 
Corporation 
 could use. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Other Commitments 
 In the ordinary course 
of business, the Corporation 
engages in financial transactions that 
are not recorded on 
the balance sheet or 
 may be recorded on the balance sheet in amounts that are different than the full contract or notional amount of the transaction. As a 
 provider of 
financial services, 
the Corporation 
routinely enters 
into commitments 
with off-balance 
sheet risk 
to meet 
the financial 
 needs of 
its customers. These 
commitments may include 
loan commitments and 
standby letters of 
credit. These commitments 
are 
 subject 
to 
the 
same 
credit 
policies 
and 
approval 
process 
used 
for 
on-balance 
sheet 
instruments. 
These 
instruments 
involve, 
to 
 varying degrees, elements 
of credit and 
interest rate risk 
in excess of 
the amount recognized 
in the statement 
of financial position. 
 Refer to 
Note 20 
to the 
Consolidated Financial 
Statements for 
information on 
the Corporation s 
commitments to 
extent credit 
and 
 other non-credit commitments. 

 Other types 
of off-balance 
sheet arrangements 
that the 
Corporation enters 
in the 
ordinary course 
of business 
include derivatives, 
 operating 
leases 
and 
provision 
of 
guarantees, 
indemnifications, 
and 
representation 
and 
warranties. 
Refer 
to 
Note 
27 
to 
the 
 Consolidated 
Financial 
Statements 
for 
more 
information 
on 
operating 
leases 
and 
to 
Note 
19 
to 
the 
Consolidated 
Financial 
 Statements for 
a detailed 
discussion related 
to the 
Corporation s guarantees, 
indemnifications, and 
representation and 
warranties 
 arrangements. 

 The Corporation monitors its cash requirements, including 
its contractual obligations and debt commitments. 

 FDIC Special Assessments 

 On 
November 
16, 
2023, 
the 
Federal 
Deposit 
Insurance 
Corporation FDIC 
approved 
a 
final 
rule 
that 
imposes 
a 
special 
 assessment (the FDIC 
Special Assessment to recover 
the losses to 
the deposit insurance 
fund resulting from 
the FDIC s use, 
in 
 March 
2023, 
of 
the 
systemic 
risk 
exception. In 
connection with 
this assessment, 
the 
Corporation recorded 
an 
expense of 
 71.4 
 million, 45.3 million net of tax, 
in the fourth quarter of 2023, 
representing the full amount of the 
estimated assessment at that time. 
 The 
special 
assessment 
amount 
and 
collection 
period 
may 
change 
as 
the 
estimated 
loss 
is 
periodically 
adjusted 
or 
if 
the 
total 
 amount collected varies. As 
a result, the Corporation 
recorded an additional expense 
of 14.3 million, 9.1 
million net of tax, 
in the 
 first quarter of 2024, based on the updated 
loss estimates. 
 Financial Information of Guarantor and Issuers of Registered

issued 
junior 
subordinated 
debentures 
guaranteed 
by 
PIHC 
(together 
with 
PNA, 
the 
 obligor 
group 
purchased 
by 
 statutory trusts 
established by 
the Corporation. 
These debentures 
were purchased 
by the 
statutory trust 
using the 
proceeds from 
 trust preferred securities issued to the public (referred to as 
 capital securities ), together with the proceeds of the related issuances 
 of common securities of the trusts. 
 PIHC 
fully 
and 
unconditionally 
guarantees 
the 
junior 
subordinated 
debentures 
issued 
by 
PNA. 
PIHC s 
obligation 
to 
make 
a 
 guaranteed 
payment may be satisfied by direct payment of the required 
amounts to the holders of the applicable capital securities or 
 by causing the applicable trust to pay such amounts to such holders. Each guarantee does not apply to any payment of distributions 
 by 
the 
applicable 
trust 
except 
to 
the 
extent 
such 
trust 
has 
funds 
available 
for 
such 
payments. 
If 
PIHC 
does 
not 
make 
interest 
 payments on the 
debentures held by such 
trust, such trust 
will not pay 
distributions on the applicable 
capital securities and 
will not 
 have 
funds 
available

such 
payments. 
PIHC s 
guarantee

ranks 
 subordinate and junior in 
right of payment to 
all the PIHC s other 
liabilities in the same manner 
as the applicable debentures as 
set 

170 
 forth in the applicable indentures and equally with all other guarantees 
that the PIHC issues. The guarantee constitutes a guarantee 
 of 
payment 
and 
not 
of 
collection, 
which means 
that 
the 
guaranteed party 
may 
sue 
the 
guarantor to 
enforce its 
rights 
under the 
 respective guarantee without suing any other person 
or entity. 
 The 
principal 
sources 
of

 In 
addition to 
the 
dividend income 
reflected 
in the 
Statement of 
Operations table 
above, during 
the nine 
months 
ended 
 September 30, 2024, the obligor 
group recorded a 67.4 million of 
capital distributions from non-obligor subsidiaries which 
 were in an accumulated loss position and accordingly 
were recorded as a reduction to the investments. 

172 
 During the nine 
months ended September 
30, 2024, BPPR 
declared cash dividends 
of 450 million 
to PIHC. As 
of September 30, 
 2024, BPPR 
can declare 
a dividend 
of approximately 
 377 million 
without prior 
approval of 
the Federal 
Reserve Board 
due to 
its 
 retained 
income, 
declared 
dividend 
activity 
and 
transfers 
to 
statutory 
reserves 
over 
the 
measurement 
period. 
Pursuant 
to 
the 
 requirements listed above, 
PB may not 
declare or pay 
a dividend without 
the prior approval 
of the Federal 
Reserve Board and 
the 
 New York State Department of Financial Services. 
 The Corporation s banking subsidiaries have historically not 
used unsecured capital market borrowings to finance 
its operations, and 
 therefore are less sensitive to the level and 
changes in the Corporation s overall credit ratings. 
 Refer to the 
Geographic and Government Risk section 
of this MD A for 
some highlights on the 
status of the Puerto 
Rico economy 
 and the ongoing fiscal crisis. 
 Obligations Subject to Rating Triggers or Collateral Requirements 
 The 
Corporation s 
banking 
subsidiaries 
currently 
do 
not 
issue 
unsecured 
senior 
debt, 
as 
these 
banking 
subsidiaries 
are 
funded 
 primarily with 
deposits and secured 
borrowings. The banking 
subsidiaries had 
 6.6 million in 
deposits at 
September 30, 2024 
that 
 are subject to rating triggers. 

 In addition, 
certain mortgage servicing 
and custodial agreements 
that BPPR 
has with 
third parties 
include rating covenants. 
In the 
 event of a credit rating downgrade, the third parties have the right to require the institution to engage a substitute cash custodian for 
 escrow deposits and/or increase collateral levels 
securing the recourse obligations. 

 As discussed 
in Note 
19 to 
the Consolidated Financial 
Statements, the Corporation 
services residential mortgage 
loans subject 
to 
 credit 
recourse 
provisions. 
Certain 
contractual 
agreements 
require 
the 
Corporation 
to 
post 
collateral 
to 
secure 
such 
recourse 
 obligations if 
the institution s 
required credit 
ratings are 
not maintained. 
Collateral pledged 
by the 
Corporation to 
secure recourse 
 obligations amounted 
to approximately 
 25.7 million 
at September 30, 
2024. The 
Corporation could be 
required to 
post additional 
 collateral under the 
agreements. Management expects that 
it would be 
able to meet 
additional collateral requirements if 
and when 
 needed. The requirements to post collateral under certain agreements or the loss of escrow deposits could reduce the Corporation s 
 liquidity resources and impact its operating results.
 Credit Risk 
 Geographic and Government Risk 

 The Corporation is exposed to geographic and government risk. 
The Corporation s assets and revenue composition by geographical 
 area and by business segment reporting are presented 
in Note 32 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Commonwealth of Puerto Rico 
 A 
significant portion 
of 
our financial 
activities and 
credit 
exposure is 
concentrated in 
the 
Commonwealth of 
Puerto Rico Puerto 
 Rico ), which has faced severe economic and fiscal 
challenges in the past and may face additional 
challenges in the future. 

 Economic Performance. 

 Puerto 
Rico s 
economy suffered 
a 
severe and 
prolonged recession 
from 
2007 
to 
2017, 
with real 
gross national 
product GNP 
 contracting approximately 15 
during this period. 
In 2017, Hurricane 
Mar a caused significant 
damage and destruction 
across the 
 island, resulting in further economic contraction. Puerto Rico s 
economy has been gradually recovering since 2018, in 
part aided by 
 the large amount 
of federal disaster 
relief and recovery 
assistance funds injected 
into the Puerto 
Rico economy in 
connection with 
 Hurricane Mar a 
and other 
recent natural 
disasters. This 
growth was 
interrupted by 
the economic 
shock caused 
by the 
COVID-19 
 pandemic in 2020, but has since resumed, in part 
aided by additional federal assistance from 
pandemic-related stimulus measures. 
 The 
latest 
Puerto 
Rico 
Economic Activity 
Index, 
published 
by 
the 
Economic 
Development Bank 
for 
Puerto 
Rico 
(the 
 Economic 
 Activity 
Index ), 
reflected 
a 
0.8 
year-over-year 
decline 
and 
a 
0.1 
month-over-month 
decline 
in 
August 
2024. 
The 
Economic 
 Activity Index 
is a 
coincident indicator 
of 
ongoing economic 
activity but 
not a 
direct measurement 
of 
real GNP. 
The Puerto 
Rico 

173 
 Planning Board estimates that Puerto Rico s 
real GNP grew 2.8 during fiscal 
year 2024 (July 2023-June 2024) and 
projects 1.4 
 real GNP growth for fiscal year 2025 
(July 2024-June 2025). 
 While the 
Puerto Rico 
economy has 
not directly 
tracked the 
United States 
economy in 
recent years, 
many of 
the external 
factors 
 that impact 
the Puerto 
Rico economy 
are affected 
by the 
policies and performance 
of the 
United States 
economy. 
These external 
 factors include the level 
of interest rates and 
the rate of 
inflation. In 2021 and 
2022, inflation rose sharply 
in both the 
United States 
 and Puerto 
Rico as 
the economy 
reopened following 
the COVID-19 
pandemic and 
demand surged 
beyond what 
disrupted supply 
 chains could meet. 
After peaking in 
mid-2022, inflation rates 
gradually decreased as the 
Federal Reserve implemented 
a series of 
 benchmark interest 
rate increases. 
By September 
2024, inflation 
had largely 
stabilized, prompting 
the Federal 
Reserve to 
reduce 
 interest rates for the first time 
in four years. As of 
September 2024, the United States Consumer Price Index 
(published by the U.S. 
 Bureau 
of 
Labor Statistics) 
reflects 
a 
year-over-year increase 
of 
2.4 . Meanwhile, 
inflation 
in 
Puerto 
Rico, 
as 
measured 
by 
the 
 Puerto Rico Consumer Price 
Index (published by the 
Department of Labor and 
Human Resources of Puerto 
Rico), increased 1.5 
 during the 12 months ending in August 2024. 
 Fiscal Challenges. 

 As the 
Puerto Rico 
economy contracted, the 
government s public 
debt rose 
rapidly, 
in part 
from borrowing to 
cover deficits 
to pay 
 debt service, 
pension benefits and 
other government expenditures. 
By 2016, 
the Puerto 
Rico government had 
over 120 
billion in 
 combined debt and unfunded pension liabilities, had 
lost access to the capital markets, and was in 
the midst of a fiscal crisis. 
 Puerto 
Rico s 
escalating fiscal 
and economic 
challenges 
and imminent 
widespread defaults 
in 
its 
public debt 
prompted the 
U.S. 
 Congress to 
enact the 
Puerto Rico 
Oversight, Management, 
and Economic 
Stability Act PROMESA in 
June 2016. 
PROMESA 
 created the Oversight Board with ample powers over Puerto Rico s fiscal and economic affairs and those of its public corporations, 
 instrumentalities and municipalities (collectively, 
 PR Government Entities ). Pursuant 
to PROMESA, the 
Oversight Board will be 
in 
 place 
until 
market 
access 
is 
restored 
and 
balanced 
budgets 
are 
produced 
for 
at 
least 
four 
consecutive 
years. 
PROMESA 
also 
 established two 
mechanisms for 
the restructuring 
of the 
obligations of 
PR Government 
Entities: (a) 
Title III, 
which provides 
an in-
 court process that incorporates many of the 
powers and provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code 
and permits adjustment of a broad 
 range of obligations, and 
(b) Title VI, 
which provides for a 
largely out-of-court process through which 
modifications to financial debt 
 can be accepted by a supermajority of creditors 
and bind holdouts. 
 Since 2017, Puerto Rico and several 
of its instrumentalities have availed themselves 
of the debt restructuring mechanisms of Titles 
 III and VI of PROMESA. The Puerto Rico government emerged from Title III of PROMESA in March 2022. Several instrumentalities, 
 including 
Government 
Development 
Bank 
for 
Puerto 
Rico, 
the 
Puerto 
Rico 
Sales 
Tax 
Financing 
Corporation, 
the 
Puerto 
Rico 
 Highways 
and 
Transportation 
Authority, 
and 
the 
Puerto 
Rico 
Industrial 
Development 
Company, 
have 
also 
completed 
debt 
 restructurings 
under 
Titles 
III 
or 
VI 
of 
PROMESA. 
While 
the 
majority 
of 
the 
debt 
has 
already 
been 
restructured, 
some 
PR 
 Government 
Entities 
still 
face 
significant 
fiscal 
challenges. 
For 
example, 
the 
Puerto 
Rico 
Electric 
Power 
Authority 
is 
still 
in 
the 
 process of restructuring its debts under Title III of PROMESA. 
 Municipalities. 

 Puerto Rico s 
fiscal and 
economic challenges 
have also 
adversely impacted its 
municipalities. Historically, 
the central 
government 
 provided 
significant 
annual 
subsidies 
to 
municipalities 
based 
on 
a 
statutory 
formula. 
However, 
as 
part 
of 
the 
fiscal 
measures 
 required 
by 
the 
Oversight 
Board, 
municipal 
subsidies 
have 
decreased 
significantly 
over 
several 
years 
and 
are 
now 
approved 
 through specific, non-recurring 
appropriations. This decrease 
has been partially 
offset by 
substantial non-recurring federal 
disaster 
 and 
COVID-relief funding 
received by 
municipalities in 
recent years. 
The latest 
Puerto Rico 
fiscal plan 
certified by 
the Oversight 
 Board provides for 
the implementation of 
a restructured grant 
and transfer system 
through which the 
Commonwealth would award 
 specific 
service 
grants to 
municipalities to 
augment 
existing municipal 
service 
delivery, 
while also 
incentivizing performance 
and 
 enhanced accountability through the monitoring of outcome 
metrics. 

 Municipalities are subject to PROMESA, and the Oversight Board 
has the authority to require them to submit fiscal plans and annual 
 budgets for 
review and 
approval. The 
Oversight Board 
has imposed 
this requirement 
for certain 
municipalities. Municipalities 
are 
 also 
required 
to 
seek 
Oversight 
Board 
approval 
to 
issue, 
guarantee 
or 
modify 
their 
debts 
and 
to 
enter 
into 
contracts 
with 
an 
 aggregate value of 
 10 million or 
more. With the 
Oversight Board s approval, 
municipalities are also 
eligible to avail 
themselves of 
 the 
debt 
restructuring processes 
provided 
by 
PROMESA. To 
date, 
however, 
no municipality 
has 
been 
subject to 
any 
such 
debt 
 restructuring process. 

174 
 Exposure of the Corporation 

 The credit 
quality of BPPR s 
loan portfolio 
reflects, among other 
things, the 
general economic conditions 
in Puerto 
Rico and 
other 
 adverse conditions affecting Puerto 
Rico consumers and businesses. 
Deterioration in the Puerto 
Rico economy has resulted 
in the 
 past, and could 
result in the future, 
in higher delinquencies, greater 
charge-offs and increased losses, 
which could materially affect 
 our financial condition and results of operations. 

 At September 
30, 2024, 
the Corporation s 
direct exposure 
to PR 
Government Entities 
totaled 336 
million, of 
which 336 
million 
 were 
outstanding, 
compared 
to 
 362 
million 
at 
December 
31, 
2023, 
of 
which 
 333 
million 
were 
outstanding. 
A 
deterioration 
in 
 Puerto Rico s fiscal 
and economic situation could adversely 
affect the value of 
our Puerto Rico government 
obligations, resulting in 
 losses to us. Of 
the amount outstanding, 323 million 
consists of loans and 
 13 million are securities 314 
million and 19 million, 
 respectively, at December 31, 
2023). Substantially all of the Corporation s direct exposure outstanding at September 30, 
2024 were 
 obligations from various 
Puerto Rico municipalities. 
In most 
cases, these were 
 general obligations of 
a municipality, 
to which 
the 
 applicable municipality 
has 
pledged its 
good faith, 
credit 
and unlimited 
taxing 
power, 
or special 
obligations of 
a municipality, 
to 
 which 
the 
applicable 
municipality 
has 
pledged 
basic 
property 
tax 
or 
sales 
tax 
revenues.
 At 
September 
30, 
2024, 
80 
of 
the 
 Corporation s exposure 
to municipal loans 
and securities was 
concentrated in the 
municipalities of San 
Juan, Guaynabo, 
Carolina 
 and Caguas. 
In July 2024, the Corporation received scheduled principal payments amounting to 40 million from various obligations 
 from Puerto 
Rico municipalities. For 
additional discussion of 
the Corporation s 
direct exposure to 
the Puerto 
Rico government and 
 its 
instrumentalities 
and 
municipalities, 
refer 
to 
Note 
20 
 
Commitments 
and 
Contingencies 
to 
the 
Consolidated 
Financial 
 Statements. 

 In 
addition, 
at 
September 
30, 
2024, 
the 
Corporation 
had 
 225 
million 
in 
loans 
insured 
or 
securities 
issued 
by 
Puerto 
Rico 
 governmental entities, 
but for 
which the 
principal source 
of repayment 
is non-governmental 238 million at 
December 31, 2023). 
 These 
included 
 179 
million 
in 
residential mortgage 
loans 
insured by 
the 
Puerto 
Rico 
Housing 
Finance Authority HFA ), 
a PR 
 Government 
Entity 
(December 
31, 
2023 
- 
 191 
million). 
These 
mortgage 
loans 
are 
secured 
by 
first 
mortgages 
on 
Puerto 
Rico 
 residential properties 
and the 
HFA insurance 
covers losses 
in the 
event of 
a borrower 
default and 
upon the 
satisfaction of 
certain 
 other 
conditions. 
The 
Corporation also 
had 
at 
September 
30, 
2024, 
 38 
million 
in 
bonds 
issued 
by 
HFA 
which 
are 
secured 
by 
 second 
mortgage loans 
on Puerto 
Rico 
residential properties, 
and for 
which HFA 
also provides 
insurance to 
cover losses 
in the 
 event of a borrower default, and upon the satisfaction of 
certain other conditions (December 31, 2023 - 40 million). In 
the event that 
 the mortgage loans insured by HFA and held by the Corporation directly or those 
serving as collateral for the HFA bonds default and 
 the collateral is insufficient to satisfy the outstanding balance of these loans, HFA s 
ability to honor its insurance will depend, among 
 other factors, 
on the 
financial condition 
of HFA 
at the 
time such 
obligations become 
due and 
payable. The 
Corporation does 
not 
 consider the government guarantee when estimating 
the credit losses associated with this portfolio. 

 BPPR s 
commercial loan 
portfolio also 
includes loans 
to 
private borrowers 
who 
are service 
providers, lessors, 
suppliers or 
have 
 other relationships with the government. These borrowers could be negatively 
affected by a deterioration in the fiscal and 
economic 
 situation 
of 
PR 
Government 
Entities. 
Similarly, 
BPPR s 
mortgage 
and 
consumer 
loan 
portfolios 
include 
loans 
to 
government 
 employees 
and 
retirees, 
which 
could 
also 
be 
negatively 
affected 
by 
fiscal 
measures, 
such 
as 
employee 
layoffs 
or 
furloughs 
or 
 reductions in pension benefits, if the fiscal and economic 
situation deteriorates. 
 As 
of 
September 
30, 
2024, 
BPPR 
had 
 18.7 
billion 
in 
deposits 
from 
the 
Puerto 
Rico 
government, 
its 
instrumentalities, 
and 
 municipalities. The rate at 
which public deposit balances may 
decline is uncertain and 
difficult to predict. The 
amount and timing of 
 any such 
reduction is 
likely to 
be impacted 
by, 
for example, 
the speed 
at which 
federal assistance 
is distributed 
and the 
financial 
 condition, liquidity 
and cash 
management practices of 
such entities, 
as well 
as on 
the ability 
of BPPR 
to maintain 
these customer 
 relationships. 
 United States Virgin Islands 
 The 
Corporation 
has 
operations 
in 
the 
United 
States 
Virgin 
Islands 
(the 
 USVI 
and 
has 
credit 
exposure 
to 
USVI 
government 
 entities. 
 The USVI has 
been experiencing a 
number of fiscal 
and economic challenges, 
which could adversely 
affect the 
ability of its 
public 
 corporations and instrumentalities to service their outstanding 
debt obligations. PROMESA does not apply to the USVI 
and, as such, 
 there 
is 
currently 
no 
federal 
legislation 
permitting 
the 
restructuring 
of 
the 
debts 
of 
the 
USVI 
and 
its 
public 
corporations 
and 
 instrumentalities. 
 To 
the extent that 
the fiscal condition 
of the USVI 
continues to deteriorate, the 
U.S. Congress or the 
Government of the 
USVI may 
 enact legislation allowing for the restructuring of the 
financial obligations of USVI government entities or imposing a 
stay on creditor 
 remedies, including by making PROMESA applicable 
to the USVI. 

175 
 At September 30, 
2024, the Corporation 
had approximately 28 
million in direct 
exposure to USVI 
government entities (December 
 31, 2023 - 28 million). 

 British Virgin Islands 
 The 
Corporation has 
operations 
in 
the 
British Virgin 
Islands BVI ), 
which 
was 
negatively 
affected by 
the 
COVID-19 
pandemic, 
 particularly as 
a reduction 
in the 
tourism activity 
which accounts 
for a 
significant portion 
of its 
economy. 
Although the 
Corporation 
 has 
no 
significant 
exposure 
to 
a 
single 
borrower 
in 
the 
BVI, 
at 
September 
30, 
2024, 
it 
has 
a 
loan 
portfolio 
amounting 
to 
 approximately 
 200 
million 
comprised 
of 
various 
retail 
and 
commercial 
clients, 
compared 
to 
a 
loan 
portfolio 
of 
 205 
million 
at 
 December 31, 2023. 
 U.S. Government 
 As further detailed in Notes 
5 and 6 to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements, a substantial portion of the 
Corporation s investment 
 securities 
represented exposure 
to 
the 
U.S. 
Government in 
the 
form 
of 
U.S. Government 
sponsored entities, 
as 
well 
as 
agency 
 mortgage-backed and U.S. Treasury securities. In 
addition, 2.0 billion of residential mortgages and 88.4 million commercial 
loans 
 were insured 
or guaranteed 
by the 
U.S. Government 
or its 
agencies at 
September 30, 
2024 (compared 
to 1.9 
billion and 
 89.2 
 million, respectively, at December 31, 2023).
 Non-Performing Assets 
 Non-performing assets NPAs 
include primarily past-due 
loans that 
are no 
longer accruing interest, 
renegotiated loans, and 
real 
 estate property acquired through foreclosure. A summary, including certain credit 
quality metrics, is presented in Table 19. 
 During the third 
quarter of 2024, 
the Corporation continued 
to reflect stable 
credit quality metrics 
in the third 
quarter of 2024 
when 
 compared to 
the previous 
quarter. 
While non-performing 
loans NPLs ), 
net charge 
offs NCOs 
and inflows 
to NPLs 
remained 
 below historical averages, consumer portfolios 
reflected increased delinquencies and NCOs 
for the quarter primarily 
driven by auto 
 loans. The 
mortgage and 
commercial portfolios 
continue to 
operate with 
low levels 
of delinquencies 
and NCOs. 
The Corporation 
 continues to closely monitor changes in the macroeconomic 
environment and borrower performance given higher interest rates and 
 inflationary pressures. Management believes that the improvements over recent years in risk management practices and the overall 
 risk profile of the Corporation s loan portfolios position 
Popular to continue to operate successfully under 
the current environment. 
 Total 
NPAs 
as of 
September 30, 
2024 decreased 
by 14 
million when 
compared with 
December 31, 
2023. Total 
non-performing 
 loans held-in-portfolio NPLs increased 
by 4 
million from 
December 31, 
2023. BPPR s 
NPLs decreased 
by 40 
million, across 
 most loan 
categories, except 
consumer NPLs 
which reflected 
an increase 
of 4 
million. The 
increase in 
the consumer 
NPLs was 
 mostly driven by auto 
loans. Popular U.S. NPLs increased 
by 44 million, driven 
by higher commercial and mortgage 
NPLs by 27 
 million and 17 million, respectively, each impacted by single loans amounting 
to 17 million. 

 On September 
30, 2024, 
the ratio 
of NPLs 
to total 
loans held-in-portfolio 
was 1.0 , 
flat when 
compared to 
December 31, 
2023. 
 Other real estate owned loans OREOs decreased by 17 
million from December 31, 2023. The decrease in OREO 
was driven by 
 the sale of 
a commercial property in 
BPPR, coupled with the 
sale of residential properties. 
On September 30, 2024, 
NPLs secured 
 by real 
estate amounted to 
 202 million in 
the Puerto Rico 
operations and 67 
million in Popular 
U.S, compared with 
 231 million 
 and 24 million, respectively, on December 31, 2023. 
 The Corporation s 
commercial loan 
portfolio secured 
by real 
estate CRE 
amounted to 
 10.7 billion 
on September 
30, 2024, 
of 
 which 
 3.1 
billion 
was 
secured 
with 
owner 
occupied 
properties, 
compared 
with 
 10.6 
billion 
and 
 3.1 
billion, 
respectively, 
on 
 December 31, 
2023. Office 
space leasing exposure 
in our 
non-owner occupied CRE 
portfolio is limited, 
representing only 2.0 
or 
 708 million of our total loan portfolio. The 
exposure is mainly comprised of low- to mid- rise properties with an 
average loan size of 
 2.3 million and is well diversified across tenant 
type. 
 CRE NPLs amounted to 67 million on September 30, 2024, compared with 48 million on December 31, 2023, driven by the single 
 17 
million 
loan 
mentioned 
above. 
The 
CRE 
NPL 
ratios 
for 
the 
BPPR 
and 
Popular 
U.S. 
segments 
were 
0.70 
and 
0.57 , 
 respectively, on September 30, 2024, compared with 0.86 and 0.13 , 
respectively, on December 31, 2023. 

176 
 In 
addition 
to 
the 
NPLs 
included 
in 
Table 
19, 
on 
September 
30, 
2024, 
there 
were 
 587 
million 
of 
performing 
loans, 
mostly 
 commercial 
loans, 
which 
in 
management s 
opinion, 
are 
currently 
subject 
to 
potential 
future 
classification 
as 
non-performing 
 (December 31, 2023 - 510 million). 
 For 
the 
quarter ended 
September 30, 
2024, 
total 
inflows 
of 
NPLs held-in-portfolio, 
excluding consumer 
loans, 
increased by 
 16 
 million, when compared to the inflows for the same period in 2023. Inflows of NPLs held-in-portfolio at the 
BPPR segment remained 
 flat, compared 
to the 
same period 
in 2023. 
Inflows of 
NPLs held-in-portfolio at 
the Popular 
U.S. segment increased 
by 17 million 
 from the same period in 2023, mainly driven by higher 
mortgage inflows by 16 million driven by abovementioned 
 17 million loan.

 [1] There were no non-performing loans held-for-sale 
as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 [2] It is the Corporation s policy to report delinquent 
residential mortgage loans insured by FHA or guaranteed 
by the VA as accruing 
loans past due 90 
 days or 
more as 
opposed to 
non-performing 
since the 
principal repayment 
is insured. 
These balances 
include 70 
million of 
residential 
mortgage 
 loans insured 
by FHA 
or guaranteed 
by the 
VA 
that are 
no longer 
accruing interest 
as of 
September 30, 
2024 (December 
31, 2023 
- 106 
million). 
 Furthermore, 
the Corporation 
has approximately 
 32 million 
in reverse 
mortgage 
loans which 
are guaranteed 
by 
FHA, but 
which are 
currently 
not 
 accruing 
interest. 
Due 
to 
the guaranteed 
nature 
of 
the loans, 
it is 
the Corporation s 
policy 
to 
exclude 
these 
balances 
from 
non-performing 
assets 
 (December 31, 2023 - 38 million).

Loans delinquent 30 days or more includes 0.4 billion 
of residential mortgage loans insured by FHA or guaranteed 
by the VA as of September 
 30, 2024 (December 31, 2023 - 0.5 billion). Refer to Note 
7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information 
of guaranteed loans. 
 Allowance for Credit Losses Loans Held-in-Portfolio 
 The ACL, 
represents management s 
estimate of 
expected credit 
losses through 
the remaining 
contractual life 
of the 
different loan 
 segments, impacted by expected prepayments. The ACL 
is maintained at a sufficient 
level to provide for estimated credit 
losses on 
 collateral dependent loans as well as loans modified 
for borrowers with financial difficulties separately from the remainder 
of the loan 
 portfolio. The Corporation s 
management evaluates the adequacy 
of the ACL 
on a quarterly 
basis. In this 
evaluation, management 
 considers current 
conditions, macroeconomic 
economic expectations through 
a reasonable 
and supportable 
period, historical 
loss 
 experience, 
portfolio composition 
by 
loan 
type 
and 
risk 
characteristics, 
results 
of 
periodic credit 
reviews 
of 
individual loans, 
and 
 regulatory requirements, amongst other factors. 
 The Corporation must rely on 
estimates and exercise judgment regarding matters where 
the ultimate outcome is unknown, such 
as 
 economic developments affecting specific 
customers, industries, or markets. 
Other factors that can 
affect management s estimates 
 are 
recalibration 
of 
statistical 
models 
used 
to 
calculate 
lifetime 
expected 
losses, 
changes 
in 
underwriting 
standards, 
financial 
 accounting standards and loan impairment measurements, 
among others. Changes in the financial condition 
of individual borrowers, 
 in economic 
conditions, and 
in the 
condition of 
the various 
markets in 
which collateral 
may be 
sold, may 
also affect 
the required 
 level of 
the allowance 
for credit 
losses. Consequently, 
the business 
financial condition, 
liquidity, 
capital, and 
results of 
operations 
 could also be affected.

 On September 30, 2024, 
the ACL increased by 
 15 million from December 
31, 2023 to 744 
million. The ACL for 
BPPR increased 
 by 
 26 
million, 
driven 
by 
an 
increase 
of 
 16 
million 
in 
reserves 
for 
commercial 
loans 
and 
a 
combined 
 12 
million 
increase 
in 
 reserves for 
the consumer 
and lease 
portfolios. These 
increases were 
mainly 
due to 
a combination 
of 
growth in 
the commercial 
 portfolio and changes in credit quality trends for the auto and credit cards portfolios. In PB, the ACL decreased by 11 
million, when 
 compared 
to 
December 
31, 
2023, 
mainly 
driven 
by 
lower 
reserves 
for 
the 
commercial 
and 
construction 
portfolios 
due 
to 
 improvements 
in 
credit 
quality 
and 
lower 
balances. 
The 
Corporation s 
ratio 
of 
the 
allowance 
for 
credit 
losses 
to 
loans 
held-in-
 portfolio was 2.06 on September 30, 2024, compared to 
2.08 on December 31, 2023. The ratio of the 
allowance for credit losses 
 to NPLs held-in-portfolio stood at 206.0 , compared 
to 204.0 on December 31, 2023. 
 Given that any one 
economic outlook is inherently uncertain, the 
Corporation leverages multiple scenarios to estimate 
its ACL. The 
 baseline scenario continues to be assigned the highest probability, 
followed by the pessimistic scenario. The weight assigned to the 
 pessimistic 
scenario 
decreased 
during 
the 
first 
quarter 
of 
2024 
in 
response 
to 
the 
positive 
momentum 
in 
the 
economy 
as 
 expectations for 
the Federal 
Reserve achieving 
a soft 
landing have 
improved. The 
Corporation evaluates, 
at least 
on an 
annual 
 basis, the assumptions tied to the CECL accounting framework. These include 
the reasonable and supportable period as well as the 
 reversion window. 
 The provision 
for credit 
losses related 
to the 
loans held-in-portfolio 
for the 
quarter ended 
September 30, 
2024, was 
 72.8 
million, 
 compared to 43.5 
million for the 
quarter ended September 
30, 2023, largely 
driven by higher 
NCOs due to 
credit quality changes 
 and commercial loan growth. The provision 
expense related to the loans-held-in-portfolio for the 
nine months ended September 30, 
 2024 
was 
 189.3 million, 
compared to 
the 
provision expense 
of 
 126.3 million 
for 
the 
nine months 
ended September 
30, 2023. 
 Refer to Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and to the Provision for Credit Losses section of this MD A for additional 
 information.

 during
the 
registrant s 
most recent 
fiscal
quarter

 over financial reporting;
and
 5. The 
registrant's

of 
directors 
(or

 persons performing the equivalent functions):

 a)
 All significant
deficiencies and 
material weaknesses in the design 
or operation of internal
control 
over financial

which 
are reasonably 
likely to 
adversely
affect

ability to 
record,
process, 
summarize 
 and report financial information;
and
 b)
 Any
fraud, 
whether or 
not material, 
that
involves
