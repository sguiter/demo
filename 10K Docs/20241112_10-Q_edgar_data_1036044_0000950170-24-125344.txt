Revenue Recognition The Physical Security Business recognized revenue upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflected the consideration expected to be received in exchange for those products or services. The contracts entered into could have included various combinations of its products, software licenses, and services, which were generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, the transaction price was allocated to each performance obligation, generally on a relative basis using its standalone selling price. The stated contract value was generally the transaction price to be allocated to the separate performance obligations. Revenue was recognized net of any taxes collected from customers that were subsequently remitted to governmental authorities. Timing of Revenue Recognition Revenues are derived from sales of hardware products, software licenses, subscriptions, professional services, software maintenance and support, and extended hardware warranties.

Significant Judgments Contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. For such arrangements, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price SSP ). Judgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation in a contract. For the majority of items, the SSP is estimated using historical transaction data. In instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when the product or service is not sold separately, the SSP is determined using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. The determination of SSP is an ongoing process and information is reviewed regularly in order to ensure SSPs reflect current information or trends.

million and treasury bills of million with maturities less than 90 days (Level 1 fair value measurements). As of December 31, 2023, the only assets measured and recognized at fair value on a recurring basis were nominal cash equivalents. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , there were liabilities measured and recognized at fair value on a recurring basis. Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Non-recurring Basis Certain of the Company's assets are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis if impairment is indicated. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , the Company had of privately-held investments measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, which were classified as Level 3 assets due to the absence of quoted market prices and inherent lack of liquidity. The Company reviews its investments to identify and evaluate investments that have an indication of possible impairment. The Company adjusts the carrying value for its privately-held investments for any impairment if the fair value is less than the carrying value of the respective assets on an other-than-temporary basis. The amount of privately-held investments is included in other assets in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , there were liabilities that are measured and recognized at fair value on a non-recurring basis. Assets and Liabilities Not Measured at Fair Value The carrying amounts of the Company's accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts payable, and other accrued liabilities approximate fair value due to their short maturities. The carrying value of the Company's financial liabilities approximates fair value based upon borrowing rates currently available to the Company for loans with similar terms.

The Company provides warranties on certain product sales for a period of months, and allowances for estimated warranty costs are recorded during the period of sale. The determination of such allowances requires the Company to make estimates of product return rates and expected costs to repair or to replace the products under warranty. The Company currently establishes warranty reserves based on historical warranty costs for each product line combined with liability estimates based on the prior 12 months sales activities. If actual return rates and/or repair and replacement costs differ significantly from the Company s estimates, adjustments to recognize additional cost of sales may be required in future periods.

 Each of the terms the Company, Identiv, we, us and our as used herein refers collectively to Identiv, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, unless otherwise stated. 
 Overview 
 Historically, we organized our operations into two reportable business segments: Identity and Premises. Our Identity segment included products and solutions that enabled secure access to information serving the logical access and cyber-security market, and protected connected objects and information using RFID embedded security. Our Premises segment included the Company's solutions to address the premises security market for government and enterprise, including access control, video surveillance, analytics, audio, access readers and identities. 
 As disclosed in Note 1, Basis of Presentation and Note 3, Discontinued Operations , on September 6, 2024, we completed the sale of our Physical Security Business, which historically represented primarily our Premises segment. As a result, we currently have one reportable segment: the IoT Business segment. 
 The IoT Business segment develops, manufactures, and supplies specialty IoT solutions tailored for the healthcare industry and other high-value end markets. Our specialty radio-frequency identification (RFID) IoT devices, including NFC, high frequency (HF), dual frequency (DF), ultra-high frequency (UHF) and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), are attached to or embedded into physical items, such as syringes, pill containers, wine bottles, and sports jerseys, providing those items with a unique digital identity. These devices enable unique and secure digital interaction with the physical world while simultaneously capturing relevant data which can then be analyzed and managed by the end customer. We sell our products across multiple industries, focusing on pharmaceutical and medical devices, consumer electronics, mobile devices, wine and spirits, luxury goods, libraries, and logistics. 
 
 Recent Developments 
 
 Closing of Asset Sale 
 On September 6, 2024, the Company completed the sale of its physical security, access card, and identity reader operations and assets, including all outstanding shares of Identiv Private Limited, its wholly-owned subsidiary (the Physical Security Business to Hawk Acquisition, Inc., a Delaware corporation Buyer and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Vitaprotech SAS, a French soci t par actions simplifi e and provider of security solutions, and Buyer assumed certain of the Company s liabilities related to the Physical Security Business (collectively, the Asset Sale pursuant to that certain Stock and Asset Purchase Agreement, dated as of April 2, 2024 (the Purchase Agreement ), by and between the Company and Buyer. As consideration for the Asset Sale, the Company received approximately 144.3 million in cash, subject to further customary adjustments as set forth in the Purchase Agreement. 
 In connection with the closing of the Asset Sale, the Company and Buyer entered into a transition services agreement (the Transition Services Agreement ). The Transition Services Agreement outlines the information technology, people, and facility support the Company will provide to Buyer for a period of 12 months to 18 months after the transaction closing date. 
 In addition, at the closing of the Asset Sale, unvested restricted stock units RSUs held by employees who became employed by the Buyer (or an affiliate of Buyer) became fully vested, while RSUs held by our remaining employees and non-employee directors continue to vest according to their terms. 
 Following the completion of the Asset Sale, we continue to be a public company operating under the name Identiv, Inc. and continue to own the assets and liabilities of our business that were not sold to Buyer, which we refer to herein as the IoT Business .

The discussion in this Item 2, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, unless otherwise noted, relates solely to the Company s continuing operations. 
 Factors Affecting Our Performance 
 Market Adoption 
 Our financial performance depends on the pace, scope and depth of end-user adoption of our RFID products in multiple industries. That pace, scope and depth has resulted in large fluctuations in our operating results. For example, adoption of BLE devices, which accelerated in 2023, significantly declined to date in 2024, as we have experienced lower unit sales of BLE transponder products to one of our customers undergoing a technology transition. We do not expect to resume shipments to this customer for at least a few quarters. As a result, we have experienced a corresponding decrease in utilization in our production facilities in Southeast Asia. 
 We believe significant improvement in chip capabilities at lower costs has accelerated the opportunities for product engineers to integrate RFID into their products to create new and more engaging customer experiences, reduce counterfeiting, and ensure proper product use and adherence. Though we believe the number of opportunities for RFID-based solutions has increased, the evaluation period and customer adoption originally expected for certain applications has taken longer than we anticipated. 
 We believe the underlying, long-term trend is continued RFID adoption across multiple verticals, but regulated industries like healthcare take longer to optimize the technology and fully understand the benefits. We also believe that expanding use cases fosters adoption across verticals and into other markets. 
 If RFID market adoption, and adoption of our products specifically, does not meet our expectations then our growth prospects and operating results will be adversely affected. If we are unable to meet end-user or customer volume or performance expectations, then our business prospects may be adversely affected. In contrast, if our RFID sales exceed expectations, then our revenue and profitability may be positively affected. 
 Given the uncertainties of the specific timing of our new customer deployments, we cannot assure you that we have appropriate inventory and capacity levels or that we will not experience inventory shortfalls or overages in the future or acquire inventory at costs to maintain gross margins. We attempt to mitigate those risks by being deeply embedded in our customers design cycles, working with our chip partners on long lead time components, managing our limited capital equipment needs within a short cycle and future proofing our facilities to accommodate several scenarios for growth potential. 
 If end users with sizable projects change or delay them, we may experience significant fluctuation in revenue on a quarterly or annual basis, and we anticipate that uncertainty to continue to characterize our business for the foreseeable future. 
 
 Competitive Landscape 
 We have seen a large increase in global production capacity at several of our RFID competitors. This has resulted in competitive pricing pressure, and, in response, we have begun to exit some of our lowest margin business. This has had, and we expect will continue to have, a negative impact on our operating results. We have also publicly disclosed allegations of anti-competitive business practices by one of our RFID competitors. 
 
 Impacts of Macroeconomic Conditions and Other Factors on our Business 
 We conduct operations internationally with sales in the Americas, Europe and the Middle East, and Asia-Pacific regions. Our manufacturing operations and third-party contract manufacturers are located in China, Singapore, and Thailand/Southeast Asia. We purchase certain products and key components from a limited number of sources that depend on the supply chain, including freight, to receive components, transport finished goods and deliver our products across the world. In view of the rapidly changing business environment, we have experienced delays and reductions in customer orders, shifting supply chain availability, component shortages, and other production-related challenges. We are currently unable to determine if there will be any continued disruption and the extent to which this may have future impact on our business. We continue to monitor the global supply chain challenges and its effect on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. 
 
 More recently, we have also been impacted by other adverse macroeconomic conditions, including but not limited to, inflation, foreign currency fluctuations, and the slowdown of economic activity around the globe. These conditions have also impacted our suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, and distributors, causing increases in cost of materials and higher shipping and transportation rates, which then impacted the pricing of our products. Price increases may not successfully offset cost increases or may cause us to lose market share and, in turn, may adversely impact our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. 
 
 23 

Anticipated Effects of Asset Sale 
 
 Our business has and will continue to be affected by the Asset Sale. The Asset Sale included assets and operations that have historically represented the majority of our revenues, representing approximately 63 of our 2023 revenue, as well as a substantial portion of our assets, representing approximately 43 of our assets as of December 31, 2023. The gross margin profile of our continuing business has and will continue to be significantly lower than our historical total gross margins across a lower revenue base. As a result, our net loss has and we expect it will continue to increase substantially.

Net Revenue 
 Net revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 6.5 million and 19.9 million, respectively, decreases of 44 and 38 compared with 11.7 million and 32.1 million, respectively, for the comparable periods of 2023. 
 Net revenue in the Americas for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 2.8 million and 9.1 million, respectively, decreases of 34 and 51 compared to 4.2 million and 18.5 million, respectively, for the comparable periods of 2023. These decreases were primarily due to substantially lower unit sales of RFID transponder products to one of our customers undergoing a technology transition to their next-generation (Gen 3) chip. We do not expect shipments to this customer for at least a few quarters while they work on producing their Gen 3 chip. 
 Net revenue in Europe, the Middle East, and the Asia-Pacific for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 3.8 million and 10.8 million, decreases of 50 and 20 , respectively, compared with the comparable period of 2023. The decreases were primarily due to lower sales of RFID transponder products in both Europe and the Middle East and the Asia-Pacific. 
 Gross Profit and Gross Margin 
 Gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 0.2 million compared with 1.3 million in the comparable period of 2023. Gross profit for nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 1.3 million compared with 4.2 million in the comparable period of 2023. Gross profit represents net revenue less direct cost of product sales, manufacturing overhead, other costs directly related to preparing the product for sale including freight, scrap, and inventory adjustments, where applicable. 
 Gross profit margins for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased to 4 and 7 from 11 and 13 in the comparable periods of 2023. The decrease in gross profit margins was primarily attributable to substantially lower unit sales to one of our customers, as discussed above, resulting in underutilization of our manufacturing production facilities in Singapore and Thailand. 
 We expect there will be variation in our gross profit from period to period, as our gross profit has been and will continue to be affected primarily by varying mix among our products. Within each product category, gross margins have tended to be consistent, but over time may be affected by a variety of factors, including, without limitation, competition, product pricing, the volume of sales in any given quarter, manufacturing volumes, product configuration and mix, the availability of new products, product enhancements, risk of inventory write-downs and the cost and availability of components.

Research and development expenses consist primarily of employee compensation and fees for the development of hardware, software and firmware products. We focus the bulk of our research and development activities on the continued development of existing products and the development of new offerings for emerging market opportunities. 
 Research and development expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased compared to the comparable prior year period primarily due to higher external contractor costs as well as higher travel related costs. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the decrease in research and development expenses were attributable to lower headcount and payroll related costs.

The increase in interest income (expense), net for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the comparable period of 2023 was primarily attributable to interest earned on our money market accounts and treasury bills. 
 
 Gain on investment is associated with additional proceeds received in connection with the acquisition of a private company that we had previously invested in, which had been fully impaired and had no carrying value. 
 Changes in currency valuation in the periods mainly were the result of exchange rate movements between the U.S. Dollar, the Euro and the Thai Baht. Our foreign currency gains and losses primarily result from the valuation of current assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the respective entity in the local financial statements.

As of September 30, 2024, our deferred tax assets are fully offset by a valuation allowance. ASC 740, Income Taxes , provides for the recognition of deferred tax assets if realization of such assets is more likely than not. Based upon the weight of available evidence, which includes historical operating performance, reported cumulative net losses since inception and difficulty in accurately forecasting our future results, we provided a full valuation allowance against all of our net U.S. and foreign deferred tax assets. We reassess the need for our valuation allowance on a quarterly basis. If it is later determined that a portion or all of the valuation allowance is not required, it generally will be a benefit to the income tax provision in the period such determination is made. 
 We recorded an income tax provision during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, associated with taxable income from one of our foreign subsidiaries. The effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 differ from the federal statutory rate of 21 primarily due to a change in valuation allowance, and the provision or benefit in certain foreign jurisdictions, which are subject to higher tax rates.

Income from discontinued operations consists of the results of operations, net of tax of our Physical Security Business which we disclosed as discontinued operations. The gain on sale of the Physical Security Business is subject to adjustment as we complete our tax analysis on the ability to utilize net operating loss and credit carryforwards to reduce the amount of income tax provision. Any adjustment to the income tax provision recorded in connection with the Sale of the Physical Security Business will be completed by December 31, 2024. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 As of September 30, 2024, our working capital, defined as current assets less current liabilities, was 147.0 million, an increase of 98.3 million compared to 48.7 million as of December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents balance was 145.4 million. 
 On February 8, 2017, we entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (as amended or amended and restated from time to time, the Loan Agreement with East West Bank EWB ). Following subsequent amendments, on April 14, 2022, we amended and restated the Loan Agreement by replacing the 20.0 million revolving loan facility subject to a borrowing base with a non-formula revolving loan facility with no borrowing base requirement and a maturity date of February 8, 2023. In addition, the interest rate was lowered from prime to prime minus 0.25 , and certain financial covenants were amended. On February 8, 2023, we entered into an amendment (the "Fourth Amendment") to the Loan Agreement. The Fourth Amendment amends the Loan Agreement to, among other things, extend the maturity date to February 8, 2025 and amend certain financial covenants. As of September 30, 2024, there were no amounts outstanding under the Loan Agreement.

As our previously unremitted earnings have been subjected to U.S. federal income tax, we expect any repatriation of these earnings to the U.S. would not incur significant additional taxes related to such amounts. However, our estimates are provisional and subject to further analysis. Generally, most of our foreign subsidiaries have accumulated deficits and cash and cash equivalents that are held outside the United States are typically not cash generated from earnings that would be subject to tax upon repatriation if transferred to the United States. We have access to the cash held outside the United States to fund domestic operations and obligations without any material income tax consequences. As of September 30, 2024, the amount of cash included at such subsidiaries was 3.3 million. We have not, nor do we anticipate the need to, repatriate funds to the United States to satisfy domestic liquidity needs arising in the ordinary course of business, including liquidity needs associated with our domestic debt service requirements. 
 We have historically incurred operating losses and negative cash flows from operating activities, and we expect to continue to incur losses in the future. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 339.7 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had a loss from continuing operations of 21.6 million which included strategic review-related costs of 6.1 million. 
 We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, together with cash generated from operations and available credit under our Loan Agreement will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital needs to fund operations for the next 12 months. We may also use cash to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, technologies, services or products that would change our cash requirements. We may also choose to finance our business through public or private equity offerings, debt financings or other arrangements. However, there can be no assurance that additional capital will be available to us or that such capital will be available to us on acceptable terms. If we raise funds by issuing equity securities, dilution to stockholders could result. Debt or any equity securities issued also may provide for rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock. The terms of debt securities issued or loans could impose significant restrictions on our operations. The incurrence of additional indebtedness or the issuance of certain debt or equity securities could result in increased fixed payment obligations and could also result in restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt or issue additional equity, limitations on our ability to acquire or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. Our Loan Agreement imposes restrictions on our operations, increases our fixed payment obligations and has restrictive covenants. In addition, the issuance of additional equity securities by us, or the possibility of such issuance, may cause the market price of our common stock to decline. If we are not able to secure additional funding when needed, we may have to curtail or reduce the scope of our business or forgo potential business opportunities. 
 The following summarizes our cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands):

Cash flows from operating activities 
 Cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 9.5 million, was primarily due to adjustments to net income for certain non-cash items of 89.3 million, consisting primarily of the gain on sale of our Physical Security Business of 99.5 million, as well as depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation, offset by net income of 75.2 million and an increase in cash from net changes in operating assets and liabilities of 4.6 million. 
 Cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 of 3.6 million, was primarily due to net loss of 3.9 million, a decrease in cash from net changes in operating assets and liabilities of 4.6 million, partially offset by adjustments for certain non-cash items of 4.9 million, consisting primarily of depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation. 
 Cash flows from investing activities 
 Cash provided by investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 142.5 million which related primarily to proceeds received in connection with the sale of our Physical Security Business in the third quarter of 2024, partially offset by capital expenditures for our manufacturing facility in Thailand. 
 28 

Cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 3.0 million related primarily to capital expenditures for our manufacturing facility in Thailand. 
 Cash flows from financing activities 
 Cash used in financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 11.7 million, which consisted of net repayments of 10.1 million under our revolving loan facility with our lender, and net share settlements of RSUs of 1.6 million. 
 Cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 10.5 million, which consisted of net borrowings of 9.9 million under our revolving loan facility with our lender, proceeds received from the exercise of warrants by 21 April Fund, LP and 21 April Fund, Ltd. of approximately 1.0 million, partially offset by net share settlements of RSUs of 0.4 million. 
 Contractual Obligations 
 We lease facilities, certain equipment, and automobiles under non-cancelable operating lease agreements. See Note 14, Leases , in the accompanying notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 Purchases for inventories are highly dependent upon forecasts of customer demand. Due to the uncertainty in demand from our customers, we may have to change, reschedule, or cancel purchases or purchase orders from our suppliers. These changes may lead to vendor cancellation charges on these orders or contractual commitments. See Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies , in the accompanying notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 Our other long-term liabilities include gross unrecognized tax benefits, and related interest and penalties. At this time, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years in connection with these tax liabilities. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We have not entered into off-balance sheet arrangements, or issued guarantees to third parties. 
 Climate Change 
 We believe that neither climate change, nor governmental regulations related to climate change, have had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Our condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires management to establish accounting policies that contain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. These policies relate to revenue recognition, inventory, income taxes, goodwill, intangible and long-lived assets and stock-based compensation. We have other important accounting policies and practices; however, once adopted, these other policies either generally do not require us to make significant estimates or assumptions or otherwise only require implementation of the adopted policy and not a judgment as to the policy itself. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Despite our intention to establish accurate estimates and assumptions, actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, management believes there have been no significant changes to the items that we disclosed within our critical accounting policies and estimates in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as amended. 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 See Note 2, S ignificant Accounting Policies and Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the accompanying notes to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in Item 1 of Part I of this Quarterly Report for a description of recent accounting pronouncements, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or Exchange Act, that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Our disclosure controls and procedures have been designed to meet reasonable assurance standards. Additionally, in designing disclosure controls and procedures, our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures. The design of any disclosure controls and procedures also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. 
 Based on their evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
 Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting 
 We have made no changes to our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the three months ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or that are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 30 

PART II: OT HER INFORMATION 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 We are and from time to time, may become subject to various legal proceedings and claims arising in the ordinary course of business or could be named a defendant in other lawsuits. Legal proceedings could result in material costs, occupy significant management resources and entail penalties, even if we prevail. The outcome of such claims or other proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty and may have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
 Item 1A. Ri sk Factors 
 Our business and results of operations are subject to numerous risks, uncertainties, and other factors that you should be aware of. You should carefully review and consider the information regarding certain factors that could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results set forth in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, as amended, under the heading Risk Factors. There have been no material changes from the risk factors disclosed in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, as amended, other than as set forth below. The risks, uncertainties and other factors described in the risk factors are not the only ones facing our company. Additional risks, uncertainties and other factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. Any of the risks, uncertainties and other factors could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or product market share and could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline substantially. 
 Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property, and Litigation 
 We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights, which could make us less competitive and cause us to lose market share. 
 Our future success will depend, in part, upon our intellectual property rights and our ability to protect these rights. We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions to establish, maintain and protect our proprietary rights. From time to time, we may be required to use litigation to protect our proprietary technology. As a result, we may incur substantial costs and we may not be successful in any such litigation. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized third parties may copy aspects of our products, obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary, or infringe upon our patents. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary and intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws in the U.S. Because many of our products are sold and a significant portion of our business is conducted outside the U.S., our exposure to intellectual property risks may be higher. Our efforts to protect our proprietary and intellectual property rights may not be adequate. Additionally, there is a risk that our competitors will independently develop similar technology or duplicate our products or design around patents or other intellectual property rights. If we are unsuccessful in protecting our intellectual property or our products or technologies are duplicated by others, our competitive position could be harmed and we could lose market share . 
 As an example, the complexity and uncertainty of European patent laws have increased in recent years. In Europe, a new unitary patent system took effect June 1, 2023 which will significantly impact European patents, including those granted before the introduction of such a system. Under the unitary patent system, European applications have the option, upon grant of a patent, of becoming a Unitary Patent which will be subject to the jurisdiction of the Unitary Patent Court (UPC). As the UPC is a new court system, there is no precedent for the court, increasing the uncertainty of any litigation. Patents granted before the implementation of the UPC will have the option of opting out of the jurisdiction of the UPC and remaining as national patents in the UPC countries. Patents that remain under the jurisdiction of the UPC will be potentially vulnerable to a single UPC-based revocation challenge that, if successful, could invalidate the patent in all countries who are signatories to the UPC. We cannot predict with certainty the long-term effects of the unitary patent system and any potential changes . 
 
 Risks Related to the Company s IoT Business 
 
 The growing number of competitors in the RFID industry is posing additional risks to our business. 
 As the RFID industry continues to grow, there has been an increase in the number of companies entering the market, including from China. Competitors have and may continue to sell products or solutions at low prices in order to gain market share, because they have lower costs than other competitors, or for other reasons. The number of contract manufacturers and the amount of manufacturing capacity has also increased significantly. If the growth of the RFID industry does not keep pace with the increased manufacturing capacity, this may result in downward pressure on pricing and reduced margins, each of which could have a serious adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations . 
 
 31 

Our success depends largely on the continued service and availability of key personnel. 
 Our future success depends on our ability to continue to attract, retain, and motivate our senior management as well as qualified technical personnel in the RFID industry. Competition for these employees is intense and many of our competitors may have greater name recognition and significantly greater financial resources to better compete for these employees. We have in the past, and may in the future, experience the loss of employees to our competitors. If we are unable to retain our existing personnel, or attract and retain additional qualified personnel, specifically following the completion of the Asset Sale, our growth may be limited. Our key employees are employed on an at will basis, meaning either we or the employee may terminate their employment with us at any time. The loss of or inability to hire or replace key employees could slow our product development processes and sales efforts or harm our reputation. Also, if our stock price declines, as it has recently, it may result in difficulty attracting and retaining personnel as equity incentives generally comprise a significant portion of our employee compensation . 
 
 The separation of the Physical Security Business following the closing of the Asset Sale may significantly disrupt our operations. 
 The separation of the Physical Security Business from our operations and financial reporting and corporate functions has required us to reconfigure our system processes, transactions, data and controls. This transition has required significant management attention, capital and personnel resources, and the coordination of our system providers and internal business teams. We may experience difficulties, including delays and higher than anticipated costs related to capital and personnel resources, as we continue to manage these changes, including loss or corruption of data, delays in finalizing our financial records for each accounting period and related delays in completion of our financial reporting, unanticipated expenses, and lost revenue. In addition, any delays in finalizing our records could result in our failure to timely file our periodic reports with the SEC, which could limit our access to the public markets to raise debt or equity capital, restrict our ability to issue equity securities, and result in the delisting of our common stock and/or regulatory sanctions from the SEC or The Nasdaq Stock Market, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our operations. Difficulties in continuing to implement the separation of the Physical Security Business could disrupt our operations, divert management s attention from key strategic initiatives and have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows . 
 
 32 

Failure to expand our IoT Business to penetrate new markets and scale successfully within those markets may negatively impact our revenues and financial condition. 
 Following the closing of the Asset Sale, our growth strategy for the IoT Business depends in part on our ability to penetrate emerging markets, such as the medical device market, and scale successfully within those markets. The medical device market and other new markets present distinct and substantial challenges and risks and will likely require us to develop new customized solutions to address the particular requirements of that market. Additionally, these new market opportunities may be outside the scope of our proven expertise or in areas which have unproven market demand, and the utility and value of new products developed by us may not be accepted in the markets served by the new products. Our inability to gain market acceptance of new products could prevent us from scaling successfully within new markets and may harm our future operating results. Our future success also depends on our ability to manufacture new products to meet customer demand in a timely and cost-effective manner. Difficulties or delays in replacing existing products with new products we introduce or in manufacturing improved or new products in sufficient quantities to meet customer demand could diminish future demand for our products and harm our future operating results. In addition, if the medical device market and other new market opportunities for our current and future products are smaller than estimated or do not develop as we expect, our growth may be limited and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Even if the medical device market and other emerging markets develop as expected, we may not be able to achieve the high gross margins associated with such markets, or, if we do achieve such gross margins, we may not be able to sustain them . 
 
 We continue to incur significant expenses and administrative burdens as a public company despite our revenue being significantly lower following the Asset Sale, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Following the closing of the Asset Sale, we continue to incur significant legal, accounting, administrative and other costs and expenses as a public company. Because our revenue has and will continue to be significantly reduced as a result of the divestiture of the Physical Security Business, these expenses will represent a larger percentage of our revenue and will have a negative effect on our gross margins. If we are unable to generate sufficient revenue through our IoT Business, these increased expenses as a percentage of our revenue may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations . 
 
 Uncertainty regarding the use of proceeds from the Asset Sale and our future operations may negatively impact the value and liquidity of our common stock. 
 As consideration for the Asset Sale, we received approximately 144.3 million in cash, subject to further customary adjustments as set forth in the Purchase Agreement. Our board of directors will have discretion regarding the use of proceeds from the Asset Sale and plans to use a portion of the net proceeds to pursue growth opportunities for the IoT Business. It may also use the funds to pay dividends and distributions on or redeem or repurchase our capital stock pursuant to our stock repurchase program; for working capital and other general corporate purposes, which may include sales and marketing activities, research and development, general and administrative matters and capital expenditures; to invest in or acquire complementary businesses, products, services, technologies or assets; or to otherwise execute our growth strategy. Although our board of directors continues to evaluate various alternatives regarding use of the proceeds from the Asset Sale, it has not yet identified any specific plans, investments or acquisitions or committed to making any such decision by a particular date. This uncertainty may negatively impact the value and liquidity of our common stock. While our board of directors has approved a stock repurchase program following the Asset Sale, we cannot guarantee that the program will be fully completed. The program does not obligate us to repurchase any specific dollar amount or number of shares of our common stock. Additionally, it has no expiration date and may be suspended or terminated at any time at our discretion. 
 We may use the net proceeds for purposes that do not yield a significant return or any return at all for our stockholders. In addition, pending their use, we may invest the net proceeds from the Asset Sale in a manner that does not produce income or that loses value, or in a manner that stockholders do not agree with. For example, repurchases pursuant to our stock repurchase program could affect the trading price of our stock, increase volatility and reduce the market liquidity for our common stock. If we do not invest or apply the net proceeds from the Asset Sale in ways that enhance stockholder value, we may fail to achieve expected financial results, which could cause our stock price to decline . 
 
 The amount of net proceeds that we receive from the Asset Sale is subject to decrease . 
 We received approximately 144.3 million in cash as consideration for the Asset Sale, which amount is subject to further customary adjustments as set forth in the Purchase Agreement. Such post-closing adjustment process, including any disputes between us and the Buyer regarding the final purchase price and any adjustments thereof, could result in a significant reduction to the amount of net proceeds that we receive from the Asset Sale . 
 
 33 

Our business prospects may diminish following completion of the Asset Sale and our stock price has and may continue to decline. 
 We continue to operate our IoT Business despite the sale of assets that have historically generated a significant portion of our revenue. For example, the Physical Security Business generated approximately 63 of the Company s revenue for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. The divestiture of the Physical Security Business resulted in material cash proceeds to the Company and a reduction in operating expenses and liabilities; however, our revenue following the closing of the Asset Sale is now limited to our IoT Business. A failure by us to grow our IoT Business could result in our business prospects diminishing, and the value and liquidity of our common stock could be negatively impacted . 
 
 We cannot provide any assurances that we will realize the intended benefits of the Asset Sale. 
 We cannot provide any assurances that we will realize the intended benefits of the Asset Sale. We expect to continue to focus our resources, capital, and management attention towards expanding our IoT Business. However, we may not be able to realize our goals for the IoT Business. In addition, we have and will continue to experience a significant decrease in revenue as a result of the sale of the Physical Security Business. Any failure to realize the intended benefits of the Asset Sale could have a material adverse impact on our future operating results and financial condition and could materially and adversely affect our stock price or trading volume . 
 
 To the extent we pursue acquisitions, strategic alliances, or investments in other businesses, products, services, technologies or assets, we could experience operating difficulties and other consequences that may harm our business, financial condition, and operating results, and we may not be able to successfully consummate favorable transactions or successfully integrate such acquisitions. 
 We expect to apply a portion of the net proceeds from the Asset Sale to pursue growth opportunities for the IoT Business, including potentially investing in opportunities such as acquisitions of complementary businesses, products, services, technologies or assets. We may also pursue strategic alliances that leverage our core technology and industry experience to expand our IoT offerings or make investments in other companies or technologies. 
 The identification of suitable acquisition candidates is difficult, and we may not be able to complete acquisitions on favorable terms, if at all. With respect to any future acquisitions, we may not be able to integrate such acquisitions successfully into our existing business, and we could assume unknown or contingent liabilities. Any acquisitions by us also could result in significant write-offs or the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities, any of which could harm our operating results. Furthermore, the loss of customers, partners or suppliers following the completion of any acquisition could harm our business. Changes in services, sources of revenue, and branding or rebranding initiatives may involve substantial costs and may not be favorably received by customers, resulting in an adverse impact on our financial results, financial condition and stock price. Integration of an acquired company or business also may require management s time and resources that otherwise would be available for ongoing development of our existing business. We may also need to divert cash from other uses, or issue equity securities in order to fund these integration activities and these new businesses. If the stock price of our common stock is low or volatile, we may not be able to acquire other companies for stock. In addition, our stockholders may experience substantial dilution as a result of additional securities we may issue for acquisitions. Open market sales of substantial amounts of our common stock issued to stockholders of companies we acquire could also depress our stock price . 
 Ultimately, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition, strategic alliance, or investment, or these benefits may take longer to realize than we expected. The occurrence of any of these risks could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition . 
 
 Changes in management following the closing of the Asset Sale may adversely affect the future performance of our IoT Business. 
 In connection with the closing of the Asset Sale, our former Chief Executive Officer, Steven Humphreys, and certain other members of our senior management joined Buyer. The senior management of the Company currently includes Kirsten Newquist, Chief Executive Officer, Justin Scarpulla, Chief Financial Officer, Edward Kirnbauer, Vice President, Global Corporate Controller, Dr. Manfred Mueller, Chief Strategy Officer, Amir Khoshniyati, Executive Vice President and General Manager, IoT Solutions, and Boon Yong (BY) Koh, Executive Vice President, Operations. In connection with these changes in management and the sale of our Physical Security Business, there have been and will continue to be changes to the Company s operations and our key strategies and tactical initiatives related to our IoT Business over time. If we do not successfully implement and adapt to these changes, we may be unable to successfully execute our long-term business development plans for our IoT Business, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Further, the future performance of our IoT Business will depend, in part, on the successful transition of our workforce to our new operating and organizational structure, and our inability to successfully manage these transitions could be viewed negatively by our customers, employees, investors and other third-party partners, and could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations . 
 
 34 

We are subject to five-year non-competition and non-solicitation covenants under the Purchase Agreement, which will prevent us from reentering the Physical Security Business. 
 We are subject to five-year non-competition and non-solicitation covenants in the Purchase Agreement. During such five-year period, the Company and its controlled affiliates are restricted from directly or indirectly engaging with, managing or operating, or having any ownership interest in any person that engages with, manages, or operates, a business that is competitive with the Physical Security Business or competes for customers of the Physical Security Business, in each case, with respect to geographies that the Physical Security Business participated in as of the closing of the Asset Sale. In addition, during this five-year period, the Company has agreed, not to directly or indirectly hire, engage, recruit, employ, solicit or otherwise attempt to employ or engage or enter into any business relationship with any Business Employee or Acquired Entity Employee (each as defined in the Purchase Agreement), or induce or attempt to induce any such employee to leave his or her employment with Buyer or Buyer s affiliates, subject to certain customary limitations. These limitations will prevent us from reentering the Physical Security Business . 
 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equi ty Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 325,781 shares of our common stock. The table below sets forth information regarding the Company s purchases of its common stock during the three months ended September 30, 2024:
