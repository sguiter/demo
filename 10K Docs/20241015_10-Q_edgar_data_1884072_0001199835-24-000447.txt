ADAMAS ONE CORP. 

 NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 

 For the Nine Months Ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 

NOTE
1 ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS ACTIVITY 

Adamas
One Corp. (the Company was incorporated on September 6, 2018, in the state of Nevada for the purpose of acquiring existing
technology that would efficiently and effectively produce lab-grown, environmentally friendly, ethically sourced diamonds. On January
31, 2019, we entered into an Amended Asset Purchase Agreement with Scio Diamond Technology Corporation, or Scio, which was subsequently
amended February 3, 2020, pursuant to which we acquired substantially all of the assets of Scio, which assets consisted primarily of
proprietary diamond growing chemical reactors, which we refer to as diamond growing machines, patents, and all intellectual property
related thereto, for an aggregate of 1,500,000 shares of our common stock and payment to certain lenders of Scio of an aggregate of 2.1
million in cash. In addition, we agreed to pay one-half of certain other unsecured operational liabilities of Scio. The transaction was
approved by a majority of the Scio stockholders voting in person or by proxy at a special meeting of stockholders held commencing on
July 12, 2019 and reconvening on August 6, 2019. The transaction closed on October 17, 2019. We recorded the fair value of the assets
purchased and liabilities assumed at 8.7 million. 

The
assets and liabilities were valued using ASC 805 , the fair value of assets acquired, and liabilities assumed in a business combination,
which requires the measurement of assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be recognized at their acquisition-date fair values. 

Since
acquiring the assets of Scio, we have continued to further develop the technologies acquired from Scio, and we have begun producing diamonds
for fine jewelry and diamond material for industrial uses. 

On
April 17, 2024, the Company announced the establishment of a Board of Advisors for it s newly formed Adamas Technologies subsidiary.
Adamas Technologies was formed on November 9. 2023 and is responsible for research and development, partnerships and deployment of lab-grown
diamond-based solutions for the technology industry. The board consists of Jerry McGuire, the Adamas One Corp. COO and three technology
industry veterans. Activity during the quarter has been focused on planning, as the subsidiary intends to take Adamas One Diamond Technology
into high-tech industrial markets including semiconductors. 

NOTE
2 GOING CONCERN 

The
accompanying condensed financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets
and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. We incurred a net loss of 10.1 million and used approximately
 2.1 million of cash in operations for the nine months ended June 30, 2024. Further information related to a going concern the Going
Concern Uncertainty paragraph in the Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm, also contained in the above referenced
financial statements. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for the following year. 

We
will need additional financing to implement our full business plan and to service our ongoing operations. There can be no assurance that
we will be able to secure any needed funding, or that if such funding is available, the terms or conditions would be acceptable to us.
If we are unable to obtain additional financing when it is needed, we will need to restructure our operations and possibly divest all
or a portion of our business. We may seek additional capital through a combination of equity offerings and debt financings. Debt financing,
if obtained, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring
additional debt, and could increase our expenses and require that our assets secure such debt. Equity financing, if obtained, could result
in dilution to our existing stockholders and/or require such stockholders to waive certain rights and preferences. The accompanying condensed
financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the
amount and classification of liabilities or any other adjustment that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern.

NOTE
3 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

Principles
of Presentation 

The accompanying financial statements
of the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America U.S.
GAAP for financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-K as promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission
(the SEC ). Accordingly, these condensed financial statements include all of the disclosures required by U.S. GAAP for complete
financial statements. 

The
Company s fiscal year begins on October 1 and ends on September 30. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters,
months and periods refer to the Company s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those
fiscal years. 

Reclassification 

Certain
prior period amounts in the balance sheet, statement of cash flows and accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the current
period s presentation. 

Cash
and Cash Equivalents 

For purposes of the condensed statements
of cash flows, we consider highly liquid financial instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less at
the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. 

Accounts
Receivable 

We
follow the allowance method of recognizing uncollectible accounts receivable, which recognizes bad debt expense based on a review of
the individual accounts outstanding and our prior history of uncollectible accounts receivable. We extend credit based on an evaluation
of each customer s financial condition, and our receivables are generally unsecured. Accounts receivable are stated net of an allowance
for doubtful accounts in the balance sheet. We consider accounts past due if outstanding longer than contractual payment terms. We record
an allowance based on consideration of a number of factors, including the length of time trade accounts are past due, our previous loss
history, the creditworthiness of individual customers, economic conditions affecting specific customer industries, and economic conditions
in general. We charge-off accounts receivable after all reasonable collection efforts have been exhausted. We credit payments subsequently
received on such receivables to bad debt expense in the period we receive the payment. 

As
of June 30, 2024, we had established an allowance of 1.2 million for potentially uncollectible accounts receivable. As of September
30, 2023, we had established an allowance of 1.7 million for potentially uncollectible accounts receivable. We record delinquent finance
charges on outstanding accounts receivable only if they are collected. 

Fair
Value Measurement 

ASC
Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement , requires that certain financial instruments be recognized at their fair values at our
balance sheet dates. However, other financial instruments, such as debt obligations, are not required to be recognized at their fair
values, but GAAP provides an option to elect fair value accounting for these instruments. GAAP requires the disclosure of the fair values
of all financial instruments, regardless of whether they are recognized at their fair values or carrying amounts in our balance sheets.
For financial instruments recognized at fair value, GAAP requires the disclosure of their fair values by type of instrument, along with
other information, including changes in the fair values of certain financial instruments recognized in income or other comprehensive
income. For financial instruments not recognized at fair value, the disclosure of their fair values is provided below under Financial
Instruments. 

Nonfinancial
assets, such as property, plant and equipment, and nonfinancial liabilities are recognized at their carrying amounts in the Company s
balance sheets. GAAP does not permit nonfinancial assets and liabilities to be remeasured at their fair values. However, GAAP requires
the remeasurement of such assets and liabilities to their fair values upon the occurrence of certain events, such as the impairment of
property, plant and equipment. In addition, if such an event occurs, GAAP requires the disclosure of the fair value of the asset or liability
along with other information, including the gain or loss recognized in income in the period the remeasurement occurred. 

Level
1 - Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical assets or liabilities; 

Level
2 - Quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the
full term of the asset or liability; or 

Level
3 - Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (supported
by little or no market activity). 

The
Company did not have any Level 1 or Level 2 assets and liabilities at June 30, 2024, or September 30, 2023. The Derivative liabilities
are Level 3 fair value measurements.

During
2023, the Company issued note payable agreements which contain conversion provisions meeting the definition of a derivative liability
which therefore require bifurcation. Further, pursuant to the Company s contract ordering policy, equity linked instruments subsequently
issued resulted in derivative liabilities. 

At
June 30, 2024, the Company estimated the fair value of the conversion feature derivatives embedded in the notes payable based on assumptions
used in the Cox-Ross-Rubinstein binomial pricing model using the following inputs: the price of the Company s common stock of 0.4365;
risk-free interest rate of 5.50 ; expected volatility of the Company s common stock of 118 based on the historical volatility
of the Company s common stock; exercise price of 0.2586; and terms of three months. 

Property
and Equipment 

We
recorded property and equipment purchased at cost. We compute depreciation, after equipment is placed in service, using the straight-line
method at rates intended to depreciate the cost of assets over their estimated useful lives, which are generally four to ten years. Upon
retirement or sale of property and equipment, we will remove the cost of the disposed assets and related accumulated depreciation from
the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is credited or charged to selling, general, and administrative expenses. We charge expenditures
for normal repairs and maintenance to expense as incurred. We capitalize additions and expenditures for improving or rebuilding existing
assets that extend the useful life. Leasehold improvements made either at the inception of the lease or during the lease term will be
amortized over the shorter of their economic lives or the lease term including any renewals that are reasonably assured. 

Goodwill 

We
evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than
not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount. In testing for goodwill impairment, we may elect to utilize
a qualitative assessment to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying
amount. If our qualitative assessment indicates that goodwill impairment is more likely than not, we perform a two-step impairment test.
We test goodwill for impairment under the two-step impairment test by first comparing the book value of net assets to the fair value
of the reporting unit. If the fair value is determined to be less than the book value or qualitative factors indicate that it is more
likely than not that goodwill is impaired, a second step is performed to compute the amount of impairment as the difference between the
estimated fair value of goodwill and the carrying value. We estimate the fair value of the reporting units using discounted cash flows.
Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future net sales and operating expenses, based primarily on expected
category expansion, pricing, market segment share, and general economic conditions. 

Goodwill represents the excess of fair
value over identifiable tangible and intangible net assets acquired in the Scio business combination. Goodwill is not amortized, instead
goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually, or on an interim basis between annual tests when events or circumstances indicate
that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than it s carrying value. The goodwill that arose
from the Scio asset purchase agreement was independently valued at 5,413,000 as of August 7, 2019. We completed our last annual goodwill
impairment test in our fourth quarter for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, and as a result of the annual test management determined
that no change was needed to the carrying value of goodwill at June 30, 2024 or as of September 30, 2023. 

Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets 

We
continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of long-lived assets may not be recoverable.
When such events or changes in circumstances are present, we assess the recoverability of long-lived assets by determining whether the
carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows. If the total of the future cash flows
is less than the carrying amount of those assets, we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the
fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value less costs to sell.
No impairment expense was recognized for the nine months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023. 

9 

Revenue
Recognition 

We
generate revenue from the sale of diamonds that have been produced or purchased. We recognize revenue according to Accounting Standards
Codification 606 Revenue from Contracts with Customers ASC 606 ). When the customer obtains control over the promised
goods or services, we record revenue in the amount of consideration that we can expect to receive in exchange for those goods. We apply
the following five-step model to determine revenue recognition: 

identification
of a contract with a customer; 

identification
of the performance obligations in the contact; 

determination
of the transaction price; 

allocation
of the transaction price to the separate performance obligations; and 

recognition
of revenue when performance obligations are satisfied. 

We
only apply the five-step model when it is probable that we will collect the consideration we are entitled to in exchange for the goods
or services we transfer to the customer. At contract inception and once the contract is determined to be within the scope of ASC 606,
we assess the goods or services promised within each contract and determine those that are performance obligations and assess whether
each promised good or service is distinct. Our contracts contain a single performance obligation (delivery of diamonds), and the entire
transaction price is allocated to the single performance obligation. We recognize as revenue the amount of the transaction price that
is allocated to the respective performance obligation when the performance obligation is satisfied or as it is satisfied. Accordingly,
we recognize revenue when the customer obtains control of our product, which typically occurs upon delivery of the product. Currently,
our credit terms are payment is due within 90 days. 

Shipping
costs consists of fees charged to customers for shipping of sold items by the Company. The performance obligation is to ship the item
sold as initiated by the customer. The price is set based on the third-party service provider selected to be used by the customer as
well as the speed and location of shipment. Revenue is recognized at a point in time when the shipping label is printed. 

Disaggregated
Revenue Information 

We
have no disaggregated revenue to report for the nine months ended June 30, 2024 or 2023. 

Advertising
Costs 

We
plan to expense advertising costs as they are incurred. We have incurred no advertising costs to date. 

Inventories 

We
 state inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value in the following manners. We
 determine cost using the average cost method on all inventory generated by our manufacturing operations upon our transition from
research and development in our manufacturing facility to the full production of our products for sale. We
 also purchase lab-grown diamonds from a vendor who cuts and polishes the majority of our manufactured diamonds as the vendor has
access to other lab-grown diamonds that may supplement the inventory needed by the Company or which may be unique in nature which may
appeal to our customers or be used in design of our proprietary jewelry line which is under
development. We carry the value of these purchased diamonds at the lower of cost
 or net realizable value. Included in inventory is work in process which states the average cost method of these items at their
state of completion at the condensed balance sheet date. At June 30, 2024, our inventory consisted
of finished precious stones in various carat sizes, shapes, and colors that we produced or purchased and work in process. As of June 30,
2024 and September 30, 2023, our inventory consisted primarily of finished precious stones in various carat sizes, shapes, and
 colors which we produced and work in process. 

Stock-Based
Compensation 

We
account for stock-based compensation at fair value in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 718 Compensation 
Stock Compensation ASC 718 ), which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share-based
payment awards to employees and directors. On October 01, 2022, we adopted ASU 2022-03, Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities
Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions. Accordingly, stock-based compensation is valued using market value of our Common Stock.
Stock-based compensation is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting periods and forfeitures are recognized in the periods
they occur. We account for common stock purchase option awards by estimating the fair value of each option award on the grant date using
the Black-Scholes option pricing model that uses assumption and estimates that we believe are reasonable. 

10 

We
account for stock-based compensation at estimated fair value on the date of grant. There were 2,628,215 shares of common stock granted
to employees for one year s services and fully expensed during the nine months ended June 30, 2024. These were valued at an aggregate
of 1.5 million. 

There were 1,145,000 shares of common stock granted to employees for their
service. The price per share was based upon the market closing price on the day of the grant. The grants are fully vested and are recognized
upon the date of grant. 

Concentrations
of Credit Risk 

Accounts at banks are insured by the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation, or the FDIC, up to 250,000. As of June 30, 2024, our bank account balance did not exceed the federally
insured limit. 

Income
Taxes 

We
account for income taxes under the asset and liability method in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 740 - Income Taxes,
or ASC 740. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the
condensed financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. We measure deferred
tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable amounts in years in which those temporary differences
are expected to be recovered or settled. If it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized,
a valuation allowance is recognized. We reflect changes in recognition or measurement in the period in which the change in judgment occurs.
We currently have substantial net operating loss carryforwards. We have recorded a valuation allowance equal to the net deferred tax
assets due to the uncertainty of the ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets. 

Contingencies 

Certain
conditions may exist as of the date the condensed financial statements are issued that may result in a loss to us but will only be resolved
when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. We assess such contingent liabilities, and such assessment inherently involves
an exercise of judgment. In assessing loss contingencies related to potential unasserted claims that may result in legal proceedings
against us, we evaluate the perceived merits of any claims and the perceived merits of the amount of relief sought or expected to be
sought therein and determine if any loss is likely. 

If
the assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability
is reasonably estimated, the estimated liability would be accrued in our condensed financial statements. If the assessment indicates
that a potentially material loss contingency is not probable but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be estimated, then
the nature of the contingent liability, together with an estimate of range of possible loss if determinable and material, would be disclosed.
There were no known loss contingencies identified as of June 30, 2024. (See NOTE 6 below for additional information) 

Loss
Per Common Share 

We calculate
basic loss per share using the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each reporting period. Diluted loss
per share includes potentially dilutive financial instruments, such as convertible term notes and related interest. We
 excluded 1,085,217 and 883,132 shares from the weighted average diluted common shares outstanding for the nine months ended
June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, because their inclusion would have been antidilutive. These shares are what would have been issued
if the convertible debt, plus accrued interest had been converted for each of the nine months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023. 

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncement 

Adopted 

In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting
Standards Update ASC 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). The update improves financial reporting about leasing transactions by
requiring a lessee to record on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by lease terms of
more than 12 months. We adopted ASU 2016-02 effective October 1, 2022 as required for private companies, given the Company went public
in December 2022. We have applied the modified retrospective approach to adopt the new leasing standard. This approach typically applies
the new standard to all existing leases existing at the date of initial application and does not require a restatement of comparative
periods. We completed the process of aggregating and evaluating lease arrangements and implementing new processes during the fiscal year
ended at September 30, 2023. As a result of evaluating the impact of adoption of the ASC on our financial statements we recognized a right-of-use
asset and lease liability on our balance sheet for our real estate operating leases. At October 1, 2022 we recognized a right of use asset
of 1.4 million, and a lease liability of 1.4 million. 

11 

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncement 

In
August 2020, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU 2020-06, Debt Debt with Conversion and Other Options
(Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging Contracts in Entity s Own Equity (Subtopic 815 40) ASU 2020-06 ).
ASU 2020-06 simplifies the accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity, including convertible
instruments and contracts on an entity s own equity. The ASU is part of the FASB s simplification initiative, which aims
to reduce unnecessary complexity in US GAAP. The ASU s amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023,
and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2020-06 on its financial statements. 

In
December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2023-09 ASU 2023-09 ),
Income Taxes, which enhances the transparency of income tax disclosures by expanding annual disclosure requirements related to the rate
reconciliation and income taxes paid. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption
is permitted. The amendments should be applied on a prospective basis. Retrospective application is permitted. The Company is currently
evaluating this ASU to determine its impact on the Company s disclosures. The new guidance eliminates certain exceptions to the general
approach to the income tax accounting model and adds new guidance to reduce the complexity in accounting for income taxes. The guidance
will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024 and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption of
the amendments is permitted, including adoption in any interim period for public business entities for periods for which financial statements
have not yet been issued. We are currently evaluating the impact that the new guidance will have on our condensed financial statements. 

In
June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326), which replaces the current
incurred loss impairment methodology for most financial assets with the current expected credit loss, or CECL, methodology. The series
of new guidance amends the impairment model by requiring entities to use a forward-looking approach based on expected losses rather than
incurred losses to estimate credit losses on certain types of financial instruments, including trade receivables. The guidance should
be applied on either a prospective transition or modified-retrospective approach depending on the subtopic. The guidance is effective
for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted.
We are currently evaluating the impact that the new guidance will have on our condensed financial statements, but since we have yet to
recognize revenue, adoption is not anticipated to have a material effect. 

NOTE
4 INVENTORIES 

As of June 30, 2024 and September 30,
2023, the inventory balances were comprised of purchased products carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value, finished products
and work in process carried at the value of the costs associated with the manufacturing of the goods. As of June 30, 2024, finished products
and work in process were 0.9 million and 0.5 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2023, finished products and work in process
were 0.9 million and 0.7 million, respectively. There was no inventory obsolescence in the nine months period ended June 30, 2024. 

NOTE
5 PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT 

Property
and equipment are listed net of the related accumulated depreciation as of June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023. As of June 30, 2024.
The Company has a deposit on equipment on order in the amount of 1.3 million, which represents approximately 50 of the total purchase
price. As the equipment is not yet in service, it is not being depreciated. 

Depreciation
expense for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024 totaled 18,000 and 35,314 respectively. Depreciation expense for the
three and nine months ended June 30, 2023 totaled 78,250 and 234,750, respectively. 

NOTE
6 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 

Indemnifications 

During
the normal course of business, we make certain indemnities and commitments under which we may be required to make payments in relation
to certain transactions. These may include (i) indemnities to vendors and service providers pertaining to claims based on negligence
or willful misconduct; and (ii) indemnities involving the representations and warranties in certain contracts. In addition, under our
bylaws we are committed to our directors and officers for providing for payments upon the occurrence of certain prescribed events. The
majority of these indemnities and commitments do not provide for any limitation on the maximum potential for future payments that we
could be obligated to make. We have not incurred costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification agreements.
As a result, we believe the estimated fair value of these agreements is minimal. Accordingly, we had no liabilities recorded for these
agreements as of June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023. 

Contingent
Consideration 

The
Company s contingent consideration liabilities related to certain lenders compliance guidelines are included as a current liability
on the Balance Sheet at June 30, 2024 and included herein. 

12 

Leases 

As
the Company s leases generally do not provide an implicit discount rate, the Company uses the estimated collateralized incremental
borrowing rate based on information available at the lease commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments for use
in the calculation of the operating lease liabilities and right-of-use assets. This rate is determined using a portfolio approach based
on the risk-adjusted rate of interest and requires estimates and assumptions including credit rating, credit spread, and adjustments
for the impact of collateral. The Company believes that this is the rate it would have to pay to borrow an amount equal to the lease
payments on a collateralized basis over a similar lease term. Operating lease liabilities and corresponding right-of-use assets include
options to extend lease terms that are reasonably certain of being exercised. The Company does not record a lease liability and corresponding
right-of-use asset for leases with terms of 12 months or less, and accounts for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component.
The Company s lease portfolio is comprised of operating leases with the lease cost recorded on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 

We
are obligated under a triple-net operating lease for our 6,475 square foot manufacturing facility located in Greenville, South Carolina,
which is classified as an operating lease. The terms of the lease require a payment of approximately 10,680 per month, which includes
an estimate for utilities, taxes, and repairs. This lease expires in August 2028. 

We believe this facility will be adequate
to meet our current needs based on the property and equipment currently owned. On April 1, 2023, we had entered into a lease to expand
our manufacturing footprint in Greenville, South Carolina. On April 1. 2024, we terminated the lease in a mutual agreement with our former
landlord, as we reassess the locations for future growth. In addition, we have a lease for 3,414 square feet of office space in Scottsdale,
Arizona, expiring in September 2024. The office is to facilitate the administration and marketing of expanding the manufacturing aspect
of our company as well as to administer increased management anticipated in areas of human resources, finance, accounting, and financial
analysis as well as sales and marketing to manage the growth in the production output as a result of the second facility in Greenville,

Employment
Agreements 

We
have entered into five separate employment agreements that provide for stock to be issued annually in varying amounts through fiscal
2025. The price per share to be included in employee stock compensation expense will be based upon the fair market value of the stock
on the date of grant. The grants are fully vested, pending the service requirement of continued employment. 

Additional
Compensation 

In
addition to the above stock commitments, we have agreed to provide certain executive officers with compensation paid in diamonds.
These commitments amount to issuing 9.5 carats of diamonds per month through September 2024 and 2.5 carats of diamonds per month
through October 2025. For the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 this obligation has been accrued at a valuation of
 1,000 per carat, which is based on management s estimate of the market value of the diamonds. 

Litigation 

During
December 2022, we became a party to a class action filing previously between Scio and a class action investor. We have retained outside
counsel specifically for this matter and are working with other defendants named in this matter to increase our chance of prevailing.
On February 17, 2022 the Company filed a motion to dismiss the class action in concert with Scio which filed a separate motion to dismiss
this class action. Our approach will continue to seek a dismissal on all items related to this legal action. We believe the case is without
merit and will defend our position vigorously. Based on the Company s assessment of a favorable decision by the court no liability
has been recorded on our balance sheet at June 30, 2024. 

13 

The
Company retained outside counsel and filed a motion to dismiss and joined in Scio s motion to dismiss on February 17, 2023. Specifically,
the Company believes it was mis-joined to the lawsuit and that no claims are adequately pled against it. The Company further contended
the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction. The case was re-assigned to Hon. Cristina D. Silva. Judge Silva s on July 5, 2023.
On June 14, 2024, the court ordered an additional briefing based on the Company s motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter
jurisdiction. The briefing was to commence on June 28, 2024, however, as a result of the court s inclination to grant the Company s
motion to dismiss, the Plaintiff stipulated to dismiss the claims against the Company, Mr. Grdina, and Scio s management and filed
a voluntary dismissal of all of the claims as of June 28, 2024.

NOTE
10 INCOME TAXES 

We
compute income taxes using the asset and liability method in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes . Under the asset
and liability method, we determine deferred income tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial reporting
and tax bases of assets and liabilities and measure them using currently enacted tax rates and laws. We provide a valuation allowance
for the amount of deferred tax assets that, based on available evidence, are more likely than not to be realized. Realization of our
net operating loss carryforward was not reasonably assured as of June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, and we have recorded a related
valuation allowance against deferred tax assets in excess of deferred tax liabilities in the accompanying condensed financial statements. 

As
of June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, we had federal income tax net operating loss carryforwards. We are subject to limitations existing
under Internal Revenue Code Section 382 (Change of Control) relating to the availability of the operating loss, therefore utilization
of a portion of our net operating loss may be limited in future years. 

As
of June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 we had no Internal Revenue Service or state tax examinations. Therefore, all periods since inception
are subject to audit.

Overview 

We
are a high-tech, laboratory grown, diamond company that uses our proprietary technology to produce high-quality, single crystal diamonds
and diamond materials through a CVD process, which we refer to as our Diamond Technology . Lab-grown diamonds have the exact
physical, chemical, and optical properties of the best mined diamonds. Lab-grown diamonds are composed of a pure carbon lattice, just
like mined diamonds, and are not considered synthetic or simulant diamonds like cubic zirconia and moissanite. Simulants are other chemical
compounds that resemble diamonds but do not possess the same hardness, thermal characteristics, band gap energy, and light reflectivity
as diamond, whether mined or lab-grown. 

We
use our Diamond Technology to produce finished diamond gemstones that we intend to sell wholesale and retail for jewelry and rough unfinished
diamond materials that we intend to sell wholesale and retail for industrial uses. We are in the initial phases of commercializing diamonds
and diamond materials, and our primary mission is the development of a profitable and sustainable commercial production model for the
manufacture and sale of diamonds and diamond materials, which are suitable for known, emerging, and anticipated industrial, technology,
and consumer applications. 

Since
acquiring the Scio assets over three years ago, we have focused our efforts on research and development of improvements to the fundamental
CVD process. Like most high-tech manufacturers, the philosophy of continuous improvement is at our core. Our development efforts have
focused on commercialization of the diamonds and diamond materials we produce, improvements in our white diamond process, improvements
in our diamond seed processes, automation in our machine operation, expansion of our capacity with our existing machines, and improvements
in our laser cutting procedures. The guiding principle of these efforts is to provide the highest quality diamonds and diamond materials
in a consistent and high-yield manner. 

We
currently have limited available commercial products and have to date sold minimal diamonds or diamond materials to consumers or commercial
buyers. Our current operations, until just recently, have been dedicated to the research and development of our Diamond Technology and
the exploration of markets that we may exploit in the future. While we are unable to predict the timing of our entry into any market
in the future, we will strive to produce on a large scale high-quality finished and raw diamond materials and to pursue related commercial
opportunities.

Components
of Results of Operations Net Sales 

During
the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024, we had net sales of 179,774 and 411,046 respectively, compared to 290,938 and 1,130,994
net sales for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2023. We anticipate deriving continuing future revenue from the following business
lines: 

Direct
Sales of Diamonds: The sale of diamond gemstones direct to the consumer through our website and the sale of industrial grade diamonds
direct to industrial manufacturing companies. 

Wholesale
of Diamonds: The sale of diamonds to wholesalers, distributors, and jewelers. 

Cost
of Revenues 

Cost
of revenues includes direct costs (parts, material, and labor), indirect manufacturing costs (manufacturing overhead, depreciation, plant
operating lease expense, and rent), shipping, lab services, and logistics costs. 

Costs of revenues for the three and nine
months ended June 30, 2024, were 161,273 and 461,753 respectively. Costs of revenues for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2023
were 217,844 and 397,842, respectively. 

Gross Profit (Loss) 

Gross Profit (Loss) for the three and
nine months ended June 30, 2024, was 18,500 and (50,707) respectively with a gross margin on diamond sales of 47 and (12.3) for each
of those periods, respectively. Gross Profit (Loss)for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2023, was 73,094 and 733,152, respectively
with a gross profit margin on diamond sales of 25 and 65 for each of those periods, respectively. 

Research
and Development Expense 

We
conduct research and development activities to enhance existing processes and products and develop new processes and products at our
facilities in Greenville, South Carolina, utilizing our personnel and strategic relationships. We expense all costs associated with our
research and development efforts through either our cost of goods sold, as they are performed by the same employees who produce our finished
product, or through our general and administrative expenses if the product has not been brought to market. 

We
expect our research and development expenses to increase for the foreseeable future as we continue to invest in research and development
activities to achieve our operational and commercial goals. 

Operating
Expense 

Operating
expense includes selling, general and administrative expense, employee salaries and related expense and depreciation and amortization
expense. Selling, general, and administrative expenses consist primarily of legal and professional, consulting services and all non-personnel-related
expenses or depreciation and amortization. Personnel-related expenses consist of salaries, payroll taxes, benefits, and stock-based compensation.
Depreciation and amortization expenses are related to the Company s fixed assets and intangible assets. 

Operating
expense for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024, included in the condensed statements of operations was 1.9 million and 7.5
million, respectively, compared to 4.5 million and 16.9 million in the prior period. These decreases in operating expenses for both
the three- and nine-month periods were generally due to the lower stock compensation expense as a result of a lower valuation based on
price of the stock at the time of grant. 

We
expect our future operating expense to increase for the foreseeable future as we scale headcount and expenses with the growth of our
business, build out our manufacturing facilities, refine our production processes, drive for productivity improvements, acquire new and
retain existing customers, and incur additional costs as a result of being a public company. 

18 

Other
Expenses 

Interest
Expense and Other Costs of Financing 

Interest expense consists of interest
paid and accrued on our notes payable, promissory notes and the amortization of debt issue costs. 

Interest and other expenses were 0.3
million and 2.6 million for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024, respectively, compared to .1 million and 2.3 million the
three- and nine-month periods of the prior year. This was due primarily to the higher costs associated with new financings and lower overall
borrowings for the nine months ended June 30, 2024, versus the nine months ended June 30, 2023. 

Net Loss 

Primarily as a result of the above factors
we had a net loss of 2.2 million and 10.1 million compared to a net loss of 4.5 million and 18.5 million for the three and nine months
ended June 30, 2024, and June 30, 2023, respectively. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

As of June 30, 2024, we had 16,102
of cash and cash equivalents compared to 26,088 at September 30, 2023. 

Changes in cash flows are summarized
as follows: 

Operating Activities 

For the nine months ended June 30,
2024, net cash used in operating activities totaled approximately 2.1 million. This was primarily the result of a net loss of approximately
 10.1 million, increases to our period end accounts accrued liabilities of 1.2 million, an increase in our accrued interest of 0.5 million,
a increase in derivative liability of 1.1 million, a decrease with an offset by the benefit of non-cash expenses for employee stock compensation
and consultants compensation of 3.7 million and warrants issued for conversion of 0.9 million. 

For the nine months ended June 30, 2023,
net cash used in operating activities totaled approximately 6.1 million. This was primarily the result of net loss of approximately 18.5
million offset by the benefit of non-cash expenses for employee stock compensation of 9.9 million. 

Investing Activities 

During the nine months ended June 30,
2024, we used no cash for investing activities. During the nine months ended June 30, 2023, we used 1.5 million for investing activities
related to purchase of property and equipment. 

Financing Activities 

During the nine months ended June 30,
2024, net cash provided by financing activities was approximately 2.1 million. This was primarily the result of additional borrowings. 

During the nine months ended June 30,
2023, net cash provided by financing activities was 8.1 million. This was the net effect of 9.1 million we received as net proceeds
from our IPO which closed on December 14, 2022 offset by 0.6 million used to reduce related party notes and 1.2 million to acquire treasury
stock during the nine months ended June 30, 2023. 

These conditions raise substantial doubt
about our ability to continue as a going concern for the ensuing year. Our independent auditors have added an explanatory paragraph in
their audit opinion in regard to this uncertainty and can be found in the Company s Annual Form 10K filing with the Securities and

Satisfaction
of our Cash Obligations for the Next 12 Months 

Our
IPO which closed on December 14, 2022, gave us gross proceeds of 11.0 million before direct IPO expenses and fees associated with underwriting.
These funds along with the ability to obtain additional capital through additional equity and/or debt financing are anticipated to meet
our operating needs. We are not currently generating sufficient revenue to meet operating needs. In the event we cannot obtain additional
capital to pursue our strategic plan, however, this would materially impact our ability to continue as a going concern. 

19 

Since
inception, we have financed cash flow requirements through debt financing and the private issuance of common stock for cash and services
along with advances from our CEO as well as our CEO and CFO deferring significant compensation and benefits that were earned under their
respective employment contracts. If we continue to experience cash flow deficiencies, we would be required to obtain additional financing
to fund operations through private common stock offerings and debt borrowings to the extent necessary to provide working capital. However,
there is no assurance we would be able to obtain such financing on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. 

We
intend to implement and successfully execute our business and marketing strategy, continue to develop, and upgrade technology and products,
respond to competitive developments, and attract, retain, and motivate qualified personnel. There can be no assurance that we will be
successful in addressing such risks, and the failure to do so can have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial
condition, and results of operations. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We
do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial
condition, changes in financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources
that is material to investors. 

Critical
Accounting Policies 

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affected the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates
made in preparing the condensed financial statements include the valuation of allowances for doubtful accounts, valuation of deferred
tax assets, inventories, useful lives of assets, goodwill, intangible assets, and stock-based compensation. A summary of our critical
accounting policies is included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2023, under Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. There have been no significant changes to these policies
during the nine months ended June 30, 2024. For disclosure regarding recent accounting pronouncements and the anticipated impact they
will have on our operations, please refer to Note 2 to the financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the year ended September 30, 2023. 

ITEM
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

We
are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are not required to provide the information
under this item. 

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the
 Exchange Act ), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file
or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities
and Exchange Commission s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. We carried out an evaluation, under
the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design
and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of June 30, 2024. Based on the evaluation of these disclosure controls and
procedures, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective.
Our controls were ineffective due to the size of the Company and available resources. There are limited personnel to assist with the
accounting and financial reporting function, which results in: (i) a lack of segregation of duties and (ii) controls that may not be
adequately designed or operating effectively. Despite the existence of material weaknesses, the Company believes the financial information
presented herein is materially correct and fairly presents the financial position and operating results of the nine months ended June
30, 2024, and 2023 in accordance with GAAP. 

Changes
in internal controls 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act, during
the quarterly period from April 1, 2023 to June 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal control over financial reporting.

PART
II OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM
1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

We
are involved in or subject to, or may become involved in or subject to, routine litigation, claims, disputes, proceedings, and investigations
in the ordinary course of business. While the outcome of lawsuits and other proceedings against us cannot be predicted with certainty,
in the opinion of management, individually or in the aggregate, no such lawsuits are expected to have a material effect on our financial
position, results of operations or cash flows. We record accruals for contingencies when it is probable that a liability will be incurred,
and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. 

On
January 10, 2023, the Company was joined as a defendant to an existing lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of
Nevada (case no. 2:22-cv-00256) between Theodorus Strous, a shareholder of Scio Diamond Technology Corp. Scio ), and Scio
executives, brought as a proposed derivative shareholder class action. The second amended complaint added the Company and John G. Grdina
as defendants, expanding the claim to assert a proposed derivative shareholder class action against the Company as well as Scio. 

The
Company retained outside counsel and filed a motion to dismiss and joined in Scio s motion to dismiss on February 17, 2023. Specifically,
the Company believes it was mis-joined to the lawsuit and that no claims are adequately pled against it. The Company further contended
the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction. The case was re-assigned to Hon. Cristina D. Silva. Judge Silva s on July 5, 2023.
On June 14, 2024, the court ordered additional briefing based on the Company s motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.
The briefing was to commence on June 28, 2024, however, as a result of the court s inclination to grant the Company s motion
to dismiss, the Plaintiff stipulated to dismiss the claims against the Company, Mr. Grdina, and Scio s management and filed a voluntary
dismissal of all of the claims as of June 28, 2024. 

Please
reference the Contingencies section of Note 3 of our Condensed Financial Statements for additional disclosure.
