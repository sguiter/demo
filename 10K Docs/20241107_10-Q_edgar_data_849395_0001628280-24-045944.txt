 The Company s reportable segments are the same as the Company s operating segments and correspond with how the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) regularly reviews financial information to allocate resources and assess performance under the Company s organizational structure. 
 The CODM monitors the operating results of segments separately in order to allocate resources between segments and to assess performance. Segment performance is evaluated using Adjusted EBITDA. Given that Interest expense and Income tax expense are managed on a centralized basis, these items are not allocated between operating segments for the purposes of the information presented to the CODM and are accordingly omitted from the detailed segmental analysis below. There are no asymmetrical allocations to reporting segments which would require disclosure. 
 Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings from continuing operations before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion, amortization, loss on impairments, gain/loss on divestitures and unrealized gain/loss on investments, income/loss from equity method investments, substantial acquisition-related costs and pension expense/income excluding current service cost component.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 Introduction 
 Our Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD A) is intended to convey management s perspective regarding operational and financial performance for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. This MD A should be read in conjunction with the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes appearing in Part I, Item 1. "Financial Statements of this Quarterly Report. 
 The following discussion contains trend information and forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those discussed in or implied by these forward-looking statements, as well as from our historical performance, due to various factors, including those discussed elsewhere in this Quarterly Report, particularly "Forward-Looking Statements," and Item 1A. "Risk Factors" in our 2023 Form 10-K and in our other filings with the SEC. Our operating results depend upon economic cycles, seasonal and other weather related conditions, and trends in government expenditures, among other factors. Accordingly, financial results for any financial period presented, or period-to-period comparisons of reported results, may not be indicative of future operating results. 

Overview 
 CRH is a leading provider of building materials solutions that build, connect and improve our world. Since its formation in 1970, CRH has evolved from being a supplier of base materials to providing end-to-end value-added solutions that solve complex construction challenges for our customers. CRH works closely with customers across the entire project lifecycle from planning, design, manufacture, installation and maintenance through to end-of-life recycling, using our engineering and innovation expertise to provide superior materials, products and services. 
 The Company integrates essential material s (aggregates and cement), val ue-added building pro ducts and construction services to provide our customers with complete end-to-end solutions. CRH s capabilities, innovation and technical expertise enable it to be a valuable partner for transportation and critical utility infrastructure projects, complex non-residential construction and outdoor living solutions. 
 Operating in 28 countries, the Company has market leadership positions in North America and Europe. The United States is expected to be a key driver of future growth for CRH due to continued economic expansion, a growing population and significant public investment in construction. Our European business benefits from strong economic and construction growth prospects across Central and Eastern Europe as well as recurring repair and remodel demand in Western Europe. In both geographies there is significant government support for infrastructure and increasing demand for integrated solutions in major infrastructure and commercial projects. 
 CRH has a proven track record in value creation through acquisitions which over the last decade has accounted for approximately two-thirds of the Company s growth. We achieve this by acquiring businesses at attractive valuations and creating value by integrating them with our existing operations and generating synergies. The Company takes an active approach to portfolio management and continuously reviews the competitive landscape for attractive investment and divestiture opportunities to deliver further growth and value creation for shareholders. 
 Seasonality 
 Activity in the construction industry is dependent to a considerable extent on the seasonal impact of weather on the Company s operating locations, with periods of higher activity in some markets during spring and summer which may reduce significantly in winter due to inclement weather. In addition to impacting demand for our products and services, adverse weather can negatively impact production processes for a variety of reasons. For example, workers may not be able to work outdoors in sustained high temperatures, heavy rainfall and/or other unfavorable weather conditions. Therefore, financial results for any particular quarter do not necessarily indicate the results expected for the full year. 
 Financial performance highlights

Capital allocation highlights 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 
 Cash paid to shareholders through dividends was 1.5 billion, compared with 0.8 billion in t he first nine months of t he prior year. CRH transitioned to quarterly dividends during the first quarter of 2024, with a quarterly dividend of 0.35 per share declared in February 2024, May 202 4 and August 2024 and a fourth quarterly dividend of 0.35 per share announced on November 7, 2024, repr esenting an annualized increase of 5 on the prior year; 
 Cash returned to shareholders through share buybacks was 1.0 billio n, a decrease of 1.0 billion versus the first nine months of the prior year. On November 6, 2024, the latest tranche of the share buyback program was completed, bringing the year-to-date cash returned to 1.2 billion.

 28 acquisitions were completed for total consideration of 3.9 billion, compared wit h 0.6 billion in the first nine months of the prior year. A further 1.6 billion was invested in development and replacement capital expenditure projects, compared with 1.2 billion for the comparable 2023 period. 
 
 Development Review 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, CRH completed 12 acquisitions for a total consideration of 1.4 billion, compared with 0.4 billion in the same period of 2023. Americas Materials Solutions compl eted seven acquisitions, Americas Building Solutions completed three acquisitions and Europe Materials Solutions completed two acquisitions. 
 Overall, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, CRH completed 28 acquisitions for a total consideration of 3.9 billion, compared with 0.6 billion in the first nine months of the prior year. On July 1, 2024, CRH completed the acquisition of a majority stake in Adbri Ltd (Adbri) for a total consideration of 0.8 billion. Adbri is an integrated materials business with high-quality assets and leading market positions in Australia that complements our core competencies in cement, concrete and aggregates and creates additional growth and development opportunities for our existing Australian business. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, cash proceeds from divestitures and disposals of long-lived assets were 0.1 billion, including the third and final phase of the divestiture of the European Lime operations, which was completed on August 30, 2024. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, CRH realized cash proceeds from divestitures and disposals of long-lived assets of 1.2 billion, primarily related to the divestiture of the European Lime operations. No divestitures occurred in the first nine months of the prior year. 
 
 Outlook 
 We are pleased to reaffirm our guidance midpoint for 2024, reflecting the continued strength of our financial performance, the positive underlying momentum in our business as well as the positive contribution from portfolio activity. 2 
 Looking ahead to 2025 and notwithstanding some macroeconomic uncertainties, we expect positive underlying demand across our key end-use markets, underpinned by significant public investment in infrastructure and re-industrialization activity. A lower interest rate environment is expected to aid a gradual recovery in new-build residential construction activity. Through a combination of continued positive price momentum, favorable underlying demand and the benefits of our integrated, value-based solutions strategy we expect another year of progress in 2025. 

2 The above guidance does not reflect the potential Q4 impairment in the range of 0.3- 0.4 billion. See the discussion within 'Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates' on page 36.

 Total revenues 
 Total revenues were 10.5 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 0.4 billion, or 4 , compared with the third quarter of 2023, driven by continued pricing progress and contributions from acquisitions partly offset by lower activity levels in certain regions due to adverse weather and divestitures. 
 Similar trends were experienced for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 resulting in total revenues of 26.7 billion, an increase of 0.4 billion or 2 from the first nine months of 2023. 
 For additional discussion on segment revenues, see Segments section on pages 28 to 31. 
 Gross profit 
 Gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was 4.1 billion, an increase of 0.3 billion, or 8 , from the same period in 2023, reflecting total revenues increase of 4 , while total cost of revenues increased by 1 . The gross profit margin of 38.6 increased 140bps from 37.2 for the third quarter of the prior year. Total cost of revenues increased primarily as a result of an increase in labor costs of 9 and 18 higher depreciation charges mainly due to acquisitions. These were partly offset by lower energy costs of 13 . 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, gross profit was 9.5 billion, an increase of 0.5 billion, or 6 , from the same period in 2023, with total revenues 2 ahead of the same period in 2023, while total cost of revenues decreased by 1 . The gross profit margin of 35.7 increased 140bps from 34.3 for the first nine months of the prior year. Total cost of revenues decreased from the first nine months of the prior year, with a 19 reduction in energy costs due to divestitures, a decline in energy prices and lower activity levels. These were partly offset by labor cost increases of 7 . 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses 
 Selling, general and administrative (SG A) expenses, which are primarily comprised of haulage costs, labor costs, and other selling and administration expenses, were 2.2 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 0.2 billion, or 10 , from the comparable 2023 period. This increase was primarily due to labor cost increases of 13 as a result of increased headcount from acquisitions, and wage inflation along with a 6 increase in haulage costs, mainly driven by acquisitions. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, SG A expenses were 5.9 billion, an increase of 0.3 billion, or 5 , from the comparable 2023 period. SG A expenses increased primarily due to labor cost increases of 10 as a result of higher headcount from acquisitions, and wage inflation.

 CRH Form 10-Q 26 

Gain on disposal of long-lived assets 
 Gain on disposal of long-lived assets was 89 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 74 million compared with 2023, an d 199 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 161 million. The increase mainly related to the disposal of certain land assets. 
 Interest income 
 Interest income was 33 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 29 million from the comparable period in 2023, and 112 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 26 million from the comparable period in 2023, in both instances, primarily due to lower levels of cash deposits. 
 Interest expense 
 Interest expense was 164 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 33 million from the comparable period in 2023, and 452 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 167 million from the prior period. The increases were primarily due to higher gross debt balances. 
 Other nonoperating income, net 
 Other nonoperating income, net, was 62 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 1 million in the comparable period for 2023. Other nonoperating income, net, includes pension and postretirement benefit costs (excluding service costs), gains and losses from divestitures, and other miscellaneous income and expenses. The increase in other nonoperating income, net, was primarily related to gain s on div estitures. 
 Other nonoperating income, net, was 246 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 3 million in the comparable period for 2023. The increase in other nonoperating income, net, was primarily related to gains on the completed divestiture of the Company's European Lime operations and unrealized gains on certain investments. 
 Income tax 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had an income tax expense of 531 million, compared to 416 million for the comparable period in 2023. The effective tax rate was 28 for the third quarter in 2024 compared with an effective tax rate of 24 for the third quarter in 2023. The movement in the effective tax rate was mainly driven by the timing of discrete items occurring throughout the year, including non-deductible acquisition-related costs in the third quarter. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had an income tax expense of 942 million compared to 781 million for the comparable period in 2023. The effective tax rate was 25 for the first nine months of 2024 compared with an effective tax rate of 24 for the same period in 2023. The movement in the effective tax rate was primarily due to a change in the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with a higher rate of tax and non-deductible acquisition-related costs which is partially offset by items arising in the first quarter (being the movement in tax provisions, a tax deduction for share-based compensation and the largely tax-exempt divestiture of phases one and two of the European Lime operations). 
 Income from equity method investments 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, a gain of 25 million was recorded in equity method investments, an increase of 11 million from the comparable period in 2023 and a gain of 27 million was recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 6 million from the comparable period in 2023. 
 Net income 
 Net income was 1.4 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 0.1 billion from the comparable period in 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 net income increased by 0.3 billion to 2.8 billion. The results with respect to prior year comparative periods were primarily driven by higher gross profit along with higher gains on disposal of long-lived assets and divestitures, which offset higher interest expenses and higher SG A expenses. 
 Net income attributable to CRH plc and earnings per share 
 Net income attributable to CRH plc was 1.4 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 0.1 billion from the comparable period in 2023. Basic EPS for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was 1.99, compared with 1.81 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Net income attributable to CRH plc was 2.8 billion f or the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 0.3 billion from the comparable period in 2023. Basic EPS for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 4.03, compared with 3.36 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 Americas Materials Solutions total revenues were 4 ahead of the third quarter of 2023. Continued positive pricing across all lines of business was partly offset by adverse weather impacting volumes, resulting in organic total revenues 1 ahead of the prior year. 
 In Essential Materials, total revenues increased by 5 driven by pricing growth in both aggregates and cement, ahead by 10 and 9 , respectively. Cement volumes increased by 1 , as acquisition activity offset the adverse impact of major hurricanes. Aggregates volumes declined by 4 , negatively impacted by adverse weather. 
 In Road Solutions, total revenues increased by 4 driven by improved pricing across all lines of business and continued funding support relating to the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) more than offsetting challenging weather in certain regions. Paving and construction revenue increased by 3 with growth in the Northeast and West regions. Construction backlogs were ahead of the prior year supported by positive momentum in bidding activity.

Non-GAAP Reconciliation and Supplementary Information 
 CRH uses a number of non-GAAP performance measures to monitor financial performance. These measures are referred to throughout the discussion of our reported financial position and operating performance on a continuing operations basis unless otherwise defined and are measures which are regularly reviewed by CRH management. These performance measures may not be uniformly defined by all companies and accordingly may not be directly comparable with similarly titled measures and disclosures by other companies. 
 Certain information presented is derived from amounts calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP but is not itself an expressly permitted GAAP measure. The non-GAAP performance measures as summarized below should not be viewed in isolation or as an alternative to the equivalent GAAP measure. 
 Adjusted EBITDA: Adjusted EBITDA is d efined as earnings from continuing operations before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion, amortization, loss on impair ments, gain/loss on divestitures and unrealized gain/loss on investments, i ncome/loss from equity method investments, substantial acquisition-related costs and pension expense/income excluding current service cost component. It is quoted by management in conjunction with other GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures to aid investors in their analysis of the performance of the Company. Adjusted EBITDA by segment is monitored by management in order to allocate resources between segments and to assess performance. Adjusted EBITDA margin is calculated by expressing Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of total revenues. 
 Reconciliation to its nearest GAAP measure is presented below:

Expenses in the third quarter of 2024 primarily include legal and consulting expenses related to these non-routine substantial acquisitions. 
 Net Debt: Net Debt is used by management as it gives additional insight into the Company s current debt position less available cash. Net Debt is provided to enable investors to see the economic effect of gross debt, related hedges and cash and cash equivalents in total. Net Debt comprises short and long-term debt, finance lease liabilities, cash and cash equivalents and current and noncurrent derivative financial instruments (net) .

Organic Revenue and Organic Adjusted EBITDA: CRH pursues a strategy of growth through acquisitions and investments, with total spend on acquisitions and investments of 3.9 billion in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 0.6 billion for the same period in 2023. Acquisitions completed in 2023 and the first nine months of 2024 contributed incremental total revenues of 0.6 billion and Adjusted EBITDA of 0.1 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and total revenues of 1.0 billion and Adjusted EBITDA of 0.2 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Cash proceeds from divestitures and disposals of long-lived assets amounted to 1.2 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 0.1 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The total revenues impact of divestitures was a negative 0.2 billion and the impact at an Adjusted EBITDA level was a negative 46 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the total revenues impact of divestitures was a negative 0.5 billion and the impact at an Adjusted EBITDA level was a negative 0.1 billion. 
 The U.S. Dollar weakened against most major currencies during the three months ended September 30, 2024, from the comparable period in 2023, resulting in an overall positive currency exchange impact. 
 Because of the impact of acquisitions, divestitures, currency exchange translation and other non-recurring items on reported results each reporting period, CRH uses organic revenue and organic Adjusted EBITDA as additional performance indicators to assess performance of pre-existing (also referred to as underlying, like-for-like or ongoing) operations each reporting period. 
 Organic revenue and organic Adjusted EBITDA are arrived at by excluding the incremental revenue and Adjusted EBITDA contributions from current and prior year acquisitions and divestitures, the impact of exchange translation, and the impact of any one-off items. In Part I, Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section on pages 28 to 31, changes in organic revenue and organic Adjusted EBITDA are presented as additional measures of revenue and Adjusted EBITDA to provide a greater understanding of the performance of the Company. Organic change is calculated by expressing the organic movement as a percentage of the prior year reporting period (adjusted for currency exchange effects). A reconciliation of the changes in organic revenue and organic Adjusted EBITDA to the changes in total revenues and Adjusted EBITDA by segment is presented with the discussion within each segment s performance in tables contained in the segment discussion in Part I, Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations commencing on page 26. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 The Company s primary source of incremental liquidity is cash flows from operating activities, which combined with the cash and cash equivalents balance, the U.S. Dollar and Euro Commercial Paper Programs, and committed credit lines, is expected to be sufficient to meet the Company s working capital needs, c apital expenditures, dividends, share repurchases, upcoming debt maturities, and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations for the foreseeable future. In addition, the Company believes that it will have the ability to fund additional acquisitions via cash flows from internally available cash, cash flows from operating activities and, subject to market conditions, via obtaining additional borrowings and/or issuing additional debt or equity securities. 
 Total short and long-term debt was 13.9 billion at September 30, 2024, compared to 11.6 billion at December 31, 2023, and 11.4 billion at September 30, 2023. I n January 2024, 600 million 1.875 euro Senior Notes were repaid on maturity. In May 2024, wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company completed the issuance of 750 million 5.20 Senior Notes due 2029 and 750 million 5.40 Senior Notes due 2034. In July 2024, as part of the Adbri acquisition 0.5 billion of external debt was acquired. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a net 0.6 billion of commercial paper was issued across the U.S. Dollar and Euro Commercial Paper Programs. 
 Net Debt at September 30, 2024, was 11.2 billion, compared to 5.4 billion at December 31, 2023, and 5.9 billion at September 30, 2023. The increase in Net Debt 7 compared to December 31, 2023, reflects acquisitions, cash returns to shareholders through dividends and continued share buybacks, as well as the purchase of property, plant and equipment, partially offset by inflows from operating activities and proceeds from divestitures. 
 CRH continued its ongoing share buyback program in the first nine months of 2024 repurchasing approximately 13.2 million ordinary shares for a total consideration of 1.0 billion and the Company is commencing an additional 0.3 billion tranche to be completed no later t han February 26, 20 25. The Company also made cash dividend payment s of 1.5 b illion in the first nine months of 2024. 
 Other than items updated in this Quarterly Report, CRH's financial condition and the nature and composition of the Company s material cash requirements, which include debt service and related interest payments, operating lease obligations, share repurchase commitments and other purchase obligations arising in the normal course of business, have not materially changed from those disclosed in the 2023 Form 10-K. 
 Cash flows 
 At September 30, 2024, CRH had cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash of 3.1 billion compared with 5.7 billion at September 30, 2023. 
 At September 30, 2024, CRH had outstanding total short and long-term debt of 13.9 billion compared with 11.4 billion at September 30, 2023. 
 Total lease liabilities were 1.6 billion compared with 1.4 billion at September 30, 2023. 
 At September 30, 2024, CRH had 4.0 billion of undrawn committed facilities, almost all of which, are available until May 2029. At September 30, 2024, the weighted average maturity of the term debt (net of cash and cash equivalents) was 7.5 years. 
 
 Cash flows from operating activities 
 Nine months ended September 30 in millions 2024 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 2,259 2,594 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 2.3 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 0.3 billion, compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to higher outflows related to working capital which offset an increase in net income.

Capital expenditure totaled 1.6 billion in the first nine months of 2024, resulting in an increased outflow of 0.5 billion versus the comparable prior year period. These outflows were partially offset by 1.1 billion of increased proceeds from divestitures and disposals of long-lived assets, primarily related to the completed divestiture of the European Lime operations and the divestiture of certain operations in Canada. 
 
 Cash flows from financing activities Nine months ended September 30 in millions 2024 2023 Net cash used in financing activities (1,144) (1,097) 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 1.1 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, in line with the comparable period in the prior year. Proceeds from debt issuances were 3.5 billion compared to 2.7 billion for the first nine months of 2023, an increase of 0.8 billion, which was primarily related to the issuance and sale of 750 million 5.20 Senior Notes due 2029 and 750 million 5.40 Senior Notes due 2034, as well as the issuance of 1.8 billion under the Company s commercial paper programs in the first nine months of 2024. Payments on debt in the first nine months of 2024 were 1.9 billion, primarily the repayment of the 600 million 1.875 euro Senior Notes on maturity in January 2024 as well as the repayment of 1.2 billion issued under the Company s commercial paper programs. This is compared with 0.9 billion in the prior year relating to the repayment of the 750 million 3.125 euro Senior Notes which were repaid on maturity in April 2023.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 There have been no material changes during the three months ended September 30, 2024, to our critical accounting policies and/or estimates disclosed in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 The results of the Company s third quarter impairment assessment indicated increased risk of impairment as a result of certain recent challenging market conditions which may impact future growth prospects, resulting in reduced headroom. Arising from the Company s ongoing sensitivity analysis, potential non-cash impairment charges of 0.3- 0.4 billion, representing the range of possible outcomes and based on reasonably possible changes in key assumptions, may be recognized in its results for the quarter and year ending December 31, 2024. These potential impairment charges relate to the Company s equity method investment in China and the Architectural Products reporting unit in the Europe Building Solutions segment. 
 The Company s equity method investment in China and the Company's Architectural Products reporting unit have observed challenging market conditions which may adversely impact their longer-term forecast projections. If current projections for the Company's equity method investment in China and the Architectural Products reporting unit decrease, this may result in their carrying value exceeding their fair value. 
 CRH Form 10-Q 36 

The Company s annual goodwill impairment assessment is ongoing in parallel with its annual five-year strategic planning process. The Company s assessment is expected to conclude in December 2024, when the five-year strategic plan document, which will incorporate our estimate of the potential impact of the recent market challenges noted above, is approved by the Board of Directors. 
 Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors, as set out in the Critical Accounting Estimates in the Company s 2023 Form 10-K.

CRH Form 10-Q 37 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 CRH is exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in foreign exchange risks, interest rates, and commodity prices. Changes in those factors could impact the Company s results of operations and financial condition. Financial risk management at the Company seeks to minimize the negative impact of foreign exchange, interest rate and commodity price fluctuations on the Company s earnings, cash flows and equity. Management provides oversight for risk management and derivative activities, determines certain of the Company s financial risk policies and objectives, and provides guidelines for derivative instrument utilization. 
 To manage these risks, CRH uses various derivative financial instruments, including interest rate swaps, foreign exchange forwards and swaps, and commodity contracts. CRH only uses commonly traded and non-leveraged instruments. These contracts are entered into primarily with major banking institutions and utility companies, while CRH actively monitors its exposure to counterparty risk through the use of counterparty approvals and credit limits, thereby managing the risk of counterparty loss. 
 The following discussion presents the sensitivity of the market value, earnings and cash flows of the Company s financial instruments to hypothetical changes in interest and exchange rates assuming these changes occurred at September 30, 2024. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 CRH may be impacted by interest rate volatility with respect to existing debt and future debt issuances as well as cash balances. For fixed rate debt instruments, interest rate changes affect the fair market value but do not impact earnings or cash flows. Conversely, for floating rate debt instruments, interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value of the instrument but impact future earnings and cash flows, assuming that other factors are held constant. Cash balances are held on short-term deposits and changing interest rates will impact deposit interest income earned. The Company uses interest rate swaps to convert a portion of its fixed rate debt to floating rate debt and these may be designated and qualify as fair value hedges. Under these arrangements, the Company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and benchmark floating interest rates calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. 
 At September 30, 2024, of total debt including overdrafts, finance leases and the impact of derivatives, the Company had fixed rate debt of 10.4 billion and floating rate debt of 3.8 billion, representing 74 and 26 respectively. The equivalent figures as at December 31, 2023, were fixed rate debt of 9.1 billion and floating rate debt of 2.7 billion, representing 77 and 23 respectively, and as at September 30, 2023, fixed rate debt of 9.4 billion and floating rate debt of 2.2 billion, representing 81 and 19 respectively. The Company s interest rate swaps at September 30, 2024 whereby the Company swaps from fixed interest rates to floating interest rates, were 1.4 billion, compared to 1.4 billion as at December 31, 2023 and 1.4 billion as at September 30, 2023. The Company s interest rate swaps at September 30, 2024 whereby the Company swaps from floating interest rates to fixed interest rates, were 0.2 billion, compared to nil billion as at December 31, 2023 and nil billion as at September 30, 2023. Cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2024, were 3.0 billion, compared to 6.4 billion at December 31, 2023 and 5.7 billion at September 30, 2023, which was all held on short-term deposits and investments. 
 Sensitivity to interest rate moves 
 At September 30, 2024, the before-tax earnings and cash flows impact of a 100bps increase in interest rates, including the offsetting impact of derivatives, on the variable rate cash and debt portfolio would be approximately 8 million unfavorable 37 million favorable at December 31, 2023 and 35 million favorable at September 30, 2023). 
 Foreign Exchange Rate Risk 
 CRH s exchange rate exposures result primarily from its investments and ongoing operations in countries outside of the United States and other business transactions such as the procurement of products, services and equipment from foreign sources. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may affect (i) the carrying value of the Company s net investment in foreign subsidiaries; (ii) the translation of foreign currency earnings; and (iii) the cash flows related to foreign currency denominated transactions. 
 Where economically feasible, the Company maintains Net Debt 8 in the same relative ratio as capital employed to act as an economic hedge of the underlying currency assets. Where it is not feasible to do so, the Company may enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge a portion of the net investment against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations. These transactions are designated as net investment hedges. 
 The Company also enters into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows denominated in foreign currencies. These transactions are designated as cash flow hedges. In addition, the Company may enter into foreign currency contracts that are not designated in hedging relationships to offset, in part, the impacts of changes in value of various non-functional currency denominated items including certain intercompany financing balances. The U.S. Dollar equivalent gross notional amount of the Company s foreign exchange forward contracts was 4.4 billion at September 30, 2024, compared to 1.6 billion at December 31, 2023 and 1.7 billion at September 30, 2023. 
 Holding all other variables constant, if there was a 10 weakening in foreign currency exchange rates versus U.S. Dollar for the portfolio, the fair market value of foreign currency contracts outstanding at September 30, 2024, would decrease by approximately 104 million, which would be largely offset by a gain on the foreign currency fluctuation of the underlying exposure being hedged. In comparison, the fair market value of foreign currency contracts outstanding at December 31, 2023 would increase by approximately 2 million and at September 30, 2023, would increase by approximately 18 million, largely offset by a loss on the underlying exposure being hedged. 
 Commodity Price Risk 
 Some of the Company s products use significant amounts of commodity-priced materials, predominantly oil, electricity, coal and carbon credits which are subject to price changes based upon fluctuations in the commodities market. This price volatility could potentially have a material impact on our financial condition and/or our results of operations. Where feasible, the Company manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts and forward contracts to manage operating costs. The Company monitors commodity trends and where possible has alternative sourcing plans in place to mitigate the risk of supplier concentration and passing commodity-related inflation to customers or suppliers. 
 Where appropriate, the Company also has a number of derivative hedging programs in place to hedge commodity risks, with the aim of the programs being to neutralize variability arising from changes in associated commodity indices. The timeframe for such programs can be up to four years.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Management has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Securities Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e) as of September 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive and the Chief Financial Officer have concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of such date at the level of providing reasonable assurance. 
 In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management, including the Chief Executive and the Chief Financial Officer, recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
 Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting .

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 CRH and its subsidiaries are from time to time parties to various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business, including some in which claims for damages have been asserted against CRH. Having taken appropriate advice, we believe that the aggregate outcome of such proceedings will not have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. 
 CRH has elected to use a 1 million threshold for disclosing certain proceedings under environmental laws to which a governmental authority is a party. Applying this threshold, there were no relevant legal proceedings to disclose for this period.

 Exhibit 95.1 - Disclosure of MSHA Safety Data Q3 2024 

Exhibit 95.1 
 Disclosure of Mine Safety and Health Administration MSHA Safety Data 
 CRH is committed to the health and safety of its employees and to providing an incident free workplace. The Company maintains a comprehensive 
 health and safety program that includes extensive training for all employees and contractors, site inspections, emergency response preparedness, crisis 
 communications training, incident investigation, regulatory compliance training and process auditing. 
 CRH s U.S. aggregate quarry and mine operations are subject to Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) regulation under the Federal Mine 
 Safety and Health Act of 1977 (the Mine Act ). MSHA inspects our mines on a regular basis and issues various citations and orders when it believes 
 a violation has occurred under the Mine Act. Whenever MSHA issues a citation or order, it also generally proposes a civil penalty, or fine, related to 
 the alleged violation. 
 During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, none of our mining operations received orders under section 104(b) written notice from MSHA of a 
 flagrant violation under section 110(b)(2), notice of pattern of violations under section 104(e) or potential to have pattern under section 104(e) of the 
 Mine Act. For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we experienced one fatality at our East Quarry mine (Mine ID 3400050). 
 The information in the table below reflects citations and orders MSHA issued to CRH during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, as reflected in our 
 records. The data in our system may not match or reconcile with the data MSHA maintains on its public website. In evaluating this information, 
 consideration should also be given to factors such as (i) the number of citations and orders may vary depending on the size and operation of the mine 
 (ii) the number of citations issued may vary from inspector to inspector and mine to mine and (iii) citations and orders may be contested and 
 appealed, and in that process, may be reduced in severity and amount, and may be dismissed.

(1) MSHA assigns an identification number to each mine or operation and may or may not assign separate identification numbers to related facilities. The 
 information provided in this table is presented by mine identification number. 
 (2) The definition of mine under Section 3 of the Mine Act includes the mine, as well as other items used in, or to be used in, or resulting from, the work of 
 extracting minerals, such as land, structures, facilities, equipment, machines, tools, and preparation facilities. Unless otherwise indicated, any of these 
 other items associated with a single mine have been aggregated in the totals for that mine. 
 (3) Represents the total number of citations issued by MSHA, for violation of health or safety standards that could significantly and substantially contribute to a 
 serious injury if left unabated. If MSHA determines that a violation of a mandatory health or safety standard is reasonably likely to result in a reasonably 
 serious injury or illness under the unique circumstance contributed to by the violation, MSHA will classify the violation as a significant and substantial 
 violation. 
 (4) Represents the total number of orders issued, which represents a failure to abate a citation under section 104(a) within the period prescribed by MSHA. 
 (5) Represents the total number of citations and orders issued by MSHA of the Mine Act for unwarrantable failure to comply with mandatory health or safety 
 standards. These violations are similar to those described above, but the standard is that the violation could significantly and substantially contribute to the 
 cause and effect of a safety or health hazard, but the conditions do not cause imminent danger, and the MSHA inspector finds that the violation is caused 
 by an unwarranted failure of the operator to comply with the health and safety standards. 
 (6) Represents the total number of imminent danger orders issued under section 107(a) of the Mine Act. These orders are issued for situations in which MSHA 
 determines an imminent danger exists in the quarry or mine and results in orders of immediate withdrawal of all persons (except certain authorised persons) 
 from the area of the quarry or mine affected by its condition until the imminent danger and the underlying conditions causing the imminent danger no longer 
 exist. 
 (7) Represents whether a mine has received a written notice of a pattern of violations of mandatory health or safety standards that are of such nature as could 
 have significantly and substantially contributed to the cause and effect of our mine health or safety hazards under section 104(e) of the Mine Act. 
 (8) Represents whether a mine has received a written notice of the potential to have a pattern of violations of mandatory health or safety standards that are of 
 such nature as could have significantly and substantially contributed to the cause and effect of our mine health or safety hazards under section 104(e) of the 
 Mine Act. 
 (9) Total dollar value of proposed assessments from MSHA under the Mine Act. These are the amounts of proposed assessments issued by MSHA with each 
 citation or order for the time period covered by the reports. Penalties are assessed by MSHA according to a formula that considers a number of factors, 
 including the mine operator s history, size, negligence, gravity of the violation, good faith in trying to correct the violation promptly, and the effect of the 
 penalty on the operator s ability to continue in business. 
 (10) Pending legal actions before the Commission as required to be reported by Section 1503(a)(3) of the Dodd-Frank Act. All 16 pending legal actions are 
 contests of proposed penalties referenced in Subpart C of 29 CFR Part 2700. There are no contests of citations and orders referenced in Subpart B of 29 
 CFR Part 2700 no complaints of discharge, discrimination or interference referenced in Subpart E of 29 CFR Part 2700 no complaints for compensation 
 referenced in Subpart D of 29 CFR Part 2700 no applications for temporary relief referenced in Subpart F of 29 CFR Part 2700 and no appeals of judges 
 decisions or orders to the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission referenced in Subpart H of 29 CFR Part 2700.
