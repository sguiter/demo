Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking
Statements 

Certain statements that
we make from time to time, including statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q constitute forward-looking statements 
within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,
or the Securities Act, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. All statements other than
statements of historical fact contained in this Form 10-Q are forward-looking statements. These statements, among other things, relate
to our business strategy, goals and expectations concerning our future operations, prospects, plans and objectives of management. The
words anticipate , believe , continue , could , estimate , expect ,
 intend , may , plan , predict , project , will , and similar
terms and phrases are used to identify forward-looking statements in this presentation. 

Our operations involve
risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside our control, and any one of which, or a combination of which, could materially affect
our results of operations and whether the forward-looking statements ultimately prove to be correct. We have based these forward-looking
statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and trends that we believe may affect our financial
condition, results of operations, business strategy, short-term and long-term business operations and objectives, and financial needs.
Forward-looking statements in this Form 10-Q include, without limitation, statements reflecting management s expectations for future
financial performance and operating expenditures (including our ability to continue as a going concern, to raise additional capital and
to succeed in our future operations), expected growth, profitability and business outlook and increased operating expenses. 

Forward-looking statements
are only current predictions and are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and other factors that may cause our actual results,
levels of activity, performance, or achievements to be materially different from those anticipated by such statements. These factors include,
among other things, the unknown risks and uncertainties that we believe could cause actual results to differ from these forward looking
statements as set forth under the heading, Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31,
2023. New risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of the risks and uncertainties
that could have an impact on the forward-looking statements, including without limitation, risks and uncertainties relating to our ability
to: 

reverse the recent decline in
our revenue and resume growing our revenue; 

resolve the various litigation proceedings pending against us on favorable terms or at all; 

obtain additional financing in sufficient amounts or on acceptable terms so that we can fund our business plan; 

reduce our dependence on third-party subcontractors to perform some of the work on our contracts; 

mitigate the impact of new or changed laws, regulations or other industry standards that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business; 

mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our revenues; 

adopt and master new technologies and adjust certain fixed costs and expenses to adapt to our industry s and customers evolving demands; and 

mitigate the impact of changes in general market, economic and political conditions in the United States and global economies or financial markets, including those resulting from natural or man-made disasters. 

Although we believe that
the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-Q are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results,
levels of activity, performance, or achievements. In light of inherent risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the future events and trends
discussed in this Form 10-Q may not occur and actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated or implied in
the forward-looking statements. Except as required by law, we are under no duty to update or revise any of such forward-looking statements,
whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, after the date of this Form 10-Q. 

You should read this Form
10-Q with the understanding that our actual future results, levels of activity, performance and events and circumstances may be materially
different from what we expect. 

All references to SCWorx, 
 we, us, our or the Company mean SCWorx Corp., a Delaware corporation, and where
appropriate, its wholly owned subsidiaries.

SCWorx Corp. 

Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 

(Unaudited) 

. To facilitate the planned acquisition by Alliance
MMA, Inc., a Delaware corporation Alliance ), on June 27, 2018, SCW LLC merged with and into a newly-formed entity, SCWorx
Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation SCW Acquisition ), with SCW Acquisition being the surviving entity. Subsequently,
on August 17, 2018, SCW Acquisition changed its name to SCWorx Corp. On November 30, 2018, the Company and certain of its stockholders
agreed to cancel shares of common stock. In June 2018, the Company began to collect subscriptions for common stock. From June to
November 2018, the Company collected in subscriptions and issued shares of common stock to new third-party investors.
In addition, on February 1, 2019, (i) SCWorx Corp. (f/k/a SCWorx Acquisition Corp.) changed its name to SCW FL Corp. (to allow Alliance
to change its name to SCWorx Corp.) and (ii) Alliance acquired SCWorx Corp. (n/k/a SCW FL Corp.) in a stock-for-stock exchange transaction
and changed Alliance s name to SCWorx Corp., which is the Company s current name, with SCW FL Corp. becoming the Company s
subsidiary. On March 16, 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, SCWorx established a wholly-owned subsidiary, Direct-Worx, LLC to
endeavor to source and provide critical, difficult-to-find items for the healthcare industry which it has since ceased. 

On October 6, 2023, following
stockholder approval at the Company s annual meeting, the Company amended its certificate of incorporation to implement a reverse split of its common stock. The reverse stock split was effective at the opening of the trading day on October 11, 2023. 

The effects of the reverse
stock split have been reflected in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for all periods presented.

for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and for the year ended
December 31, 2023. The accumulated deficit as of September 30, 2024 was . The Company has not yet achieved profitability and
expects to continue to incur cash outflows from operations. It is expected that its operating losses will continue and, as a result, the
Company will eventually need to generate significant increases in product revenues to achieve profitability. These conditions indicate
that there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the financial statement
issuance date. 

As of the filing date of this
Report, the Company has only limited cash on hand, and management believes that there may not be sufficient capital resources from operations
and existing financing arrangements in order to meet operating expenses and working capital requirements for the next twelve months. 

Accordingly, the Company is
evaluating various alternatives, including reducing operating expenses, securing additional financing through debt or equity securities
to fund future business activities and other strategic alternatives. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to generate
the level of operating revenues in its business plan, or if additional sources of financing will be available on acceptable terms, if
at all. If no additional sources of financing are available, our future operating prospects may be adversely affected. The unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the CARES ACT ). The funds were received from Bank of America through

the economic slowdown caused by COVID-19 by providing forgivable loans to qualifying businesses for up to 2.5 times their average monthly
payroll costs. The amount borrowed under the CARES Act and used for payroll costs, rent, mortgage interest, and utility costs during the
24 week period after the date of loan disbursement is eligible to be forgiven provided that (a) the Company uses the PPP Funds during
the eight week period after receipt thereof, and (b) the PPP Funds are only used to cover payroll costs (including benefits), rent, mortgage
interest, and utility costs. While the full loan amount may be forgiven, the amount of loan forgiveness will be reduced if, among other
reasons, the Company does not maintain staffing or payroll levels or less than of the loan proceeds are used for payroll costs. Principal

shares of the Company s common stock at exercise prices ranging from to per share. The Company valued the warrants

The Company has operating leases for corporate, business and technician

consolidated balance sheets, unless the arrangement includes an option to purchase the underlying asset, or an option to renew the arrangement,
that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise (short-term leases). The Company recognizes lease expense for these leases on a straight-line
bases over the lease term. The Company s only remaining lease is month-to-month. As a practical expedient, the Company elected,
for all office and facility leases, not to separate non-lease components (common-area maintenance costs) from lease components (fixed
payments including rent) and instead to account for each separate lease component and its associated non-lease components as a single
lease component.

for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was an increase of approximately . In assessing the realizability of deferred tax
assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be
realized. The ultimate realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the
periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred income tax liabilities,
projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on consideration of these items, management
has determined that enough uncertainty exists relative to the realization of the deferred income tax asset balances to warrant the application
of a full valuation allowance as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic 

The Company s operations
and business have experienced disruption due to the unprecedented conditions surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic which spread throughout
the United States and the world. The outbreak adversely impacted new customer acquisition. The Company has followed the recommendations
of local health authorities to minimize exposure risk for its team members since the outbreak. 

In addition, the Company s
customers (hospitals) also experienced extraordinary disruptions to their businesses and supply chains, while experiencing unprecedented
demand for health care services related to COVID-19. As a result of these extraordinary disruptions to the Company s customers 
business, the Company s customers were focused on meeting the nation s health care needs in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
As a result, the Company believes that its customers were not able to focus resources on expanding the utilization of the Company s
services, which has adversely impacted the Company s growth prospects, at least until the adverse effects of the pandemic subside.
In addition, the financial impact of COVID-19 on the Company s hospital customers could cause the hospitals to delay payments due
to the Company for services, which could negatively impact the Company s cash flows.

Revenues 

Revenue for the three months
ended September 30, 2024 was 759,724 as compared to 906,099 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was primarily
due to the expiration and non-renewal of certain customer contracts. 

Cost of revenues 

Cost of revenues was 627,148
for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 666,808 for the same period in 2023. The decrease was primarily the result
of staffing reductions. 

Operating expenses 

Operating expenses decreased
 571,199 to 526,074 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 1,097,273 in the same period of 2023. The decrease
is primarily attributable to decreases in legal and professional fees of approximately 50,000, a one time accrual for a legal settlement
of approximately 470,000 and stock-based compensation of 41,000. We expect operating expenses to remain relatively flat during the rest
of 2024. 

Other income (expense) 

We had other expenses of 31,465
and 276 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, comprised of interest expense. The increase was due
to the issuance of new interest-bearing convertible notes as well as the amortization of note discounts during the current year period. 

Net loss 

For the three months ended
September 30, 2024, we incurred a net loss of 424,963 compared to a net loss of 858,258 for the same period in 2023 due to the factors
detailed above.

Revenue for the nine months
ended September 30, 2024 was 2,313,850 as compared to 2,894,647 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was primarily

Operating expenses decreased
 861,572 to 1,466,637 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 2,328,209 in the same period of 2023. The decrease
is primarily attributable to decreases in salaries and wages of approximately 48,000, a one-time accrual for a legal settlement of approximately
 470,000 and stock-based compensation of 336,000, partially offset by an increase in legal and professional fees of approximately 31,000.
We expect operating expenses to remain relatively flat during the rest of 2024. 

Other income (expense) 

We had other expenses of
 61,834 and 6,208 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, comprised of interest expense. The increase
was largely due to an original interest discount on a loan issued in the current year, the issuance of new interest-bearing convertible
notes as well as the amortization of note discounts during the current year. 

Net loss 

For the nine months ended
September 30, 2024, we incurred a net loss of 940,935 compared to a net loss of 1,412,070 for the same period in 2023 due to the factors

Investing Activities 

The Company did not have any
investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

Financing Activities 

Cash provided by financing
activities was approximately 946,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, consisting of proceeds loans payable of 995,000 partially
offset by repayments of loans payable of 48,000. 

Cash provided by financing activities was approximately
 524,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, consisting of approximately 573,000 in proceeds from the sale of common stock
and 23,000 in proceeds from advances from related party, offset by 48,000 in repayments of notes payable, and 24,000 in repayments
of shareholder advances. 

Liquidity and Going Concern 

Management has concluded that
on our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 conditions exist that
raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern since we may not have sufficient capital resources from operations
and existing financing arrangements to meet our operating expenses and working capital requirements. We have historically incurred operating
losses and may continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future. We believe that these conditions raise substantial doubt
about our ability to continue as a going concern. This may hinder our future ability to obtain financing or may force us to obtain financing
on less favorable terms than would otherwise be available. If we are unable to develop sufficient revenues and additional customers for
our products and services, we may not generate enough revenue to sustain our business, and we may fail, in which case our stockholders
would suffer a total loss of their investment. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue as a going concern. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

As September 30, 2024 and
December 31, 2023, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
About Market Risk 

We are a smaller reporting
company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information under this item. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Management conducted an evaluation
of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures Disclosure Controls ), as defined by Rules 13a-15(e) and
15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act, as of September 30, 2024, the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q, as required by Rules
13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) of the Exchange Act. The Disclosure Controls evaluation was done under the supervision and with the participation
of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, based on the 2013 framework and criteria established
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system
of Disclosure Controls. Accordingly, even effective Disclosure Controls can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control
objectives. Based upon this evaluation, our President and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, due to deficiencies in the design
of internal controls and lack of segregation of duties, our Disclosure Controls were not effective as of September 30, 2024, such
that the Disclosure Controls did not ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed under the Exchange Act
is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and
(ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons
performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting. 

During the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2024, there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under
the Exchange Act) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

26 

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 

In conducting our business,
we may become involved in legal proceedings. We will accrue a liability for such matters when it is probable that a liability has been
incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. When only a range of possible loss can be established, the most probable amount in
the range is accrued. If no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range, the minimum amount in
the range is accrued. The accrual for a litigation loss contingency might include, for example, estimates of potential damages, outside
legal fees and other directly related costs expected to be incurred.
