Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
 Certain matters within this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q include forward looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The forward-looking statements include our current expectations, assumptions, estimates and projections about the respective business and industry of Holdings and CUSA. They include statements relating to: 
 future revenue, expenses and profitability; 

currency exchange rate and inflationary impacts; 

the future development and expected growth of our business; 

projected capital expenditures; 

access to capital resources; 

attendance at movies generally or in any of the markets in which we operate; 

the number and diversity of popular movies released, the length of exclusive theatrical release windows and our ability to successfully license and exhibit popular films; 

national and international growth in our industry; 

competition from other exhibitors, alternative forms of entertainment and content delivery via streaming and other formats; 

determinations in lawsuits in which we are a party; and 

the ongoing recovery of our business and the motion picture exhibition industry from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2023 writers and actors guilds strikes. 

You can identify forward-looking statements by the use of words such as may, should, could, estimates, predicts, potential, continue, anticipates, believes, plans, expects, future and intends and similar expressions. These statements are neither historical facts nor guarantees of future performance. Instead, they are based only on our current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding the future of our business, future plans and strategies, projections, anticipated events and trends, the economy and other future conditions and are, therefore, subject to risks, inherent uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control and difficult to predict. Such risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in the forward-looking statements. Therefore, you should not rely on any of these forward-looking statements. For a description of our risk factors, please review the Risk Factors section or other sections of, or incorporated by reference to, the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed February 16, 2024. All forward-looking statements attributable to either Holdings or CUSA or persons acting on our behalf, are expressly qualified in their entirety by such risk factors. Forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-Q reflect the views of Holdings and CUSA only as of the date of this Form 10-Q. Neither Holdings nor CUSA undertake any obligation, other than as required by law, to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 
 Unless the context otherwise requires, all references to we, our, us, the Company or Cinemark relate to Cinemark Holdings, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, and all references to CUSA relate to Cinemark USA, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. All references to Latin America relate to Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Peru, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Guatemala, Bolivia and Paraguay.

Share-based awards Holdings considers its unvested restricted stock awards, which contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends, participating securities and includes such participating securities in its computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method. Basic earnings per share for the two classes of stock (common stock and unvested restricted stock) is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock and unvested restricted stock outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted earnings per share is calculated using the weighted average number of shares of common stock plus the potentially dilutive effect of common equivalent shares outstanding determined under both the two-class method and the treasury stock method. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, diluted earnings per share using the treasury stock method was less dilutive than the two-class method; as such, only the two-class method has been included above. Convertible notes, hedges and warrants The 4.50 Convertible Senior Notes, discussed further in Note 14 of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed February 16, 2024, may be considered dilutive in periods in which Holdings has net income. The impact of such dilution on earnings per share is calculated under the if-converted method, which requires that all of the shares of Holdings' common stock issuable upon conversion of the 4.50 Convertible Senior Notes be included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share assuming conversion at the beginning of the reporting period. Also, the interest expense, net of tax, related to the 4.50 Convertible Senior Notes is excluded from the calculation of diluted net income attributable to common stockholders assuming conversion of the 4.50 Convertible Senior Notes at the beginning of the reporting period. The closing price of Holdings' common stock exceeded per share of the initial conversion price of per share) during at least of the last trading days of the quarter ended September 30, 2024 and, therefore, the 4.50 Convertible Senior Notes will be convertible during the fourth quarter of 2024. The if-converted value of the 4.50 Convertible Senior Notes, based on the weighted average closing price of Holdings common stock for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, exceeded the aggregate outstanding principal value of the notes by as of September 30, 2024. Holdings entered into hedge transactions with counterparties in connection with the issuance of the 4.50 Convertible Senior Notes. The convertible note hedge transactions cover, subject to anti-dilution adjustments substantially similar to those applicable to the

 shares of its common stock at a price of approximately per share. Concurrently with entering into the convertible note hedge transactions, Holdings also entered into warrant transactions with each option counterparty whereby Holdings sold to such option counterparty warrants to purchase, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, up to the same number of shares of Holdings' common stock, which initially gives the option counterparties the option to purchase approximately shares at a price of approximately per share. The economic effect of these transactions is to effectively raise the strike price of the 4.50 Convertible Senior Notes to approximately per share of Holdings common stock. .

The notes will mature on . Interest on the 7.00 Senior Notes will be payable on February 1 and August 1 of each year, beginning on February 1, 2025. CUSA incurred debt issuance costs of approximately in connection with the issuance, which were recorded as a reduction of long-term debt on the Company s consolidated balance sheet. Proceeds, net of fees, were used to repay CUSA s aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due March 2026 (the 5.875 Senior Notes ), as discussed below under 5.875 Secured Notes . The remainder of the net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes. The notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several senior unsecured basis by certain of CUSA s subsidiaries, or its guarantors, that guarantee, assume or in any other manner become liable with respect to any of CUSA s or its guarantors other debt. If CUSA cannot make payments on the 7.00 Senior Notes when they are due, CUSA s guarantors must make them instead. The 7.00 Senior Notes and the guarantees are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of CUSA s and its guarantor s existing and future senior debt, including the 5.25 senior notes due 2028 and all borrowings under CUSA s Credit Agreement. The notes and the guarantees will be structurally subordinated to all existing and future debt and other liabilities of CUSA s non-guarantor subsidiaries. The notes and the guarantees will be structurally senior to the 4.50 convertible senior notes due 2025, and all future debt, if any, issued by Holdings that is not guaranteed by CUSA or any of its subsidiaries. CUSA may redeem the 7.00 Senior Notes in whole or in part at any time on or after August 1, 2027 at redemption prices set forth in the indenture governing the 7.00 Senior Notes.

The indenture governing the 7.00 Senior Notes contains covenants that limit, among other things, the ability of CUSA and certain of its subsidiaries to (1) incur or guarantee additional indebtedness, (2) pay dividends or distributions on, or redeem or repurchase, capital stock and make other restricted payments, (3) make certain investments, (4) engage in certain transactions with affiliates, (5) incur or assume certain liens, and (6) consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of its assets. Additionally, upon a change in control, as defined in the indenture governing the 7.00 Senior Notes, CUSA would be required to make an offer to repurchase all of the 7.00 Senior Notes at a price equal to of the aggregate principal amount outstanding plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, through the date of repurchase. 5.875 Secured Notes Concurrently with the 7.00 Senior Notes bond offering discussed above, on , CUSA commenced a cash tender offer to purchase any and all of CUSA s Senior Notes .

Interest Rate Swap Agreements The Company s interest rate swap agreements are used to hedge a portion of the interest rate risk associated with the variable interest rates on the Company s term loan and qualify for cash flow hedge accounting. Effective January 31, 2024, the Company amended and extended one of its then existing notional amount interest rate swap agreements to amend the pay rate and extend the maturity date to . Effective February 29, 2024, the Company amended and extended its other then existing notional amount interest rate swap agreement to amend the pay rate and extend the maturity to . Upon amending each of the interest rate swap agreements, the Company determined that the interest payments hedged with the respective agreements are still probable to occur, therefore the aggregate gains that accumulated on the swaps prior to the amendments of are being amortized to interest expense through the maturity date of the swaps. 

Total 

(1) of the total is included in Prepaid expenses and other and the long-term liability portion of is included in Other long-term liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024 . 

The fair values of the interest rate swaps are recorded on Holdings and CUSA s condensed consolidated balance sheets as an asset or liability with the related gains or losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss. The changes in fair value are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss into earnings in the same period that the hedged items affect earnings. The valuation technique used to determine fair value is the income approach and under this approach, the Company uses projected future interest rates as provided by counterparties to the interest rate swap agreements and the fixed rates that the Company is obligated to pay under the agreement. Therefore, the Company's measurements are based on observable market data, which fall in Level 2 of the U.S. GAAP hierarchy as defined by FASB ASC Topic 820-10-35. Fair Value of Long-Term Debt The Company estimates the fair value of its long-term debt primarily based on observable market prices, which fall under Level 2 of the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy as defined by FASB ASC 820-10-35, Fair Value Measurement.

 and and CUSA s stockholder's equity of and , as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, primarily includes cumulative net foreign currency losses of and as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, from translating the financial statements of the Company's international subsidiaries and the cumulative changes in fair value of the interest rate swap agreements that are designated as hedges. As of September 30, 2024 , all foreign countries where the Company has operations are non-highly inflationary, other than Argentina. In non-highly inflationary countries, the local currency is the same as the functional currency and any fluctuation in the currency results in a cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss. The Company deemed Argentina to be highly inflationary beginning July 1, 2018. A highly inflationary economy is defined as an economy with a cumulative inflation rate of percent or more over a period. If a country s economy is classified as highly inflationary, the financial statements of the foreign entity operating in that country must be remeasured to the functional currency of the reporting entity. The financial information of the Company s Argentina subsidiaries was remeasured in U.S. dollars in accordance with ASC Topic 830, Foreign Currency Matters , effective July 1, 2018. During 2019, the Argentine government instituted exchange controls restricting the ability of entities and individuals to exchange Argentine pesos for foreign currencies and to remit foreign currency out of Argentina. As a result of these currency exchange controls, markets in Argentina developed a legal trading mechanism known as the Blue Chip Swap that allows entities to transfer U.S. dollars out of and into Argentina. In a Blue Chip Swap transaction, an entity buys U.S. dollar denominated securities in Argentina using Argentine pesos, and subsequently sells the securities for U.S. dollars, in Argentina, to access U.S. dollars locally, or outside of Argentina, by transferring the securities abroad, prior to being sold (the latter commonly known as Blue Chip Swap Rate). The Blue Chip Swap rate is the implicit exchange rate resulting from the Blue Chip Swap transaction. The Blue Chip Swap rate can diverge significantly from Argentina s official exchange rate. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company entered into Blue Chip Swap transactions that resulted in a loss of approximately and , respectively, which is reflected in Foreign currency exchange and other related loss in the Company s consolidated statement of income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

The Company conducted arms-length negotiations with an independent third party for film licensing terms and agreed to film licensing terms for Reagan substantially similar to film licensing terms agreed to with other similarly sized independent distributors.

During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded film rental expense of related to the film Reagan.

for Holdings and for CUSA was recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 resulting in an effective tax rate of approximately for Holdings and for CUSA, respectively. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 , the Company recorded a discrete deferred tax benefit of for Holdings and for CUSA related to the release of valuation allowances previously recorded against certain foreign tax credits, other federal deferred tax assets, certain state net operating losses and other state deferred tax assets . During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 the Company recorded a discrete deferred tax benefit of for Holdings and for CUSA related to the release of the aforementioned valuation allowances in the U.S. as well as valuation allowances in certain foreign jurisdictions. The release of these valuation allowances was the result of the availability of positive evidence related to sustained taxable income in the relevant jurisdictions to support the future realizability of deferred tax assets. This discrete benefit favorably impacted the effective tax rates of Holdings and CUSA for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, causing the income tax benefit to vary significantly from the tax expense derived by applying the statutory tax rate to the pre-tax income of Holdings and CUSA. The remaining valuation allowance as of September 30, 2024 was for Holdings and for CUSA, and primarily relates to foreign tax credits, federal and state interest expense carryforwards, and certain state net operating losses. The Company is currently under IRS audit for tax years 2019 and 2020. On October 21, 2024 , the IRS issued a Revenue Agent Report RAR proposing an adjustment of approximately before interest and penalties related to positions reported in each year. The Company firmly disagrees with the conclusions presented by the IRS and believes the positions reported on its tax returns that have not been reserved for are more likely than not to prevail on technical merits. The Company intends to vigorously defend its reported positions through the applicable IRS administrative and judicial procedures, as appropriate. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from examinations such as this to determine the adequacy of the Company s tax reserves. Currently, the Company believes it is adequately reserved for these matters. The ultimate outcome of disputes of this nature is uncertain and there can be no assurance that the dispute with the IRS will be resolved favorably.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes and schedules included elsewhere in this report. Amounts included in the following discussion, except for theatres, screens, average screens, average ticket price and concessions revenue per patron, are rounded in millions. 
 We are a leader in the motion picture exhibition industry, with theatres in the U.S., Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Peru, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Guatemala, Bolivia, and Paraguay. As of September 30, 2024, we managed our business under two reportable operating segments U.S. markets and international markets. See Note 16 to the condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 The success of the theatrical exhibition industry is contingent upon several key factors, including the volume of new film content available, which has been impacted by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and last year s writers and actors guilds strikes (the Hollywood strikes ), the box office performance of new film content released, the duration of the exclusive theatrical release window, and evolving consumer behavior with competition from other forms of in-and-out-of-home entertainment. 
 Revenue and Expense 
 We generate revenue primarily from filmed entertainment box office receipts and concession sales with additional revenue from screen advertising, screen rental and other revenue streams, such as transactional fees, vendor marketing promotions, studio trailer placements, meeting rentals and electronic video games located in some of our theatres. Filmed entertainment box office receipts include traditional content from studios as well as alternative entertainment, such as the Metropolitan Opera, concert events, live and pre-recorded sports programs and other special events in our theatres. NCM provides our domestic theatres with various forms of in-theatre advertising. Our Flix Media subsidiaries provide screen advertising and alternative content for our international circuit and for other international exhibitors. 
 Films leading the box office during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included Inside Out 2, Deadpool Wolverine, Despicable Me 4, Dune: Part Two, Twisters, and Beetlejuice Beetlejuice . 
 Film rental costs are variable in nature and fluctuate with our admissions revenue. Film rental costs as a percentage of revenue are generally higher for periods in which more blockbuster films are released. Advertising costs, which are expensed as incurred, are primarily related to expanding our customer base, increasing the frequency of visits and growing loyalty. These expenses vary depending on the timing and length of such campaigns. 
 Concession supplies expense is variable in nature and fluctuates with our concession revenue and also product mix. Inflationary pressures have impacted, and may continue to impact, product costs in the near term. We source products from a variety of partners around the world to minimize supply chain interruptions and price increases, wherever possible. 
 Although salaries and wages include a fixed cost component (i.e., the minimum staffing costs to operate a theatre facility during non-peak periods), salaries and wages tend to move in relation to anticipated changes in attendance. Staffing levels may vary based on the amenities offered at each location, such as full-service restaurants, bars or expanded food and beverage options. In certain international locations, staffing levels are also subject to local regulations, including minimum hour requirements. Inflationary pressures have driven increases in wage rates across our labor base and increases may continue in the future. 
 Facility lease expense is primarily a fixed cost at the theatre level as most of our facility leases require a fixed monthly minimum rent payment. Certain leases are subject to percentage rent only, while others are subject to percentage rent in addition to their fixed monthly rent if a target annual performance level is achieved. Facility lease expense as a percentage of revenue is also affected by the number of theatres under operating leases, the number of theatres under finance leases and the number of owned theatres. 
 Utilities and other costs include both fixed and variable costs and primarily consist of utilities, property taxes, janitorial costs, credit card fees, third party ticket sales commissions, gift card commissions, repairs and maintenance expenses, security services, and projection and sound equipment maintenance expenses. 
 General and administrative expenses to support the overall management of the Company are primarily fixed in nature. Fixed expenses include salaries, wages and benefits costs for our corporate office personnel, facility expenses for our corporate and other offices, software license and maintenance costs and audit fees. General and administrative expenses also include some variable expenses such as incentive compensation, consulting and legal fees, supplies, and other costs that are not specifically associated with the operations of our theatres.

(1) U.S. operating segment revenue includes eliminations of intercompany transactions with the international operating segment. See Note 16 to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 

(2) Average ticket price is calculated as admissions revenue divided by attendance. Concession revenue per patron is calculated as concession revenue divided by attendance. 

(3) Constant currency revenue amounts, which are non-GAAP measurements, were calculated using the average exchange rate for the corresponding month for 2023. We translate the results of our international operating segment from local currencies into U.S. dollars using currency rates in effect at different points in time in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Significant changes in foreign currency exchange rates from one period to the next can result in meaningful variations in reported results. We are providing constant currency amounts for our international operating segment to present a period-to-period comparison of business performance that excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. 

U.S. Attendance increased to 37.6 million patrons during the third quarter of 2024 compared with 37.5 million patrons during the third quarter of 2023. Average ticket price increased 6.9 to 9.98 during the third quarter of 2024 compared with 9.34 during the third quarter of 2023 primarily driven by strategic pricing actions, a higher mix of premium format tickets, and the absence of National Cinema Day in the third quarter of 2024. Concession revenue per patron increased 11.5 to 7.97 during the third quarter of 2024 compared with 7.15 during the third quarter of 2023 driven by higher incidence rates associated with the film content mix, strategic pricing actions and, to a lesser extent, product mix. Other revenue for the third quarter of 2024 increased 3.9 to 66.6 million compared with 64.1 million during the third quarter of 2023 primarily due to an increase in promotional and events revenue. 

International. Attendance decreased 6.6 to 22.8 million patrons during the third quarter of 2024 compared with 24.4 million patrons during the third quarter of 2023 driven by the mix of film releases during the third quarter of 2024. Revenues, average ticket price and concession revenue per patron for our international segment, as reported, were unfavorably impacted by exchange rate fluctuations for the third quarter of 2024. In constant currency, the average ticket price increased 50.9 to 5.78 for the third quarter of 2024 primarily due to inflationary pricing actions, partially offset by promotional activity. Similarly, in constant currency, concession revenue per patron increased 53.7 to 4.52 for the third quarter of 2024 primarily due to inflationary pricing actions. Other revenue increased 56.1 in constant currency to 42.3 million for the third quarter of 2024 primarily due to inflationary impacts.

(1) Constant currency expense amounts, which are non-GAAP measurements, were calculated using the average exchange rate for the corresponding month for 2023. We translate the results of our international operating segment from local currencies into U.S. dollars using currency rates in effect at different points in time in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Significant changes in foreign currency exchange rates from one period to the next can result in meaningful variations in reported results. We are providing constant currency amounts for our international operating segment to present a period-to-period comparison of business performance that excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. 

U.S. Film rentals and advertising costs for the third quarter of 2024 were 59.2 of admissions revenue compared with 57.4 for the third quarter of 2023 due to an increased concentration of high grossing titles and the overall mix of films. Concession supplies expense for the third quarter of 2024 was 16.5 of concession revenue compared with 17.8 for the third quarter of 2023. The decline in the concession supplies rate for the third quarter of 2024 was driven by the impact of strategic pricing actions and favorable concession rebates, partially offset by inflationary pressures on certain concession categories and product mix. 

Salaries and wages increased 2.4 to 91.1 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared with 89.0 million for the third quarter of 2023 due to higher wage rates and expanded operating hours, partially offset by the impact of labor productivity initiatives. Facility lease expense, which is predominantly fixed in nature, increased 4.1 to 63.5 million primarily due to higher percentage rent. Utilities and other costs decreased 1.6 to 97.3 million, driven by lower repairs and maintenance and janitorial costs. 
 International. Our international operating costs, as reported, were favorably impacted by exchange rate fluctuations for the third quarter of 2024. 

Film rentals and advertising costs were 50.8 of admissions revenue as reported for the third quarter of 2024 compared with 50.4 for the third quarter of 2023 driven by the overall mix of films. Concession supplies expense was 22.5 of concessions revenue as reported for the third quarter of 2024 compared with 21.3 for the third quarter of 2023. The increase in the concession supplies rate was in part driven by product mix. 
 Salaries and wages, facility lease expense and utilities and other expenses, as reported, were lower for the third quarter of 2024 as a result of favorable exchange rate fluctuations. In constant currency, salaries and wages increased to 29.4 million for the third quarter of 2024 primarily due to wage rate inflation, partially offset by labor productivity initiatives and lower attendance. Facility lease expense increased to 31.0 million in constant currency for the third quarter of 2024 driven by inflationary increases and the return of certain minimum rent thresholds, partially offset by lower percentage rent. Utilities and other costs increased to 46.3 million in constant currency for the third quarter of 2024 primarily due to inflationary pressures and higher utility costs. 
 General and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expense for Holdings increased to 56.4 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared with 48.2 million for the third quarter of 2023. General and administrative expense for CUSA increased to 55.5 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared with 47.5 million for the third quarter of 2023. The increase for both Holdings and CUSA is primarily due to wages and benefits inflation, higher incentive and share-based compensation and higher professional fees, partially offset by the favorable impact of exchange rate fluctuations. 
 Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased to 49.1 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared with 51.9 million for the third quarter of 2023 due in part to lower levels of capital expenditures post-pandemic and the favorable impact of exchange rate fluctuations. 
 Gain on Disposal of Assets and Other. A gain on disposal of assets and other of 0.1 million was recorded for the third quarter of 2024 compared with a gain of 6.1 million for the third quarter of 2023. Activity for the third quarter of 2023 was primarily related to the sale of our Ecuador subsidiary in September 2023. 
 Interest Expense. Interest expense for Holdings, which includes amortization of debt issuance costs and original issue discount and amortization of accumulated gains for swap amendments, was 36.7 million during the third quarter of 2024 compared with 38.1 million during the third quarter of 2023. The interest expense attributable to CUSA, which includes amortization of debt issuance costs 
 41 

and original issue discount and amortization of accumulated gains for swap amendments, was 30.6 million during the third quarter of 2024 compared with 32.1 million during the third quarter of 2023. The decrease in interest expense was primarily due to the redemption of the remaining 8.75 Secured Notes, the extinguishment of the 5.875 Senior Notes, and the amendment and extension of our interest rate swaps, partially offset by the impact of the issuance of the 7.00 Senior Notes. See further discussion in Liquidity and Capital Resources below. 
 Interest Income . Interest income for Holdings was 14.2 million during the third quarter of 2024 compared with 15.3 million during the third quarter of 2023. The interest income attributable to CUSA was 11.1 million during the third quarter of 2024 compared with 12.2 million during the third quarter of 2023. The decrease in interest income primarily reflects the impact of interest rate fluctuations on our cash balances. 
 Loss on Debt Amendments and Extinguishments. We recorded a loss on amendment and extinguishment of debt of 3.0 million during the third quarter of 2024 related to the early extinguishment of the 5.875 Senior Notes. See Note 7 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
 Foreign Currency Exchange and Other Related Loss. We recorded a foreign currency exchange loss of 3.0 million during the third quarter of 2024 compared with a loss of 11.0 million during the third quarter of 2023. Activity for the third quarter of 2024 and 2023 includes losses of 0.9 million and 5.2 million, respectively, associated with Blue Chip Swap transactions. Excluding the impact of Blue Chip Swap transactions, the loss on foreign currency exchange is primarily related to currency exchange fluctuations from original transaction dates until settlement. See Note 14 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for a discussion of Blue Chip Swap transactions. 
 Equity in Income of Affiliates. Equity in income of affiliates of 5.0 million was recorded during the third quarter of 2024 compared with 1.5 million during the third quarter of 2023 driven by higher income earned from our investment in AC JV LLC during the third quarter of 2024. See Note 9 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for information about our equity investments. 
 Net Gain on Investment in NCMI. We recorded a net gain on our investment in NCMI of 11.6 million during the third quarter of 2024 compared with 4.7 million during the third quarter of 2023, related to the mark-to-market adjustment of our investment in NCMI under the fair value basis of accounting. See Note 8 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for information about our investment in NCMI. 
 Income Taxes - Holdings. An income tax benefit of 42.7 million was recorded for the third quarter of 2024 compared with income tax expense of 21.4 million for the third quarter of 2023. The effective tax rate was approximately (29.2) for the third quarter of 2024 compared with 19.0 for the third quarter of 2023. The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2024 was favorably impacted by changes in valuation allowances previously recorded against certain foreign tax credits, other federal deferred tax assets, certain state net operating losses and other state deferred tax assets. The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2023 was favorably impacted by the use of certain foreign tax credits for which valuation allowances had been established in prior periods as well as the release of valuation allowances previously recorded against the net deferred tax assets in various jurisdictions. Income tax provisions for interim periods are generally based on estimated annual income tax rates and are adjusted for the effects of significant, infrequent or unusual items (i.e. discrete items) occurring during the interim period. As a result, the interim rate may vary significantly from the normalized annual rate. 
 Income Taxes - CUSA. An income tax benefit of 39.7 million was recorded for the third quarter of 2024 compared with income tax expense of 17.4 million for the third quarter of 2023. The effective tax rate was approximately (26.4) for the third quarter of 2024 compared with 15.0 for the third quarter of 2023. The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2024 was favorably impacted by changes in valuation allowances previously recorded against certain foreign tax credits, other federal deferred tax assets, certain state net operating losses and other state deferred tax assets. The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2023 was favorably impacted by the use of certain foreign tax credits for which valuation allowances had been established in prior periods as well as the release of valuation allowances previously recorded against the net deferred tax assets in various jurisdictions.

U.S. Attendance decreased 11.0 to 90.3 million patrons during the 2024 period compared with 101.5 million patrons during the 2023 period driven by less carryover benefit in the 2024 period from prior year releases and the overall mix of film releases due to the impact of the Hollywood strikes. Average ticket price increased 3.8 to 9.90 during the 2024 period compared with 9.54 during the 2023 period driven by strategic pricing actions. Concession revenue per patron increased 6.2 to 7.86 during the 2024 period compared with 7.40 during the 2023 period primarily driven by strategic pricing actions, product mix and higher incidence rates associated with the film content mix. Other revenue for the 2024 period decreased 5.9 to 166.4 million compared with 176.9 million during the 2023 period primarily due to a decrease in attendance, which resulted in a reduction in the variable component of other revenue. 

International. Attendance decreased 11.7 to 59.8 million patrons during the 2024 period compared with 67.7 million patrons during the 2023 period due to less carryover benefit in the 2024 period from prior year releases and the overall mix of film releases due to the impact of the Hollywood strikes. Revenues, average ticket price and concession revenue per patron for our international segment, as reported, were unfavorably impacted by exchange rate fluctuations for the 2024 period. In constant currency, the average ticket price increased 45.8 to 5.70 for the 2024 period primarily due to inflationary pricing actions. Similarly, in constant currency, concession revenue per patron increased 51.7 to 4.43 for the 2024 period primarily due to inflationary pricing actions. Other revenue increased 51.4 in constant currency to 104.0 million for the 2024 period primarily due to inflationary impacts.

(1) Constant currency expense amounts, which are non-GAAP measurements, were calculated using the average exchange rate for the corresponding month for 2023. We translate the results of our international operating segment from local currencies into U.S. dollars using currency rates in effect at different points in time in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Significant changes in foreign currency exchange rates from one period to the next can result in meaningful variations in reported results. We are providing constant currency amounts for our international operating segment to present a period-to-period comparison of business performance that excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. 

U.S. Film rentals and advertising costs for the 2024 period were 57.4 of admissions revenue compared with 57.7 for the 2023 period due to the overall mix of film releases. Concession supplies expense for the 2024 period was 17.9 of concession revenue compared with 17.4 for the 2023 period. The concession supplies rate for the 2024 period was impacted by inflationary pressures on certain concession categories, product mix and higher shrink, partially offset by the impact of strategic pricing actions. 

Salaries and wages decreased 3.4 to 244.4 million for the 2024 period compared with 253.0 million for the 2023 period due to lower attendance and the impact of labor productivity initiatives, partially offset by higher wage rates and expanded operating hours. Facility lease expense, which is predominantly fixed in nature, decreased to 184.0 million primarily due to theatre closures and lease renegotiations, partially offset by higher percentage rent. Utilities and other costs decreased 5.2 to 255.7 million, as many of these costs are variable or semi-variable in nature and were impacted by the decrease in attendance. A decrease in property taxes also contributed to the decline in utilities and other costs. 
 International. Our international operating costs, as reported, were favorably impacted by exchange rate fluctuations for the 2024 period. 

Film rentals and advertising costs were 50.0 of admissions revenue as reported for the 2024 period compared with 50.7 for the 2023 period due to the overall mix of film releases. Concession supplies expense was 21.9 of concessions revenue as reported for the 2024 period compared with 21.7 for the 2023 period. The increase in the concession supplies rate was primarily driven by inflationary pressures offset by the impact of strategic pricing actions. 
 Salaries and wages, facility lease expense and utilities and other expenses, as reported, were lower for the 2024 period as a result of favorable exchange rate fluctuations. In constant currency, salaries and wages increased to 80.4 million for the 2024 period primarily driven by wage rate inflation, partially offset by labor productivity initiatives and lower attendance. Facility lease expense increased to 81.4 million in constant currency for the 2024 period primarily due to inflationary increases and the return of certain minimum rent thresholds, partially offset by lower percentage rent. Utilities and other costs increased to 120.6 million in constant currency for the 2024 period due to inflationary pressures and higher utility costs. 
 General and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expense for Holdings increased to 161.0 million for the 2024 period compared with 144.7 million for the 2023 period. General and administrative expense for CUSA increased to 158.2 million for the 2024 period compared with 142.2 million for the 2023 period. The increase for both Holdings and CUSA is primarily due to wages and benefits inflation, as well as higher incentive and share-based compensation and related payroll taxes, partially offset by the favorable impact of exchange rate fluctuations. 
 Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased to 148.3 million for the 2024 period compared with 159.6 million for the 2023 period due in part to lower levels of capital expenditures post-pandemic, the impairment of assets during 2023 and the favorable impact of exchange rate fluctuations. 
 Loss (Gain) on Disposal of Assets and Other. A loss on disposal of assets and other of 2.0 million was recorded for the 2024 period compared with a gain of 8.8 million for the 2023 period. Activity for the 2024 period was primarily related to the removal and disposal of equipment at closed theatres. Activity for the 2023 period was primarily related to the sale of our Ecuador subsidiary in September 2023 and the write-off of operating lease obligations for theatres that were closed during the 2023 period. 
 Interest Expense. Interest expense for Holdings, which includes amortization of debt issuance costs and original issue discount and amortization of accumulated gains for swap amendments, was 109.0 million during the 2024 period compared with 112.0 million during the 2023 period. The interest expense attributable to CUSA, which includes amortization of debt issuance costs and original issue 
 44 

discount and amortization of accumulated gains for swap amendments, was 90.8 million during the 2024 period compared with 93.9 million during the 2023 period. The decrease in interest expense was primarily due to the redemption of the remaining 8.75 Secured Notes, the extinguishment of the 5.875 Senior Notes, and the amendment and extension of our interest rate swaps, partially offset by a higher average interest rate on our term loan and the impact of the issuance of the 7.00 Senior Notes. See further discussion in Liquidity and Capital Resources below. 
 Interest Income . Interest income for Holdings was 40.3 million during the 2024 period compared with 40.2 million during the 2023 period. The interest income attributable to CUSA was 30.8 million during the 2024 period compared with 31.5 million during the 2023 period. 
 Loss on Debt Amendments and Extinguishments. We recorded a loss on amendments and extinguishments of debt of 5.5 million during the 2024 period related to the amendment of our Senior Secured Credit Facility, the redemption of the remaining 8.75 Secured Notes, and the extinguishment of the 5.875 Senior Notes. We recorded a loss on amendments and extinguishments of debt of 10.7 million during the 2023 period related to the amendment of our Senior Secured Credit Facility and the partial redemption of the 8.75 Secured Notes. See Note 7 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
 Foreign currency exchange and other related loss. We recorded a foreign currency exchange loss of 7.9 million during the 2024 period compared with a loss of 19.4 million during the 2023 period. Activity for the 2024 and 2023 period includes losses of 0.9 million and 10.1 million, respectively, associated with Blue Chip Swap transactions. Excluding the impact of Blue Chip Swap transactions, the loss on foreign exchange is primarily related to currency exchange fluctuations from original transaction dates until settlement. See note 14 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for a discussion of Blue Chip Swap transactions. 
 Equity in Income of Affiliates. Equity in income of affiliates of 11.3 million was recorded during the 2024 period compared with 1.2 million during the 2023 period driven by higher income earned from our investment in AC JV, LLC during the 2024 period and the absence of a loss from our investment in NCMI, which is now accounted for under the fair value basis of accounting. See Note 8 and Note 9, respectively, to the condensed consolidated financial statements for information about our investment in NCMI and our equity investments. 
 Net Gain on Investment in NCMI. We recorded a net gain on our investment in NCMI of 12.8 million during the 2024 period compared with 13.9 million during the 2023 period, primarily related to the mark-to-market adjustment of our investment in NCMI under the fair value basis of accounting. See Note 8 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for information about our investment in NCMI. 
 Income Taxes - Holdings. An income tax benefit of 71.3 million was recorded for the 2024 period compared with income tax expense of 29.8 million for the 2023 period. The effective tax rate was approximately (37.6) for the 2024 period compared with 12.5 for the 2023 period. During the 2024 period, a deferred tax benefit of 116.3 million was recorded discretely related to the release of valuation allowances previously recorded against certain foreign tax credits, other federal deferred tax assets, certain state net operating losses and other state deferred tax assets as well as deferred tax assets in certain foreign jurisdictions. The release of these valuation allowances was the result of the availability of positive evidence related to sustained taxable income in the relevant jurisdictions to support the future realizability of deferred tax assets. This discrete benefit favorably impacted the effective tax rate for the 2024 period, causing the income tax benefit to vary significantly from the tax expense derived by applying the statutory tax rate to the pre-tax income for the period. The effective tax rate for the 2023 period was favorably impacted by the use of certain foreign tax credits for which valuation allowances had been established in prior periods as well as the release of valuation allowances previously recorded against the net deferred tax assets in certain foreign jurisdictions. Income tax provisions for interim periods are generally based on estimated annual income tax rates and are adjusted for the effects of significant, infrequent or unusual items (i.e. discrete items) occurring during the interim period. As a result, the interim rate may vary significantly from the normalized annual rate. 
 Income Taxes - CUSA. An income tax benefit of 67.6 million was recorded for the 2024 period compared with income tax expense of 24.2 million for the 2023 period. The effective tax rate was approximately (33.7) for the 2024 period compared with 9.7 for the 2023 period. During the 2024 period, a deferred tax benefit of 112.4 million was recorded discretely related to the release of valuation allowances previously recorded against certain foreign tax credits, other federal deferred tax assets, certain state net operating losses and other state deferred tax assets as well as deferred tax assets in certain foreign jurisdictions. The release of these valuation allowances was the result of the availability of positive evidence related to sustained taxable income in the relevant jurisdictions to support the future realizability of deferred tax assets. This discrete benefit favorably impacted the effective tax rate for the 2024 period, causing the income tax benefit to vary significantly from the tax expense derived by applying the statutory tax rate to the pre-tax income for the period. The effective tax rate for the 2023 period was favorably impacted by the use of certain foreign tax credits for which valuation allowances had been established in prior periods as well as the release of valuation allowances previously recorded against the net deferred tax assets in certain foreign jurisdictions. Income tax provisions for interim periods are generally based on estimated annual income tax rates and are adjusted for the effects of significant, infrequent or unusual items (i.e. discrete items) occurring during the interim period. As a result, the interim rate may vary significantly from the normalized annual rate.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Operating Activities 
 We primarily collect our revenue in cash, mainly through box office receipts and the sale of concessions. Our revenue is generally received in cash prior to the payment of related expenses; therefore, we have an operating float and historically have not required traditional working capital financing. However, our working capital position will continue to fluctuate based on seasonality, the timing and volume of new film content, the timing of interest payments on our long-term debt as well as timing of payment of other operating expenses that are paid annually or semi-annually, such as property and other taxes and incentive bonuses. We believe our existing cash and expected cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditures, and expected cash requirements from known contractual obligations for the next twelve months and beyond. 
 Cash provided by operating activities was 269.6 million for Holdings and 279.5 million for CUSA for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with cash provided by operating activities of 335.8 million for Holdings and 347.9 million for CUSA for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by the timing and level of revenue earned during each period partially offset by the timing of payments to vendors for expenses incurred during each period. 
 Investing Activities 
 Investing activities have been principally related to the development and remodel of theatres. New theatre openings and remodels historically have been financed with internally generated cash and by debt financing, including borrowings under our senior secured credit facility. Cash used for investing activities was 89.1 million and 74.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in cash used for investing activities was primarily due to the proceeds from the sale of our Ecuador subsidiary during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Below is a summary of capital expenditures, disaggregated by new and existing theatres, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in millions):

(2) Approximately 3.2 million is expected to be paid during the remainder of 2024 and 7.8 million, 1.2 million and 4.8 million is expected to be paid during 2025, 2026 and 2027, respectively. The timing of payments is subject to change in the event of construction or other delays. 

Actual expenditures for continued theatre development, remodels and acquisitions are subject to change based upon the availability of attractive opportunities. During the next twelve months and the foreseeable future, we plan to fund capital expenditures for our continued development with cash flow from operations and, if needed, borrowings under our senior secured credit facility, proceeds from debt issuances, sale leaseback transactions and/or sales of excess real estate. 
 Financing Activities 
 Cash used for financing activities was 94.7 million and 118.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in cash used for financing activities was primarily due to the repayment of the 5.875 Senior Notes and the redemption of the remaining 8.75 secured notes, partially offset by the issuance of the 7.00 Senior Notes during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Holdings, at the discretion of its board of directors and subject to applicable law, may pay dividends on its common stock. The amount of the dividends to be paid in the future, if any, will depend upon available cash balances, anticipated cash needs, overall financial condition, loan agreement restrictions as discussed below, and future prospects for earnings and cash flows, as well as other relevant factors. As a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, Holdings Board of Directors has suspended the quarterly dividend to shareholders. 
 We may, from time to time, seek to retire or repurchase our outstanding debt securities through cash purchases or exchanges for other securities, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on the availability and prices of such debt securities, prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material. 
 We expect to repay the principal amount of our 4.50 Convertible Senior Notes upon their maturity in August 2025 with cash on hand, and could fund the remainder with a combination of cash, shares or a combination thereof. See 4.50 Convertible Senior Notes below. Also see Note 7 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for a summary of long-term debt outstanding as of September 30, 2024 for Holdings and CUSA. 
 Contractual Obligations 
 There have been no material changes in the contractual obligations previously disclosed in Liquidity and Capital Resources in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed February 16, 2024. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements. 
 4.50 Convertible Senior Notes 
 On August 21, 2020, Holdings issued 460.0 million 4.50 convertible senior notes (the 4.50 Convertible Senior Notes ). The notes will mature on August 15, 2025, unless earlier repurchased or converted. Interest on the notes is payable on February 15 and August 15 of each year. 
 47 

Holders of the 4.50 Convertible Senior Notes may convert their 4.50 Convertible Senior Notes at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding May 15, 2025 only under the following circumstances: (1) during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period, or the measurement period, in which the trading price per 1,000 principal amount of notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98 of the product of the last reported sale price of Holdings common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; (2) if Holdings distributes to all or substantially all stockholders (i) rights, options or warrants entitling them to purchase shares at a discount to the recent average trading price of Holdings common stock (including due to a stockholder rights plan) or (ii) Holdings assets or securities or rights, options or warrants to purchase the same with a per share value exceeding 10 of the trading price of Holdings common stock; or (3) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events as described further in the indenture. Prior to May 15, 2025, holders may convert their notes during any calendar quarter (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of Holdings common stock for at least 20 trading days during the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 18.66 per share (130 of the initial conversion price of 14.35 per share), on each applicable trading day. The closing price of Holdings' common stock exceeded 18.66 per share (130 of the initial conversion price of 14.35 per share) during at least 20 of the last 30 trading days of the quarter ended September 30, 2024 and, therefore, the 4.50 Convertible Senior Notes will be convertible during the fourth quarter of 2024. Beginning May 15, 2025, holders may convert their notes at any time prior to the close of business on the third scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date. Upon conversion of the 4.50 Convertible Senior Notes, Holdings will pay or deliver cash, shares of its common stock or a combination of cash and shares of its common stock, at its election. 
 The current conversion rate is 69.6767 shares of Holdings common stock per one thousand dollars principal amount of the 4.50 Convertible Senior Notes. The conversion rate will be subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events. If a make-whole fundamental change as defined in the indenture occurs prior to the maturity date, Holdings will, in certain circumstances, increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert its notes in connection with such make-whole fundamental change. 
 Holdings entered into hedge transactions with counterparties in connection with the issuance of the 4.50 Convertible Senior Notes. The convertible note hedge transactions cover, subject to anti-dilution adjustments substantially similar to those applicable to the 4.50 Convertible Senior Notes, the number of shares of Holdings' common stock underlying the 4.50 Convertible Notes, which initially gives Holdings the option to purchase approximately 32.0 shares of its common stock at a price of approximately 14.35 per share. Concurrently with entering into the convertible note hedge transactions, Holdings also entered into warrant transactions with each option counterparty whereby Holdings sold to such option counterparty warrants to purchase, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, up to the same number of shares of Holdings' common stock, which initially gives the option counterparties the option to purchase approximately 32.0 shares at a price of approximately 22.08 per share. The economic effect of these transactions is to effectively raise the strike price of the 4.50 Convertible Senior Notes to approximately 22.08 per share of Holdings common stock. The warrants expire 1/80 th per trading day between November 15, 2025 and March 12, 2026. 
 The 4.50 Convertible Notes are effectively subordinated to any of Holdings , or its subsidiaries , existing and future secured debt to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness, including obligations under the Credit Agreement. The 4.50 Convertible Notes are structurally subordinated to all existing and future debt and other liabilities, including trade payables, and including CUSA s 5.25 Senior Notes due 2028 and 7.00 Senior Notes due 2032, or, collectively, CUSA s senior notes (but excluding all obligations under the Credit Agreement, as defined below, which are guaranteed by Holdings). The 4.50 Convertible Notes rank equally in right of payment with all existing and future unsubordinated debt, including all obligations under the Credit Agreement, which is guaranteed by Holdings, and senior in right of payment to any future debt that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the 4.50 Convertible Notes. The 4.50 Convertible Notes are not guaranteed by any of Holdings' subsidiaries. 
 Senior Secured Credit Facility 
 On May 26, 2023, CUSA amended and restated its senior secured credit facility (the Credit Agreement to provide for an aggregate principal amount of 775.0 million, consisting of a 650.0 million term loan with a maturity date of May 24, 2030 and a 125.0 million revolving credit facility with a maturity date of May 26, 2028. The term loan and revolving credit facility are subject to a springing maturity date of April 15, 2028 if CUSA s 5.25 Senior Notes due 2028 have not been paid or refinanced as required under the Credit Agreement prior to such date, as more specifically described in the Credit Agreement. 
 On May 28, 2024, CUSA amended and restated its senior secured credit facility to reduce the rate at which the term loan bears interest by 0.50 and reset the 101 soft call for another six months (the 2024 Amendment ). See below for additional discussion of interest rates on the term loan, and Note 7 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information on the 2024 Amendment. 
 Under the Credit Agreement, principal payments of 1.6 million are due on the term loan quarterly through March 31, 2030, with a final principal payment of the remaining unpaid principal due on May 24, 2030. 
 Pursuant to the 2024 Amendment noted above, i nterest on the term loan accrues, at CUSA's option, at either (i) a rate determined by reference to the secured overnight financing rate SOFR as published by CME Group Benchmark Administration Limited and identified by Barclay's Bank PLC (the Administrative Agent) as the forward-looking term rate based on SOFR for a period of 1, 3, or 6 
 48 

months (depending upon the Interest Period (as defined in the Credit Agreement) chosen by CUSA) (the Term SOFR Rate ), subject to a floor of 0.50 per annum, plus an applicable margin of 3.25 per annum, or (ii) for any day, a rate per annum equal to the greatest of (a) the Prime Rate in effect on such day, (b) the Federal Reserve Bank of New York Rate in effect on such day, plus 1/2 of 1.00 and (c) the Term SOFR Rate for a one month Interest Period, as published two U.S. Government Securities Business Days prior to such day (or if such day is not a U.S. Government Securities Business Day, the immediately preceding U.S. Government Securities Business Day), plus 1.00 (this clause (ii), the "Alternate Base Rate"), subject in the case of this clause (ii) to a floor of 1.50 per annum, plus, in the case of this clause (ii), an applicable margin of 2.25 per annum effective. 
 Interest on revolving credit loans accrues, at CUSA's option, at either (i) the Term SOFR Rate plus an applicable margin that ranges from 3.00 to 3.50 per annum, or (ii) the Alternate Base Rate, subject, in the case of this clause (ii) to a floor of 1.00 per annum, plus, in the case of this clause (ii), an applicable margin that ranges from 2.00 to 2.50 . The applicable margin with respect to revolving credit loans is a function of the Consolidated Net Senior Secured Leverage Ratio as defined in the Credit Agreement. As of September 30, 2024, the applicable margin was 3.00 , however, there were no borrowings outstanding under the revolving line of credit. In addition, CUSA is required to pay a commitment fee on the revolving line of credit that accrues at a rate ranging from 0.20 to 0.375 per annum of the daily unused portion of the revolving line of credit. The commitment fee rate is a function of the Consolidated Net Senior Secured Leverage Ratio and was 0.20 at September 30, 2024. 
 CUSA s obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by Holdings and certain subsidiaries of Holdings other than CUSA (the Other Guarantors and are secured by security interests in all of CUSA, and substantially all of Holdings and the Other Guarantors personal property. 
 The Credit Agreement contains usual and customary negative covenants for agreements of this type, including, but not limited to, restrictions on the ability of Holdings, CUSA and their subsidiaries to: merge, consolidate, liquidate, or dissolve; sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of assets; create, incur or permit to exist certain indebtedness and liens; pay dividends, repurchase stock and make other Restricted Payments (as defined in the Credit Agreement); prepay certain indebtedness; make investments; enter into transactions with affiliates; and change the nature of their business. At any time that CUSA has revolving credit loans outstanding, it is not permitted to allow the Consolidated Net Senior Secured Leverage Ratio to exceed 3.5 to 1.0. As of September 30, 2024, there were no revolving credit loans outstanding, and CUSA s Consolidated Net Senior Secured Leverage Ratio was below zero. 
 The Credit Agreement also includes customary events of default, including, among other things, payment default, covenant default, breach of representation or warranty, bankruptcy, cross-default, material ERISA events, a change of control, material money judgments and failure to maintain security interests. If an event of default occurs, all commitments under the Credit Agreement may be terminated and all obligations under the Credit Agreement could be accelerated by the Lenders, causing all loans outstanding (including accrued interest and fees payable thereunder) to be declared immediately due and payable. 
 The Restricted Payments covenant, as defined in the Credit Agreement generally does not limit the ability of Holdings and its subsidiaries to pay dividends and make other Restricted Payments if the Consolidated Net Total Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) is less than or equal to 2.75 to 1.00. If the Consolidated Net Total Leverage Ratio is greater than 2.75 to 1.00, but not greater than 5.00 to 1.00, Restricted Payments generally may be made in an aggregate amount not to exceed the Available Amount (as defined in the Credit Agreement), which is a function of CUSA s Consolidated EBITDA minus 1.75 times its Consolidated Interest Expense (as such terms are defined in the Credit Agreement) and certain other factors as specified in the Credit Agreement. As of September 30, 2024, the Consolidated Net Total Leverage Ratio was 2.14 to 1.00 and the Available Amount was 752.8 million. In addition, the Credit Agreement contains other baskets that allow certain Restricted Payments in excess of the Applicable Amount. 
 We have three interest rate swap agreements that are used to hedge a portion of the interest rate risk associated with the variable interest rates on the term loan outstanding. See Note 7 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for discussion of the interest rate swaps. 
 As of September 30, 2024, there was 640.3 million outstanding under the term loan and no borrowings were outstanding under the 125.0 million revolving line of credit. The average interest rate on outstanding term loan borrowings under the Credit Agreement as of September 30, 2024 was approximately 6.9 per annum, after giving effect to the interest rate swap agreements. 
 7.00 Senior Notes 
 On July 18, 2024, CUSA issued 500.0 million 7.00 senior unsecured notes, at par (the 7.00 Senior Notes ). The notes will mature on August 1, 2032. Interest on the 7.00 Senior Notes will be payable on February 1 and August 1 of each year, beginning on February 1, 2025. CUSA incurred debt issuance costs of approximately 8.7 million in connection with the issuance, which were recorded as a reduction of long-term debt on the Company s consolidated balance sheet. Proceeds, net of fees, were used to repay CUSA s 5.875 405.0 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes due March 2026 (the 5.875 Senior Notes ), as discussed below under 5.875 Secured Notes. The remainder of the net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes. 
 The notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several senior unsecured basis by certain of CUSA s subsidiaries, or its guarantors, that guarantee, assume or in any other manner become liable with respect to any of CUSA s or its guarantors other 
 49 

debt. If CUSA cannot make payments on the 7.00 Senior Notes when they are due, CUSA s guarantors must make them instead. The 7.00 Senior Notes and the guarantees are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of CUSA s and its guarantor s existing and future senior debt, including the 5.25 senior notes due 2028 and all borrowings under CUSA s Credit Agreement. The notes and the guarantees will be structurally subordinated to all existing and future debt and other liabilities of CUSA s non-guarantor subsidiaries. The notes and the guarantees will be structurally senior to the 4.50 convertible senior notes due 2025, and all future debt, if any, issued by Holdings that is not guaranteed by CUSA or any of its subsidiaries. 
 CUSA may redeem the 7.00 Senior Notes in whole or in part at any time on or after August 1, 2027 at redemption prices set forth in the indenture governing the 7.00 Senior Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on the 7.00 Senior Notes redeemed, to the applicable redemption date, if redeemed during the 12-month period beginning on August 1 of the years indicated below: 

Percentage of Principal Amount 

2027 
 103.50 

2028 
 101.75 

2029 and Thereafter 
 100.00 

Prior to August 1, 2027, CUSA has the option to redeem all or a portion of the 7.00 Senior Notes at a price equal to 100.0 of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, plus a make-whole premium. In addition, prior to August 1, 2027, CUSA may redeem up to 40 of the aggregate principal amount of the 7.00 Senior Notes with funds in an amount equal to the net proceeds of certain equity offerings at a redemption price equal to 107.0 of the principal amount of the 7.00 Senior Notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, as long as (i) at least 60 of the principal amount of the 7.00 Senior Notes outstanding issued under the indenture governing the 7.00 Senior Notes (including any additional notes) remains outstanding immediately after each such redemption and (ii) the redemption occurs within 120 days of the date of the closing of such equity offerings. 
 The indenture governing the 7.00 Senior Notes contains covenants that limit, among other things, the ability of CUSA and certain of its subsidiaries to (1) incur or guarantee additional indebtedness, (2) pay dividends or distributions on, or redeem or repurchase, capital stock and make other restricted payments, (3) make certain investments, (4) engage in certain transactions with affiliates, (5) incur or assume certain liens, and (6) consolidate, merge or transfer all or substantially all of its assets. Additionally, upon a change in control, as defined in the indenture governing the 7.00 Senior Notes, CUSA would be required to make an offer to repurchase all of the 7.00 Senior Notes at a price equal to 101 of the aggregate principal amount outstanding plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, through the date of repurchase. 
 5.875 Senior Notes 
 On March 16, 2021, CUSA issued 405.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.875 senior notes due 2026, at par value (the 5.875 Senior Notes ). Interest on the 5.875 Senior Notes was payable on March 15 and September 15 of each year. The 5.875 Senior Notes were scheduled to mature on March 15, 2026. 
 Concurrently with the 7.00 Senior Notes bond offering discussed above, on July 9, 2024, CUSA commenced a cash tender offer to purchase any and all of CUSA s 5.875 Senior Notes. On July 18, 2024, CUSA completed the tender of 345.3 aggregate principal amount of the notes. After the expiration of the tender offer, 59.7 million aggregate principal amount of the 5.875 Senior Notes remained outstanding. 
 On September 19, 2024, CUSA, as permitted by the terms of the indenture governing the 5.875 Senior Notes, irrevocably deposited non-callable U.S. government treasury securities with a trustee in an amount sufficient to fund the repayment of the remaining 59.7 million principal amount of the 5.875 Senior Notes on March 15, 2025 (the Redemption Date at 100 of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon. After the deposit of such funds with the trustee, CUSA s obligations under the indenture with respect to the 5.875 Senior Notes were satisfied and discharged and the transaction was accounted for as a debt extinguishment. 
 As a result of the debt extinguishment CUSA recognized a loss of 3.0 related to the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs as well as legal and other fees incurred in connection with the transactions, which is reflected in Loss on debt amendments and extinguishments in the Company s condensed consolidated statement of income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. See Note 7 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the satisfaction and discharge of the 5.875 Senior Notes completed on September 19, 2024. 
 5.25 Senior Notes 
 On June 15, 2021, CUSA issued 765.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.25 senior notes due 2028, at par value (the 5.25 Senior Notes ). Interest on the 5.25 Senior Notes is payable on January 15 and July 15 of each year. The 5.25 Senior Notes mature on July 15, 2028. 
 The 5.25 Senior Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several senior unsecured basis by certain of CUSA s subsidiaries that guarantee, assume or become liable with respect to any of CUSA's or a guarantor s debt. The 5.25 Senior Notes and the guarantees will be CUSA s and the guarantors senior unsecured obligations and (i) rank equally in right of payment to 
 50 

CUSA s and the guarantors existing and future senior debt, including borrowings under CUSA's Credit Agreement (as defined below) and CUSA s existing senior notes, (ii) rank senior in right of payment to CUSA s and the guarantors future subordinated debt, (iii) are effectively subordinated to all of CUSA s and the guarantors existing and future secured debt, including all obligations under the Credit Agreement, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such debt, (iv) are structurally subordinated to all existing and future debt and other liabilities of CUSA s non-guarantor subsidiaries, and (v) are structurally senior to the 4.50 convertible senior notes due 2025 issued by Holdings. 
 CUSA may redeem the 5.25 Senior Notes in whole or in part at redemption prices specified in the indenture. 
 8.75 Secured Notes 
 On April 20, 2020, CUSA issued 250.0 million 8.75 senior secured notes (the 8.75 Secured Notes with a maturity date of May 1, 2025. Interest on the 8.75 Secured Notes was payable on May 1 and November 1 of each year. CUSA could redeem the 8.75 Secured Notes in whole or in part at redemption prices specified in the indenture. 
 On May 1, 2023, CUSA redeemed 100.0 million in principal amount of the 8.75 Secured Notes plus accrued interest thereon for 106.6 million in cash. Following the redemption, 150.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 8.75 Secured Notes remained outstanding. 
 On May 1, 2024, CUSA redeemed the remaining 150.0 million in outstanding principal amount of the 8.75 Secured Notes at par plus accrued interest thereon for 156.6 million in cash. Upon redemption, the indenture governing the 8.75 Secured Notes was fully satisfied and discharged. See Note 7 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information on the redemption. 
 Borrowing of International Subsidiaries 
 In August, 2024, one of the Company s international subsidiaries paid off its outstanding bank loan. The bank loan was scheduled to mature in January 2029. 
 Covenant Compliance 
 The indentures governing the 7.00 Senior Notes and the 5.25 Senior Notes ("the indentures") contain covenants that limit, among other things, the ability of CUSA and certain of its subsidiaries to (1) make investments or other restricted payments, including paying dividends, making other distributions or repurchasing subordinated debt or equity, (2) incur additional indebtedness and issue preferred stock, (3) enter into transactions with affiliates, (4) enter new lines of business, (5) merge or consolidate with, or sell all or substantially all of its assets to, another person and (6) create liens. As of September 30, 2024, CUSA could have distributed up to approximately 3.9 billion to its parent company and sole stockholder, Holdings, under the terms of the indentures, subject to its available cash and other borrowing restrictions outlined in the indentures. Upon a change of control, as defined in the indentures, CUSA would be required to make an offer to repurchase the 7.00 Senior Notes and the 5.25 Senior Notes at a price equal to 101 of the aggregate principal amount outstanding plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, through the date of repurchase. The indentures allow CUSA to incur additional indebtedness if it satisfies the coverage ratio specified in the indenture, after giving effect to the incurrence of the additional indebtedness, and in certain other circumstances. The required minimum coverage ratio is 2 to 1 and our actual ratio as of September 30, 2024 was 5.1 to 1. 
 See discussion of dividend restrictions and the net senior secured leverage ratio under the Credit Agreement at Senior Secured Credit Facility above. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we believe we were in full compliance with all agreements, including all related covenants, governing our outstanding debt.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitati ve Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We have exposure to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 The Company currently has variable rate debt. An increase or decrease in interest rates would affect its interest expense related to this variable rate debt. At September 30, 2024, we had an aggregate of 190.3 million of variable rate debt outstanding, after giving effect to the interest rate swaps. Based on the interest rates in effect on the variable rate debt outstanding at September 30, 2024, a 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by 1.9 million. 
 The tables below provide information about Holdings' and CUSA s fixed rate and variable rate long-term debt agreements as of September 30, 2024. The Company has three interest rate swap agreements that are used to hedge a portion of the interest rate risk associated with the variable interest rates on the Company s term loan debt. See Interest Rate Swap Agreements below. Holdings long-term debt agreements include fixed rate and variable rate long-term debt of CUSA, which is guaranteed by Holdings.
