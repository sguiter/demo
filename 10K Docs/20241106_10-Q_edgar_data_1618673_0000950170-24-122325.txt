Subsequent to September 28, 2024, the Company acquired Cheney Bros., Inc. ("Cheney Brothers") in a transaction valued at billion. The billion purchase price was financed with borrowings under the ABL Facility (as defined in Note 6. Debt ). Cheney Brothers will be reported in the Foodservice segment. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed will be recognized at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date. The Company is in the process of determining the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, which will require the use of judgment. Due to the limited time since the October 8, 2024 acquisition date, the preliminary acquisition valuation is incomplete at this time and the Company is unable to provide amounts recognized as of the acquisition date for the major classes of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including information required for valuation of intangible assets and goodwill.

Credit Agreement PFGC, Inc. PFGC ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and Performance Food Group, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of PFGC, were parties to the Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated September 17, 2021, as amended by the First Amendment to the Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated April 17, 2023 (as amended, the Prior Credit Agreement ). The Prior Credit Agreement had an aggregate principal amount available of billion and was scheduled to mature on . On September 9, 2024, PFGC and Performance Food Group, Inc. entered into the Sixth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the "ABL Facility"), with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent, and the other lenders party thereto, which amends and restates the Prior Credit Agreement. The ABL Facility, among other things, (i) increases the total revolving commitments from billion under the Prior Credit Agreement to billion under the ABL Facility and (ii) extends the stated maturity date from under the Prior Credit Agreement to , under the ABL Facility. The ABL Facility also provides for up to billion of uncommitted incremental facilities. The terms of any such incremental facility shall be agreed between Performance Food Group, Inc. and the lenders providing the new commitments, subject to certain limitations set forth in the ABL Facility. Performance Food Group, Inc. is the lead borrower under the ABL Facility, which is jointly and severally guaranteed by, and secured by the majority of the assets of, PFGC and all material domestic direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of PFGC (other than the captive insurance subsidiary and other excluded subsidiaries). Availability for loans and letters of credit under the ABL Facility is governed by a borrowing base, determined by the application of specified advance rates against eligible assets, including trade accounts receivable, inventory, owned real property, and owned transportation equipment. The borrowing base is reduced quarterly by a cumulative fraction of the real property and transportation equipment values. Advances on accounts receivable and inventory are subject to change based on periodic commercial finance examinations and appraisals, and the real property and transportation equipment values included in the borrowing base are subject to change based on periodic appraisals. Audits and appraisals are conducted at the direction of the administrative agent for the benefit and on behalf of all lenders.

million and (ii) of the lessor of the borrowing base and the sum of (a) the aggregate commitments plus (b) any outstanding term loans for five consecutive business days. The ABL Facility also contains customary restrictive covenants that include, but are not limited to, restrictions on the loan parties' and their subsidiaries' abilities to incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends, create liens, make investments, make prepayments, redemptions, or defeasances prior to the maturity of certain restricted debt and dispose of assets. The ABL Facility provides for customary events of default, including payment defaults and cross-defaults on other material indebtedness. If an event of default occurs and is continuing, amounts due under the ABL Facility may be accelerated and the rights and remedies of the lenders may be exercised, including rights with respect to the collateral securing the obligations under such agreement. S enior Notes due 2032 On September 12, 2024, Performance Food Group, Inc. issued and sold billion aggregate principal amount of its Senior Notes due (the "Notes due 2032"). The Notes due 2032 are jointly and severally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by PFGC and all domestic direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of PFGC (other than captive insurance subsidiaries and other excluded subsidiaries). The Notes due 2032 are not guaranteed by the Company. The Company intended to use the proceeds from the Notes due 2032, together with borrowings under the ABL Facility, to finance the cash consideration in connection with the acquisition of Cheney Brothers and to pay the fees, expenses, and other transaction costs incurred in connection with the Notes due 2032. However, since there was no requirement to hold the funds in escrow until the Cheney Brothers Acquisition closed, the net proceeds for the Notes due 2032 were used to pay down a portion of the outstanding balance of the ABL Facility. The Company subsequently funded the cash consideration for the Cheney Brothers Acquisition with borrowings under the ABL Facility. The Notes due 2032 were issued at of their par value. The Notes due 2032 mature on , and bear interest at a rate of per year, payable in arrears. (in the case of a change of control triggering event) or (in the case of an asset sale) of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. Performance Food Group, Inc. may redeem all or a part of the Notes due 2032 at any time prior to September 15, 2027, at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount of the Notes due 2032 being redeemed plus a make-whole premium and accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, beginning on September 15, 2027, Performance Food Group, Inc. may redeem all or a part of the Notes due 2032 at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The redemption price decreases to and of the principal amount redeemed on September 15, 2028, and September 15, 2029, respectively. In addition, at any time prior to September 15, 2027, Performance Food Group, Inc. may redeem up to of the Notes due 2032 from the proceeds of certain equity offerings at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The indenture governing the Notes due 2032 contains covenants limiting, among other things, PFGC s and its restricted subsidiaries ability to incur or guarantee additional debt or issue disqualified stock or preferred stock; pay dividends and make other distributions on, or redeem or repurchase, capital stock; make certain investments; incur certain liens; enter into transactions with affiliates; consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets; create certain restrictions on the ability of PFGC s restricted subsidiaries to make dividends or other payments to PFGC; designate restricted subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries; and transfer or sell certain assets. These covenants are subject to a number of important exceptions and qualifications.

year to years, some of which include years , and some of which include . Certain full-service fleet lease agreements include variable lease payments associated with usage, which are recorded and paid as incurred. When calculating lease liabilities, lease terms will include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Certain of the leases for tractors, trailers, and other vehicles and equipment provide for residual value guarantees to the lessors. Circumstances that would require the subsidiary to perform under the guarantees include either (1) default on the leases with the leased assets being sold for less than the specified residual values in the lease agreements, or (2) decisions not to purchase the assets at the end of the lease terms combined with the sale of the assets, with sales proceeds less than the residual value of the leased assets specified in the lease agreements. Residual value guarantees under these operating lease agreements typically range between and of the value of the leased assets at inception of the lease. These leases have original terms ranging from to and are set to expire at various dates ranging from to . As of September 28, 2024, the undiscounted maximum amount of potential future payments for lease residual value guarantees totaled approximately million, which would be mitigated by the fair value of the leased assets at lease expiration.

million and million, is million and million at September 28, 2024 and June 29, 2024 , respectively, and is determined by reviewing current market pricing related to comparable debt issued at the time of the balance sheet date, and is considered a Level 2 measurement. 

for the three months ended September 28, 2024 and for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The effective tax rate varies from the statutory rate primarily due to state and foreign income taxes, federal credits, and other permanent items. The excess tax benefit of exercised and vested stock awards is treated as a discrete item. The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 28, 2024, differed from the prior year period primarily due to an increase in foreign taxes and a decrease in deductible discrete items related to stock-based compensation, partially offset by a decrease in state taxes and an increase in federal credits. As of September 28, 2024 and June 29, 2024 , the Company had net deferred tax assets of million and million, respectively, and deferred tax liabilities of m illion and million, respectively. As of both September 28, 2024 and June 29, 2024, the Company had established a valuation allowance of m illion, net of federal benefit, against deferred tax assets related to certain net operating losses and certain other losses which are not likely to be realized due to limitations on utilization. The change in the deferred tax balances relates primarily to deferred taxes established in purchase accounting. The Company believes that it is more likely than not that the remaining deferred tax assets will be realized. On October 8, 2021, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development ("OECD") announced the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting ("Framework"), which provides for a two-pillar solution to address tax challenges arising from the digitalization of the economy. To mitigate the administrative burden in complying with the new rules during the initial years of implementation, the OECD developed the temporary Transitional Country-by-Country Safe Harbor ("Safe Harbor"). This transitional Safe Harbor applies for fiscal years beginning on or before December 31, 2026, but not including a fiscal

million related to capital projects and services including purchases of compressed natural gas for its trucking fleet at September 28, 2024. Amounts due under these contracts were not included on the Company s consolidated balance sheet as of September 28, 2024. Guarantees The Company from time to time enters into certain types of contracts that contingently require it to indemnify various parties against claims from third parties. These contracts primarily relate to: (i) certain real estate leases under which subsidiaries of the Company may be required to indemnify property owners for environmental and other liabilities and other claims arising from their use of the applicable premises; (ii) certain agreements with the Company s officers, directors, and employees under which the Company may be required to indemnify such persons for liabilities arising out of their employment relationship; and (iii) customer agreements under which the Company may be required to indemnify customers for certain claims brought against them with respect to the supplied products. Generally, a maximum obligation under these contracts is not explicitly stated. Because the obligated amounts associated with these types of agreements are not explicitly stated, the overall maximum amount of the obligation cannot be reasonably estimated. Historically, the Company has not been required to make payments under these obligations and, therefore, no liabilities have been recorded for these obligations in the Company s consolidated balance sheets. Litigation The Company is engaged in various legal proceedings that have arisen but have not been fully adjudicated. The likelihood of loss arising from these legal proceedings, based on definitions within contingency accounting literature, ranges from remote to reasonably possible to probable. When losses are probable and reasonably estimable, they have been accrued. Based on estimates of the range of potential losses associated with these matters, management does not believe that the ultimate resolution of these proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect upon the consolidated financial position or results of operations of the Company. However, the final results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty and, if the Company failed to prevail in one or more of these legal matters, and the associated realized losses were to exceed the Company s current estimates of the range of potential losses, the Company s consolidated financial position or results of operations could be materially adversely affected in future periods. JUUL Labs, Inc. Marketing Sales Practices, and Products Liability Litigation. In October 2019, a Multidistrict Litigation action MDL was initiated in order to centralize litigation against JUUL Labs, Inc. JUUL and other parties in connection with JUUL s e-cigarettes and related devices and components in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. On March 11, 2020, counsel for plaintiffs and the Plaintiffs Steering Committee filed a Master Complaint in the MDL ("Master Complaint") naming, among several other entities and individuals including JUUL, Altria Group, Inc., Philip Morris USA, Inc., Altria Client Services LLC, Altria Group Distribution Company, Altria Enterprises LLC, certain members of management and/or individual investors in JUUL, various e-liquid manufacturers, and various retailers, including the Company s subsidiaries Eby-Brown Company LLC Eby-Brown and Core-Mark Holding Company, Inc. Core-Mark ), as defendants. The Master Complaint also named additional distributors of JUUL products (collectively with Eby-Brown and Core-Mark, the Distributor Defendants ). The Master Complaint contains various state law claims and alleges that the Distributor Defendants: (i) failed to disclose JUUL s nicotine contents or the risks associated; (ii) pushed a product designed for a youth market; (iii) engaged with JUUL in planning and marketing its product in a manner designed to maximize the flow of JUUL products; (iv) met with JUUL management in San Francisco, California to further these business dealings; and (v) received incentives and business development funds for marketing and efficient sales. JUUL and Eby-Brown are parties to a Domestic Wholesale Distribution Agreement dated March 10, 2020 (the "Distribution Agreement"), and JUUL has agreed to defend and indemnify Eby-Brown under the terms of that agreement and is paying Eby-Brown s outside counsel fees directly. In addition, Core-Mark and JUUL have entered into a Defense and Indemnity Agreement dated March 8, 2021 (the "Defense Agreement") pursuant to which JUUL has agreed to defend and indemnify Core-Mark, and JUUL is paying Core-Mark s outside counsel fees directly.

reportable segments: Foodservice, Vistar, and Convenience . The Foodservice segment distributes a broad line of national brands, customer brands, and our proprietary-branded food and food-related products, or Performance Brands. Foodservice sells to independent and multi-unit Chain restaurants and other institutions such as schools, healthcare facilities, business and industry locations, and retail establishments. Our Chain customers are multi-unit restaurants with five or more locations and include some of the most recognizable family and casual dining restaurant chains. Our Vistar segment specializes in distributing candy, snacks, beverages, and other items nationally to vending, office coffee service, theater, retail, hospitality, and other channels. Our Convenience segment distributes candy, snacks, beverages, cigarettes, other tobacco products, food and foodservice related products, and other items to convenience stores across North America. Corporate All Other is comprised of corporate overhead and certain operations that are not considered separate reportable segments based on their size. This includes the operations of the Company s internal logistics unit responsible for managing and allocating inbound logistics revenue and expense. Corporate All Other may also include capital expenditures for certain information technology projects that are transferred to the segments once placed in service. Intersegment sales represent sales between the segments, which are eliminated in consolidation. Management evaluates the performance of each operating segment based on various operating and financial metrics, including total sales and Segment Adjusted EBITDA, which is the Company s GAAP measure of segment profit. Segment Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income before interest expense, interest income, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization and excludes certain items that the Company does not consider part of its segments' core operating results, including stock-based compensation expense, changes in the last-in-first-out ("LIFO") reserve, acquisition, integration and reorganization expenses, and gains and losses related to fuel derivatives.

Item 2.	Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the unaudited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q and the audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in the Form 10-K. In addition to historical consolidated financial information, this discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs and involve numerous risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to those described in the Item 1A. Risk Factors section of the Form 10-K. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. You should carefully read Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. 
 Our Company 
 We market and distribute food and food-related products to customers across North America from our over 150 locations to over 300,000 customer locations in the food-away-from-home industry. We offer our customers a broad assortment of products including our proprietary-branded products, nationally branded products, and products bearing our customers brands. Our product assortment ranges from center-of-the-plate items (such as beef, pork, poultry, and seafood), frozen foods, and groceries to candy, snacks, and beverages. We also sell disposables, cleaning and kitchen supplies, and related products used by our customers, as well as cigarettes and other tobacco products. In addition to the products we offer to our customers, we provide value-added services by allowing our customers to benefit from our industry knowledge, scale, and expertise in the areas of product selection and procurement, menu development, and operational strategy. 
 Based on the Company s organizational structure and how the Company s management reviews operating results and makes decisions about resource allocation, the Company has three reportable segments: Foodservice, Vistar, and Convenience. Our Foodservice segment distributes a broad line of national brands, customer brands, and our proprietary-branded food and food-related products, or Performance Brands. Foodservice sells to independent and multi-unit Chain restaurants and other institutions such as schools, healthcare facilities, business and industry locations, and retail establishments. Our Chain customers are multi-unit restaurants with five or more locations and include some of the most recognizable family and casual dining restaurant chains. Our Vistar segment specializes in distributing candy, snacks, beverages, and other items nationally to vending, office coffee service, theater, retail, hospitality, and other channels. Our Convenience segment distributes candy, snacks, beverages, cigarettes, other tobacco products, food and foodservice related products and other items to convenience stores across North America. We believe that there are substantial synergies across our segments. Cross-segment synergies include procurement, operational best practices such as the use of new productivity technologies, and supply chain and network optimization, as well as shared corporate functions such as accounting, treasury, tax, legal, information systems, and human resources. 
 On October 8, 2024, the Company acquired Cheney Bros., Inc. ("Cheney Brothers") in a transaction valued at 2.1 billion. The 2.1 billion purchase price was financed with borrowings under the ABL Facility. Cheney Brothers will be reported in the Foodservice segment. 
 Key Factors Affecting Our Business 
 We believe that our long-term performance is principally affected by the following key factors: 
 Changing demographic and macroeconomic trends. Excluding the peak years of the COVID-19 pandemic, the share of consumer spending captured by the food-away-from-home industry has increased steadily for several decades. The share increases in periods of increasing employment, rising disposable income, increases in the number of restaurants, and favorable demographic trends, such as smaller household sizes, an increasing number of dual income households, and an aging population base that spends more per capita at foodservice establishments and is adversely impacted when these factors move in the opposite direction. The foodservice distribution industry is also sensitive to national and regional economic conditions, such as changes in consumer spending, changes in consumer confidence, changes in the rate of inflation and fuel prices, supply chain disruptions, and labor shortages. 

22 

Food distribution market structure. The food distribution market consists of a wide spectrum of companies ranging from businesses selling a single category of product (e.g., produce) to large national and regional broadline distributors with many distribution centers and thousands of products across all categories. We believe our scale enables us to invest in our Performance Brands, to benefit from economies of scale in purchasing and procurement, and to drive supply chain efficiencies that enhance our customers satisfaction and profitability. We believe that the relative growth of larger foodservice distributors will continue to outpace that of smaller, independent players in our industry. 

Our ability to successfully execute our segment strategies and implement our initiatives. Our performance will continue to depend on our ability to successfully execute our segment strategies and to implement our current and future initiatives. The key strategies include focusing on independent sales and Performance Brands, pursuing new customers for our three reportable segments, expansion of geographies, utilizing our infrastructure to gain further operating and purchasing efficiencies, and making strategic acquisitions. 

How We Assess the Performance of Our Business 
 In assessing the performance of our business, we consider a variety of performance and financial measures. The key measures used by our management are discussed below. The percentages on the results presented below are calculated based on rounded numbers. 
 Net Sales 
 Net sales is equal to gross sales, plus excise taxes, minus sales returns; sales incentives that we offer to our customers, such as rebates and discounts that are offsets to gross sales; and certain other adjustments. Our net sales are driven by changes in case volumes and product inflation that is reflected in the pricing of our products and mix of products sold. 
 Gross Profit 
 Gross profit is equal to our net sales minus our cost of goods sold. Cost of goods sold primarily includes inventory costs (net of supplier consideration), inbound freight, and remittances of excise tax. Cost of goods sold generally changes as we incur higher or lower costs from our suppliers and as our customer and product mix changes. 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 Management measures operating performance based on our Adjusted EBITDA, defined as net income before interest expense, interest income, income and franchise taxes, and depreciation and amortization, further adjusted to exclude certain items that we do not consider part of our core operating results. Such adjustments include certain unusual, non-cash, non-recurring, cost reduction, and other adjustment items permitted in calculating covenant compliance under our ABL Facility and indentures (other than certain pro forma adjustments permitted under our ABL Facility and indentures governing the Notes due 2027, Notes due 2029, and Notes due 2032 relating to the Adjusted EBITDA contribution of acquired entities or businesses prior to the acquisition date). Under our ABL Facility and indentures, our ability to engage in certain activities such as incurring certain additional indebtedness, making certain investments, and making restricted payments is tied to ratios based on Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the ABL Facility and indentures). Our definition of Adjusted EBITDA may not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies. 
 Adjusted EBITDA is not defined under GAAP, is not a measure of operating income, operating performance, or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP, and is subject to important limitations. We use this measure to evaluate the performance of our business on a consistent basis over time and for business planning purposes. In addition, targets based on Adjusted EBITDA are among the measures we use to evaluate our management s performance for purposes of determining their compensation under our incentive plans. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors because it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors, and other interested parties, including our lenders under the ABL Facility and holders of our Notes due 2027, Notes due 2029, and Notes due 2032 in their evaluation of the operating performance of companies in industries similar to ours. 
 Adjusted EBITDA has important limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. For example, Adjusted EBITDA: 
 excludes certain tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us; 

does not reflect any cash capital expenditure requirements for the assets being depreciated and amortized that may have to be replaced in the future; 

23 

does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; and 

does not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements, necessary to service our debt. 

In calculating Adjusted EBITDA, we add back certain non-cash, non-recurring, and other items as permitted or required by our ABL Facility and indentures. Adjusted EBITDA among other things: 
 does not include non-cash stock-based employee compensation expense and other non-cash charges; and 

does not include acquisition, restructuring, and other costs incurred to realize future cost savings and enhance our operations. 

We have included the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA for the periods presented.

Consolidated Results of Operations 
 Three months ended September 28, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 
 Net Sales 
 Net sales growth is a function of acquisitions, case growth, pricing (which is primarily based on product inflation/deflation), and a changing mix of customers, channels, and product categories sold. Net sales increased 476.9 million, or 3.2 , for the first three months of fiscal 2025 compared to the first three months of fiscal 2024. 
 The increase in net sales was driven by recent acquisitions, an increase in cases sold including a favorable shift in mix of cases sold, and an increase in selling price per case as a result of inflation. Total case volume increased 2.6 in the first three months of fiscal 2025 compared to the same period of fiscal 2024. Total organic case volume growth of 1.2 benefited from a 4.3 increase in organic independent cases, including growth in Performance Brands cases, and growth in cases sold to Foodservice's Chain business. The overall rate of product cost inflation was approximately 5.0 for the first three months of fiscal 2025. 
 Gross Profit 
 Gross profit increased 101.3 million, or 6.1 , for the first three months of fiscal 2025 compared to the first three months of fiscal 2024. The increase in gross profit was primarily driven by recent acquisitions, cost of goods sold optimization through procurement efficiencies, a favorable shift in the mix of cases sold, and growth in cases sold, including growth in the independent channel. Independent customers typically receive more services from us, cost more to serve, and pay a higher gross profit per case than other customers. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Operating expenses increased 102.2 million, or 7.1 , for the first three months of fiscal 2025 compared to the first three months of fiscal 2024. The increase in operating expenses for the first three months of fiscal 2025 was primarily driven by recent acquisitions, a 41.9 million increase in personnel expenses primarily related to wages, commissions, and benefits, and an 12.2 million increase in insurance expense primarily related to workers compensation and vehicle liability, partially offset by a 9.0 million decrease in fuel expense primarily due to lower fuel prices in the first three months of fiscal 2025 as compared to the prior year period. 
 Depreciation and amortization of intangible assets increased from 129.3 million for the first three months of fiscal 2024 to 152.9 million in the first three months of fiscal 2025. Depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of intangible assets increased as a result of recent acquisitions, an increase in transportation equipment under finance leases, and accelerated amortization of certain customer relationships and trade names. 
 25 

Net Income 
 Net income decreased 12.7 million, or 10.5 for the first three months of fiscal 2025 compared to the first three months of fiscal 2024. The decrease in net income was primarily attributable to the increase in operating expenses, interest expense, and other expense, partially offset by the increase in gross profit and decrease in income tax expense. The increase in interest expense was primarily the result of an increase in the average borrowings, including finance lease obligations, during the first three months fiscal 2025 compared to the prior year period. 
 The Company reported income tax expense of 38.9 million for the first three months of fiscal 2025 compared to income tax expense of 42.6 million for the first three months of fiscal 2024. Our effective tax rate for the first three months of fiscal 2025 was 26.5 compared to 26.1 for the first three months of fiscal 2024. The effective tax rate for the period ended September 28, 2024, differed from the prior year period primarily due to an increase in foreign taxes and a decrease in deductible discrete items related to stock-based compensation, partially offset by a decrease in state taxes and an increase in federal credits. 
 Segment Results 
 The Company has three reportable segments: Foodservice, Vistar, and Convenience. Management evaluates the performance of these segments based on various operating and financial metrics, including their respective sales growth and Segment Adjusted EBITDA, which is the Company s GAAP measure of segment profit. Segment Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income before interest expense, interest income, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization and excludes certain items that the Company does not consider part of its segments core operating results, including stock-based compensation expense, changes in the LIFO reserve, acquisition, integration and reorganization expenses, and gains and losses related to fuel derivatives. See Note 13. Segment Information of the consolidated financial statements within Part I, Item 1. Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q. 
 Corporate All Other is comprised of unallocated corporate overhead and certain operations that are not considered separate reportable segments based on their size. This also includes the operations of our internal logistics unit responsible for managing and allocating inbound logistics revenue and expense.

 Net Sales 
 Net sales for Foodservice increased 415.1 million, or 5.7 , from the first three months of fiscal 2024 to the first three months of fiscal 2025. This increase in net sales was driven by a recent acquisition, an increase in selling price per case as a result of inflation, and case volume growth, including growth in our independent and Chain business. Total case growth for Foodservice was 2.9 and organic case growth was 1.6 for the first three months of fiscal 2025, compared to the prior year period. Securing new and expanding business with independent customers resulted in total independent case growth of 7.8 and organic independent case growth of 4.3 in the first three months of fiscal 2025, compared to the prior year period.

Gross profit contributing to Foodservice s Adjusted EBITDA increased 65.7 million, or 6.4 , in the first three months of fiscal 2025, compared to the prior year period. The increase in gross profit was driven by a recent acquisition, a favorable shift in the mix of cases sold, and growth in cases sold, including more Performance Brands products sold to independent customers. 
 Operating expenses impacting Foodservice's Adjusted EBITDA increased 31.8 million, or 4.1 , from the first three months of fiscal 2024 to the first three months of fiscal 2025.

The increase in net sales was driven primarily by an acquisition in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Total organic case volume growth for Vistar was flat, as growth in the vending, office coffee service, and corrections channels was offset by declines in theater and retail cases sold, in the first three months of fiscal 2025 compared to the prior year period. 
 Segment Adjusted EBITDA 
 Adjusted EBITDA for Vistar decreased 5.4 million, or 6.1 , from the first three months of fiscal 2024 to the first three months of fiscal 2025. The decrease was the result of an increase in operating expenses, partially offset by an increase in gross profit. Gross profit increased 19.0 million, or 9.1 , for the first three months of fiscal 2025 compared to the prior year period primarily driven by an acquisition in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. 
 Operating expenses impacting Vistar's Adjusted EBITDA increased 24.3 million, or 20.2 , for the first three months of fiscal 2025 compared to the prior year period.

Segment Results Convenience 
 Three months ended September 28, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 
 Net Sales 
 Net sales for Convenience increased 26.7 million, or 0.4 , from the first three months of fiscal 2024 to the first three months of fiscal 2025 driven primarily by an increase in selling price per case as a result of continued inflation for food and foodservice related products and cigarette manufacturers price increases, as well as an increase in food and foodservice related cases sold, partially offset by a decline in cigarette carton sales. 
 Segment Adjusted EBITDA 
 Adjusted EBITDA for Convenience increased 10.6 million, or 11.2 , from the first three months of fiscal 2024 to the first three months of fiscal 2025. This increase was a result of an increase in gross profit, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses. Gross profit contributing to Convenience's Adjusted EBITDA increased 13.7 million, or 3.3 , for the first three months of fiscal 2025 compared to the prior year period primarily due to a favorable shift in mix of cases sold and growth in cases sold. 
 Operating expenses impacting Convenience's Adjusted EBITDA increased 3.0 million, or 1.0 , for the first three months of fiscal 2025 compared to the prior year period. Operating expenses increased primarily as a result of a 4.0 million increase in insurance expense primarily related to worker's compensation, partially offset by a 1.8 million decrease in fuel expense primarily due to lower fuel prices compared to the prior year period. 
 Depreciation and amortization of intangible assets recorded in this segment increased from 37.7 million in the first three months of fiscal 2024 to 38.6 million in the first three months of fiscal 2025. 
 Segment Results Corporate All Other 
 Three months ended September 28, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 
 Net Sales 
 Net sales for Corporate All Other increased 15.7 million from the first three months of fiscal 2024 to the first three months of fiscal 2025. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in products and services sold to our other segments. 
 Segment Adjusted EBITDA 
 Adjusted EBITDA for Corporate All Other was a negative 56.6 million for the first three months of fiscal 2025 compared to a negative 45.5 million for the first three months of fiscal 2024. The decline in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily driven by a 5.4 million increase in corporate personnel expense and a 2.7 million increase in information technology maintenance expense primarily related to cloud-based services. 
 Depreciation and amortization of intangible assets recorded in this segment increased from 10.6 million in the first three months of fiscal 2024 to 14.9 million in the first three months of fiscal 2025 due to accelerated amortization of certain customer relationships and trade names. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We have historically financed our operations and growth primarily with cash flows from operations, borrowings under our credit facility, operating and finance leases, and normal trade credit terms. We have typically funded our acquisitions with additional borrowings under our credit facility or net proceeds from the issuances of senior notes. Our working capital and borrowing levels are subject to seasonal fluctuations and timing of procurement and acquisition activities. We borrow under our credit facility or pay it down regularly based on our cash flows from operating and investing activities. Our practice is to minimize interest expense while maintaining reasonable liquidity. 
 As market conditions warrant, we may from time to time seek to repurchase our securities or loans in privately negotiated or open market transactions, by tender offer or otherwise. Any such repurchases may be funded by incurring new debt, including additional borrowings under our credit facility. In addition, depending on conditions in the credit and capital markets and other factors, we will, from time to time, consider other financing transactions, the proceeds of which could be used to refinance our indebtedness, make investments or acquisitions or for other purposes. Any new debt may be secured debt. 
 28 

We are exposed to interest rate risk related to changes in interest rates for borrowings under our ABL Facility. To add stability to interest expense and manage our exposure to interest rate movements, we enter into interest rate swap agreements. These swaps are designated as cash flow hedges and involve the receipt of variable-rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for making fixed-rate payments. As of September 28, 2024, 350.0 million of the outstanding ABL Facility balance is currently hedged under interest rate swaps which results in 89 of our total debt outstanding, including finance lease obligations, being fixed-rate debt. 
 In November 2022, the Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to 300 million of the Company s outstanding common stock. This authorization replaced the previously authorized 250 million share repurchase program. The new share repurchase program has an expiration date of November 16, 2026 and may be amended, suspended, or discontinued at any time at the Company s discretion, subject to compliance with applicable laws. Repurchases under this program depend upon marketplace conditions and other factors, including compliance with the covenants in the agreements governing our existing indebtedness. During the first quarter of fiscal 2025, the Company repurchased 0.4 million shares of the Company's common stock, for a total of 29.5 million or an average cost of 74.69 per share. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company repurchased and subsequently retired 0.5 million shares of the Company's common stock, for a total of 28.1 million or an average cost of 60.35 per share. As of September 28, 2024, 181.1 million remained available for share repurchases. 
 Our contractual cash requirements over the next 12 months and beyond relate to our long-term debt and associated interest payments, operating and finance leases, and purchase obligations. For information regarding the Company s expected cash requirements related to long-term debt and operating and finance leases, see Note 6. Debt and Note 7. Leases , respectively, of the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q. As of September 28, 2024, the Company had total purchase obligations of 199.7 million, which includes agreements for purchases related to capital projects and services in the normal course of business, for which all significant terms have been confirmed, as well as a minimum amount due for various Company meetings and conferences. Purchase obligations also include amounts committed to various capital projects in process or scheduled to be completed in the coming fiscal years. As of September 28, 2024, the Company had commitments of 114.8 million for capital projects related to warehouse expansion and improvements and warehouse equipment. The Company anticipates using cash flows from operations or borrowings under the ABL Facility to fulfill these commitments. Amounts due under these agreements were not included in the Company s consolidated balance sheet as of September 28, 2024. 
 We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 
 We believe that our cash flows from operations and available borrowing capacity will be sufficient both to meet our anticipated cash requirements over at least the next 12 months and to maintain sufficient liquidity for normal operating purposes and to fund capital expenditures. 
 As of September 28, 2024, our cash balance totaled 50.3 million, including restricted cash of 7.8 million, as compared to a cash balance totaling 27.7 million, including restricted cash of 7.7 million, as of June 29, 2024. 
 Three months ended September 28, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 
 Operating Activities 
 During the first three months of fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024, our operating activities provided cash flow of 53.5 million and 87.1 million, respectively. The decrease in cash flow provided by operating activities in the first three months of fiscal 2025 compared to the first three months of fiscal 2024 was largely driven by advanced purchases of cigarette and candy inventory to take advantage of preferred pricing. 
 Investing Activities 
 Cash used in investing activities totaled 669.8 million in the first three months of fiscal 2025 compared to 266.9 million in the first three months of fiscal 2024. These investments consisted of cash paid of 574.3 million for an acquisition in the first three months of fiscal 2025 compared to 214.6 million for an acquisition in the first three months of fiscal 2024, along with capital purchases of property, plant, and equipment of 96.5 million and 53.2 million for the first three months of fiscal 2025 and the first three months of fiscal 2024, respectively. For the first three months of fiscal 2025, purchases of property, plant, and equipment primarily consisted of outlays for warehouse expansion and improvements, warehouse equipment, information technology, and transportation equipment. The following table presents the capital purchases of property, plant, and equipment by segment.

 During the first three months of fiscal 2024, our financing activities provided cash flow of 175.0 million, which consisted primarily of 249.0 million in net borrowings under our ABL Facility. 
 The following describes our financing arrangements as of September 28, 2024: 
 Credit Agreement : PFGC, Inc. PFGC ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and Performance Food Group, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of PFGC, were parties to the Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated September 17, 2021, as amended by the First Amendment to the Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated April 17, 2023 (as amended, the Prior Credit Agreement ). The Prior Credit Agreement had an aggregate principal amount available of 4.0 billion and was scheduled to mature on September 17, 2026. 
 On September 9, 2024, PFGC and Performance Food Group, Inc. entered into the Sixth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the "ABL Facility"), with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent, and the other lenders party thereto, which amends and restates the Prior Credit Agreement. The ABL Facility, among other things, (i) increases the total revolving commitments from 4.0 billion under the Prior Credit Agreement to 5.0 billion under the ABL Facility and (ii) extends the stated maturity date from September 17, 2026, under the Prior Credit Agreement to September 9, 2029, under the ABL Facility. The ABL Facility also provides for up to 1.0 billion of uncommitted incremental facilities. The terms of any such incremental facility shall be agreed between Performance Food Group, Inc. and the lenders providing the new commitments, subject to certain limitations set forth in the ABL Facility. 
 Performance Food Group, Inc. is the lead borrower under the ABL Facility, which is jointly and severally guaranteed by, and secured by the majority of the assets of, PFGC and all material domestic direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of PFGC (other than the captive insurance subsidiary and other excluded subsidiaries). Availability for loans and letters of credit under the ABL Facility is governed by a borrowing base, determined by the application of specified advance rates against eligible assets, including trade accounts receivable, inventory, owned real property, and owned transportation equipment. The borrowing base is reduced quarterly by a cumulative fraction of the real property and transportation equipment values. Advances on accounts receivable and inventory are subject to change based on periodic commercial finance examinations and appraisals, and the real property and transportation equipment values included in the borrowing base are subject to change based on periodic appraisals. Audits and appraisals are conducted at the direction of the administrative agent for the benefit and on behalf of all lenders. 
 Borrowings under the ABL Facility bear interest, at Performance Food Group, Inc. s option, at (a) the Base Rate (defined as the greatest of (i) a floor rate of 0.00 , (ii) the federal funds rate in effect on such date plus 0.5 , (iii) the prime rate on such day, or (iv) one month Term SOFR plus 1.0 plus a spread or (b) Term SOFR plus a spread. The ABL Facility also provides for an unused commitment fee at a rate of 0.250 per annum based on average excess availability. 
 The following table summarizes outstanding borrowings, availability, and the average interest rate under the Company's ABL Facility:

 30 

borrowing base and the sum of (a) the aggregate commitments plus (b) any outstanding term loans for five consecutive business days. The ABL Facility also contains customary restrictive covenants that include, but are not limited to, restrictions on the loan parties' and their subsidiaries' abilities to incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends, create liens, make investments, make prepayments, redemptions, or defeasances prior to the maturity of certain restricted debt and dispose of assets. The ABL Facility provides for customary events of default, including payment defaults and cross-defaults on other material indebtedness. If an event of default occurs and is continuing, amounts due under the ABL Facility may be accelerated and the rights and remedies of the lenders may be exercised, including rights with respect to the collateral securing the obligations under such agreement. 
 Senior Notes due 2027 : On September 27, 2019, PFG Escrow Corporation (which merged with and into Performance Food Group, Inc.) issued and sold 1,060.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.500 Senior Notes due 2027 ("the "Notes due 2027").

 The Notes due 2027 were issued at 100.0 of their par value. The Notes due 2027 mature on October 15, 2027 and bear interest at a rate of 5.500 per year, payable semi-annually in arrears. 
 Upon the occurrence of a change of control triggering event or upon the sale of certain assets in which Performance Food Group, Inc. does not apply the proceeds as required, the holders of the Notes due 2027 will have the right to require Performance Food Group, Inc. to repurchase each holder s Notes due 2027 at a price equal to 101 (in the case of a change of control triggering event) or 100 (in the case of an asset sale) of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. Beginning on October 15, 2024, Performance Food Group, Inc. may redeem all or part of the Notes due 2027 at a redemption price equal to 100.0 of the principal amount redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest.

 Senior Notes due 2029 : On July 26, 2021, Performance Food Group, Inc. issued and sold 1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of its 4.250 Senior Notes due 2029 (the Notes due 2029 ).

The Notes due 2029 are not guaranteed by the Company. 
 The proceeds from the Notes due 2029 were used to pay down the outstanding balance of the ABL Facility, to redeem the 5.500 Senior Notes due 2024, and to pay the fees, expenses, and other transaction costs incurred in connection with the Notes due 2029. 
 The Notes due 2029 were issued at 100.0 of their par value. The Notes due 2029 mature on August 1, 2029 and bear interest at a rate of 4.250 per year, payable semi-annually in arrears. 
 Upon the occurrence of a change of control triggering event or upon the sale of certain assets in which Performance Food Group, Inc. does not apply the proceeds as required, the holders of the Notes due 2029 will have the right to require Performance Food Group, Inc. to repurchase each holder s Notes due 2029 at a price equal to 101 (in the case of a change of control triggering event) or 100 (in the case of an asset sale) of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. Performance Food Group, Inc. may redeem all or part of the Notes due 2029 at a redemption price equal to 102.125 of the principal amount redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The redemption price decreases to 101.163 and 100 of the principal amount redeemed on August 1, 2025, and August 1, 2026, respectively.

affiliates; consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets; create certain restrictions on the ability of PFGC s restricted subsidiaries to make dividends or other payments to PFGC; designate restricted subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries; and transfer or sell certain assets. These covenants are subject to a number of important exceptions and qualifications. The Notes due 2029 also contain customary events of default, the occurrence of which could result in the principal of and accrued interest on the Notes due 2029 to become or be declared due and payable. 
 Senior Notes due 2032 : On September 12, 2024, Performance Food Group, Inc. issued and sold 1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of its Notes due 2032. The Notes due 2032 are jointly and severally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by PFGC and all domestic direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of PFGC (other than captive insurance subsidiaries and other excluded subsidiaries). The Notes due 2032 are not guaranteed by the Company. 
 The Company intended to use the proceeds from the Notes due 2032, together with borrowings under the ABL Facility, to finance the cash consideration in connection with the acquisition of Cheney Brothers and to pay the fees, expenses, and other transaction costs incurred in connection with the Notes due 2032. However, since there was no requirement to hold the funds in escrow until the Cheney Brothers acquisition closed, the net proceeds from the Notes due 2032 were used to pay down a portion of the outstanding balance of the ABL Facility. The Company subsequently funded the cash consideration for the Cheney Brothers acquisition with borrowings under the ABL Facility. 
 The Notes due 2032 were issued at 100.0 of their par value. The Notes due 2032 mature on September 15, 2032, and bear interest at a rate of 6.125 per year, payable semi-annually in arrears.

Performance Food Group, Inc. may redeem all or a part of the Notes due 2032 at any time prior to September 15, 2027, at a redemption price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the Notes due 2032 being redeemed plus a make-whole premium and accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, beginning on September 15, 2027, Performance Food Group, Inc. may redeem all or a part of the Notes due 2032 at a redemption price equal to 103.063 of the principal amount redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The redemption price decreases to 101.531 and 100 of the principal amount redeemed on September 15, 2028, and September 15, 2029, respectively. In addition, at any time prior to September 15, 2027, Performance Food Group, Inc. may redeem up to 40 of the Notes due 2032 from the proceeds of certain equity offerings at a redemption price equal to 106.125 of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest. 
 The indenture governing the Notes due 2032 contains covenants limiting, among other things, PFGC s and its restricted subsidiaries ability to incur or guarantee additional debt or issue disqualified stock or preferred stock; pay dividends and make other distributions on, or redeem or repurchase, capital stock; make certain investments; incur certain liens; enter into transactions with affiliates; consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets; create certain restrictions on the ability of PFGC s restricted subsidiaries to make dividends or other payments to PFGC; designate restricted subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries; and transfer or sell certain assets. These covenants are subject to a number of important exceptions and qualifications. The Notes due 2032 also contain customary events of default, the occurrence of which could result in the principal of and accrued interest on the Notes due 2032 to become or be declared due and payable. 
 The ABL Facility and the indentures governing the Notes due 2027, the Notes due 2029, and the Notes due 2032 contain customary restrictive covenants under which all of the net assets of PFGC and its subsidiaries were restricted from distribution to Performance Food Group Company, except for approximately 1,872.2 million of restricted payment capacity available under such debt agreements, as of September 28, 2024. Such minimum estimated restricted payment capacity is calculated based on the most restrictive of our debt agreements and may fluctuate from period to period, which fluctuations may be material. Our restricted payment capacity under other debt instruments to which the Company is subject may be materially higher than the foregoing estimate. 
 As of September 28, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all of the covenants under the ABL Facility and the indentures governing the Notes due 2027, the Notes due 2029 and the Notes due 2032.

 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Regulations under the Exchange Act require public companies, including us, to maintain disclosure controls and procedures, which are defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act to mean a company s controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required or necessary disclosures.
