owned subsidiary,
Nascent Pharma, LLC, acquired certain Patents using liquid formulations containing cannabinoids which are used in such products as vape
cartridges, edibles, pills, gummies, tinctures, oils, concentrates and more. 

Prior
to September 2024 , the Company was in the business of promoting health and wellness through its development, manufacture and sale of
products containing cannabinoids derived from hemp biomass and the licensing of durable medical devises. Can B s products
included oils, creams, moisturizers, isolate, gel caps, spa products, and concentrates. Can B developed its own line of proprietary
products and sought synergistic value through acquisitions in the hemp industry. In June 2024, Can B shifted its business focus
to commercializing and enforcing the patents recently acquired by Nascent Pharma, LLC Nascent ), continuing to collect
Duramed receivables and reestablishing the Company s production of the Longevity Brand Superfood drink mix for Brooke Burke Body,
Inc. 

On
October 25, 2015, Can B implemented a legal reorganization which resulted in Nascent Pharma Holdings, Inc. NPH owning all of the outstanding stock of Can B . Consequently, Can B became a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of NPH. Each share
of each class of Can B stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the legal reorganization automatically converted into
an equivalent corresponding share of NPH stock, having the same designations, rights, powers and preferences and the qualifications,
limitations and restrictions as the corresponding share of Can B stock being converted. Asa result, Can B s stockholders
immediately prior to the consummation of the legal reorganization became stockholders of NPH. 

and negative working capital of . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred losses of 
which made the total accumulated deficit through September 30, 2024. These factors raise substantial doubt as to the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern. 

The
Company is currently funding its operations on a month-to-month basis through third party loans. In March 2024, certain equipment used
in the operation of the Company s hemp division was sold in an auction conducted under Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code.
The auction resulted in proceeds of approximately which were applied to the Company s obligations under convertible notes
held by Arena Special Opportunities Partners I, L.P. and its affiliates. In June 2024, the Company s Board of Directors concluded
that as a result of the impact of the auction on the hemp division, it is no longer feasible to continue the Company s hemp operations.
As a result, the Company will no longer pursue the development, manufacture or sale of hemp derived products. 

Historically,
revenues from the Company s hemp division supported, in part, its durable medical equipment business conducted through Duramed.
Due to the elimination of support from the hemp division, Duramed is operating with reduced staff which has adversely impacted revenues. 

The
Company s ability to continue its operations is dependent on the execution of management s plans, which include
protecting and commercializing the cannabis patents recently acquired by Nascent, raising litigation funding to support
Nascent s patent protection efforts, continuing to collect Duramed receivables, reestablishing the Company s production
of the Longevity Brand Superfood drink mix for Brooke Burke Body, Inc., restructuring outstanding indebtedness and raising of
capital through the debt and/or equity markets. The condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that
might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. If the Company is not to continue as a going
concern, it would likely not be able to realize its assets at values comparable to the carrying value or the fair value estimates
reflected in the balances set out in its financial statements. 

There
can be no assurances that the Company will be successful in generating additional cash from equity or debt financings or other sources
to be used for operations. Should the Company not be successful in obtaining the necessary financing to fund its operations, it would
need to curtail certain or all operational activities and/or contemplate the sale of its assets, if necessary.

of notes payable as of December 31, 2023 and corresponding decrease to stockholder s equity/(deficit). The error was a result of improper accounting for certain conversions of principal to common stock. Amounts were
corrected via reconciliation to supporting documentation from each lender. Going forward, the Company is implementing a more stringent
debt reconciliation process and a lender by lender basis. 

In
accordance with the SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 99, Materiality, and SAB No. 108, Considering the Effects
of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements, the Company evaluated the materiality
of the error from qualitative and quantitative perspectives and concluded that the error was immaterial to the September 30, 2024 and
December 31, 2023, financial statements. Consequently, only the December 31, 2023, consolidated balance sheet and the December 31, 2023,

ITEM
2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Can
B Corp. was originally formed as a Florida corporation on October 11, 2005, under the name of WrapMail, Inc. Effective January
5, 2015, we acquired 100 ownership of Prosperity Systems, Inc., which the Company is in the process of dissolving. Effective December
28, 2018, we acquired 100 ownership of Pure Health Products. In November 2018, we formed Duramed as a wholly owned subsidiary. The Company
is presently in the process of dissolving Prosperity. 

Prior
to June 2024, The Company was in the business of promoting health and wellness through its development, manufacture and sale of products
containing cannabinoids derived from hemp biomass and the licensing of durable medical devices. Can B s products included
oils, creams, moisturizers, isolate, gel caps, spa products, and concentrates and lifestyle products. Can B developed its own line
of proprietary products and sought synergistic value through acquisitions in the hemp industry. 

On
March 14, 2024, an auction of the assets of our hemp division was conducted under Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code following
allegations by Arena that we were in breach of our obligations under certain notes and a forbearance agreement. See Part II Item
1. Legal Proceedings. 

Following
the auction, we continued our hemp operations on a reduced scale using equipment provided by third parties and the services of third-party
processors. Historically, revenues from our hemp division supported, in part, our durable medical equipment business conducted through
Duramed. Due to reduced support from the hemp division, Duramed is operating with reduced staff which has adversely impacted revenues.
In June 2024,, our Board of Directors concluded that as a result of the impact of the auction conducted by Arena under Article 9 of the
Uniform Commercial Code on the hemp division, it is no longer feasible to continue our hemp operations. As a result, we are no longer
pursuing the development, manufacture or sale of hemp derived products. Going forward, our primary focus will be on protecting and commercializing
the cannabis patents acquired by Nascent, continuing to collect Duramed receivables and reestablishing the Company s production
of the Longevity Brand Superfood drink mix for Brooke Burke Body, Inc. 

The
condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of CANB and its operational wholly owned subsidiaries. 

Results
of Operations 

Three
months ended September 30, 2024 compared to three months ended September 30, 2023. 

Revenues
decreased 403,688. The decrease largely due to the normalization of sales activity in 2023, the Company discontinuing the sale of certain
products and the Company s decision to discontinue its hemp operations. 

Cost
of product sales decreased 819,831 due to inventory adjustments taken and the decrease in revenue. 

Operating
expenses decreased 329,100 due to a decrease consulting fees, rent and other operating expenses. 

Nine
months ended September 30, 2024 compared to nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Revenues
decreased 1,122,203. The decrease largely due to the normalization of sales activity with 2023, the Company ending the sale of certain
of its product offerings around hemp products and the Company s decision to discontinue its hemp operations. 

Cost
of product sales decreased 420,201 due to inventory adjustments taken and decrease in revenue.

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements 

In
December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. These amendments address
investor requests for enhanced transparency regarding income tax information. Specifically, they improve income tax disclosures related
to rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. ASU 2023-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company
is evaluating the impact the adoption of this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements. 

In
November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. This ASU improves
reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant expenses, and is effective for fiscal
years beginning after December 31, 2023 and for interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024 on a retrospective
basis. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on the consolidated financial statements.

4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

(A)
EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

As
of September 30, 2024, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer conducted an evaluation regarding the effectiveness
of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based upon the evaluation
of these controls and procedures, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure
controls and procedures are ineffective to ensure that information disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange
Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and
forms. This determination was based on the small size of our accounting staff and the lack of segregation of duties. 

To
address the material weaknesses, we performed additional analysis and other post-closing procedures in an effort to ensure our financial
statements included in this report have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Accordingly, management
believes that the financial statements included in this report fairly present in all material respects our financial condition, results
of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. 

(B)
CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting in our fiscal quarter for the period September 30, 2024 covered by this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over
financial reporting. 

PART
II- OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM
1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

On
April 28, 2021, the Company was served with a commercial legal action against the Company and certain officers by David Weissberg and
Donna Marino, who are investors in the Company (collectively, the Investors ). The complaint was filed in the Supreme Court
of the State of New York, County of Nassau, Index No. 605191/2021. The complaint alleges four causes of action. 

The
first cause of action alleged that the Company breached Securities Purchase Agreements with the Investors by failing to assist the Investors
in getting opinion letters to remove the restrictive legends from their shares, even though the Company made introductions and requests
to the Company s counsel, provided supporting documents for the Investor s shares, and ultimately the opinion letters could
not be rendered because the Investors failed to submit required documentation to counsel. 

The
second cause of action was similar to the first but related to alleged misrepresentations regarding removing the restrictive legends from
shares that were issued for services rather than purchased. 

The
third cause of action alleged that the Company mislead the Investors to invest 500,000. The final cause of action alleges that officers
of the Company made misrepresentations regarding the value of the Company s stock, which caused David Weissberg to owe more in
taxes than he was expecting. 

The Investors claims against the Company were dismissed in June
2022. The court ruled that judgment should be entered only against the individual defendants and not against the Company. The Investors
have yet to enter judgment. 

In
November 24, 2021, a vendor of the Company filed an amended suit against the Company in Florida, Case No. 2021 CA 001797, for monies
allegedly owed and civil theft relating to such monies and related products and fraud in the inducement. We do not believe we owe such
vendor any amount. The court has entered a default judgement against the Company for our failure to timely answer the complaint, which
default has since been overturned. Subsequently the case has been set for interrogatories and document production which activities are
being fulfilled. 

On
or about August 11, 2022, a Complaint was filed by Evexia Plus, LLC against Can B Corp. in a product payment trade dispute. Case Number
63-CV-2022-900692.00 in the Circuit Court of Tuscaloosa County, AL. On 1-26-2023 the court ordered a Summary Judgement in the amount
of 336,924. The parties are trying to work out a payment schedule tied to production to satisfy the judgement. 

On
December 1, 2023,the Company, received a notice from Arena Special Opportunities Partners I, LP, Arena Special Opportunities Fund, LP
and Arena Investors, LP (collectively, the Arena Entities or Arena advising that by virtue of defaults in
the performance of the obligations of the Company and its subsidiaries to the Arena Entities, the Arena Entities intended to conduct
a public auction of certain assets of the Company and its subsidiaries under Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code. 

The
Arena Entities collectively hold approximately 3,838,770 aggregate principal amount of Convertible Notes (the Arena Notes issued by the Company. The Arena Entities previously notified the Company and its subsidiaries that they were in default of certain obligations
under the Forbearance Agreement dated February 27, 2023 among the Company, its subsidiaries and the Arena Entities pursuant to which
the Arena Entities agreed to forbear from exercising remedies under the Arena Notes until December 31, 2024 provided that no defaults
occurred under the Arena Notes or the Forbearance Agreement. The alleged defaults include a failure to deliver account control agreements,
failure to enter into a servicing agreement, failure to timely make certain payments and the unauthorized use and misuse of receivable
assigned to the Arena Entities. 

23 

On
February 27, 2024, the Supreme Court, County of New York (the Court ), denied a motion made by the Company seeking a temporary
restraining order and preliminary injunction to halt the proposed sale. As a result of the decision, the Arena Entities proceeded with
its proposed auction of the Company s hemp division assets and the auction took place on March 14, 2024. Approximately 300,000
of proceeds were generated by the sale. 

On
April 7, 2024, Arena filed a complaint in the Court against the Company, it subsidiaries and certain officers of the Company and its
subsidiaries alleging tortious interference with the auction and seeking a declaratory judgment that the Company is in breach of the
Arena Notes and the Forbearance Agreement and that Arena has the right to auction certain equipment held at a Company facility that
is not owned by the Company or any of its subsidiaries. Arena also alleges that that was induced by fraud to forbear from enforcing
its rights to collect the outstanding loans owed by the Company and filed a motion to enjoin the Company from interfering with the
auction. On October 25, 2024, the court held argument on Arena s motion and stated on the record that it was inclined to grant
Arena some form of preliminary injunctive relief. The court has not issued any such order. The Company believes that Arena s
claims are without merit and intends to vigorously defend Arena s claims. 

Other
than above, we are not aware of any pending or threatened legal proceedings in which we are involved. 

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS 

There
have been no material changes to the risk factors discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2023, which was filed with the SEC on April 15, 2024 except as described below. 

An
auction of the assets of our hemp division was conducted under Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code following allegations by certain
affiliated creditors that we were in breach of our obligations under certain notes and a forbearance agreement. See Item 1. Legal
Proceedings. 

In
June 2024 our Board of Directors concluded that as a result of the impact of the auction on the hemp division, it is no longer feasible
to continue our hemp operations. As a result, we will no longer pursue the development, manufacture or sale of hemp derived products. 

Historically,
revenues from our hemp division supported, in part, our durable medical equipment business conducted through Duramed. Due to the elimination
of support from the hemp division, Duramed is operating with reduced staff which has adversely impacted revenues. Going forward, our
primary focus will be on protecting and commercializing the cannabis patents recently acquired by Nascent; however, the discontinuance
of our hemp division and its impact on the Duramed division increases the risk that we will not be able to continue as a going concern. 

ITEM
2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 

In
August 2024, the Company issued 6,500,000 shares of common stock to consultants pursuant to the terms of consulting agreements. The
Company relied upon the exemption provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act in connection with these issuances. 

In
August 2024, the Company issued 1,750,000 shares of common stock upon the conversion of an outstanding note. The
Company relied upon the exemption provided by Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act of 1933 in connection with this issuance. 

ITEM
3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES 

In
September 2023, Arena Special Opportunities Partners I, LP and Arena Special Opportunities Fund, LP provided notice to the Company that
it is in default of certain terms of their Forbearance Agreement with the Company dated as of February 27, 2023 and thus have right to
accelerate the payment of the Company s obligations under the 3.8 million aggregate principal of notes held by them. In April
2024, the Arena entities filed a lawsuit seeking a declaratory judgment that the Company is in
breach of the Arena Notes and the Forbearance Agreement 

As
of September 30, 2024, notes payable in the aggregate principal amount of approximately 8.7 million were past due.

NOW
THEREFORE, in consideration of the promises contained herein and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy
of which is hereby acknowledged, Pledgor hereby agrees with Beneficiary as follow: 

1. 
 Pledge
 of Security . The Pledgor hereby grants and pledges to Beneficiary, for the benefit of
 Beneficiary as security for the prompt payment in full when due, whether at stated maturity
 or acceleration, of all amounts currently or hereafter owed by Pledgor to Beneficiary under
 the Note, a security interest and a lien upon all of Pledgor s right, title and interest
 in and to the following (the Pledged Collateral ): 

(a) 
 The
 Interest and any interests of Pledgor in the entries and on the books of any financial intermediary pertaining to the Interest, and
 all distributions, warrants, rights, instruments and other property or proceeds from time to time received, receivable or otherwise
 distributed in respect of or in exchange for all or a portion of the Interest; 

(b) 
 To
 the extent not covered by the security interest granted pursuant to section 1(a) above, all proceeds of any or all of the foregoing
 Pledged Collateral. For purposes of this Agreement, the term Proceeds includes whatever is receivable or received when
 Pledged Collateral or proceeds are sold, exchanged, collected or otherwise disposed of, whether such disposition is voluntary or
 involuntary. 

2. 
 Security
 For Obligations . This Agreement secures, and the Pledged Collateral is collateral security for, the prompt payment or performance
 in full when due, of the obligations of the Pledgor to the Beneficiary under the Note (the Obligations ). 

3. 
 Delivery
 of Pledged Collateral . All certificates or instruments representing or evidencing the Pledged Collateral (if any) shall be delivered
 to and held of Beneficiary by Beneficiary, and shall be in suitable form for transfer by delivery or, as applicable, shall be accompanied
 by the appropriate endorsement of Pledgor, where necessary, or duly executed instruments of transfer or assignment in blank, all
 in form and substance satisfactory to Beneficiary. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default (as defined in the Note), Beneficiary
 shall have the right, at any time in its discretion and without notice to Pledgor, to transfer to or to register in the name of Beneficiary
 any or all of the Pledged Collateral. In addition, Beneficiary shall have the right at any time to exchange certificates or instruments
 representing or evidencing the Pledged Collateral for certificates or instruments of smaller or larger denominations. 

4. 
 Release
 of Interest . Upon the termination of the Note and the payment to Beneficiary of all amounts due to Beneficiary thereunder, Beneficiary
 shall release the certificates representing the pledged Interest (if any) to the Pledgor. 

5. 
 Further
 Assurance: Pledge Amendments . 

(a) 
 Pledgor
 agrees that from time to time, at the expense of Pledgor, Pledgor will promptly execute and deliver all further instruments and documents,
 and take all further action that may be necessary or that Beneficiary may reasonably request, in order to perfect and protect any
 security interest granted or purported to be granted hereby or to enable Beneficiary to exercise and enforce his rights and remedies
 hereunder with respect to any Pledged Collateral. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Pledgor shall: 

(i) 
 execute
 and file such financing or continuation statements, or amendments thereto, and such other instruments or notices, as may be necessary,
 or as Beneficiary may reasonably request, in order to perfect and preserve the security interests granted or purported to be granted
 hereby; and 

(ii) 
 at
 Beneficiary s request, appear in and defend any action or proceeding that may affect Pledgor s title to or Beneficiary s
 security interest in all or any part of the Pledged Collateral. 

(b) 
 Pledgor
 further agrees that it shall, upon obtaining any additional units of membership interest or other securities or deliver to Beneficiary
 a Pledge Amendment, duly executed by Pledgor, in respect of the additional units or securities to be pledged pursuant to this Agreement.
 Pledgor hereby authorizes Beneficiary to attach each Pledge Amendment to this Agreement and agrees that all securities listed on
 any Pledge Amendment delivered to Beneficiary shall for all purposes hereunder be considered Pledged Collateral; provided that the
 failure of Pledgor to execute a Pledge Amendment with respect to any additional securities pledged pursuant to this Agreement shall
 not impair the security interest of Beneficiary therein or otherwise adversely affect the rights and remedies of Beneficiary hereunder
 with respect thereto. 

2 

6. 
 Voting
 Rights . 

(a) 
 So
 long as an Event of Default (as defined in the Note) does not exist and no notice has been provided pursuant to Section 6(b): 

(i) 
 Pledgor
 shall be entitled to exercise any voting and other consensual rights pertaining to the Pledged Collateral or any part thereof, if
 any, subject to the terms of Nascent Operating Agreement; and 

(ii) 
 Beneficiary
 shall promptly execute and deliver (or cause to be executed and delivered) to Pledgor all such proxies, dividend payment orders and
 other instruments as Pledgor may from time to time reasonably request for the purpose of enabling Pledgor to exercise the voting
 and other consensual rights which it is entitled to exercise pursuant to paragraph (i) above. 

(b) 
 Upon
 the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default, upon written notice from Beneficiary to Pledgor, all rights of
 Pledgor to exercise the voting and other consensual rights which it would otherwise be entitled to exercise pursuant to Section 6(a)(i)
 shall cease, and all such rights shall thereupon become vested in Beneficiary who shall thereupon have the sole and exclusive right
 to exercise such voting and other consensual rights relating to the Pledged Collateral. 

(c) 
 In
 order to permit Beneficiary to exercise the voting and other consensual rights which he may be entitled to exercise pursuant to Section
 6(b), Pledgor shall promptly execute and deliver (or causes to be executed and delivered) to Beneficiary all such proxies, dividend
 payment orders and other instruments as Beneficiary may from time to time reasonably request. 

7. 
 Secured
 Party Appointed Attorney-in-Fact . Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default, Pledgor hereby irrevocably
 appoints Beneficiary (and any agent of Beneficiary, with full power of substitution and revocation) as Pledgor s attorney-in-fact,
 with full authority in the place and stead of Pledgor and in the name of Pledgor, Beneficiary or otherwise, from time to time in
 Beneficiary s discretion, to take any action and to execute any instrument that Beneficiary may deem necessary or advisable
 to accomplish the purposes of this Agreement, including without limitation: 

(a) 
 to
 file one or more financing or continuation statements, or amendments thereto, relative to all or any part of the Pledged Collateral
 without the signature of Pledgor; 

(b) 
 to
 ask, demand, collect, sue for, recover, compound, receive and give acquittance and receipts for monies due and to become due under
 or in respect of any of the Pledged Collateral; 

(c) 
 to
 receive, endorse and collect any instruments made payable to Pledgor representing any dividend (other than cash dividends), principal
 or interest payment or other distribution in respect of the Pledged Collateral or any part thereof and to give full discharge for
 the same. 

3 

8. 
 Secured
 Party May Perform . If Pledgor fails to perform any covenant contained herein, Beneficiary may perform, or cause Beneficiary incurred
 in connection therewith shall be payable by Pledgor. 

9. 
 Remedies . 

(a) 
 If
 any Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, Beneficiary may at his option exercise in respect of the Pledged Collateral,
 in addition to all other rights and remedies provided for herein or otherwise available to him, all the rights and remedies of a
 secured party on default under the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect in any relevant jurisdiction (the Code (whether
 or not the Code applies to the affected Pledged Collateral), and Beneficiary may at his option declare all of the Obligations to
 be immediately due and payable in full and Beneficiary may also in his sole discretion, without notice except as specified below,
 sell or have sold the Pledged Collateral or any part thereof in one or more parcels at public or private sale, at any exchange or
 broker s board or elsewhere, for cash, on credit or for future delivery, at such time or times and at such price or prices
 and upon such other terms as may be commercially reasonable, irrespective of the impact of any such sales on the market price of
 the Pledged Collateral. Beneficiary may be the purchaser of any or all of the Pledged Collateral at any such sale and Beneficiary
 shall be entitled, for the purpose of bidding and making settlement or payment of the purchase price for all or any portion of the
 Pledged Collateral sold at any such public sale, to use and apply any of the Obligations as a credit on account of the purchase price
 for any Pledged Collateral payable by Beneficiary at such sale. Each purchaser at any such sale shall hold the property sold absolutely
 free from any claim or right on the part of Pledgor, and Pledgor hereby waives (to the extent permitted by applicable law) all rights
 of redemption, stay and/or appraisal which it now has or may at any time in the future have under any rule of law or statute now
 existing or hereafter enacted. Pledgor agrees that to the extent notices of sale shall be required by law, at least five (5) days
 notice to Pledgor of the time and place of any public sale or the time after which any private sale is to be made shall constitute
 reasonable notification. Beneficiary shall not be obligated to make any sale of Pledged Collateral regardless of notice of sale having
 been given. Beneficiary may adjourn any public or private sale from time to time by announcement at the time and place fixed therefor,
 and such sale may, without further notice, be made at the time and place to which it was so adjourned. If the proceeds of any sale
 or other disposition of the Pledged Collateral are insufficient to pay all the Obligations, Pledgor shall be liable for the deficiency
 and the fees of any attorneys employed by Beneficiary to collect such deficiency. 

4 

(b) 
 Pledgor
 recognizes that, by reason of certain prohibitions contained in the Securities Act of 1933, as from time to time amended (the Securities
 Act ), and applicable state securities laws, Beneficiary may be compelled, with respect to any sale of all or any part of the
 Pledged Collateral conducted without prior registration or qualification of such Pledged Collateral under the Securities Act and/or
 such state securities laws, to limit purchasers to those who will agree, among other things, to acquire the Pledged Collateral for
 their own account, for investment and not with a view to the distribution or resale thereof. Pledgor acknowledges that any such private
 sale may be at prices and on terms less favorable than those obtainable through a public sale without such restrictions (including,
 without limitation, a public offering made pursuant to a registration statement under the Securities Act) and, notwithstanding such
 circumstances, Pledgor agrees that any such private sale shall be deemed to have been made in a commercially reasonable manner and
 that Beneficiary shall have no obligation to engage in public sales and no obligation to delay the sale of any Pledged Collateral
 for the period of time necessary to permit the issuer thereof to register it for a form of public sale requiring registration under
 the Securities Act or under applicable state securities laws, even if such issuer would, or should, agree to so register it. 

(c) 
 Notwithstanding
 the foregoing, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the remedies provided for herein are not exclusive of any other remedies
 available to Beneficiary upon the occurrence of an Event of Default. Beneficiary expressly reserves any and all other remedies available
 to him under the Purchase Agreement. 

(d) 
 Pledgor
 agrees that in lieu of any other remedy available to Beneficiary hereunder or at law or equity, so long as an Event of Default has
 occurred and is continuing, Beneficiary may in its sole discretion elect to transfer the Interest to his own name, or the name of
 his nominee, release Pledgor from the remaining Obligations and release all Pledged Collateral from the lien of this Agreement. Upon
 such transfer and releases, legal and beneficial ownership in the Interest shall automatically vest in Beneficiary, free and clear
 of any claim, including any right or equity of redemption of Pledgor. Pledgor agrees that Beneficiary shall have the absolute right
 to retain the Interest, as consideration of the releases granted by Beneficiary under this Section 9(d) and as liquidated damages,
 and not as a penalty, for Pledgor s breach. 

10. 
 Application
 of Proceeds . Except as expressly provided elsewhere in this Agreement, all proceeds received by Beneficiary in respect of any
 sale of, collection from, or other realization upon all or any part of the Pledged Collateral may, in the discretion of Beneficiary,
 be held by Beneficiary as Pledged Collateral for, and/or then, or at any time thereafter, applied in full or in part by Beneficiary
 against the Obligations in the following order of priority: 

FIRST:
 To the payment of all costs and expenses of such sale, collection or other realization, and all other expenses, liabilities and advances
 made or incurred by Beneficiary in connection therewith, and all advances made by Beneficiary hereunder for the account of Pledgor,
 and to the payment of all costs and expenses paid or incurred by Beneficiary in connection with the exercise of any right or remedy
 hereunder, all in accordance with Section 11 hereof; 

5 

SECOND:
 To the payment of all other Obligations in such order as Beneficiary shall elect; and

 jurisdiction may direct, of any surplus then remaining from such proceeds. 

11. 
 Expenses .
 Pledgor shall pay to Beneficiary upon demand the amount of any and all costs and expenses, including the reasonable fees and expenses
 of their counsel and of any experts and agents, that Beneficiary may incur in connection with 

(i) 
 the
 sale of, collection from, or other realization upon, any of the Pledged Collateral; 

(ii) 
 the
 exercise or enforcement of any of the rights of Beneficiary hereunder; or 

(iii) 
 The
 failure by a Pledgor to perform or observe any of the provisions hereof. 

12. 
 Continuing
 Security Interest . This Agreement shall create a continuing security interest in the Pledged Collateral and shall: 

(a) 
 Remain
 in full force and effect until the payment in full of all Obligations; and/or; 

(b) 
 be
 binding upon Pledgor, its respective heirs, administrators or other personal representatives; and 

(c) 
 inure,
 together with the rights and remedies of Beneficiary hereunder, to the benefit of Beneficiary and his successors, heirs, transferees,
 personal representatives and assigns. 

13. 
 Amendments;
 Etc. No amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement, or consent to any departure by Pledgor herefrom, shall in any
 event be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by Beneficiary, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective
 only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which it was given. 

6 

14.

 or privilege hereunder shall impair such power, right or privilege or be construed to be a waiver of any default or acquiescence
 therein, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such power, right or privilege preclude any other or further exercise thereof
 or of any power, right or privilege. All rights and remedies existing under this Agreement are cumulative to, and not exclusive of,
 any rights or remedies otherwise available. 

16. 
 Severability .
 In case any provision in or obligation under this Agreement shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, the validity,
 legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions or obligations, or of such provision or obligation in any other jurisdiction,
 shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.
