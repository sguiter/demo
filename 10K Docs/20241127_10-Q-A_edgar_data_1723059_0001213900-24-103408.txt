respectively. The Company also had an accumulated deficit of from the company s continuing operations as of March
31, 2024. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company plans
to increase its income by strengthening its sales force, providing attractive sales incentive program, and increasing marketing and promotion
activities. Management also intends to raise additional funds by way of a private or public offering, or by obtaining loans from banks
or others. While the Company believes in the viability of its strategy to generate sufficient revenue and in its ability to raise additional
funds on reasonable terms and conditions, there can be no assurances to that effect. The ability of the Company to continue as a going
concern is dependent upon the Company s ability to further implement its business plan and generate sufficient revenue and its
ability to raise additional funds by way of a public or private offering. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that
might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

At March 31, 2024 and December
31, 2023, the Company had net operating loss NOL for income tax purposes; for federal income tax purposes, the
NOL arising in tax years beginning after 2017 may only reduce of a taxpayer s taxable income, and may be carried forward
indefinitely; for California income tax purposes, the entire NOL can be carried forward up to 20 years. However, the coronavirus
Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act the CARES Act issued in March 2020, provides tax relief to both corporate and noncorporate
taxpayers by adding a five-year carryback period and temporarily repealing the limitation for NOLs arising in 2019, 2020 and
2021. 

The Company has NOL carry-forwards
for Federal and California income tax purposes of million and million at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023,
respectively. No tax benefit was reported with respect to these NOL carry-forwards in the accompanying consolidated financial statements
because the Company believes the realization of the Company s net deferred tax assets for the NOL for both federal and California
State of approximately million as of March 31, 2024, was not considered more likely than not and accordingly, the potential
tax benefits of the net loss carry-forwards are fully offset by a full valuation allowance.

Management s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Business Overview 

Bio Essence Corporation the Company or Bio Essence was incorporated in 2000 in the state of California. Fusion Diet Systems FDS was incorporated in 2010 in the state of Utah. Bio Essence and FDS have been owned under common control since 2016. Bio Essence and FDS
are mainly engaged in manufacturing and distributing health supplement products. In January 2017, Bio Essence incorporated two subsidiaries
in the state of California: BEP and BEH, Bio Essence transferred its manufacturing operation into BEP, and transferred its distributing
operation into BEH. On March 1, 2017, the 100 shareholder of FDS transferred all her ownership in FDS into Bio Essence. On December
7, 2021, the Company dissolved FDS. On November 12, 2021, Bio Essence incorporated a wholly owned subsidiary McBE Pharma Inc. McBE in the state of California, McBE will be engaged in research and development and manufacture of prescription medicine. As a result of
the ownership restructure, BEP, BEH, and MCBE became wholly owned subsidiaries of Bio Essence, and Bio Essence serves as a holding corporation
for these subsidiaries. McBE has not engaged in any operations since its inception. On December 12, 2023, the Company entered into
an agreement with Newway Inc to sell the 100 equity ownership of BEP for 300,000. On March 28, 2024, the Company entered into an agreement
with Health Up Inc to sell the 100 equity ownership of BEH for 400,000. On April 15, 2024, the Company dissolved McBE. 

The primary focus of BEP
is producing products for BEH, along with providing OEM services to other companies. BEH targets healthcare practitioners with herbal
products in the form of granules, capsules, pills and tablets. It also offers special formulation service to practitioners. The Company
intends to develop the subsidiary into an integrated healthcare platform that provides customers direct connections with integrative
healthcare practitioners such as dietitians, nutraceutical practitioners, and other practitioners in this discipline worldwide. 

However, the pandemic could
result in significant disruption of global financial markets, reducing the Company s ability to access capital, which could negatively
affect the Company s liquidity.

Critical Accounting
Policies and Estimates 

Our management s
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements CFS ),
which were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America US GAAP ).
The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported
net sales and expenses during the reporting periods. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. We base our estimates
on historical experience and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form
the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual
results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 

While our significant accounting
policies are more fully described in Note 2 to our CFS, we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to assist
you in fully understanding and evaluating this management discussion and analysis. 

Basis of Presentation 

The accompanying consolidated
financial statements CFS are prepared in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles US GAAP and
applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC regarding interim financial reporting.
The functional currency of Bio Essence is U.S. dollars ). The accompanying financial statements are presented
in U.S. dollars ). The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries,
BEP, BEH and McBE (up to disposal date). All significant inter-company transactions and balances were eliminated in consolidation.

Going Concern 

The Company incurred net
losses of 122,986 and 23,064 from the company s continuing operations for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and
2023, respectively. The Company also had an accumulated deficit of 9,006,535 from the company s continuing operations as
of March 31, 2024. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company
plans to increase its income by strengthening its sales force, providing attractive sales incentive programs, and increasing marketing
and promotion activities. Management also intends to raise additional funds by way of a private or public offering, or by obtaining loans
from banks or others. While the Company believes in the viability of its strategy to generate sufficient revenue and in its ability to
raise additional funds on reasonable terms and conditions, there can be no assurances to that effect. The ability of the Company to continue
as a going concern is dependent upon the Company s ability to further implement its business plan and generate sufficient revenue
and its ability to raise additional funds by way of a public or private offering. The financial statements do not include any adjustments
that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Use of Estimates 

In preparing financial
statements in conformity with US GAAP, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the reporting period. 

Significant estimates,
required by management, include the recoverability of long-lived assets, allowance for doubtful accounts, and the reserve for obsolete
and slow-moving inventories. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Accounts Receivable 

The Company s policy
is to maintain an allowance for potential credit losses on accounts receivable. Management reviews the composition of accounts receivable
and analyzes historical bad debts, customer concentrations, customer credit worthiness, current economic trends and changes in customer
payment patterns to evaluate the adequacy of these reserves. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the bad debt allowance was nil
and nil, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, the bad debt allowance from discontinued operations (BEH) was 2,252, respectively. 

Revenue Recognition 

The Company recognizes
revenues following the five-step model prescribed under ASC 606: (i) identify contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance
obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations
in the contract; and (v) recognize revenues when (or as) we satisfy the performance obligation. 

Revenue is measured at
the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for the sale of our product, which occurs at a point in time, typically
upon delivery to the customer. The Company expenses incremental costs of obtaining a contract as and when incurred if the expected amortization
period of the asset that it would have recognized is one year or less or the amount is immaterial. 

Revenues from sales of
goods are measured at net of reserves established for applicable discounts and allowances that are offered within contracts with the
Company s customers, and are recognized when the goods are delivered to the customers. 

Product revenue reserves,
which are classified as a reduction in product revenues, are generally characterized in the following categories: discounts, returns
and rebates. These reserves are based on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales and are classified as
reductions of accounts receivable as the amount is payable to the Company s customers. 

Revenues from manufacture
services are recognized when the manufacture process is completed pursuant to the customers requirement and the finished goods
were delivered to the customers. 

The Company s return
policy allows for the return of damaged or defective products and shipment errors. A notice of damage or wrong items should make within
five days from receiving the goods, and actual return of the products must be completed within 30 days from the date of receiving the
goods. Delayed notification for damaged or wrong products will not be accepted for return or exchange. Custom formulas and capsules are
not returnable. The amount for return of products was immaterial for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023.

Net cash used in
operating activities for continuing operations 

Net cash used in operating
activities for continuing operations was 34,836 for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to 34,945 in 2023.
The decrease of cash outflow of 109 from operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was principally attributable
to increased operating cash inflow before working capital changes by 32,311, decreased cash outflow on accounts payable by 13,098,
decreased cash outflow on accrued liabilities and other payables by 199,095 which was partly offset by increased cash outflow on other
receivable by 197,295, and increased cash outflow on payment of lease liabilities by 47,100. 

Net cash provided by
financing activities for continuing operations 

Net cash provided by financing
activities for continuing operations was 180,959 for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared to 216,083 in 2023. The net cash
provided by financing activities for three months ended March 31, 2024 mainly consisted of proceeds of 190,700 loan from one major shareholder
(also the senior officer), partly offset by bank overdraft of 9,436, and repayment of government loan of 305. The net cash provided
by financing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2023 consisted of proceeds of 215,611 from loan from one major shareholder
(also the senior officer) and increase in bank overdraft of 765, partly offset by repayment of government loans of 293. 

22 

Our current liabilities
exceed current assets at March 31, 2024, and we incurred substantial losses and cash outflows from operating activities in the periods
presented. We may have difficulty meeting upcoming cash requirements. As of March 31, 2024, our principal source of funds was loans from
an officer (also is the Company s major shareholder). As of March 31, 2024, we believe we will need 1.2 million cash to continue
our current business for the next 12 months. In addition to our continuous effort to improve our sales and net profits, we have explored
and continue to explore other options to provide additional financing to fund future operations as well as other possible courses of
action. Such actions may include, but are not limited to, securing lines of credit, sales of debt or equity securities (which may result
in dilution to existing shareholders), loans and cash advances from other third parties or banks, and other similar actions. There can
be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional funding (if needed), on acceptable terms or at all, through a sale of our common
stock, loans from financial institutions, or other third parties, or any of the actions discussed above. If we cannot sustain profitable
operations, and additional capital is unavailable, lack of liquidity could have a material adverse effect on our business viability,
financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 

Contractual Obligations 

Long-Term Debts 

Government loans 

In May and June 2020, BEH,
BEP and FDS received total of 215,600 from the Economic Injury Disaster Loan EIDL loan from the SBA after deducting
 100 Uniform Commercial Code UCC handling charge and filing fee for each company. This is a low-interest federal
disaster loan for working capital to small businesses and non-profit organizations of any size suffering substantial economic injury
as a result of the Coronavirus (COVID-19), to help the businesses to meet financial obligations and operating expenses that could have
been met had the disaster not occurred. This loan has interest of 3.75 and is not forgivable. The maturity of the loan is 30 years,
installment payments including principal and interest of 515 monthly will begin 12 months from the date of the promissory note. On
March 4, 2022, The FDS transferred its EIDL loan to BEC due to the dissolution of FDS. The SBA extended the deferment period to allow
small businesses and not-for-profits that received EIDL funds do not have to begin payments on the loan until 30 months after the date
of the note. Accordingly, the company began to make installment payments in the fourth quarter 2022. 

As of March 31, 2024, the future minimum
EIDL loan payments from the company s continuing operations to be paid by year are as follows:

We have not entered into
any financial guarantees or other commitments to guarantee the obligations of any third parties. We have not entered into any derivative
contracts that are indexed to our shares and classified as shareholder s equity or that are not reflected in our consolidated financial
statements. Furthermore, we do not have any retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity that serves
as credit, liquidity or market risk support to such entity. We do not have any variable interest in any unconsolidated entity that provides
financing, liquidity, market risk or credit support to us or engages in leasing, hedging or research and development services with us. 

Item 3. Quantitative and
Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 

As a smaller reporting company, as defined in 17
CFR 229.10(f)(1), we are not required to provide the information requested by this Item. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 

The Company s Chief Executive, Yin Yan, is
responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures for the Company. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

For purposes of this Item 4, the term disclosure
controls and procedures means controls and other procedures of the Company (i) that are designed to ensure that information required
to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (15 U.S.C.
78a et seq. and hereinafter the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within
the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and (ii) include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed
to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or
persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

23 

On March 31, 2024, Ms. Yan and Mr. Sluss reviewed the effectiveness
of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period
covered by this report and concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are not effective to ensure that material
information relating to the Company is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and
forms of the SEC. Ms. Yan and Mr. Sluss are working to develop and implement controls and procedures. 

Report of Management 

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate
internal control over financial reporting ICFR ), as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15. Our ICFR is designed to provide
reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial
statements. Management conducted an assessment of our ICFR based on the framework and criteria established by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). Based on the assessment,
management concluded that, as of March 31, 2024, our ICFR were not effective at the reasonable assurance level based on those criteria.
Management will continue to work to develop ICFR and controls over our reporting procedures. 

Our independent public accountant has not conducted
an audit of our controls and procedures regarding ICFR and therefore expresses no opinion with regards to the effectiveness or implementation
of our controls and procedures with regards to ICFR. 

Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting 

There were no changes in our ICFR identified in
connection with our evaluation of these controls as of the end of the quarter ending on March 31, 2024, as covered by this report that
has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our ICFR. 

Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 

The Company s management does not expect that
its disclosure controls or its ICFR will prevent or detect all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and
operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system s objectives will be met. The design of
a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative
to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance
that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company
have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns
can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion
of two or more people, or management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions
about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under
all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over
time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting
during the quarter ending on March 31, 2024 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting.

and have: 

a. Designed
such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under my supervision, to ensure
that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those
entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared; 

b. Designed
such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision,
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external

in this report any change in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant s most
recent fiscal quarter (the registrant's fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably
likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal control over financial reporting. 

5. I have disclosed, based on my most recent evaluation
of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant's auditors and the registrant's board of directors (or persons performing
the equivalent functions): 

a. All significant deficiencies
and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely
affect the registrant's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information in the registrant s amended quarterly
report on Form 10-Q/A; and 

b. Any fraud, whether or not material,
that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting.
