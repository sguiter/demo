 Assets Held-for-Sale 
 We consider assets to be held for sale when management, with appropriate authority, approves and commits to a formal plan to actively market the assets for sale at a price reasonable in relation to their estimated fair value, the assets are available for immediate sale in their present condition, an active program to locate a buyer has been initiated, the sale of the assets is probable and expected to be completed within one year, and it is unlikely that significant changes will be made to the plan. Upon designation as held for sale, we record the assets at the lower of their carrying value or their estimated fair value, reduced for the cost to dispose the assets. 
 
 During the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we committed to a plan to sell property in our Europe segment consisting of a warehouse building and land with a total net carrying value of million. There were impairment charges recognized on these asset groups as the estimated fair value exceeded their respective carrying values. The building, land and other property and equipment were classified as assets held for sale in other noncurrent assets on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of May 4, 2024.

 OVERVIEW 
 GameStop Corp. GameStop, we, us, our, or the Company ), a Delaware corporation established in 1996, is a leading specialty retailer offering games and entertainment products through its thousands of stores and ecommerce platforms. 
 We operate our business in four geographic segments: United States, Canada, Australia and Europe. Our fiscal year is composed of the 52 or 53 weeks ending on the Saturday closest to the last day of January. Fiscal 2024 consists of 52 weeks ending February 1, 2025 ("fiscal 2024"). Fiscal 2023 consisted of 53 weeks ended on February 3, 2024. All three-month periods presented herein contain 13 weeks. All references to years, quarters and months relate to fiscal periods rather than calendar periods. The discussion and analysis of our results of operations refers to continuing operations unless otherwise noted. Our business, like that of many retailers, is seasonal, with the major portion of the net sales realized during the fourth quarter, which includes the holiday selling season. 
 
 BUSINESS PRIORITIES 
 GameStop is following a strategic plan to fully leverage its unique position and brand recognition in gaming through a new phase of transformation. Our strategic plan is designed to optimize our core business and achieve profitability. 
 GameStop is actively focused on the below objectives: 
 Establish Omnichannel Retail Excellence. We aim to be the leading destination for games and entertainment products through our stores and ecommerce platforms. To accomplish this, we are taking steps to ensure we are a fast and convenient solution for our customers. This includes increased product availability across all channels, faster fulfillment through ship from store offerings, and a further improved customer service experience. 
 Achieve Profitability. During fiscal 2023, we continued to optimize our cost structure to align with our current and anticipated future needs. We will continue to focus on cost containment as we look to operate with increased efficiency. 
 Leverage Brand Equity to Support Growth. GameStop has many strengths and assets, including strong household brand recognition and a significant store network. 
 We believe these efforts are important aspects of our continued business to enable long-term value creation for our shareholders. 
 As part of our efforts to achieve sustained profitability, we continue to evaluate our portfolio of assets to validate their strategic and financial fit and to eliminate redundancies. During fiscal 2023, we exited our operations in Ireland, Switzerland, and Austria. While we expect our cost containment efforts to yield reductions in selling, general and administrative ("SG A") expenses in the long term, we have incurred and may continue to incur non-recurring costs related to these efforts in the short term. 
 Investments 
 
 On December 5, 2023, the Board of Directors approved a new investment policy (the Investment Policy ). Subsequently, on March 21, 2024, the Board of Directors unanimously authorized revisions to the Investment Policy to codify the role of certain members of the Board of Directors in overseeing the Company s investments. In accordance with the revised Investment Policy, the Board of Directors has delegated authority to manage the Company s portfolio of securities investments to an Investment Committee consisting of the Company s Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer, Ryan Cohen, and two independent members of the Board of Directors, together with such personnel and advisors as the Investment Committee may choose. The Company s investments must conform to guidelines set forth in the revised Investment Policy or be approved by

Table of Contents 

 either the Investment Committee, by unanimous vote, or the full Board of Directors, by majority vote. Additionally, the Investment Committee may recommend to the Board of Directors further modifications to the Investment Policy from time to time. 
 
 The Investment Committee will direct the investment activity of the Company in public and private markets pursuant to authority granted by the Board of Directors. Depending on certain market conditions and various risk factors, Mr. Cohen or other members of the Investment Committee, each in their personal capacity or through affiliated investment vehicles, may at times invest in the same securities in which the Company invests. The Board anticipates that such investments will align the interests of the Company with the interests of related parties because it places the personal resources of such directors at risk in substantially the same manner as resources of the Company in connection with investment decisions made by the Investment Committee on behalf of the Company.

 Net sales decreased 355.3 million or 28.7 , for the three months ended May 4, 2024 compared to the prior year. 
 During the three months ended May 4, 2024, net sales in our Europe, Canada, Australia, and United States segments decreased by 37.2 , 32.1 , 31.0 , and 25.8 , respectively, compared to the prior year. The decrease in consolidated net sales for the three months ended May 4, 2024 compared to the prior year was primarily attributable to a 98.6 million, or 29.1 , decline in the sale of new software, a 220.5 million, or 30.4 , decline in the sale of hardware and accessories, and a 36.2 million, or 20.9 , decline in the sale of collectibles.

 Gross Profit 
 During the three months ended May 4, 2024, gross profit decreased 42.8 million, or 14.9 , compared to the prior year. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to 27.7 , compared to 23.2 in the prior year. The decrease in gross profit is primarily attributable to the decrease in net sales, as further outlined in the net sales commentary, partially offset by 10.8 million, or 38 , decrease in freight expenses from added cost optimizations. 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
 During the three months ended May 4, 2024, SG A expenses decreased 50.6 million, or 14.6 , compared to the prior year. SG A expenses as a percentage of sales increased to 33.5 in the current year compared to 27.9 in the prior year. 
 The decrease in SG A expenses for the three months ended May 4, 2024 compared to the prior year is primarily attributable to a reduction in labor-related, consulting service, and marketing costs of 49.7 million, driven by our continued focus on cost reduction efforts, partially offset by 14.3 million of deferred income recognized in the prior year in connection with our NFT marketplace. Store related costs decreased 6.1 million in the current year in connection with prior year store closures, primarily in our European segment. 
 Interest Income, net 
 During the three months ended May 4, 2024, we recognized net interest income of 14.9 million, compared to net interest income of 9.7 million in the prior year. The impact is primarily attributable to interest income increasing as a result of higher returns on invested cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. 
 Income Tax 
 We recognized income tax benefit of 3.4 million for the three months ended May 4, 2024 compared to an income tax benefit of 0.1 million for the same period in 2023. Our effective income tax rate was 9.5 for the three months ended May 4, 2024 compared to 0.2 for the same period in 2023. 
 Our effective income tax rate for the three months ended May 4, 2024 as well as the three months ended April 29, 2023 are primarily due to the recognition of tax benefits on certain current period losses, partially offset by forecasted income taxes due in certain foreign and state jurisdictions in which we operate. 
 See Part I, Item 1 "Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements", Note 9 , "Income Taxes," for additional information. 
 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities 
 May 4, 2024 April 29, 2023 February 3, 2024 Cash and cash equivalents 999.9 1,057.0 921.7 Marketable securities 83.0 253.1 277.6 Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities 1,082.9 1,310.1 1,199.3 
 Sources of Liquidity; Uses of Capital 
 Our principal sources of liquidity are cash from operations, cash on hand, and borrowings from the capital markets, which include our revolving credit facilities. As of May 4, 2024, we had total unrestricted cash and cash equivalents on hand of 999.9 million, marketable securities of 83.0 million, and an additional 244.1 million of effective available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities. 
 Our cash and cash equivalents are carried at fair value and consist primarily of U.S. government bonds and notes, money market funds, cash deposits with commercial banks, and highly rated direct short-term instruments that mature in 90 days or less. 
 Our marketable securities are also carried at fair value and include investments in certain highly-rated short-term government notes, government bills, and time deposits. Our marketable securities have a maturity date of greater than 90 days but less than one year. 
 We opened investment portfolios consisting of U.S. government treasury notes and bills. Additionally, we also invested in time deposits. As of May 4, 2024, the investment portfolios' aggregate balance was 83.0 million, all of which are recognized in marketable securities. See Item 1, Part I, "Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements", Note 4, "Fair Value Measurements," for additional information.

 On an ongoing basis, we evaluate and consider certain strategic operating alternatives, including divestitures, restructuring or dissolution of unprofitable business segments, uses for our excess cash, as well as equity and debt financing alternatives that we believe may enhance stockholder value. The nature, amount and timing of any strategic operational change, or financing transactions that we might pursue will depend on a variety of factors, including, as of the applicable time, our available cash and liquidity and operating performance; our commitments and obligations; our capital requirements; limitations imposed under our credit arrangements; and overall market conditions. 
 On December 5, 2023, the Board of Directors approved a new Investment Policy. Subsequently, on March 21, 2024, the 
 Board of Directors amended the new Investment Policy. See "Part I, Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Investments for more information. Gains and losses on marketable securities may fluctuate significantly from period to period in the future and could have a significant impact on the Company s results of operations. However, the amount of gain or loss on marketable securities for any given period may have no predictive value and variations in amount from period to period may have no analytical value. 
 Some of our vendors have requested and may continue to request credit support collateral for our inventory purchase obligations and the levels of such collateral will depend on a variety of factors including our inventory purchase levels, available payment terms for inventories, availability of borrowing capacity under our credit facilities, favorable credit terms and costs of providing collateral. 
 In fiscal 2021, the six separate unsecured term loans held by our French subsidiary, Micromania SAS, for a total of 40.0 million were extended for five years. As of May 4, 2024, 25.7 million remains outstanding. 
 In November 2021, we entered into a credit agreement for a secured asset-based credit facility comprised of a 500 million revolving line of credit which matures in November 2026 ("2026 Revolver"). The 2026 Revolver includes a 50 million swing loan revolving sub-facility, a 50 million Canadian revolving sub-facility, and a 250 million letter of credit sublimit. On March 
 22, 2024, we delivered an irrevocable notice pursuant to the 2026 Revolver that reduces the 500 million revolving line of credit 
 to 250 million. The 2026 Revolver will continue to include a 50 million swing loan sub-facility, a 50 million Canadian 
 sub-facility and a 250 million letter of credit sublimit. 
 As of the end of the first quarter of 2024, based on our borrowing base and amounts reserved for outstanding letters of credit, total effective availability under the 2026 Revolver was 244.1 million, with no outstanding borrowings and outstanding standby letters of credit of 5.9 million. 
 Separate from the 2026 Revolver, we maintain uncommitted facilities with certain lenders that provide for the issuance of letters of credit and bank guarantees, at times supported by cash collateral. As of May 4, 2024, we had bank guarantees outstanding in the amount of 9.5 million outside of the 2026 Revolver. 
 On May 17, 2024, we entered into an Open Market Sale Agreement SM (the Sales Agreement with Jefferies LLC (the Sales 
 Agent providing for the sale by the Company of shares of our Class A common stock, par value 0.001 per share Common 
 Shares ), from time to time, through the Sales Agent in connection with an at-the-market offering program (the ATM 
 Offering ). Pursuant to the prospectus supplement relating to the ATM Offering filed with the SEC on May 17, 2024 (the May Prospectus Supplement ), we sold an aggregate of 45.0 million Common Shares for aggregate gross proceeds before commissions and offering expenses of approximately 933.4 million. 
 
 Pursuant to the prospectus supplement relating to the ATM Offering filed with the SEC on June 7, 2024, (the June Prospectus Supplement ), we sold an aggregate of 75.0 million additional Common Shares for aggregate gross proceeds before commissions and offering expenses of approximately 2.137 billion. 
 
 We intend to use the net proceeds from the ATM Offering for general corporate purposes, which may include acquisitions and investments in a manner consistent with the Investment Policy.

 Operating Activities 
 During the three months ended May 4, 2024, cash flows from operating activities were an outflow of 109.8 million, compared with an outflow of 102.7 million during the same period last year. Cash used in operating activities during the three months ended May 4, 2024 was primarily due to the impact of our net loss, an increase in merchandise inventory, and a decrease in trade payables, partially offset by a reduction in accounts receivable. Cash used in operating activities during the three months ended April 29, 2023 was primarily due to the impact of our net loss and an increase in merchandise inventory, partially offset by an increase in trade payables and a reduction in accounts receivable. 
 Investing Activities 
 Cash flows from investing activities were an inflow of 189.8 million during the three months ended May 4, 2024 compared to an outflow of 6.7 million during the same period last year. Cash provided by investing activities during the three months ended May 4, 2024 was primarily attributable to the maturity of marketable securities.

 Financing Activities 
 Cash flows from financing activities were an outflow of 2.7 million during the three months ended May 4, 2024 compared to an outflow of 2.8 million during the comparable prior year period.

 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 Our condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP for interim financial information and exclude certain disclosures required under GAAP for complete consolidated financial statements. Preparation of these statements requires us to make judgments and estimates. Some accounting policies have a significant impact on amounts reported in these condensed consolidated financial statements. For a summary of significant accounting policies and the means by which we develop estimates thereon, see Part II Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

 RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 
 In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, "Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures." This standard requires disclosure of significant segment expenses and other segment items by reportable segment. This ASU becomes effective for annual periods beginning in 2024 and interim periods in 2025. The Company is assessing the impact of this ASU and upon adoption expects that any impact would be limited to additional segment expense disclosures in the footnotes to its consolidated financial statements. 
 
 In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, "Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures." This standard enhances disclosures related to income taxes, including the rate reconciliation and information on income taxes paid. This ASU becomes effective January 1, 2025. The Company is assessing the impact of this ASU and upon adoption expects to include certain additional disclosures in the footnotes to its consolidated financial statements.

625 Westport Parkway Grapevine, TX 76051 817-424-2000 April 11, 2024 Mr. Daniel Moore Re: Compensation Change Dear Daniel, In conjunction with your recent promotion to Principal Financial and Accounting Officer at GameStop Corp (the Company ), you are receiving a compensation increase. You will continue to be subject to all policies of the Company and GameStop Texas, Ltd. in effect from time to time, including the Company s Anti-hedging Policy, Clawback Policy, Insider Trading Policy, and Code of Ethics. Your new base salary will be 200,000 effective April 4, 2024. A total of 400,000 in transformation bonuses were also paid bi-weekly over the two-year period which began on July 1, 2021. These bonuses have been paid in full. You will continue to be eligible to earn restricted shares and stock units in accordance with, and subject to, the vesting and other terms of any award agreements that have been issued to you on or prior to the date hereof. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this letter shall change, eliminate or modify any terms of those award agreements, certain terms of which are summarized below. On October 1, 2021, you were granted 15,960 restricted stock units of the Company s Common Stock. The October 2021 equity award will vest as follows: 5 on the first anniversary of the grant date, 15 of the second anniversary of the grant date, and 20 on each of the dates that are 30, 36, 42 and 48 months following the grant date, subject in each case to your continuous service through the applicable vesting date. On October 1, 2022, you were granted 1,407 restricted shares of the Company s Class A common stock Common Stock ). The October 2022 equity award will vest as follows: 16.66 on each of the months that are 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36 following the grant date, subject to your continuous service through the applicable vesting date. On June 1, 2023, you were granted 3,312 restricted shares of the Company s Class A common stock Common Stock ). The June 2023 equity award will vest as follows: 50 on July 1, 2023, and 50 on January 1, 2024, subject to your continuous service through the applicable vesting date. On November 1, 2023, you were granted 6,641 restricted shares of the Company s Class A common stock Common Stock ). The November 2023 equity award will vest as follows: 25 on January 1, 2024, 25 on April 1, 2024, 25 on July 1, 2024, and 25 on October 1, 2024, subject to your continuous service through the applicable vesting date. In addition to the above and in connection with your recent promotion, on July 1, 2024, you will be granted restricted stock units of the Company s Common Stock determined by dividing 540,000 by the average closing price of the Company s Common Stock for the 30 trading days immediately preceding such grant date (the July 2024 Equity Award ). The July 2024 equity award will vest in twelve equal quarterly installments beginning on October 1, 2024. Finally, in order for you to maintain your new target total compensation near-term prior to the vesting of the new July 2024 Equity Award, you will also receive a cash bonus in the amount of 28,877, less applicable withholding 

taxes, which will be paid in equal bi-weekly installments over the next six pay periods, beginning with the first pay period ending after the date of this letter. Nothing in this letter guarantees your employment for any period or otherwise limits our ability to terminate your employment at any time, for any reason, even if your opportunity to receive or vest in any equity would be forfeited as a result of such termination. We will periodically review your performance and compensation levels and may make adjustments, all as determined in the sole discretion of the Company. Any modification of any of the terms of this letter must be made in writing and signed by an authorized, executive officer of the Company to be valid and enforceable. This letter supersedes any prior compensation terms or offer letter entered into between you and the Company. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, this letter and the terms and conditions of the applicable award agreements referenced above represents our entire agreement regarding your employment and compensation and supersedes all prior discussions and agreements regarding these topics; provided, however, this agreement is in addition to and complements (and does not replace or supersede): i) your agreement to the GameStop C.A.R.E.S Rules of Dispute Resolution; and ii) all obligations you have to the Company or any of its affiliates with respect to confidentiality and return of property, non-disparagement, non-competition, and non-solicitation (whether such obligation arises by contract, common law, statute, or otherwise). If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact me. Sincerely, Ryan Cohen Chief Executive Officer Accepted By: Daniel Moore June 11, 2024 Daniel Moore Date Page 2 of 2

 Exhibit 99.1 

GameStop Discloses First Quarter 2024 Results 
 GRAPEVINE, Texas, June 7, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) GameStop Corp. (NYSE GME) GameStop or the Company today released financial results for the first quarter ended May 4, 2024. The Company s condensed and consolidated financial statements, including GAAP and non-GAAP results, are below. 
 FIRST QUARTER OVERVIEW 
 Net sales were 0.882 billion for the first quarter, compared to 1.237 billion in the prior year's first quarter. 
 Selling, general and administrative SG expenses were 295.1 million, or 33.5 of net sales for the first quarter, compared to 345.7 million, or 27.9 of net sales, in the prior year's first quarter. 
 Net loss was 32.3 million for the first quarter, compared to a net loss of 50.5 million for the prior year s first quarter. 
 Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were 1.083 billion at the close of the quarter. 
 Long-term debt remains limited to a low-interest, unsecured term loan associated with the French government s response to COVID-19. 
 
 The Company will not be holding a conference call today. 
 NON-GAAP MEASURES AND OTHER METRICS 
 As a supplement to the Company s financial results presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP ), GameStop may use certain non-GAAP measures, such as adjusted SG&A expenses, adjusted operating income (loss), adjusted net income (loss), adjusted earnings (loss) per share, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors in evaluating the Company s core operating performance. Adjusted SG&A expenses, adjusted operating income (loss), adjusted net income (loss), adjusted earnings (loss) per share and adjusted EBITDA exclude the effect of items such as certain transformation costs, asset impairments, severance, as well as divestiture costs. Free cash flow excludes capital expenditures otherwise included in net cash flows (used in) provided by operating activities. The Company s definition and calculation of non-GAAP financial measures may differ from that of other companies. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed as supplementing, and not as an alternative or substitute for, the Company s financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Certain of the items that may be excluded or included in non-GAAP financial measures may be significant items that could impact the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows and should therefore be considered in assessing the Company s actual and future financial condition and performance.

 Non-GAAP results 
 The following table reconciles the Company's cash flows provided by operating activities as presented in its unaudited Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and prepared in accordance with GAAP to its free cash flow. Free cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes, however, that free cash flow, which measures our ability to generate additional cash from our business operations, is an important financial measure for use by investors in evaluating the company s financial performance.

 Non-GAAP Measures and Other Metrics 
 Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted SG&A expense, adjusted operating loss and adjusted net loss per share are supplemental financial measures of the Company s performance that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, GAAP. We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations. We define adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before income taxes, plus interest income, net and depreciation and amortization, excluding stock-based compensation, certain transformation costs, business divestitures, asset impairments, severance and other non-cash charges. Net income (loss) is the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to adjusted EBITDA. Our non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Furthermore, non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as an analytical tool because they exclude some but not all items that affect the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Some of these limitations include 
 certain items excluded from adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing a company s financial performance, such as a company s cost of capital and tax structure 
 adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments 
 adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs 
 although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements and 
 our computations of adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. 
 We compensate for the limitations of adjusted EBITDA, adjusted SG&A expense, adjusted operating loss, adjusted net loss and adjusted loss per share as analytical tools by reviewing the comparable GAAP financial measure, understanding the differences between the GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures and incorporating these data points into our decision-making process. Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted SG&A expense, adjusted operating loss, adjusted net loss and adjusted net loss per share are provided in addition to, and not as an alternative to, the Company s financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Because adjusted EBITDA, adjusted SG&A expense, adjusted operating loss, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings (loss) per share may be defined and determined differently by other companies in our industry, our definitions of these non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing their utility.
