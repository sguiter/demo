 variable interest entities ("VIEs") (Note 17) that most significantly impact the VIEs economic performance, combined with a variable interest that gives us the right to receive potentially significant benefits or the obligation to absorb potentially significant losses, we have a controlling financial interest in those VIEs. 
 These financial statements have not been audited by the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, except that the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2023 is derived from audited consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and notes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. The financial statements reflect all adjustments (all of which are of a normal recurring nature) which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim periods presented. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for a full year. Certain disclosures have been condensed in or omitted from these consolidated financial statements. The accompanying unaudited financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 
 We are engaged in the engineering, manufacturing, marketing, and sale of premium air conditioning and heating equipment consisting of standard, semi-custom, and custom rooftop units, data centers cooling solutions, cleanroom systems, packaged outdoor mechanical rooms, air handling units, makeup air units, energy recovery units, condensing units, geothermal/water-source heat pumps, coils, and controls.

 Due to the highly customized nature of many of the Company s products and each product not having an alternative use to the Company without significant costs to the Company, the Company recognizes revenue over time as progress is made toward satisfying the performance obligations of each contract. The Company has formal cancellation policies and generally does not accept returns on these units. As a result, many of the Company s products do not have an alternative use and therefore, for these products we recognize revenue over the time it takes to produce the unit. 
 
 Contract costs include direct materials, direct labor, installation, freight and delivery, commissions and royalties. Other costs not related to contract performance, such as indirect labor and materials, small tools and supplies, operating expenses, field rework and back charges are charged to expense as incurred. Provisions for estimated losses on contracts in progress are made in the period in which such losses are determined. Changes in job performance, job conditions, and estimated profitability, including those arising from contract penalty provisions and final contract settlements, may result in revisions to costs and income, and are estimated and recognized by the Company throughout the life of the contract. The aggregate of costs incurred and income recognized on uncompleted contracts in excess of billings is shown as a contract asset within our consolidated balance sheets, and the aggregate of billings on uncompleted contracts in excess of related costs incurred and income recognized is shown as a contract liability within our consolidated balance sheets. 
 
 The Company recognizes revenue, presented net of sales tax, when it satisfies the performance obligation in its contracts. For certain manufactured equipment contracts and part sales, the primary performance obligation is delivery. We satisfy the performance obligation when the control is passed to the customer, generally at time of shipment. Final sales prices are fixed based on purchase orders.

Product Warranties 
 A provision is made for the estimated cost of maintaining product warranties to customers at the time the product is sold based upon historical claims experience by product line. The Company records a liability and an expense for estimated future warranty claims based upon historical experience and management s estimate of the level of future claims. Changes in the estimated amounts recognized in prior years are recorded as an adjustment to the liability and expense in the current year. 
 The Company also sells extended warranties on parts for various lengths of time ranging from six months to 10 years. Revenue for these separately priced warranties is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the separately priced warranty period. 
 Representatives and Third Party Products 
 We are responsible for billings and collections resulting from all sales transactions, including those initiated by our independent manufacturer representatives Representatives ). Representatives are national companies that are in the business of providing HVAC units and other related products and services to customers. The end user customer orders a bundled group of products and services from the Representative and expects the Representative to fulfill the order. These additional products and services may include controls purchased from another manufacturer to operate the unit, start-up services, and curbs for supporting the unit Third Party Products ). All are associated with the purchase of a HVAC unit but may be provided by the Representative or another third party. Only after the specifications are agreed to by the Representative and the customer, and the decision is made to use a Company HVAC unit, will we receive notice of the order. We establish the amount we must receive for our HVAC unit minimum sales price ), but do not control the total order price that is negotiated by the Representative with the end user customer. The Representatives submit the total order price to us for invoicing and collection. The total order price includes our minimum sales price and an additional amount which may include both the Representatives fee and amounts due for additional products and services required by the customer. The Company is considered the principal for the equipment we design and manufacture and records that revenue. The Company has no control over the Third Party Products to the end customer and the Company is under no obligation related to the Third Party Products. Amounts related to Third Party Products are not recognized as revenue but are recorded as a liability and are included in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. 
 The Representatives fee and Third Party Products amounts Due to Representatives are paid only after all amounts associated with the order are collected from the customer. The amount of payments to our Representatives were million and million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023 we had million and million outstanding under the Revolver, respectively. We have standby letter of credit totaling million as of September 30, 2024, and two standby letters of credit totaling 2.3 million as of December 31, 2023. Borrowings available under the Revolver at September 30, 2024 were million. The Revolver expires on May 27, 2027. We have amended the Revolver to allow for the occurrence of transactions associated with the New Markets Tax Credit transactions (Note 17). 
 Any outstanding loans under the Revolver bear interest at the daily compounded secured overnight financing rate ("SOFR") plus the applicable margin. Applicable margin, ranging from - , is determined quarterly based on the Company's leverage ratio. The Company is also subject to letter of credit fees, ranging from - , and a commitment fee, ranging from - . The applicable fee percentage is determined quarterly based on the Company's leverage ratio. The weighted average interest rate on borrowings outstanding on the Revolver was for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Fees associated with the unused portion of the committed amount are included in interest expense on our consolidated statements of income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 If SOFR cannot be determined pursuant to the definition, as defined by the Revolver agreement, any outstanding affected loans will be deemed to have been converted into alternative base rate ("ABR") loans. ABR loans would bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the highest of (a) the Prime Rate in effect on such day, (b) the Federal Funds Rate in effect on such day plus , or (c) daily simple SOFR for a one-month tenor in effect on such day plus .

 We have historically earned investment tax credits from the state of Oklahoma s manufacturing property investment program. We use the flow-through method to account for investment tax credits earned on eligible tangible asset expenditures. Under this method, the investment tax credits are recognized as a reduction to our Oklahoma income tax expense in the year they are used. As part of our expansion projects in Oklahoma, we identified a separate, more advantageous Oklahoma credit program (not income tax related) which resulted in us discontinuing our accumulation of credits for Oklahoma s manufacturing property investment program after the 2022 tax year. Because the Company will not generate additional excess credits after our 2022 tax year, we will be able to use our credit carryforwards against future taxable income and the related valuation allowance was reversed resulting in a one-time benefit of million to the income tax provision for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, we have investment tax credit carryforwards of approximately million. These credits have estimated expirations from the year 2039 through 2043. 
 In accordance with the 2017 Tax Cuts Jobs Act, under Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m), the tax deduction for covered executives of public companies is limited to 1.0 million per individual. Because of the increase in our stock price and timing of executive stock option exercises this resulted in an increase to the income tax provision of approximately million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. 
 In accordance with the 2017 Tax Cuts Jobs Act, under Internal Revenue Code Section 174, research and development expenses incurred after December 31, 2021 are required to be capitalized and amortized over 5 years. The amortization requirements for tax purposes is a mid-year convention, meaning that the tax amortization is 10 in the year of acquisition, 20 in the following 4 years, and 10 in the final year. 
 The Company's estimated annual 2024 effective tax rate, excluding discrete events, is approximately . We file income tax returns in the U.S., state and foreign income tax return jurisdictions. We are subject to U.S. income tax examinations for tax years 2021 to present, and to non-U.S. income tax examinations for the tax years 2020 to present. In addition, we are subject to

The million shares issued and outstanding under the 2016 Plan are only eligible for issuance under the 2024 Plan upon forfeiture, expiration, or cancellation. 
 Under the 2024 Plan and previously under the 2016 Plan (collectively, the "Plans"), shares can be granted in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, performance awards, dividend equivalent rights, and other awards. Under the Plans, the exercise price of shares granted may not be less than of the fair market value at the date of the grant. The Plans are administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors or such other committee of the Board of Directors as is designated by the Board of Directors (the Committee ). Membership on the Committee is limited to independent directors. The Committee may delegate certain duties to one or more officers of the Company as provided in the Plans. The Committee determines the persons to whom awards are to be made, determines the type, size and terms of awards, interprets the Plans, establishes and revises rules and regulations relating to the Plans and makes any other determinations that it believes necessary for the administration of the Plans.

The issuance of the Key Employee Awards was contingent upon BASX meeting certain post-closing earn-out milestones during each of the years ending 2021, 2022 and 2023 as defined by the BASX acquisition membership interest purchase agreement ("MIPA Agreement") and continued employment with the Company. At the end of the earn-out period, ending December 31, 2023, each eligible Key Employee Award vested and was converted into common stock. The fair value of Key Employee Awards is based on the fair market value of AAON common stock on the grant date. The weighted average grant date fair value of the key awards was 53.45. All pre-tax compensation cost has been recognized as of December 31, 2023, and all 39,899 awards vested in March 2024.

 Share-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the service period of the related share-based compensation award. Historically, stock options and restricted stock awards, granted to employees, vested at a rate of per year. Restricted stock awards granted to directors historically vested one-third each year or, if granted on or after May 2019, vest over the shorter of directors' remaining elected term or one-third each year. As of March 2021, all new grants of stock options and restricted stock awards, granted to employees, vest at a rate of per year. Forfeitures are accounted for as they occur. 
 Historically, if the employee or director is retirement eligible (as defined by the applicable LTIP, 2016 Plan or 2024 Plan) or becomes retirement eligible during the service period of the related share-based compensation award, the service period (and compensation expense recognition) is the lesser of 1) the grant date, if retirement eligible on grant date, or 2) the period between grant date and retirement eligible date. All stock options and restricted stock awards granted on or after March 1, 2020 to retirement eligible employees or directors contain a employment requirement (minimum service period) or the entire award is forfeited. Forfeitures are accounted for as they occur. 
 The PSUs cliff vest on December 31, at the end of the third year from the date of grant. Share-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the service period of PSUs. The PSUs are subject to several service and market conditions, as defined by the PSU agreement, which allows the holder to retain a pro-rata amount of awards as a result of certain termination conditions, retirement, change in common control, or death. Forfeitures are accounted for as they occur.

Cash was paid in lieu of fractional shares (approximately million). All share and per share information has been updated to reflect the effects of this stock split.

million in the aggregate of contingent consideration to the former owners of BASX, which is payable in approximately million shares of the Company's common stock, par value per share. The shares do not accrue dividends. 
 Under the MIPA Agreement, the issuance of shares to the former owners of BASX was contingent upon BASX meeting certain post-closing earn-out milestones during each of the years ended 2021, 2022, and 2023. In March 2024, we issued the remaining million shares related to the earn-out milestone for the year ended 2023. As a result of the shares issued in March 2024, the tax basis exceeded the book basis for consideration paid resulting in a deferred tax asset and an increase to additional paid-in capital of million, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheet. The deferred tax asset is expected to be amortized over fifteen years. We previously issued million shares in March 2023, related to the earn-out milestone for the year ended 2022.

Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto, which are included in this report, and our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto, which are included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 
 This discussion contains or incorporates by reference forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but rather are based on expectations, estimates, assumptions and projections about our industry, business and future financial results, based on information available at the time this report is filed with the SEC or, with respect to any document incorporated by reference, available at the time that such document was prepared. Our actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those identified in the section entitled Forward-Looking Statements in this Item 2 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in the section entitled Risk Factors in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. We do not assume any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect changed assumptions, the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events, new information or circumstances or otherwise, except as required by law. 
 Overview 
 We are engaged in the engineering, manufacturing, and selling of premium heating, ventilation, and air conditioning equipment consisting primarily of semi-custom and custom rooftop units, data center cooling solutions, cleanroom systems, packaged outdoor mechanical rooms, air handling units, makeup air units, energy recovery units, condensing units, geothermal/water-source heat pumps, coils, and controls. These products are marketed and sold to a variety of vertical markets including retail, manufacturing, educational, lodging, supermarket, data centers, medical and pharmaceutical, industrial, and other commercial markets. We sell our products to all 50 states in the United States and certain provinces in Canada. Foreign sales were approximately 24.6 million of our total net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 29.3 million of our sales during the same period of 2023. 
 Our business can be affected by a number of economic factors, including the level of economic activity in the markets in which we operate. Both the new construction and replacement markets are cyclical. If the domestic economy were to slow or enter a recession, this could result in a decrease in our sales volume and profitability. Sales in the commercial and industrial new construction markets generally lag the housing market, which in turn is influenced by cyclical factors such as interest rates, inflation, consumer spending habits, employment rates, the state of the economy and other macroeconomic factors over which we have no control. Sales in the replacement markets are driven by various factors, including general economic growth, the Company's new product introductions, fluctuations in the average age of existing equipment in the market, government regulations and stimulus, change in market demand between more customized, higher performing HVAC equipment and lower priced standard equipment, as well as many other factors. When new construction is down, we emphasize the replacement market. 
 We sell our products to property owners and contractors mainly through a network of independent manufacturers Representatives. This go-to-market strategy is unique compared to most of our larger competitors in that most control their sales channel. We value the independent sales channel as we think it is a more effective way of increasing market share. Although we concede full control of the sales process with this strategy, the entrepreneurial aspect of the independent sales channel attracts the most talent and provides greater financial incentives for its salespeople. Furthermore, the independent sales channel sells different types of equipment from various manufacturers, allowing it to operate with more of a solutions-based mindset, as opposed to an internal sales department of a manufacturing company that is incentivized to only sell its equipment regardless if it is the best solution for the end customer. We also have a small internal sales force that supports the relationships between the Company and our sales channel partners. BASX sells highly customized products for unique applications for a more concentrated customer base and an internal sales force is more effective for such products. 
 The principal components of cost of goods sold are labor, raw materials, component costs, factory overhead, freight and engineering expense. The principal high volume raw materials used in our manufacturing processes are steel, copper and aluminum, and are obtained from domestic suppliers. We also purchase from domestic manufacturers certain components, including coils, compressors, motors, and electrical controls. 
 The price levels of our raw materials fluctuate given that the market continues to be volatile and unpredictable as a result of the uncertainty related to the U.S. economy and global economy. At September 30, 2024, the price (year to date average) for copper, galvanized steel, stainless steel and aluminum decreased 5.1 , 13.2 , 23.7 , and 1.6 , respectively, as compared to the price (year to date average) at September 30, 2023. 
 
 - 29 - 

We attempt to limit the impact of price fluctuations on these materials by entering into cancellable and non-cancellable contracts with our major suppliers for periods of six to 18 months. We expect to receive delivery of raw materials from our contracts for use in our manufacturing operations. 
 We occasionally increase the price of our products to help offset any inflationary headwinds. In 2022, we implemented a recurring 1 monthly price increase beginning June 1, 2022, and ending on April 1, 2023. We reinstated the recurring 1 monthly price increase on October 1, 2023, through February 1, 2024.

 At September 30, 2024, we had a backlog of 647.7 million. Compared to a year ago, backlog was up 32.0 from 490.6 million, driven by the BASX and AAON Coil Products segments. At the end of the quarter, a majority of total backlog consisted of orders of data center equipment that will be delivered in 2025.

 Our cash flows from operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 191.7 million, up 78.9 compared to a year ago, giving us the flexibility to continue our investment in capital expenditures and software development of 113.8 million for this period. 
 We completed the repurchase of 1.4 million shares for 107.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

 2 Presented after intercompany eliminations. 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, total net sales increased 15.3 million or 4.9 , due to an increase in volumes of approximately 2.8 and price increases of approximately 2.1 . F or the three months ended September 30, 2024, our BASX segment increased by 58.8 primarily related to data center cooling solutions . 
 Gross profit as a percent of sales decreased to 34.9 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 37.2 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. AAON Oklahoma's gross profit as a percent of sales decreased due to the lower volumes out of this segment that resulted in less overhead absorption. AAON Coil products benefited from a favorable product mix of units for the data center market that had significant repetition and resulted in high production efficiencies. BASX completed construction of its new weld shop expansion in Redmond during the quarter. The continued construction at this location requires outsourcing of some processes and materials that have lowered the BASX margin temporarily. 
 As shown in the table below, the cost of raw materials has decreased, or stayed relatively flat, but we continued to experience inflation in our component parts that typically lag raw materials by six to 18 months. Additionally, in order to retain our existing employees, we have increased our starting wage rate considerably in recent years and continue to award periodic wage increases to our employees. These additional costs have been offset by the various price increases we have put in place in the past two years and increases in our production efficiency that has led to increased overhead absorption.

 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, total net sales increased 41.0 million or 4.8 , due primarily to increases in price. BASX continues to see increased demand for data cooling solutions, increasing their sales year-over-year 39.0 . 
 Gross profit as a percent of sales increased to 35.4 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 33.3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. As noted above, realization of price increases has improved our margin profile along with the slowing of inflation for raw materials, especially in our AAON Oklahoma and AAON Coil Products segments, improving overall consolidated margin performance. Production timing delays at our BASX location during the first quarter of 2024, as well as some expansion construction inefficiencies, and materials outsourcing, contributed to less overhead absorption and margin performance, which resulted in a period over period decline in gross margin for our BASX segment. 
 As shown in the table below, the cost of raw materials has started to come down but we continued to experience inflation in our component parts that typically lag raw materials by six to 18 months. Additionally, in order to retain our existing employees, we have increased our starting wage rate considerably in recent years and continue to award periodic wage increases to our employees. These additional costs have been offset by the various price increases we have put in place in the past two years and increases in our production efficiency that has led to increased overhead absorption.

 Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 16.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from the prior year period. Depreciation and amortization has increased 4.2 million due to investments in back office technology and automation. Professional fees decreased 4.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due the 2023 litigation settlement (Note 18), offset by increases in various professional, regulatory, and legal corporate requirements. Other expenses increased 6.3 million or 29.8 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, due to increased travel, bad debts, the closing of our New Markets Tax Credit transaction, and consulting expenses. 
 Income Taxes 
 Nine Months Ended Effective Tax Rate September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 2024 2023 (in thousands) Income tax provision 34,456 29,447 19.3 18.4 
 The Company s estimated annual 2024 effective tax rate, excluding discrete events, is expected to be approximately 24.9 . 
 The 18.4 overall effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was primarily due to the change in our valuation allowance from the discontinuation of our participation in the state of Oklahoma s manufacturing property investment program. This change will allow the Company to utilize existing credit carryforwards in future tax years, eliminating the need for a valuation allowance against this deferred tax asset. The related valuation allowance was reversed resulting in a one-time benefit of 3.1 million to the estimated income tax provision for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded an excess tax benefit of 11.7 million as compared to 6.3 million during the same period in 2023. The excess tax benefit is related to the timing of stock option exercises as a result of our high stock price during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 In accordance with the 2017 Tax Cuts Jobs Act, under Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m), the tax deduction for covered executives of public companies is limited to 1.0 million per individual. Because of the increase in our stock price and timing of executive stock option exercises this resulted in an increase to the income tax provision of approximately 2.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our working capital and capital expenditure requirements are generally met through net cash provided by operations and the use of the revolving bank line of credit based on our current liquidity at the time. 
 Working Capital - Our unrestricted cash decreased 0.3 million from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024. Our restricted cash decreased 2.1 million due to funding requirements related to our Longview, Texas expansion. Our restricted cash originates from the closing of our recent New Markets Tax Credit transaction related to our Longview, Texas expansion. We expect most funds will be released from this account by the end of 2024. 
 Revolving Line of Credit - Our revolving credit facility (as amended, "Revolver"), provides for maximum borrowings of 200.0 million. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had 55.7 million and 38.3 million outstanding under the Revolver, respectively. We have one standby letter of credit totaling 0.3 million as of September 30, 2024 and two standby letters of credit totaling 2.3 million as of December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024, we have 144.0 million of borrowings available under the Revolver. The Revolver expires May 27, 2027. We have amended the Revolver to allow for the occurrence of transactions associated with the New Markets Tax Credit transactions (Note 17). 
 Any outstanding loans under the Revolver bear interest at the daily compounded secured overnight financing rate ("SOFR") plus the applicable margin. Applicable margin, ranging from 1.25 - 1.75 , is determined quarterly based on the Company's leverage ratio. The Company is also subject to letter of credit fees, ranging from 1.25 - 1.75 , and a commitment fee, ranging from 0.10 - 0.20 . The applicable fee percentage is determined quarterly based on the Company's leverage ratio. The weighted average interest rate on borrowings outstanding on the Revolver was 6.6 for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to 6.5 and 6.3 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Fees associated with the unused portion of the committed amount are included in interest expense on our consolidated statements of income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 If SOFR cannot be determined pursuant to the definition, as defined by the Revolver agreement, any outstanding effected loans will be deemed to have been converted into alternative base rate ("ABR") loans. ABR loans would bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the highest of (a) the Prime Rate in effect on such day, (b) the Federal Funds Rate in effect on such day plus 0.50 , or (c) daily simple SOFR for a one-month tenor in effect on such day plus 1.00 . 
 At September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with our financial covenants, as defined by the Revolver. These covenants require that we meet certain parameters related to our leverage ratio. At September 30, 2024, our leverage ratio was 0.19 to 1.0, which meets the requirement of not being above 3 to 1. 
 2019 New Markets Tax Credit - On October 24, 2019, the Company entered into a transaction with a subsidiary of an unrelated third-party financial institution (the 2019 Investor and a certified Community Development Entity under a qualified New Markets Tax Credit 2019 NMTC program pursuant to Section 45D of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, related to an investment in plant and equipment to facilitate the expansion of our Longview, Texas manufacturing operations (the 2019 Project ). In connection with the NMTC transaction, the Company received a 23.0 million NMTC allocation for the 2019 Project and secured low interest financing and the potential for future debt forgiveness related to the expansion of its Longview, Texas facilities. 
 Upon closing of the 2019 NMTC transaction, the Company provided an aggregate of approximately 15.9 million to the Investor, in the form of a loan receivable, with a term of twenty-five years, bearing an interest rate of 1.0 . This 15.9 million in proceeds plus capital contributed from the Investor was used to make an aggregate 22.5 million loan to a subsidiary of the Company. This financing arrangement is secured by equipment at the Company's Longview, Texas facilities, and a guarantee from the Company, including an unconditional guarantee of the NMTCs. 
 2023 New Markets Tax Credit - On April 25, 2023, the Company entered into a transaction with a subsidiary of an unrelated third-party financial institution (the 2023 Investor and a certified Community Development Entity under a qualified New Markets Tax Credit 2023 NMTC program pursuant to Section 45D of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, related to an investment in plant and equipment to facilitate the expansion of our Longview, Texas manufacturing operations (the 2023 Project ). In connection with the 2023 NMTC transaction, the Company received a 23.0 million NMTC allocation for the 2023 Project and secured low interest financing and the potential for future debt forgiveness related to the expansion of its Longview, Texas facilities.

This 16.7 million in proceeds plus capital contributed from the Investor was used to make an aggregate 23.8 million loan to a subsidiary of the Company. This financing arrangement is secured by a guarantee from the Company, including an unconditional guarantee of the NMTCs.

On July 7, 2023, the Board of Directors declared a three-for-two stock split of the Company's common stock that was paid in the form of a stock dividend. Stockholders of record at the close of business on July 28, 2023 received one additional share for every two shares they held as of that date on August 16, 2023 (ex-dividend date August 17, 2023). All share and per share information has been updated to reflect the effects of this stock split. 
 Based on historical performance and current expectations, we believe our cash and cash equivalents balance, the projected cash flows generated from our operations, our existing committed revolving credit facility (or comparable financing) and our expected ability to access capital markets will satisfy our working capital needs, capital expenditures, and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations in 2024 and the foreseeable future. 
 Statement of Cash Flows 
 The following table reflects the major categories of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. For additional details, see the consolidated financial statements.

 Cash Flows Provided by Operating Activities 
 The Company currently manages cash needs through working capital as well as drawing on its line of credit. Collections and payments cycles are on a normal pattern and fluctuate due to timing of receipts and payments. 
 Historically, the Company increased the purchase of inventory to take advantage of favorable pricing opportunities and also to 
 
 - 37 - 

mitigate the impact of future supply chain disruptions on our operations; however, as inflationary and supply chain disruptions have decreased, the Company has been able to reduce overall inventory levels. Additionally, timing of our customer prepayment as well as increases in our employee bonuses pools and benefits (as a result of our positive operating results) increased our cash provided by accrued liabilities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Payment terms for BASX jobs typically require upfront cash to fund the job resulting in cash inflows related to our contract liabilities and cash inflows fluctuate due to job timing and scheduling. 
 Cash Flows Used in Investing Activities 
 The capital expenditures for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, relate to our continued investment in our production capabilities. Purchases during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, relate to additional infrastructure and machinery for both replacement and growth, additional production space in our Redmond, Oregon and Longview, Texas locations, additional equipment and production capacity in Parkville, Missouri, and additional land in Tulsa, Oklahoma for future growth. We have also made investments to purchase or develop software for internal use in anticipation of future Company growth. The capital expenditure program for 2024 is estimated to be approximately 215.0 million. Many of these projects are subject to review and cancellation at the discretion of our CEO and Board of Directors without incurring substantial charges. 
 Cash Flows Provided by Financing Activities 
 The change in cash from financing activities in 2024 is primarily related to borrowings under our revolving credit facility to manage our working capital needs, especially strategic purchases of inventory to avoid supply chain delays and the funding of certain capital expenditures, offset by repayments we were able to make due to our increased operating results and financial condition. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 100.0 million under our open market share repurchase programs. Furthermore, cash flows from financing activities is historically affected by the timing of stock options exercised by our employee. 
 Commitments and Contractual Obligations 
 We are occasionally party to short-term and long-term, cancellable and occasionally non-cancellable, contracts with suppliers for the purchase of raw material and component parts. We expect to receive delivery of raw material and component parts for use in our manufacturing operations. These contracts are not accounted for as derivative instruments because they meet the normal purchase and normal sales exemption. We had no material contractual purchase obligations as of September 30, 2024, except as described below. 
 In 2023, the Company executed a five-year purchase commitment for refrigerants. Payments made in satisfaction of the purchase commitment were approximately 3.1 million and 9.7 million the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to 2.4 million and 7.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Estimated minimum future payments are 2.2 million, 9.1 million, 10.5 million, and 11.2 million for 2024, 2025, 2026, and 2027, respectively. We had no other material contractual purchase obligations as of September 30, 2024. 
 In November 2024, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to purchase a new 787,000 square foot facility in Memphis, Tennessee, which will accommodate incremental demand from the data center market over the next several years, at the same time providing more geographic diversification across our manufacturing footprint. The purchase price for the facility is approximately 63.0 million. 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 There have been no material changes in the Company s critical accounting policies during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 Commodity Price Risk 
 We are exposed to volatility in the prices of commodities used in some of our products and we may use cancellable and non-cancellable contracts with our major suppliers for periods of six to 18 months to manage this exposure. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We are exposed to changes in interest rates related to our outstanding debt. As of September 30, 2024, we had an outstanding balance of 55.7 million on our Revolver. For each one percentage point increase in the interest rate applicable to our outstanding debt, our annual income before taxes would decrease by approximately 0.6 million. 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer with the oversight of the Audit Committee, regarding the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
 (c) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 See Note 18 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. The risk factors described in our Annual Report could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or future results. There have been no material changes to the risk factors included in our 2023 Annual Report except as follows: 
 
 Risks Related to Governmental Regulation and Policies 
 
 We are subject to climate-related risks. 
 As climate change continues to be a challenge across the globe, AAON recognizes there are risks specifically related to climate. As mentioned before, there could be stricter regulations on refrigerants, energy efficiency, and the use of fossil fuels. The price of electricity could increase, or the Company s operations could be affected by climate-change related weather events or water shortages. These risks could impact the Company on a short-term or long-term basis. 
 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity and Securities and Use of Proceeds. 
 Stock Repurchases 
 The Company may repurchase AAON, Inc. stock on the open market from time to time. For nine months ended September 30, 2024, we have repurchased a total of approximately 1.4 million shares (at current market prices) under the various open market stock buyback programs for an aggregate price of 100.0 million, or an average price of 73.90 per share. The Board must authorize the timing and amount of these purchases and all repurchases are in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC allowing the Company to repurchase shares from the open market.

The Company also repurchases shares of AAON, Inc. stock from employees for payment of statutory tax withholdings on stock transactions and/or stock repurchased to cover the strike price of stock options. For nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased approximately 88.0 thousand shares (at current market prices) for an aggregate price of 7.5 million, or an average price of 84.73 per share. 
 
 Repurchases during the third quarter of 2024 were as follows: 
 ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES Period (a) Total Number of Shares (or Units) Purchased (b) Average Price Paid Per Share (or Unit) (c) Total Number of Shares (or Units) Purchased as part of Publicly Announced Plans or Programs (d) Maximum Number (or Approximate Dollar Value) of Shares (or Units) that may yet be Purchased under the Plans or Programs July 2024 327 87.29 327 August 2024 43,242 86.78 43,242 September 2024 1,839 98.37 1,839 Total 45,408 87.25 45,408 
 Contingent Shares Issued in BASX Acquisition 
 In December 2021, we closed on the acquisition of BASX. Under the MIPA Agreement, we committed to million in the aggregate of contingent consideration to the former owners of BASX, which is payable in approximately million shares of the Company's common stock, par value per share. The shares do not accrue dividends. 
 Under the MIPA Agreement, the issuance of shares to the former owners of BASX was contingent upon BASX meeting certain post-closing earn-out milestones during each of the years ended 2021, 2022, and 2023. In March 2024, we issued the remaining million shares related to the earn-out milestone for the year ended 2023. As a result of the shares issued in March 2024, the tax basis exceeded the book basis for consideration paid resulting in a deferred tax asset and an increase to additional paid-in capital of million, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheet. The deferred tax asset is expected to be amortized over 15 years. We previously issued million shares in March 2023, related to the earn-out milestone for the year ended 2022. All shares have been issued as private placements exempt from registration with the SEC under Rule 506(b) and are included in common stock on the consolidated statements of stockholders' equity.
