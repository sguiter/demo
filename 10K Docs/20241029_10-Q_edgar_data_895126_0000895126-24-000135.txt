million shares of our common stock to Southwestern s shareholders in connection with the Merger Agreement. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, subject to certain exceptions, each share of Southwestern common stock was converted into the right to receive of a share of the Company s common stock. Based on the closing price of our common stock, the total value of the shares of our common stock issued to Southwestern s shareholders was approximately billion. 
 
 We are accounting for this transaction using the acquisition method of accounting, with Expand Energy (formerly Chesapeake) treated as the accounting acquirer. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the assets and liabilities of Southwestern and its subsidiaries will be recorded at their respective fair values as of the date of the completion of the Southwestern Merger. As of the date of this report, the preliminary purchase price allocation is not complete but is expected to be completed within one year subsequent to the closing date of the Southwestern Merger. Determining the fair value of the assets and liabilities of Southwestern requires judgment and certain assumptions to be made, including relating to the valuation of Southwestern's oil and gas properties. The Southwestern Merger was structured as a tax-free reorganization for United States federal income tax purposes. 
 
 Eagle Ford Divestitures 
 In January 2023, we entered into an agreement to sell a portion of our Eagle Ford assets to WildFire Energy I LLC for approximately billion, subject to customary post-closing adjustments. Approximately million of the purchase price was recorded as deferred consideration and treated as a non-interest-bearing note to be paid in installments of million per year for the first three years following the transaction close date and million to be paid in the fourth year following the transaction close date. During the Current Period, we received the first installment payment related to this transaction. The deferred consideration is recorded at fair value with an imputed rate of interest as a Level 2 input, and approximately million and million of the deferred consideration is reflected within other current assets and approximately million and million is reflected within other long-term assets on the condensed consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The divestiture, which closed on March 20, 2023 (with an effective date of October 1, 2022), resulted in a gain of approximately million, inclusive of post-closing adjustments, based on the difference between the carrying value of the assets and consideration received. 
 In February 2023, we entered into an agreement to sell a portion of our remaining Eagle Ford assets to INEOS Upstream Holdings Limited INEOS Energy for approximately billion, subject to customary post-closing adjustments. Approximately million of the purchase price was recorded as deferred consideration and treated as a non-interest-bearing note to be paid in installments of approximately million per year for following the transaction close date. During the Current Period, we received the first installment payment related to this transaction. The deferred consideration is recorded at fair value with an imputed rate of interest as a Level 2 input, and approximately million and million of the deferred consideration is reflected within other current assets and approximately million and million is reflected within other long-term assets on the condensed consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The divestiture, which closed on April 28, 2023 (with an effective date of October 1, 2022), resulted in a gain of approximately million, based on the difference between the carrying value of the assets and consideration received.

Approximately million of the purchase price was recorded as deferred consideration and treated as a non-interest-bearing note to be paid one year from the closing date.

Additionally, SilverBow agreed to pay us an additional contingent payment of million should WTI NYMEX prices average between and per barrel or million should WTI NYMEX prices average above per barrel during the year following the close of the transaction. On July 30, 2024, Crescent Energy Company Crescent acquired SilverBow. We anticipate receiving the additional contingent payment from Crescent, if any, during the fourth quarter of 2024. The fair value of the contingent consideration as of September 30, 2024 of million is reflected within derivative assets within our condensed consolidated balance sheets.

 (a) The carrying value of borrowings under our Credit Facility approximates fair value as the interest rates are based on prevailing market rates; therefore, they are a Level 1 fair value measurement. For all other debt, a market approach, based upon quotes from major financial institutions, which are Level 2 inputs, is used to measure the fair value. 
 
 Credit Facility . In December 2022, we entered into a senior secured reserve-based credit agreement, as amended pursuant to the Amendment No. 1 and Borrowing Base Agreement, dated April 29, 2024 (the Initial Credit Agreement Amendment and as automatically amended on October 28, 2024 by the Investment Grade Credit Agreement Amendment (as defined below), with the lenders and issuing banks party thereto from time to time (the Lenders ), and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent and collateral agent (in such capacity, the Administrative Agent (such credit agreement as amended by the Initial Credit Agreement Amendment, the Pre-IG Credit Agreement , and as further amended by the Investment Grade Credit Agreement Amendment, the Credit Agreement ), providing for a revolving credit facility (such facility as amended pursuant to the Initial Credit Agreement Amendment, the Pre-IG Credit Facility , and as further amended pursuant to the Investment Grade Credit Agreement Amendment, the Credit Facility maturing in December 2027. The Initial Credit Agreement Amendment, among other things, increased the aggregate commitments under the Pre-IG Credit Facility from billion to billion and increased the sublimit available for the issuance of letters of credit from million to million. The Credit Facility continues to provide for a million sublimit available for swingline loans. As of September 30, 2024, the borrowing base under the Pre-IG Credit Facility was billion. As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately billion available for borrowings under the Pre-IG Credit Facility. 
 
 The obligations under the Pre-IG Credit Facility were guaranteed by certain of Expand Energy s subsidiaries (the Guarantors ), and the Pre-IG Credit Facility was secured by substantially all of the assets owned by the Company and the Guarantors (subject to customary exceptions), including mortgages on not less than of the total PV-9 of the borrowing base properties evaluated in the most recent reserve report (where PV-9 is the net present value, discounted at per annum, of the estimated future net revenues). Since the effectiveness of the Investment Grade Credit Agreement Amendment, the Credit Facility is no longer guaranteed or secured, or subject to a borrowing base. 
 
 The Pre-IG Credit Agreement contained restrictive covenants, subject to customary exceptions for reserve-based credit facilities, that limited Expand Energy and its subsidiaries ability to, among other things: (i) incur additional indebtedness, (ii) make investments, (iii) enter into mergers; (iv) make or declare dividends; (v) repurchase or redeem certain indebtedness; (vi) enter into certain hedges; (vii) incur liens; (viii) sell assets; and (ix) engage in certain transactions with affiliates. Since the effectiveness of the Investment Grade Credit Agreement

 to 1.00; (B) a net leverage ratio, which was the ratio of total indebtedness (less unrestricted cash up to a specified threshold) to Consolidated EBITDAX (as defined in the Pre-IG Credit Agreement) for the prior four fiscal quarters, of not greater than to 1.00 and (C) a PV-9 coverage ratio of the net present value, discounted at per annum, of the estimated future net revenues expected in the proved reserves to Expand Energy s and its restricted subsidiaries total indebtedness of not less than to 1.00. The Investment Grade Credit Agreement Amendment, among other things, (i) removed the current ratio, net leverage ratio and PV-9 coverage ratio previously contained in the Pre-IG Credit Agreement and (ii) provides for our compliance with an indebtedness to capitalization ratio, which is the ratio of the Company s total indebtedness to the sum of total indebtedness plus stockholders equity (the Debt to Capitalization Ratio ), not to exceed . 
 
 Borrowings under the Credit Agreement may be alternate base rate loans or term SOFR loans, at our election. Interest is payable quarterly for alternate base rate loans and at the end of the applicable interest period for term SOFR loa ns. Term SOFR loans bear interest at term SOFR plus an applicable rate ranging from to basis points per annum, depending on the Company s unsecured debt ratings (which rate under the Pre-IG Credit Agreement previously ranged from to basis points per annum, depending on the percentage of the commitments utilized), plus an additional basis points per annum credit spread adjustment. Alternate base rate loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the greatest of: (i) the prime rate; (ii) the federal funds effective rate plus basis points; and (iii) the adjusted term SOFR rate for a one-month interest period plus basis points, plus an applicable margin ranging from to basis points per annum, depending on the Company s unsecured debt ratings (which applicable margin under the Pre-IG Credit Agreement previously ranged from to basis points per annum, depending on the percentage of the commitments utilized). Expand Energy also pays a commitment fee on unused commitment amounts under the Credit Facility ranging from to basis points per annum, depending on the Company s unsecured debt ratings (which commitment fee rate under the Pre-IG Credit Agreement previously ranged from to basis points per annum, depending on the percentage of the commitments utilized).

 In addition, we have long-term agreements for certain natural gas gathering and related services within specified acreage dedication areas in exchange for cost-of-service based fees redetermined annually, or tiered fees based on volumes delivered relative to scheduled volumes. Future gathering fees may vary with the applicable agreement. 
 
 Other Commitments 
 As part of our normal course of business, we enter into various agreements providing, or otherwise arranging for, financial or performance assurances to third parties on behalf of our wholly owned guarantor subsidiaries. These agreements may include future payment obligations or commitments regarding operational performance that effectively guarantee our subsidiaries future performance. 
 In connection with acquisitions and divestitures, our purchase and sale agreements generally provide indemnification to the counterparty for liabilities incurred as a result of a breach of a representation or warranty by the indemnifying party and/or other specified matters. These indemnifications generally have a discrete term and are intended to protect the parties against risks that are difficult to predict or cannot be quantified at the time of entering into or consummating a particular transaction. For divestitures of natural gas and oil properties, our purchase and sale agreements may require the return of a portion of the proceeds we receive as a result of uncured title or environmental defects. 
 While executing our strategic priorities, we have incurred certain cash charges, including contract termination charges, financing extinguishment costs and charges for unused natural gas transportation and gathering capacity.

 Accounts Receivable 
 Our accounts receivable are primarily from purchasers of natural gas, oil and NGL and from exploration and production companies that own interests in properties we operate. This industry concentration could affect our overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, because our purchasers and joint working interest owners may be similarly affected by changes in economic, industry or other conditions. We monitor the creditworthiness of all our counterparties, and we generally require letters of credit or parent guarantees for receivables from parties deemed to have sub-standard credit, unless the credit risk can otherwise be mitigated. We utilize an allowance method in accounting for bad debt based on historical trends in addition to specifically identifying receivables that we believe may be uncollectible.

 As of December 31, 2023, we were in a net deferred tax asset position and anticipate being in a net deferred tax asset position as of December 31, 2024. Based on all available positive and negative evidence, including projections of future taxable income, we believe it is more likely than not that some of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. As such, a partial valuation allowance was recorded against our net deferred tax asset position for federal and state purposes as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 On August 16, 2022, the President of the United States signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which includes provisions for a 15 corporate alternative minimum tax CAMT on book income for companies whose average book income exceeds 1 billion for any three consecutive years preceding the tax year. Based upon our book income in the past three years, we believe we are subject to the CAMT beginning in the current year. The CAMT will result in incremental taxes to the extent that 15 of our adjusted book earnings exceeds our regular federal tax liability. During the Current Quarter, proposed regulations for the CAMT were released. Although we are not early adopting these, we are still analyzing their potential impact should they become finalized. We do not currently project any material impact due to the CAMT in 2024.

 We did t repurchase any shares during the Current Period, and during the Prior Period, we repurchased million shares of common stock for an aggregate price of million. The repurchased shares of common stock were retired and recorded as a reduction to common stock and retained earnings and were made pursuant to the share repurchase program that expired on December 31, 2023. All share repurchases made after January 1, 2023 are subject to a 1 excise tax on share repurchases, as enacted under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. We are able to net this 1 excise tax on share repurchases against the issuance of shares of our common stock. The impact of this 1 excise tax was immaterial during the Prior Period.

 Fair Value 
 The fair value of our commodity derivatives is based on third-party pricing models, which utilize inputs that are either readily available in the public market, such as natural gas, oil and NGL forward curves and discount rates, or can be corroborated from active markets or broker quotes, and, as such, are classified as Level 2. These values are compared to the values given by our counterparties for reasonableness. Derivatives are also subject to the risk that either party to a contract will be unable to meet its obligations. We factor non-performance risk into the valuation of our derivatives using current published credit default swap rates. To date, this has not had a material impact on the values of our derivatives. The valuation of the contingent consideration is based on an option pricing model using significant Level 2 inputs that include quoted future commodity prices based on active markets. 
 Credit Risk Considerations 
 Our derivative instruments expose us to our counterparties credit risk. To mitigate this risk, we only enter into commodity contracts derivatives with counterparties that are highly rated or deemed by us to have acceptable credit strength and deemed by management to be competent and competitive market-makers, and we attempt to limit our exposure to non-performance by any single counterparty. As of September 30, 2024, our commodity contract derivative instruments were spread among counterparties.

 ITEM 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Introduction 
 This Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is intended to provide a reader of our financial statements with management s perspective on our financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and certain other factors that may affect our future results. The following discussion should be read together with the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this report and the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of our 2023 Form 10-K . 
 On October 1, 2024, we completed the Southwestern Merger, creating a premier energy company that we believe is underpinned by a leading natural gas portfolio adjacent to the highest demand markets, premium inventory, a resilient financial foundation and an investment grade balance sheet. We believe that this new company is uniquely positioned to deliver affordable, lower carbon energy to meet growing domestic and international demand while creating sustainable value for stakeholders. In conjunction with the closing of the Southwestern Merger, Chesapeake Energy Corporation changed its name to Expand Energy Corporation. 
 Expand Energy is the largest independent natural gas producer in the U.S., based on net daily production, and is focused on responsibly developing an abundant supply of natural gas, oil and NGL to expand energy access for all. Our operations are located in Louisiana in the Haynesville/Bossier Shales Haynesville ), in Pennsylvania in the Marcellus Shale Northeast Appalachia and in West Virginia and Ohio in the Marcellus and Utica Shales Southwest Appalachia ). 
 Our strategy is to create shareholder value through the responsible development of our significant resource plays while continuing to be a leading provider of natural gas to markets in need. We continue to focus on improving margins through operating efficiencies and financial discipline and improving our ESG performance. To accomplish these goals, we intend to allocate our human resources and capital expenditures to projects we believe offer the highest cash return on capital invested, to deploy leading drilling and completion technology throughout our portfolio, and to take advantage of acquisition and divestiture opportunities to strengthen our portfolio. We also intend to continue to dedicate capital to projects that reduce the environmental impact of our production activities. 
 We are focused on expanding America s energy reach to fuel a more affordable, reliable, lower-carbon future. In our efforts to achieve this ambition, we strive to be a safe operator and dedicated community partner. We have adopted five fundamentals that drive our decision-making, and which we believe will guide our success and increase our ability to sustainably deliver stakeholder value: 
 Minimize emissions intensity in support of delivering lower-carbon energy to sustain economic progress. 
 Take steps to implement environmentally sound operations that mitigate impact and protect ecosystems. 
 Promote a safe and inclusive workplace, promoting collaboration and innovation. 
 Take meaningful action to support community well-being. 
 Provide transparent and measurable information encouraging accountability. 
 Additionally, we aim to be conscientious in our efforts and how they will shape our approach to sustainability for the future and have established the following goals: 
 Net zero (Scope 1 and 2) greenhouse gas emissions by 2035. 
 Maintain 100 responsibly sourced gas (RSG) certification across our portfolio.

Recent Developments 
 Southwestern Merger 
 On January 10, 2024, Chesapeake and Southwestern entered into an all-stock agreement and plan of merger (the Merger Agreement ). Southwestern was an independent energy company engaged in development, exploration and production activities, including related marketing activities, within its operating areas in the Appalachia and Haynesville shale plays. Our Board of Directors and the Board of Directors of Southwestern both approved the Merger Agreement. At separate special meetings each held on June 18, 2024, Chesapeake s stockholders approved the issuance of Chesapeake s common stock to the stockholders of Southwestern in connection with the Southwestern Merger, and Southwestern s stockholders approved the Merger Agreement. 
 On October 1, 2024, the Southwestern Merger was completed, and we issued approximately 95.7 million shares of our common stock to Southwestern s shareholders in connection with the Merger Agreement. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, subject to certain exceptions, each share of Southwestern common stock was converted into the right to receive 0.0867 of a share of the Company s common stock. Based on the closing price our common stock, the total value of such shares of our common stock issued to Southwestern s shareholders was approximately 7.9 billion. 
 Investment Grade Rating 
 On October 1, 2024, we received an investment grade rating from S P Global Ratings S P ). S P assigned an issuer-level rating of BBB- on our unsecured debt and raised our issuer credit rating to BBB- , with a stable outlook. Additionally, on October 2, 2024, we received an investment grade rating from Fitch Ratings Fitch ). Fitch affirmed our revolver credit rating at BBB- and upgraded the rating on our senior notes to BBB- , with a stable outlook. As a result of these investment grade ratings, certain restrictive covenants on our credit facility fall away and become more permissive. The leverage ratio and current ratio financial covenants and PV-9 Coverage Ratio are no longer effective, and the Company will be required to maintain compliance with a total indebtedness to capitalization ratio, which is the ratio of the Company s total indebtedness to the sum of total indebtedness plus stockholders equity, not to exceed 65 . 
 Divestitures 
 On January 17, 2023, we entered into an agreement to sell a portion of our Eagle Ford assets to WildFire Energy I LLC for approximately 1.425 billion, subject to post-closing adjustments. This transaction closed on March 20, 2023 (with an effective date of October 1, 2022) and resulted in the recognition of a gain of approximately 337 million. 
 On February 17, 2023, we entered into an agreement to sell a portion of our remaining Eagle Ford assets to INEOS Energy for approximately 1.4 billion, subject to post-closing adjustments. This transaction closed on April 28, 2023 (with an effective date of October 1, 2022) and resulted in the recognition of a gain of approximately 470 million. 
 On August 11, 2023, we entered into an agreement to sell the final portion of our remaining Eagle Ford assets to SilverBow Resources, Inc. SilverBow for approximately 700 million, subject to post-closing adjustments. Subject to the satisfaction of certain commodity price triggers, we may receive up to an additional 50 million cash consideration shortly following the first anniversary of the transaction close date. This transaction closed on November 30, 2023 (with an effective date of February 1, 2023) and resulted in the recognition of a gain of approximately 140 million. 
 LNG Agreement 
 On February 13, 2024, we announced our entrance into an LNG export deal that includes executed Sales and Purchase Agreements SPA for long-term liquefaction offtake. Under the SPAs, we will purchase approximately 0.5 million tonnes of LNG per annum from Delfin LNG LLC at a Henry Hub price with a contract targeted start date in 2028, then deliver to Gunvor Group Ltd., on a free on board basis with the sales price linked to the Japan Korea Market for a period of 20 years.

 Investments - Momentum Sustainable Ventures LLC 
 During the fourth quarter of 2022, we entered into an agreement with Momentum Sustainable Ventures LLC to build a new natural gas gathering pipeline and carbon capture and sequestration project, which will gather natural gas produced in the Haynesville Shale for re-delivery to Gulf Coast markets, including LNG export. The pipeline is expected to have an initial capacity of 1.7 Bcf/d expandable to 2.2 Bcf/d. The carbon capture portion of the project anticipates capturing and permanently sequestering up to 2.0 million tons per annum of CO2. The natural gas gathering pipeline is projected for a potential in-service date in the fourth quarter of 2025, and the carbon sequestration portion of the project is subject to regulatory approvals. Through the end of the Current Period, we have made total capital contributions of 296 million to the project. 
 
 Economic and Market Conditions 
 Instability and conflict in Europe and the Middle East has caused, and could intensify, volatility in natural gas, oil and NGL prices, and may further impact on global growth prospects, which could in turn affect supply and demand for natural gas and oil. In addition, a mild winter in 2023 and historically higher inventory levels have resulted in an observed decline in natural gas pricing in 2023 and 2024. Our future estimated cash flow is partially protected from commodity price volatility due to our current hedge positions that cover approximately 45 of our projected natural gas volumes through the end of 2025. Through the remainder of 2024 and for the foreseeable future, we believe our cost structure and liquidity position will enable us to successfully navigate continued price volatility. 
 
 During early 2023, our industry experienced inflationary pressures, including increased demand for oilfield service equipment, rising fuel costs, and labor shortages, which resulted in observed increases to our operating and capital costs that were not fixed. Reductions in rig activity in the lower 48 states of the United States allowed service costs to stabilize and then decline in the second half of 2023, which has continued into 2024. We continue to monitor these situations and assess their impact on our business, including business partners and customers. As a result of the Southwestern Merger, we assumed Southwestern s oilfield service businesses that will allow for some vertical integration of our exploration and production operations, which may help lower costs and secure inputs for our operations. For additional discussion regarding risks associated with price volatility and economic deterioration, see Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors in our 2023 Form 10-K . 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Liquidity Overview 
 Our primary sources of capital resources and liquidity are internally generated cash flows from operations and borrowings under our Credit Facility, and our primary uses of cash are for the development of our natural gas and oil properties, acquisitions of additional natural gas and oil properties and return of value to stockholders through dividends and equity repurchases. We believe our cash flow from operations, including from the acquired Southwestern business, cash on hand and unused borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility, as discussed below, will provide sufficient liquidity during the next 12 months and the foreseeable future. As of September 30, 2024, we had 3.5 billion of liquidity available, including 1.0 billion of cash on hand and 2.5 billion of aggregate unused borrowing capacity available under the Pre-IG Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2024, we had no outstanding borrowings under our Pre-IG Credit Facility. In April 2024, the aggregate commitments under the Pre-IG Credit Facility were increased by 500 million to 2.5 billion, bringing our aggregate unused borrowing capacity under the Pre-IG Credit Facility to 2.5 billion. 
 Further, we may from time to time seek to retire, refinance or amend some or all of our outstanding debt or debt agreements through exchanges, open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, tender offers or otherwise. Such transactions, if any, and the terms thereof, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved in such financing transactions may be material. See Note 4 of the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this report for further discussion of our debt obligations, including the carrying and fair value of our senior notes. 
 Dividends 
 On October 29, 2024, we declared a base quarterly dividend payable of 0.575 per share, which will be paid on December 4, 2024 to stockholders of record at the close of business on November 14, 2024. 
 28 

Table of Contents 

 The declaration and payment of any future dividend, whether fixed or variable, will remain at the full discretion of the Board and will depend on the Company s financial results, cash requirements, future prospects and other relevant factors. The Company s ability to pay dividends to its stockholders is restricted by (i) Oklahoma corporate law, (ii) its Certificate of Incorporation, (iii) the terms and provisions of the Credit Agreement governing the Credit Facility and (iv) the terms and provisions of the indentures governing its 5.500 Senior Notes due 2026, 5.875 Senior Notes due 2029, and 6.750 Senior Notes due 2029, as well as the senior notes assumed from Southwestern, including the 4.950 Senior Notes due 2025, 8.375 Senior Notes due 2028, 5.375 Senior Notes due 2029, 5.375 Senior Notes due 2030 and 4.750 Senior Notes due 2032. 
 
 Derivative and Hedging Activities 
 Our results of operations and cash flows are impacted by changes in market prices for the commodities we produce. We enter into various derivative instruments to mitigate a portion of our exposure to commodity price declines, but these transactions may also limit our cash flows in periods of rising commodity prices. Our natural gas, oil and NGL derivative activities, when combined with our sales of natural gas, oil and NGL, allow us to better predict the total revenue we expect to receive. See Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk included in Part I of this report for further discussion on the impact of commodity price risk on our financial position. 
 
 Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 As of September 30, 2024, our material contractual obligations include repayment of senior notes, derivative obligations, asset retirement obligations, lease obligations, undrawn letters of credit and various other commitments we enter into in the ordinary course of business that could result in future cash obligations. In addition, we have contractual commitments with midstream companies and pipeline carriers for future gathering, processing and transportation of natural gas to move certain of our production to market. The estimated gross undiscounted future commitments under these agreements were approximately 2.0 billion as of September 30, 2024. As discussed above, we believe our existing sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund our near and long-term contractual obligations. See Notes 4 , 5 and 11 of the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this report for further discussion. 
 As a result of the Southwestern Merger, we will be assuming material contractual obligations related to demand and similar charges under firm transportation and gathering agreements to guarantee access capacity on natural gas and liquids pipelines and gathering systems. 
 
 Credit Facility 
 On December 9, 2022, we entered into the Credit Agreement, as amended by the Initial Credit Agreement Amendment and the Investment Grade Credit Agreement Amendment, maturing in December 2027. The Pre-IG Credit Facility provided for a borrowing base of 3.5 billion. The Credit Facility continues to provide for aggregate commitments of 2.5 billion, with a 500 million sublimit available for the issuance of letters of credit and a 50 million sublimit available for swingline loans. As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 2.5 billion available for borrowings under the Pre-IG Credit Facility. 
 
 Borrowings under the Credit Agreement may be alternate base rate loans or term SOFR loans, at the Company s election. On October 1, 2024, we received an investment grade rating from S P Global Ratings S P ). S P assigned an issuer-level rating of BBB- on our unsecured debt and raised our issuer credit rating to BBB- , with a stable outlook. Additionally, on October 2, 2024, we received an investment grade rating from Fitch Ratings Fitch ). Fitch affirmed our revolver credit rating at BBB- and upgraded the rating on our senior notes to BBB- , with a stable outlook. As a result of these investment grade ratings and the satisfaction of certain other conditions, (i) the Pre-IG Credit Agreement was automatically amended by the Investment Grade Credit Agreement Amendment, (ii) all liens and guarantees previously provided by the Company and its subsidiaries in connection with the Pre-IG Credit Agreement were released and (iii) all guarantees previously provided in connection with the Company s senior notes were released. Such Investment Grade Credit Agreement Amendment, among other things, removed the application of the borrowing base provided for in the Pre-IG Credit Agreement and modified the pricing and covenants as discussed in Note 4 of the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this report.

 See Note 4 of the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this report for further discussion. 
 Assumption of Southwestern s Senior Notes and Southwestern Credit Facility Extinguishment 
 On October 1, 2024, the Southwestern Merger was completed, and we assumed approximately 3.7 billion of Southwestern s senior notes. On October 1, 2024, Southwestern s existing credit facility was terminated, with all loan amounts and other obligations outstanding thereunder repaid in full and all commitments thereunder extinguished, for approximately 585 million, which included all outstanding borrowings and transaction fees. 
 
 Capital Expenditures 
 For the quarter ending December 31, 2024, we currently expect to complete and turn in line 30 to 35 gross wells utilizing approximately 12 rigs and plan to invest between approximately 620 690 million in capital expenditures. We currently plan to fund our 2024 capital program through cash on hand, expected cash flow from our operations and borrowings under our Credit Facility. We may alter or change our plans with respect to our capital program and expected capital expenditures based on developments in our business, our financial position, our industry or any of the markets in which we operate. 
 
 Sources and (Uses) of Cash and Cash Equivalents 
 The following table presents the sources and uses of our cash and cash equivalents for the periods presented: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Cash provided by operating activities 1,183 1,910 Proceeds from divestitures of property and equipment 17 1,967 Receipts of deferred consideration 116 Funds held for transition services 91 Proceeds from warrant exercise 1 Capital expenditures (1,021) (1,450) Contributions to investments (71) (149) Payments on Credit Facility, net (1,050) Cash paid to repurchase and retire common stock (313) Cash paid for common stock dividends (254) (412) Debt issuance and other financing costs (4) Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash (33) 594 
 Cash Flow from Operating Activities 
 Cash provided by operating activities was 1,183 million and 1,910 million during the Current Period and Prior Period, respectively. The decrease during the Current Period is primarily due to lower prices for the natural gas we sold, as well as decreased sales volumes, including those related to our Eagle Ford divestitures, and planned production curtailments and activity deferrals. Cash flows from operations are largely affected by the same factors that affect our net income (loss), excluding various non-cash items, such as depreciation, depletion and amortization, certain impairments, gains or losses on sales of assets, deferred income taxes and mark-to-market changes in our open derivative instruments. See further discussion below under Results of Operations . 
 Proceeds from Divestitures of Property and Equipment 
 During the Prior Period, we sold a portion of our Eagle Ford assets to WildFire Energy I LLC and also sold a portion of our remaining Eagle Ford assets to INEOS Energy (each transaction with an effective date of October 1, 2022).

 Receipts of Deferred Consideration 
 During the Current Period, we received 116 million in deferred consideration associated with our Eagle Ford divestiture transactions. See Note 2 of the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this report for further discussion. 
 Funds Held for Transition Services 
 During the Prior Period, we held 91 million of funds relating to transition services associated with our Eagle Ford divestitures. 
 Capital Expenditures 
 Our capital expenditures decreased during the Current Period compared to the Prior Period, primarily as a result of decreased drilling and completion activity within our Marcellus and Haynesville operating areas, as well as reduced activity in Eagle Ford due to our Eagle Ford divestitures. See Note 2 of the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this report for further discussion. 
 
 Contributions to Investments 
 During the Current Period and Prior Period, contributions to investments primarily consisted of contributions to our investment with Momentum Sustainable Ventures LLC to build a new natural gas gathering pipeline and carbon capture project. See Note 12 of the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this report for further discussion. 
 Payments on Credit Facility, net

 Results of Operations 
 
 The results of operations discussed below for the Current Quarter and Current Period compared to the Prior Quarter and Prior Period, respectively, represent Expand Energy s results prior to the Southwestern Merger and do not include the results of operations of Southwestern and its subsidiaries for those periods. The results of operations discussed below reference legacy Chesapeake operating areas such as the Marcellus Shale in the northern Appalachian Basin in Pennsylvania Marcellus ), the Haynesville/Bossier Shales in northwestern Louisiana Haynesville and the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas Eagle Ford ). During 2023, we completed our exit from Eagle Ford through three separate divestiture transactions, with aggregate proceeds from these three transactions exceeding 3.5 billion, subject to customary post-closing adjustments. We anticipate, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2024, that our results of operations will reflect increased natural gas, oil and NGL production, operating revenues and related operating expenses due to the Southwestern Merger. Additionally, we anticipate increased interest expense related to the assumption of Southwestern s senior notes.

 Other income during the time periods presented above primarily consists of interest income and deferred consideration amortization. The increase during the Current Period was primarily due to increased interest income related to our higher average cash balance compared to the Prior Period. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 An income tax benefit of 105 million was recorded for the Current Period. This amount was entirely related to projections of deferred federal and state income taxes. Income tax expense was 532 million for the Prior Period. Of this amount, 213 million was the result of projecting current federal and state income taxes, predominately as a result of taxable gains on closed divestitures, and the remainder was related to projections of deferred federal and state income taxes. Our effective income tax rate was 25.0 and 22.3 during the Current Period and the Prior Period, respectively. Our effective tax rate can fluctuate due to the impact of discrete items, state income taxes and permanent differences. See Note 8 of the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this report for a discussion of income taxes.

 ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 The primary objective of the following information is to provide forward-looking quantitative and qualitative information about our exposure to market risk. The term market risk relates to our risk of loss arising from adverse changes in natural gas, oil and NGL prices and interest rates. These disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses, but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses. The forward-looking information provides indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market risk exposures. 
 Commodity Price Risk 
 Our results of operations and cash flows are impacted by changes in market prices for natural gas, oil and NGL, which have historically been volatile. To mitigate a portion of our exposure to adverse price changes, we enter into various derivative instruments. Our natural gas, oil and NGL derivative activities, when combined with our sales of natural gas, oil and NGL, allow us to predict with greater certainty the revenue we will receive. We believe our derivative instruments continue to be highly effective in achieving our risk management objectives. 
 We determine the fair value of our derivative instruments utilizing established index prices, volatility curves and discount factors. These estimates are compared to counterparty valuations for reasonableness. Derivative transactions are also subject to the risk that counterparties will be unable to meet their obligations. This non-performance risk is considered in the valuation of our derivative instruments, but to date has not had a material impact on the values of our derivatives. Future risk related to counterparties not being able to meet their obligations has been partially mitigated under our commodity hedging arrangements that require counterparties to post collateral if their obligations to us are in excess of defined thresholds. The values we report in our financial statements are as of a point in time and subsequently change as these estimates are revised to reflect actual results, changes in market conditions and other factors. See Note 11 of the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this report for further discussion of the fair value measurements associated with our derivatives. 
 Our natural gas revenues during the Current Period, excluding any effect of our derivative instruments, were 1,374 million. We did not have any oil or NGL revenues during the Current Period. Based on production, natural gas revenues for the Current Period would have increased or decreased by approximately 137 million, for a 10 increase or decrease in prices. As of September 30, 2024, the fair value of our natural gas derivatives was a net asset of 191 million. As of September 30, 2024, we did not have any open oil or NGL derivative positions. A 10 increase in forward natural gas prices would decrease the valuation of natural gas derivatives by approximately 176 million, while a 10 decrease would increase the valuation by approximately 180 million. This fair value change assumes volatility based on prevailing market parameters at September 30, 2024. Additionally, should oil prices not meet the average target prices specified within the contingent payment from Crescent, we may not receive any payment from the up to 50 million contingent consideration arrangement. See Note 11 of the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this report for further information on our open derivative positions, including information about the contingent consideration arrangement. 
 As a result of the Southwestern Merger, our results of operations and cash flows will continue to be impacted by changes in market prices for natural gas, oil and NGL, which have historically been volatile. We plan to mitigate a portion of our exposure to adverse price changes and have entered into various derivative instruments, which includes hedge positions that cover approximately 45 of our projected natural gas volumes through the end of 2025. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Our exposure to interest rate changes relates primarily to borrowings under our Credit Facility. Interest is payable on borrowings under the Credit Facility based on floating rates. See Note 4 of the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of Part 1 of this report for additional information. As of September 30, 2024, we did not have any outstanding borrowings under our Pre-IG Credit Facility. 
 As a result of the Southwestern Merger, we assumed approximately 3.7 billion of Southwestern s senior notes, all of which had fixed interest rates. On October 1, 2024, Southwestern s existing credit facility, which was based on floating interest rates, was terminated, with all loan amounts and other outstanding obligations thereunder repaid in full and all commitments thereunder extinguished, for approximately 585 million, which included all outstanding borrowings and transaction fees.

 ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b). Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded as of September 30, 2024 that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 ITEM 1. Legal Proceedings 
 Litigation and Regulatory Proceedings 
 We are involved in various regulatory proceedings, lawsuits and disputes arising in the ordinary course of our business operations, including commercial disputes, personal injury claims, royalty claims, property damage claims and contract actions. The majority of the legal proceedings that were in existence prior to the Petition Date were settled during the Chapter 11 Cases or will be resolved in connection with the claims reconciliation process before the Bankruptcy Court. Any allowed claim related to such prepetition litigation will be treated in accordance with the Plan. 
 In connection with the Southwestern Merger, two lawsuits have been filed by purported stockholders of the Company or Southwestern against the Company and/or the members of the Company s board of directors: Gerald Joseph Lovoi v. Chesapeake Energy Corp., et al. , No. 1:24-cv-01896 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 13, 2024); Jeffrey Schantz v. Gass et al. , No. 155009/2024 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. May 30, 2024). Included in one or both of the complaints were allegations that the defendants violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and were negligent in misrepresenting or omitting material facts under Florida common law, because the registration statement filed in connection with the Southwestern Merger allegedly omitted or misstated material information. On June 10, 2024, the complaint in the Supreme Court of the State of New York was dismissed. On June 24, 2024, the complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York was dismissed. 
 See Note 5 of the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of Part I of this report for information regarding our estimation and provision for potential losses related to litigation and regulatory proceedings. Based on management s current assessment, we are of the opinion that no pending or threatened lawsuit or dispute relating to our business operations is likely to have a material adverse effect on our future consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. The final resolution of such matters could exceed amounts accrued, however, and actual results could differ materially from management s estimates. 
 Environmental Contingencies 
 The nature of the natural gas and oil business carries with it certain environmental risks for us and our subsidiaries. We have implemented various policies, programs, procedures, training and audits to reduce and mitigate such environmental risks. We conduct periodic reviews, on a company-wide basis, to assess changes in our environmental risk profile. Environmental reserves are established for environmental liabilities for which economic losses are probable and reasonably estimable. We manage our exposure to environmental liabilities in acquisitions by using an evaluation process that seeks to identify pre-existing contamination or compliance concerns and address the potential liability. Depending on the extent of an identified environmental concern, we may, among other things, exclude a property from the transaction, require the seller to remediate the property to our satisfaction in an acquisition or agree to assume liability for the remediation of the property. 

ITEM 1A. Risk Factors 

Our business has many risks. Factors that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results or liquidity and the trading price of our common stock are described under Risk Factors in Item 1A of our 2023 Form 10-K and the additional risk factor provided below, which supplements the risk factors included in our 2023 Form 10-K . This information should be considered carefully, together with other information in this report and other reports and materials we file with the SEC. 
 
 The completion of the Southwestern Merger may have triggered an annual limitation on the utilization of our tax attributes, reducing their ability to offset future taxable income, which may result in an increase to income tax liabilities. In addition, trading in our common stock, additional issuances of common stock, and certain other stock transactions could lead to an additional, potentially more restrictive annual limitation on the utilization of our tax attributes. 
 Upon emergence from bankruptcy on February 9, 2021, the Company experienced an ownership change under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code and such change, a Section 
 42 

Table of Contents 

 382 Ownership Change ), as all of the common stock and preferred stock of our predecessor, or the old loss corporation, was canceled and replaced with common stock of the successor, or the new loss corporation (the First Ownership Change ). As such, an annual limitation was computed for the First Ownership Change based on the fair market value of the new equity immediately after emergence multiplied by the long-term tax-exempt rate in effect for the month of February 2021. This annual limitation restricts the future utilization of our net operating loss NOL carryforwards, disallowed business interest carryforwards and tax credits that existed at the time of emergence. 
 The Southwestern Merger, on October 1, 2024, resulted in an ownership change for Southwestern and is being analyzed to determine if a Section 382 Ownership Change also occurred for the Company (the Potential Second Ownership Change"). In addition, trading in our stock, additional issuances, and other stock transactions occurring subsequent to the First Ownership Change (or, if the Potential Second Ownership Change occurred, subsequent to the Southwestern Merger) could lead to a further Section 382 Ownership Change. In the event of any additional Section 382 Ownership Change, including the Potential Second Ownership Change, a new annual limitation would be determined at such time that could be more restrictive than the limitation of the First Ownership Change. Depending on the market conditions and the Company s tax basis, an additional Section 382 Ownership Change may result in a net unrealized built-in loss. The annual limitation in such a case would additionally be applied to certain of the Company s tax items other than just NOL carryforwards, disallowed business interest carryforwards and tax credits. For example, a portion of tax depreciation, depletion and amortization would also be subject to the annual limitation for a five-year period following the Section 382 Ownership Change, but only to the extent of the net unrealized built-in loss existing at the time of the additional Section 382 Ownership Change. Whether the new annual limitation would be more restrictive would depend on the value of our stock and the long-term tax-exempt rate in effect at the time of such Section 382 Ownership Change. If the Southwestern Merger resulted in a Section 382 Ownership Change for the Company, given the higher long-term tax exempt rates in effect in October 2024 as compared to prior years, we believe that the annual limitation on the utilization of the Company s tax attributes will be less restrictive than the First Ownership Change. As a result, the new limitation would generally only apply to those tax attributes generated subsequent to the First Ownership Change. However, if the value of our common stock or long-term tax-exempt rates have decreased at the time any additional Section 382 Ownership Change occurs, such ownership change may be more restrictive than the First Ownership Change or the Potential Second Ownership Change, if applicable, and would apply to certain of the tax attributes existing at the time of the additional Section 382 Ownership Change, including those remaining from the time of the First Ownership Change and Potential Second Ownership Change, if applicable. 
 Some states impose similar limitations on tax attribute utilization upon experiencing an ownership change.
