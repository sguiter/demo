In and , the Company entered i nto sale and leaseback arrangements, pursuant to which the Company sold certain equipment to an equipment leasing company for one-time cash payments of and million, respectively, and leased back such equipment from the leasing company. The associated monthly lease rents will be paid over the lease term of . On August 19, 2024, the Company and Aspen RI (each, a Borrower and collectively, the Borrowers) entered into a Credit, Security and Guaranty Agreement (the Credit Agreement and the facilities provided thereunder, collectively, the MidCap Loan Facility) with MidCap Funding IV Trust, as agent (the Agent), MidCap Financial Trust, as term loan servicer, the financial institutions or other entities from time to time party thereto as lenders (the Lenders), and the other parties party thereto as additional guarantors and/or borrowers from time to time, for a term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of million and an asset-based revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed the lesser of million or the borrowing base. At closing the Company drew million from the term loan facility and million from the revolving loan facility. The proceeds of the borrowings, net of fees and costs, were used for repurchasing of the 2022 Convertible Notes (as defined below) for million and for general corporate purposes. The amount available to the Company at September 30, 2024 under the revolving loan facility was million. The Company is increasing investment in the research and development of next-generation aerogel products and manufacturing process technologies. In addition, the Company has developed a number of promising aerogel products and technologies for the electric vehicle market. The Company believes that the commercial potential for the Company s products and technology in the electric vehicle market is significant. Accordingly, the Company is hiring additional personnel, incurring additional operating expenses, incurring significant capital expenditures to expand aerogel manufacturing capacity and automated thermal barrier fabrication operations, and enhancing research and development resources, among other items. The Company expects its existing cash balance and the amount anticipated to be available under the existing revolving loan facility will be sufficient to support current operating requirements, current research and development activities and the initial capital expenditures required to support the evolving commercial opportunity in the electric vehicle market and other strategic business initiatives. However, the Company plans to supplement its cash balance and available credit with equity financings, debt financings, equipment leasing, sale and leaseback transactions, c ustomer prepayments, or government grant and loan programs to provide the

type of performance obligation. For a majority of the contracts, the Company recognizes revenue at a point in time when transfer of control of the products is passed to the customer, which is generally upon delivery according to contractual shipping terms within customer purchase orders. For a limited number of customer arrangements for customized products with no alternative use to the Company and an enforceable right to payment for progress completed to date, the Company recognizes revenue over time using units of production to measure progress toward satisfying the performance obligations. Units of production represent work performed as we do not generate significant work in process and thereby best depicts the transfer of control to the customer. Customer invoicing terms for contracts for which revenue is recognized under the over time methodology are typically based on certain milestones within the production and delivery schedule. The timing of revenue recognition is assessed on a contract-by-contract basis. The Company also enters into rebate agreements with certain customers. These agreements may be considered an additional performance obligation of the Company or variable consideration within a contract. Rebates are recorded as a reduction of revenue in

Shipping and Handling Costs Shipping and handling costs associated with outbound freight after control over a product has transferred to a customer are accounted for as fulfillment costs and are included in the cost of product revenue. The associated amount of revenue recognized includes the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for incurring these shipping and handling costs.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized million of revenue that was included in deferred revenue as of December 31, 2023. A contract asset is recorded when the Company satisfies a performance obligation by transferring a promised good or service and has earned the right to consideration from its customer. These assets may represent a conditional right to consideration and are included within accounts receivable and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets. A contract liability is recorded when consideration is received, or such consideration is unconditionally due, from a customer prior to transferring goods or services under the terms of the contract. Contract liabilities are recognized as revenue after control of the products or services is transferred to the customer and all revenue recognition criteria have been met.

Convertible note 

The 2022 Convertible Note does not have current observable inputs such as recent trading prices (Level 1) and was measured at fair value using a combination of option pricing and discounted cash flow models and incorporate management s assumptions for stock price, volatility and risk rate. In general, fair values determined by Level 1 inputs utilize observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Fair values determined by Level 2 inputs utilize data points that are either directly or indirectly observable, such as quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, interest rates and yield curves. Fair values determined by Level 3 inputs utilize unobservable data points in which there is little or no market data, which require the Company to develop its own assumptions for the asset or liability. The Company estimated the fair value of the 2022 Convertible Note was approximately million as of December 31, 2023. However, as the Company did not elect to utilize the fair value option, it was carried at amortized cost of million.

In connection with the same, during the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company recognized a charge of million, net of contractual recoverable of million, in cost of revenues for inventory obsolescence and impairment of equipment. During the three months ended June 30, 2024, the customer approved reimbursement of parts of the claim totaling million for equipment losses incurred by the Company and its vendors, which is recognized as an offset to the charge the Company recognized in the three months ended, March 31, 2024 in cost of revenues. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the customer approved the remaining claims related to inventory obsolescence of million, in addition to the contractual recoverable amount, which is recognized as an offset to the charge recognized in the three months ended, March 31, 2024 in cost of revenues. Federal, State and Local Environmental Regulations The Company is subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. These laws generally provide for control of pollutants released into the environment and require responsible parties to undertake remediation. Penalties may be imposed for noncompliance. Litigation The Company is, from time to time, a party to litigation that arises in the normal course of its business operations. See Part II, Item 1 Legal Proceedings of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a description of certain of the Company s current legal proceedings. The Company is not presently a party to any litigation for which it believes a loss is probable requiring an amount to be accrued or a possible loss contingency requiring disclosure.

million, which included capital commitments of million. Purchase commitments related to capital expenditures are anticipated to be spent over the next , while the Company's remaining purchase commitments are anticipated to be spent throughout 2024. Purchase obligations relate primarily to open purchase orders for capital expenditures, inventories, and goods and services. Purchase obligations are entered into with various vendors in the normal course of business and are consistent with the Company's expected requirements. Warranty The Company offers warranties to its customers depending upon the specific product. The Company s standard warranty period for energy industrial products extends to from the date of shipment. This standard warranty provides that the Company s products will be free from defects in material and workmanship, and will, under normal use, conform to the specifications for the product. The Company s thermal barrier products provide quality and warranty provisions customary in the automotive industry. The Company recorded warranty reserves related to its thermal barrier products of million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 . 

 . The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Right-of-use (ROU) assets represent the Company s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company s payment obligations under the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. To measure its lease liabilities, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate or the rate implicit in the lease, if available. The Company calculates its incremental borrowing rate using a synthetic credit rating analysis based on Moody s Building Materials Industry Rating Methodology. ROU assets also include any direct costs and prepaid lease payments but exclude any lease incentives received. The Company s lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company elected the short-term lease recognition exemption for all leases that qualify. For leases that qualify for this exemption, the Company does not recognize ROU assets or lease liabilities. For lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, the Company accounts for each component separately. However, in the case of equipment leases, the Company accounts for lease and non-lease components as a single component.

As of September 30, 2024, the Company had no additional operating real estate leases that would commence during 2024. Sale and leaseback transaction In January 2024, the Company entered into a sale and leaseback arrangement, pursuant to which the Company sold certain equipment to an equipment leasing company for a one-time cash payment of million and leased back such equipment from the leasing company. The transaction was considered as a failed sale and leaseback transaction and accordingly, was accounted as a financing transaction. The Company did not recognize a gain on any of the proceeds received from the lessor that contractually constitute payments to acquire the assets subject to these arrangements. Instead, the sale proceeds received were accounted for as finance obligations. The monthly lease rents will be paid over the term of and will be allocated between interest expense and principal repayment of the financial liability.

shares of common stock were reserved for issuance upon the exercise or vesting of outstanding stock-based awards granted under the Company s equity incentive plans. Any cancellations or forfeitures of awards outstanding under the 2023 Equity Plan, the 2014 Equity Plan or the 2001 Equity Incentive Plan, as amended (the 2001 Equity Plan) will result in the shares reserved for issuance pursuant to such awards becoming available for grant under the 2023 Equity Plan. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has either reserved in connection with statutory tax withholdings or issued a total of shares under the Company s equity incentive plans. As of September 30, 2024, there were shares of common stock available for future grant under the 2023 Equity Plan. On March 5, 2024, the Compensation and Leadership Development Committee (the Committee) of the Board of Directors of the Company approved the cancellation of the outstanding, unearned portion of the performance-based restricted shares granted to certain employees pursuant to the 2014 Equity Plan on June 29, 2021 (to Donald R. Young) and June 2, 2022 (to certain other employees). The Committee determined that based on current market conditions, the likelihood of achievement of any of the remaining performance hurdles applicable to the unearned restricted shares is remote, and that the unearned restricted shares therefore had ceased to have incentive value for the grantees. On March 6, 2024, the Company entered into cancellation agreements, pursuant to which the applicable employees agreed to such cancellation. The cancelled unearned restricted shares were added to the number of shares available for awards under the Company s 2023 Equity Incentive Plan. For financial accounting purposes, the cancellation of the unearned restricted shares resulted in the immediate charge of approximately million of unamortized stock compensation costs of which million is included in the general and administrative expenses and million is included in research and development expenses in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.

 Products 
 
 Our core businesses are organized into two reportable segments: Energy Industrial and Thermal Barrier. The following describes our key product offerings and new product innovations by reportable segment. 
 Thermal Barrier 
 We are actively developing a number of promising aerogel products and technologies for the electric vehicle (EV) market. We have developed and are commercializing our proprietary line of PyroThin aerogel thermal barriers for use in battery packs in EVs. Our PyroThin product is an ultra-thin, lightweight and flexible thermal barrier designed with other functional layers to impede the propagation of thermal runaway across multiple lithium-ion battery system architectures. Our thermal barrier technology is designed to offer a unique combination of thermal management, mechanical performance and fire protection properties. These properties enable EV manufacturers to achieve critical battery performance and safety goals. In addition, we are seeking to leverage our patented carbon aerogel technology to develop industry-leading battery materials for use in lithium-ion battery cells. These battery materials have the potential to increase the energy density of the battery cells, thus enabling an increase in the driving range of EVs. 
 The commercial potential for our PyroThin thermal barriers and our carbon aerogel battery materials in the EV market is significant. Accordingly, we are hiring additional personnel, incurring additional operating expenses, incurring significant capital expenditures to expand aerogel manufacturing capacity, establishing an automated thermal barrier fabrication operation, enhancing research and development resources and expanding our battery material research facilities, among other items. 
 20 

We have entered into production contracts with certain major OEMs, including General Motors LLC (GM), to supply fabricated, multi-part thermal barriers for use in the battery system of its next-generation EVs. Pursuant to the contracts with GM, we are obligated to supply the barriers at fixed annual prices and at volumes to be specified by the customer up to a daily maximum quantity through the term of the agreements, which expire at various times from 2026 through 2034. While GM has agreed to purchase its requirement for the barriers from us at locations to be designated from time to time, it has no obligation to purchase any minimum quantity of barriers under the contracts. In addition, GM may terminate the contracts any time and for any or no reason. All other terms of the contracts are generally consistent with GM s standard purchase terms, including quality and warranty provisions customary in the automotive industry. We have also entered into production contracts with Toyota, Scania, Audi, a luxury brand of the Volkswagen Group, ACC, a battery cell joint venture between Stellantis N.V, Saft-TotalEnergies and Mercedes-Benz, and a large EU battery manufacturer to supply a next generation vehicle platform of a major EU luxury sports car brand. 
 Energy Industrial 
 We also design, develop and manufacture innovative, high-performance aerogel insulation used primarily in the energy industrial and sustainable insulation materials markets. We believe our aerogel blankets deliver the best thermal performance of any widely used insulation product available on the market today and provide a combination of performance attributes unmatched by traditional insulation materials. Our end-user customers select our products where thermal performance is critical and to save money, improve resource efficiency, enhance sustainability, preserve operating assets and protect workers. Our insulation is used by oil producers and the owners and operators of refineries, petrochemical plants, LNG facilities, power generating assets and other energy industrial companies. Our Pyrogel and Cryogel product lines have undergone rigorous technical validation by industry leading end-users and achieved significant market adoption. 
 We also derive revenue from a number of other end markets. Customers in these markets use our products for applications as diverse as military and commercial aircraft, trains, buses, appliances, apparel, footwear and outdoor gear. As we continue to enhance our Aerogel Technology Platform , we believe we will have additional opportunities to address high-value applications in the global insulation market, and in a number of new, high-value markets, including hydrogen energy, filtration, water purification, and gas sorption. 
 We market and sell our products primarily through a sales force based in North America, Europe and Asia. The efforts of our sales force are supported by a small number of sales consultants with extensive knowledge of a particular market or region. Our sales force is responsible for establishing and maintaining customer and partner relationships, delivering highly technical information and ensuring high-quality customer service. 
 Our salespeople work directly with end-user customers and engineering firms to promote the qualification, specification and acceptance of our aerogel and thermal barrier products. We also rely on an existing and well-established channel of qualified insulation distributors and contractors in more than 50 countries around the world to ensure rapid delivery of our aerogel products and strong end-user support. 
 Manufacturing Operations 
 We manufacture our products using our proprietary technology at our facility in East Providence, Rhode Island. We have operated the East Providence facility since 2008 and have increased our capacity in phases. To meet expected growth in demand for our aerogel products in the EV market, we have been in the process of expanding our aerogel blanket capacity by constructing a second manufacturing plant in Bulloch County, Georgia. However, in order to manage the development of the second plant so that its increased capacity comes online in a manner that aligns with our current expectations as to demand from our EV customers, we are extending the timeframe for construction and commissioning of the second plant until such time as its capacity is supported by increased demand. In the meantime, and until we ramp up construction, we believe that productivity improvements in our existing Rhode Island facility combined with our supplemental supply of our energy industrial products from an external manufacturing facility in China will permit us to achieve our target revenue capacity in 2024 and prior to the completion and start-up of the second plant. At present, we have engaged one third-party external manufacturing facility in China to produce certain of our Energy Industrial products. Pursuant to our supply contract with this contract manufacturer, they are obligated to deliver products to us as we issue purchase orders on an as-needed basis through the term of the agreement. The contract automatically renews year-to-year unless either party notifies the other of its intention not to renew the contract. While we have agreed to purchase our requirement for certain Energy Industrial products from the contract manufacturer, we have no obligation to purchase any minimum quantity under the contract and we may terminate the contract at any time and for any or no reason. Additionally, we have entered into a contract with Prodensa Servicios de Consultora (Prodensa) to establish OPE Manufacturer Mexico S de RL de CV, a maquiladora located in Mexico, (OPE) which manufactures thermal barrier PyroThin products and operates an automated fabrication facility for PyroThin. Pursuant to such contract, we pay Prodensa a management fee and have an option to purchase OPE from Prodensa after a period of 18 months.

Recent Developments 
 Underwritten Offering 
 In October 2024, we entered into an underwriting agreement (the Underwriting Agreement) with Goldman Sachs Co. LLC and Morgan Stanley Co. LLC (collectively, the Underwriters), pursuant to which we issued and sold an aggregate of 4,887,500 shares of our common stock, which included 637,500 shares pursuant to the Underwriters option to purchase additional shares of our common stock, to the Underwriters in a registered underwritten offering (the Offering ). The price to the public in the Offering was 20.00 per share. The net proceeds to us from the Offering were approximately 93.2 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. 
 U.S. Department of Energy Loan Programs Office 
 On October 16, 2024, we announced that the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Loan Programs Office provided us a conditional commitment for a proposed loan of up to 670.6 million (the Loan) under the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing (ATVM) loan program within DOE s Loan Programs Office (LPO) for financing the construction of our planned second aerogel manufacturing facility (the Statesboro Plant) in Statesboro, Georgia. Aspen Aerogels Georgia, LLC, a subsidiary of Aspen Aerogels, Inc, is the intended borrower of the Loan. The Loan would be structured as project financing, providing for repayment commencing upon project commissioning. The interest rate will be the applicable U.S. Treasury Rate at the time of each cash draw. While this conditional commitment indicates the DOE s intent to finance the project, the DOE and the Company must satisfy certain technical, legal, environmental, and financial conditions before the DOE enters into definitive financing documents and funds the loan. 
 We had previously estimated the cost of the Statesboro Plant to be approximately 710.0 million. Adjusting the estimated cost to account for the right-timing of construction, inflation, and a revised scope that reflects recent process improvements, we have revised our aggregate cost estimate to a range of approximately 800.0 million to 960.0 million. The prospective DOE loan is intended to fully fund our remaining spend on the construction of the plant, following and assuming the expected closing of the Loan. 
 The receipt by us of the conditional commitment from the DOE in respect of the Loan is not an assurance that definitive financing documents will be negotiated and entered into, that the terms and conditions of the Loan will be consistent with the terms contemplated in the conditional commitment, or that all technical, legal, environmental and financial conditions will be achieved and satisfied. The outcome of the process with the DOE relating to the Loan and the Company's ability to draw and utilize such funds towards the construction of the Statesboro Plant is dependent on whether the DOE determines to proceed with the definitive financing documents and under what conditions. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these decisions and the terms and conditions of the financing documents that may be offered, if any. See the section titled Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Business and Strategy We are dependent upon our ability to close on and fully draw down on our proposed loan facility from the United States Department of Energy, which may restrict our ability to conduct our business. 
 MidCap Loan Facility 
 On August 19, 2024, we and Aspen Aerogels Rhode Island, LLC, a Rhode Island limited liability company (Aspen RI and, together with the Company, each, a Borrower and collectively, the Borrowers entered into a Credit, Security and Guaranty Agreement (the Credit Agreement and the facilities provided thereunder, collectively, the MidCap Loan Facility), by and among the Borrowers, MidCap Funding IV Trust, as agent (the Agent), MidCap Financial Trust, as term loan servicer, the financial institutions or other entities from time to time party thereto as lenders (the Lenders), and the other parties party thereto as additional guarantors and/or borrowers from time to time. The proceeds of the MidCap Loan Facility were used in connection with the transaction contemplated by the Note Repurchase Agreement (as defined below), the payment of related fees and expenses and for working capital of the Company and its subsidiaries. Loans borrowed under the MidCap Loan Facility mature on August 19, 2029. 
 The MidCap Loan Facility is comprised of (i) a term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of 125.0 million (the Term Loan Facility) and (ii) an asset-based revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed the lesser of (A) a 100.0 million commitment amount and (B) the value of the borrowing base (defined as the sum of (x) 85 of certain eligible accounts of the Borrowers and (y) the lesser of 85 of the NOLV or 85 of the cost of certain eligible inventory of the Borrowers) (the Revolving Facility). Loans borrowed under the Term Loan Facility will bear an interest rate equal to Term SOFR (as defined in the Credit Agreement) for a one-month interest period plus 4.50 per year, subject to a Term SOFR floor of 4.50 and a Term SOFR cap of 7.50 . Loans borrowed under the Revolving Facility will bear an interest rate equal to Term SOFR plus 4.60 per year, subject to a Term SOFR floor of 2.50 . The Term Loan Facility is subject to amortization of principal, payable quarterly on the last day of each quarter, commencing September 30, 2024, in an amount as set forth in the Credit Agreement with the remaining aggregate principal amount payable on the maturity date. The Revolving Facility has a required minimum balance set at 30 of the average borrowing 
 22 

base during the immediate preceding month. The Borrowers are required to pay the Lenders under the Revolving Facility an unused line fee of 0.30 of the average unused availability under the Revolving Facility, subject to the aforementioned minimum balance. 
 Repurchase of Convertible Note 
 On August 19, 2024, we entered into a note purchase and sale agreement (the Note Repurchase Agreement) with Wood River Capital, LLC (Wood River), an entity affiliated with Koch Disruptive Technologies, LLC, pursuant to which we repurchased from Wood River 123.9 million in aggregate capitalized principal amount (inclusive of PIK interest paid through June 30, 2024) of Convertible Senior PIK Toggle Notes due 2027, dated February 18, 2022, as amended by Amendment No. 1 to Convertible Senior PIK Toggle Notes due 2027, dated November 28, 2022 (the Convertible Note), such aggregate amount being the entire outstanding amount of the Convertible Note, for a total purchase price of 150.1 million in cash, which amount equals to the Redemption Price (as defined in the Convertible Note). Pursuant to the Note Repurchase Agreement, all rights and obligations, covenants and agreements under the Convertible Note and the underlying note purchase agreement were satisfied and discharged. 
 Financial Summary 
 Our revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 329.6 million, which represented an increase of 175.1 million, or 113 , from 154.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 2.0 million and net loss per share was 0.03. Net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 45.3 million and net loss per share was 0.65. 
 Key Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 We regularly review a number of metrics, including the following key metric, to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate financial projections and make strategic decisions. 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 We use Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, as a means to assess our operating performance. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest expense, taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation expense and other items, from time to time, which we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental measure of our performance that is not presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) or any other measure of financial performance calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, our definition and presentation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. 
 We use Adjusted EBITDA: 
 as a measure of operating performance because it does not include the impact of items that we do not consider indicative of our core operating performance; 

for planning purposes, including the preparation of our annual operating budget; 

to allocate resources to enhance the financial performance of our business; and 

as a performance measure used under our bonus plan. 

We also believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors with respect to our results of operations and in assessing the performance and value of our business. Various measures of EBITDA are widely used by investors to measure a company s operating performance without regard to items that can vary substantially from company to company depending upon financing and accounting methods, book values of assets, capital structures and the methods by which assets were acquired. 
 Although measures similar to Adjusted EBITDA are frequently used by investors and securities analysts in their evaluation of companies, we understand that Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for net income (loss), income (loss) from operations, net cash provided by (used in) operating activities or an analysis of our results of operations as reported under U.S. GAAP. Some of these limitations are: 
 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our historical cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or other contractual commitments; 

23 

Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; 

Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect stock-based compensation expense; 

Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our income tax expense or cash requirements to pay our income taxes; 

Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt; 

although depreciation, amortization and impairment charges are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated, amortized or impaired will often have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for these replacements; and 

other companies in our industry may calculate EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as a comparative measure. 

Because of these limitations, our Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to reinvest in the growth of our business or as a measure of cash available for us to meet our obligations. 
 To properly and prudently evaluate our business, we encourage you to review the U.S. GAAP financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business. 
 The following table presents a reconciliation of net income (loss), the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure, to Adjusted EBITDA for the periods presented:

Our financial performance, including such measures as net income (loss), earnings per share and Adjusted EBITDA, are affected by a number of factors including volume and mix of aerogel products sold, average selling prices, our material costs and manufacturing expenses, the costs associated with capacity expansions and start-up of additional production capacity, and the amount and timing of operating expenses. Accordingly, we expect that our net income (loss), earnings per share and Adjusted EBITDA will vary from period to period. 
 We expect to maintain strong revenue growth during 2024 driven by accelerating demand in the EV market and continued market share gains in the sustainable insulation materials market. Our expectation to maintain strong revenue growth is based, in part, on our OEM customers production volume forecasts and targets as well as our expectation to successfully scale our manufacturing capabilities and address any potential supply chain issues to meet this expected demand. As a result, we expect to experience a decrease in both net loss and negative Adjusted EBITDA during 2024, compared to 2023. 
 Components of Our Results of Operations 
 Revenue 
 We recognize revenue from the sale of our energy industrial aerogel products and thermal barriers. Revenue is recognized upon the satisfaction of contractual performance obligations. 
 We record deferred revenue for sales when (i) we have delivered products, but other revenue recognition criteria have not been satisfied, or (ii) payments have been received in advance of the completion of required performance obligations.

We project revenue growth during 2024 due to accelerating demand in the EV market and continued market share gains in the sustainable insulation materials market. 
 Cost of Revenue 
 Cost of product revenue consists primarily of materials and manufacturing expense. Cost of product revenue is recorded when the related product revenue is recognized. 
 Material is a significant component of cost of product revenue and includes fibrous batting, silica materials and additives. Material costs as a percentage of product revenue vary from product to product due to differences in average selling prices, material requirements, product thicknesses, and manufacturing yields. In addition, we provide warranties for our products and record the estimated cost within cost of revenue in the period that the related revenue is recorded or when we become aware that a potential warranty claim is probable and can be reasonably estimated. As a result of these factors, material costs as a percentage of product revenue will vary from period to period due to changes in the mix of aerogel products sold, the costs of our raw materials or the estimated cost of warranties. In addition, global supply chain disturbances, increased reliance on foreign materials procurement, industrial gas supply constraints, increases in the cost of our raw materials, engineering changes, higher prototype sales and other factors may significantly impact our material costs and have a material impact on our operations. We expect that material costs will increase in absolute dollars during 2024 due to projected growth in product shipments and contracts but remain stable as a percentage of revenue due to improved manufacturing, and fabrication yields and a favorable mix of products sold. 
 Manufacturing expense is also a significant component of cost of revenue. Manufacturing expense includes labor, utilities, maintenance expense, and depreciation on manufacturing assets. Manufacturing expense also includes stock-based compensation of manufacturing employees and shipping costs. We expect that manufacturing expense will increase in absolute dollars and decrease as a percentage of revenue during 2024 due to increased staffing costs and spending levels in support of our thermal barrier business, including the operation of an automated fabrication facility in Monterrey, Mexico. 
 We are also continuing to monitor the impact on our material costs, manufacturing expense, and cost of product revenue from engaging one or more external manufacturing facilities in China to supply our aerogel products for the energy industrial market beginning in 2024. We expect that our energy industrial product material costs will increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue, and manufacturing expense and cost of revenue will decrease as a percentage of revenue due to projected volume growth, which will be manufactured through the external manufacturing facility. 
 During 2024, we expect that cost of product revenue will increase in absolute dollars due to projected volume growth and a planned increase in staffing and spending levels, but decrease as a percentage of product revenue due to projected increases in average selling prices, improved manufacturing and fabrication yields and a favorable mix of products sold. 
 Gross Profit 
 Our gross profit as a percentage of revenue is affected by a number of factors, including the volume of products produced and sold, the mix of products sold, average selling prices, our material and manufacturing costs, realized capacity utilization and the costs associated with expansions and start-up of production capacity. Accordingly, we expect our gross profit to vary significantly in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue from period to period. 
 During 2024, we expect gross profit to increase in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenue due to the combination of a projected increase in total revenue combined with projected reduction in material costs and manufacturing expense as a percentage of total revenue. 
 In the longer term, we expect gross profit to improve in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue due to expected increases in total revenue, production volumes and manufacturing productivity. In addition, we expect the gross profit improvement derived from the increases in revenue, volume and productivity will be supported by the continued implementation of lower cost product formulations and realization of material purchasing efficiencies. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Operating expenses consist of research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses. Operating expenses include personnel costs, legal fees, professional fees, service fees, insurance premiums, travel expense, facilities related costs and other costs, expenses and fees. The largest component of our operating expenses is personnel costs, consisting of 
 25 

salaries, benefits, incentive compensation and stock-based compensation. In any particular period, the timing and extent of personnel additions or reductions, legal activities, including patent enforcement actions, marketing programs, research efforts and a range of similar activities or actions could materially affect our operating expenses, both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue. 
 Research and Development Expenses 
 Research and development expenses consist primarily of expenses for personnel engaged in the development of next generation aerogel compositions, form factors and manufacturing technologies. These expenses also include testing services, prototype expenses, consulting services, trial formulations for new products, equipment depreciation, facilities costs and related overhead. We expense research and development costs as incurred. We expect to continue to devote substantial resources to the development of new aerogel technologies, including our carbon aerogel battery materials. We believe that these investments are necessary to maintain and improve our competitive position. We also expect to continue to invest in research and engineering personnel and the infrastructure required in support of their efforts. We expect our research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars and decrease as a percentage of revenue in 2024 and the longer term. 
 Sales and Marketing Expenses 
 Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, incentive compensation, marketing programs, costs of new product and process introductions, travel and related costs, consulting expenses and facilities related costs. We expect our sales and marketing expenses will increase in absolute dollars but decrease as a percentage of revenue in 2024 and in the longer term. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, legal expenses, consulting and professional services, audit fees, compliance with securities, corporate governance and related laws and regulations, investor relations and insurance premiums, including director and officer insurance. 
 We expect our general and administrative expenses to increase as we add general and administrative personnel to support the anticipated growth of our business. We also expect that the patent enforcement actions, described in more detail under Legal Proceedings in Part I, Item 3 of our Annual Report and Legal Proceedings in Part II, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, if protracted, could result in significant legal expense over the medium to long-term. We expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars and decrease as a percentage of revenue. 
 Interest Expense, Convertible Note - Related Party 
 Interest expense, convertible note - related party is net of the capitalized interest related to the 100.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our Convertible Senior PIK Toggle Notes due 2027, which we sold and issued to Wood River. 
 Interest Income (Expense) 
 Interest expense consists of interest expense and amortization or write-off of deferred financing costs related to our other financing arrangements including a failed sale and leaseback arrangement accounted as a financing transaction and interest earned on the cash balances invested in deposit accounts, money market accounts, and high-quality debt securities issued by the U.S. government. 
 Provision for Income Taxes 
 We have incurred annual net losses since inception and have not recorded benefit provisions for U.S. federal income taxes or state income taxes since the tax benefits of our net losses have been offset by valuation allowances due to the uncertainty associated with the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards. We record tax expenses in connection with our Mexican maquiladora operations.

The 1.9 million of income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is related to our maquiladora operations in Mexico. We did not incur income tax expense for the comparable period in 2023. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Overview 
 We have experienced significant losses and invested substantial resources since our inception to develop, commercialize and protect our aerogel technology and to build a manufacturing infrastructure capable of supplying aerogel products at the volumes and costs required by our customers. These investments have included research and development and other operating expenses, capital expenditures, and investment in working capital balances. 
 Our long-term financial projections anticipate revenue growth, increasing levels of gross profit, and improved cash flows from operations. To meet expected growth in demand for our aerogel products in the EV market, we have been in the process of expanding our aerogel blanket capacity by constructing a second manufacturing plant in Bulloch County, Georgia. However, in order to manage the development of the second plant so that its increased capacity comes online in a manner that aligns with our current expectations of demand from our EV customers, we are extending the timeframe for construction and commissioning of the second plant until such time as its capacity is supported by increased demand. In the meantime, and until we ramp up construction, we expect to be able to substantially reduce our planned capital expenditures for 2024. At the same time, we believe that productivity improvements in our existing Rhode Island facility combined with the supplemental supply of our energy industrial products from one or more external manufacturing facilities in China will permit us to achieve a target revenue capacity of approximately 650 million in 2024 and prior to the completion and start-up of the second plant. Nonetheless, there can be no assurance as to when we will ramp up construction on the second plant. There can also be no assurance that our contract manufacturing strategy of meeting the demand of our energy industrial customers with supply from one or more external manufacturing facilities in China will provide us with adequate manufacturing capacity or supply for that expected demand. Furthermore, when we ramp up construction on the second plant, further cost inflation and/or supply chain disruptions, as well as potential changes in the scope of the facilities, could lead to increases to our prior estimated costs for completion of the second plant. 
 We are also increasing our investment in the research and development of next-generation aerogel products and technologies. During 2024, we have and will continue to develop aerogel products and technologies for the EV market. We believe the commercial potential for our technology in the EV market is significant. To meet the anticipated revenue growth and take advantage of this market opportunity, we are adding personnel and incurring additional operating expenses, among other items. 
 In January and September 2024, we entered into sale and leaseback arrangements, pursuant to which we sold certain equipment to an equipment leasing company for two separate one-time cash payments of 5.0 million and 10.0 million and leased back such equipment from the leasing company. The associated monthly lease rents will be paid over the term of three years. 
 In October 2024, we entered into an underwriting agreement (the Underwriting Agreement) with Goldman Sachs Co. LLC and Morgan Stanley Co. LLC (collectively, the Underwriters), pursuant to which we issued and sold an aggregate of 4,887,500 shares of our common stock, which included 637,500 shares pursuant to the Underwriters option to purchase additional shares of our common stock, to the Underwriters in a registered underwritten offering (the Offering ). The price to the public in the Offering was 20.00 per share. The net proceeds to us from the Offering were approximately 93.2 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. 
 On August 19, 2024, we entered into a Credit, Security and Guaranty Agreement with MidCap Financial for a term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of 125.0 million and an asset-based revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed the lesser of 100.0 million or the borrowing base. At closing we drew 125.0 million from the Term Loan Facility and 43.0 million from the revolving loan facility. The proceeds of the borrowings, net of fees and costs, were used for repurchasing of the Convertible Notes for 150.0 million and for general corporate purposes. 
 33 

We believe that our September 30, 2024 cash and cash equivalents balance of 113.5 million, together with the funds available under the MidCap Loan Facility, will be sufficient to support current operating requirements, current research and development activities and the initial capital expenditures required to support the evolving commercial opportunities in the EV market and other strategic business opportunities. 
 We plan to supplement our cash balance and available credit with equity financings, debt financings, equipment leasing, customer prepayments or government grant and loan programs to provide the additional capital necessary to purchase the capital equipment, construct the new facilities and complete the aerogel capacity expansions required to support our evolving commercial opportunities and strategic business initiatives. 
 We believe that consummation of equity financing could potentially result in an ownership change under Section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Such an ownership change would lead to the use of our net operating loss carryforwards being restricted. Our inability to use a substantial portion of our net operating loss carryforwards would result in a higher effective tax rate and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
 Primary Sources of Liquidity 
 Our principal sources of liquidity are currently our cash and cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents consist primarily of cash, money market accounts, and sweep accounts on deposit with banks. As of September 30, 2024, we had 113.5 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents. 
 Analysis of Cash Flow 
 Net Cash Used in Operating Activities 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we provided 9.9 million in net cash in operating activities, as compared to the use of 39.8 million in net cash during the comparable period in 2023, a decrease in the use of cash of 49.7 million. This decrease in use of cash was the result of net income adjusted for non-cash items of 97.8 million offset by net cash used by changes in operating assets and liabilities of 48.1 million. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we used 39.8 million in net cash in operating activities, as compared to the use of 70.3 million in net cash during the comparable period in 2022, a decrease in the use of cash of 30.5 million. This decrease in use of cash was the result of lower net loss adjusted for non-cash items of 31.4 million offset by net cash used by changes in operating assets and liabilities of 0.9 million. 
 Net Cash Used in Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities is for capital expenditures for machinery and equipment principally to improve the throughput, efficiency and capacity of our East Providence facility, expansion of our automated fabrication facility in Mexico and engineering designs and construction costs for the planned aerogel manufacturing facility in Bulloch County, Georgia. Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 71.5 million and 147.7 million, respectively. 
 Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities 
 Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 35.6 million and consisted of 15.0 million in proceeds from a sales leaseback, 10.4 million in proceeds from employee stock option exercises, 119.7 in proceeds from the term loan, net of issues costs, and 42.7 in proceeds from the revolver, net of issuance costs, offset by 150.0 million in cash used for the repayment of the convertible note, 1.3 million in cash used for payments made for employee tax withholdings associated with the vesting of restricted stock units, 0.8 million in repayments of a sales leaseback, and less than 0.1 million in cash used for fees and issuance costs. 
 Net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 totaled 0.1 million and consisted of 0.4 million in cash used for payments made for employee tax withholdings associated with the vesting of restricted stock units and 0.1 million issuance costs from private placement of common stock, offset, in part, by 0.4 million in proceeds from employee stock option exercises.

Item 3.	Quantitative and Qualitati ve Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure results primarily from fluctuations in interest rates, as well as from inflation. In the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risks, including changes in interest rates which affect our cash flows. We may also face additional exchange rate risk in the future as we expand our business internationally. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We are exposed to changes in interest rates in the normal course of our business. As of September 30, 2024, we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of 113.5 million. These amounts were held for working capital and capital expansion purposes and were invested primarily in deposit accounts, money market accounts, and high-quality debt securities issued by the U.S. government via cash sweep accounts primarily at major financial institutions in North America. Due to the short-term nature of these investments, we believe that our exposure to changes in the fair value of our cash as a result of changes in interest rates is not material. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had a term loan outstanding with principal balance of 127.5 million. Our term loan bears interest at the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) plus 4.50 per annum. Under the terms of the investment, SOFR has a floor of 4.50 and a cap of 7.50 . Interest is paid quarterly. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had a revolving facility outstanding with principal balance of 43.0 million. Our revolving facility bears interest at the SOFR plus 4.60 per annum. Under the terms of the investment, SOFR has a floor of 2.50 . Interest is paid monthly. The amount available to us under the revolving credit facility was 25.7 million. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 0.4 million of restricted cash to support our outstanding letters of credit to secure obligations under certain commercial contracts and other obligations. We terminated our revolving credit facility agreement on November 28, 2022. 
 Inflation Risk 
 Although we expect that our operating results will be influenced by general economic conditions, we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations during the periods presented in this report. However, our business may be affected by inflation in the future. 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Risk 
 We are subject to inherent risks attributed to operating in a global economy. We do not consider the exposure to foreign currency risk from our international operations to be material. A majority of our revenue, receivables, purchases and debts are denominated in U.S. dollars. Certain transactions of the Company and its subsidiaries are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. Foreign currency transaction losses were 2.3 million and 0.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively, and were recorded within operating expenses on the consolidated statements of operations. 
 Item 4.	Controls and Procedures. 
 (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures . 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on such evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal 
 37 

financial officer have concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 (b) Changes in Internal Controls . 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15(d)-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 38 

PART II OTHE R INFORMATION 
 Item 1.	Legal Proceedings. 
 We are involved in various legal claims and proceedings in the normal course of operations. We believe the outcome of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity, except as described in Part 1, Item 3. Legal Proceedings of our Annual Report on Form 10-K. Since the filing of our Form 10-K, there have been no material changes in our legal proceedings from those disclosed therein, other than as noted below. 
 Our patent infringement proceedings in Italy against of AMA S.p.A. and AMA Composites S.r.l. (collectively, AMA) are ongoing. In July 2023, the technical experts appointed by the judge issued a report finding key claims of our process patents valid and infringed by the aerogel products manufactured by Nano Tech Co., Ltd. and sold by AMA. In November 2023, we appealed our motion for preliminary injunction to a panel of the Court of Genoa. In February 2024, the Court issued an order dismissing our appeal. As of March 31, 2024, the main patent infringement proceedings are ongoing. 
 Our patent infringement proceedings in Korea against Beerenberg Services AS, Beerenberg Korea Ltd., and Bronx (China) Co., Ltd., are ongoing. In April 2024, the Korea Trade Commission (KTC) concluded its investigation into unfair international trade practices by Beerenberg Korea Ltd. and Bronx (China) Co., Ltd., with a decision that our asserted composition patent claims were invalid and our asserted process patent claims were not infringed. We disagree with the KTC decision, which is subject to appeal in the Seoul Administrative Court. We continue to vigorously defend the validity of these patents in the related oppositions filed by Beerenberg Korea Ltd. and Bronx (China) Co. Ltd., at the Korean Intellectual Property Trial and Appeal Board (IPTAB). Our patent infringement case against Beerenberg Services AS and Beerenberg Korea Ltd. at the Seoul District Court remains stayed pending the outcome of the IPTAB proceedings. 
 The opposition filed in September 2023 by LG Chem Ltd. against one of the Korean patents we are asserting against Beerenberg in Korea is ongoing. We are vigorously defending the validity of this patent. The opposition filed in August 2023 by LG Chem Ltd. against a Japanese counterpart of the Korean patents was concluded in our favor in May 2023 with a decision to maintain the patent and issuance of new Certificate of Patent on May 3, 2024. 
 In October 2022, we were served with a summons from Aerogels Poland Nanotechnology LLC (APN), a former distributor of our products in Poland with whom we previously terminated our distribution agreements because of APN s failure to pay amounts due to us. The summons asserts causes of action for declaratory judgment, breach of contract, breach of implied contract, equitable estoppel and fraud, and states that plaintiffs will seek declaratory judgment, actual and liquidated damages in the sum of 20 million, in addition to attorneys fees. We were not served with any complaint at the time the summons was served. In December 2022, we filed a notice of appearance in New York County Supreme Court and a demand upon plaintiffs to file and serve a complaint. In March 2023, plaintiffs filed a complaint asserting various causes of action consistent with those set forth in the October 2022 summons, and a demand for monetary damages and other relief in excess of 16 million. In July 2023, we filed a motion to compel arbitration, and in February 2024, the Court granted our motion and stayed the litigation pending arbitration. To the extent APN seeks to pursue claims in an arbitration proceeding, Aspen intends to continue to vigorously defend this matter, including seeking its legal costs. 
 Item 1A.	Ri sk Factors. 
 The ownership of our common stock involves a number of risks and uncertainties. When evaluating the Company and our business before making an investment decision regarding our securities, potential investors should carefully consider the risk factors and uncertainties described in Part 1, Item 1A. Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K. Since the filing of our Form 10-K, there have been no material changes in our risk factors from those disclosed therein, other than as provided below. 
 We are dependent upon our ability to close on and fully draw down on our proposed loan facility from the United States Department of Energy, which may restrict our ability to conduct our business. 
 The receipt by us of the conditional commitment from the DOE in respect of the Loan is not an assurance that definitive financing documents will be negotiated and entered into, that the terms and conditions of the Loan will be consistent with the terms contemplated in the conditional commitment, or that all technical, legal, environmental and financial conditions will be achieved and satisfied. The outcome of the process with the DOE relating to the Loan and our ability to draw and utilize such funds towards the construction of the Statesboro Plant is dependent on whether the DOE determines to proceed with the definitive financing documents and under what conditions. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these decisions and the terms and conditions of the financing documents that may be offered, if any. 
 39 

If and when definitive financing documents in respect of the Loan are entered into, the Loan and our ability to draw upon the Loan are expected to be conditional upon certain condition precedents and to include representations, warranties and covenants of us customary for financings of a similar nature by the U.S. Government or other public lending institutions, including relating to repayment obligations. Our failure to comply with or satisfy any or all of the conditions or to remain in compliance with the covenant regime under the Loan could result in a reduction of the size of the Loan made available to us and/or an event of default under the Loan, which could result in the termination of the Loan and/or cause any amounts outstanding under the Loan to become immediately due and payable, any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 
 We have engaged third-party external manufacturing facilities in China to supplement our supply of our energy industrial products. If such external manufacturing facilities are unable to manufacture and deliver a sufficient quantity of high-quality products on a timely and cost-efficient basis, our net revenue and business operations may be harmed and our reputation may suffer. 
 We have engaged external manufacturing facilities in China for a supplemental supply of our energy industrial products, which we believe will enable us to achieve a target revenue capacity of approximately 650 million in the near-term and prior to the completion and start-up of our planned second manufacturing plant. If our external manufacturing facilities are unable to deliver the required aerogel product on a timely basis, we may experience delays in delivering our finished aerogel product to customers in the energy industrial market. In addition, because our third-party external manufacturing facilities have manufacturing facilities in China, their ability to provide us with adequate supplies of high-quality products on a timely and cost-efficient basis is subject to a number of additional risks and uncertainties, including political, social and economic instability and other factors that could impact the shipment of supplies. In 2022, the indirect parent of the external manufacturing facility we engaged in 2023 was added to the list of Chinese military companies that are operating directly or indirectly in the United States in accordance with Section 1260H of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021. There are certain government contract related restrictions that are or will be imposed on Section 1260H list entities and their controlled affiliates. While we currently have no contracts that would be affected by these restrictions, and the legal impact of being included on the list is relatively limited, our work with a listed entity may have a material adverse effect on our reputation and our business opportunities. If our manufacturers are unable to provide us with adequate supplies of high-quality aerogel products on a timely and cost-efficient basis, our operations could be disrupted and our revenue and business operations may suffer. Moreover, if our third-party external manufacturing facilities cannot consistently produce high-quality products that are free of defects and/or violates applicable worker or product safety rules, regulations or laws, we may experience a loss of customers, which may also reduce our revenues and may harm our reputation and brand. Furthermore, our third-party external manufacturing facilities may become subject to various supply chain disruptions, including for key inputs into their manufacturing process such as methanol. Such disruptions could be the result of pandemics or public health crises, and/or geopolitical disputes and conflicts, any of which could slow or halt the delivery of products to us and increase the price of certain materials due to resulting increases in costs of raw materials and shipping costs. 
 At present, we have engaged one third-party external manufacturing facility in China to produce certain of our Energy Industrial products. Pursuant to our supply contract with this contract manufacturer, they are obligated to deliver products to us as we issue purchase orders on an as-needed basis through the term of the agreement. The contract automatically renews year-to-year unless either party notifies the other of its intention not to renew the contract. While we have agreed to purchase our requirement for certain Energy Industrial products from the contract manufacturer, we have no obligation to purchase any minimum quantity under the contract. In addition, we may terminate the contract at any time and for any or no reason.
