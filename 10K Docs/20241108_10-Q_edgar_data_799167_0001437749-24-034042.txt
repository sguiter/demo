Options totaling and equivalent shares for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and equivalent shares for each of the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023, were outstanding but were not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share because including the options in the denominator would be antidilutive, or decrease the number of weighted-average shares, due to their exercise prices exceeding the average market price of the common shares, or because inclusion of average unrecognized compensation expense in the calculation would cause the options to be antidilutive. 

Unvested performance unit awards totaling equivalent shares for each of the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, and equivalent shares for each of the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023, were considered outstanding but were not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share because inclusion of average unrecognized compensation expense in the calculation would cause the performance units to be antidilutive. 

million which matures in August 2027. The credit agreement amends, restates and continues in its entirety our previous credit agreement, as amended. At September 30, 2024, there was no outstanding principal balance on the facility. As of that date, we had outstanding standby letters of credit to guarantee settlement of self-insurance claims of million and remaining borrowing availability of million. At December 31, 2023, there was also no outstanding principal balance on the facility. As of that date, we had outstanding standby letters of credit of million on the facility. This facility bears interest at a variable rate based on the Term SOFR Rate plus applicable margins. The interest rate for the facility that would apply to outstanding principal balances was at September 30, 2024. 

Our credit agreement effective in August 2022 prohibits us from paying, in any fiscal year, stock redemptions and dividends in excess of million. The current credit agreement also contains restrictive covenants which, among other matters, require us to maintain compliance with cash flow leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios. We were in compliance with all covenants at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 

in the first nine months of 2024 and in the first nine months of 2023 for tires and related services. In addition, we paid million in the first nine months of 2024 and million in the first nine months of 2023 to tire manufacturers for tires that were provided by BBI. BBI received commissions from the tire manufacturers related to these purchases. 

We paid Durand Builders Service, Inc. in the first nine months of 2024 for building repairs and had no transactions with that company in the first nine months of 2023. Larry B. Hagness, one of our directors, is the chief executive officer and the principal stockholder of Durand Builders Service, Inc. 

.0 million, or approximately million shares, of our common stock, which was increased by our Board of Directors to million shares in August 2020 to reflect the three -for- two stock split effected in the form of a stock dividend on August 13, 2020. On May 3, 2022, our Board of Directors approved and we announced an additional increase from current availability in our existing share repurchase program providing for the repurchase of up to million, or approximately million shares of our common stock. The share repurchase program allows purchases on the open market or through private transactions in accordance with Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act. The timing and extent to which we repurchase shares depends on market conditions and other corporate considerations. The repurchase program does not have an expiration date. 

We repurchased and retired million shares of common stock for million in the first quarter of 2022, and shares of common stock for million in the second quarter of 2022. We did not repurchase any shares in the first nine months of 2024, in 2023, or in the third or fourth quarters of 2022. As of September 30, 2024, future repurchases of up to million, or approximately million shares, were available in the share repurchase program.

million and million, respectively. 

million for the remainder of 2024. Commitments for new revenue equipment purchases in 2025 total million. Operating lease obligation expenditures through 2028 total . 

We self-insure, in part, for losses relating to workers compensation, auto liability, general liability, cargo and property damage claims, along with employees health insurance, with varying risk retention levels. We renewed our liability insurance policies effective June 1, 2024 and are responsible for the first million on each auto liability claim with an annual million aggregate for claims between million and million. For the policy years effective June 1, 2022 and June 1, 2023, we are responsible for the first million on each auto liability claim with no aggregates. We continue to be responsible for the first on each workers compensation claim. We maintain insurance coverage for per-incident and total losses in excess of these risk retention levels in amounts we consider adequate based upon historical experience and our ongoing review, and reserve currently for the estimated cost of the uninsured portion of pending claims. 

We are also involved in other legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business. A number of trucking companies, including us, have been subject to lawsuits alleging violations of various federal and state wage and hour laws. A number of these lawsuits have resulted in the payment of substantial settlements or damages by the defendants. 

The outcome of all litigation is difficult to assess or quantify, and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to such lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. The cost to defend litigation may also be significant. Not all claims are covered by our insurance, and there can be no assurance that our coverage limits will be adequate to cover all amounts in dispute. To the extent we experience claims that are uninsured, exceed our coverage limits or cause increases in future premiums, the resulting expense could have a materially adverse effect on our business and operating results. Based on our present knowledge of the facts and, in certain cases, advice of outside counsel, management believes the resolution of open claims and pending litigation, taking into account existing reserves, is not likely to have a materially adverse effect on our consolidated condensed financial statements, however, any future liability claims or adverse developments in existing claims could impact this analysis. 

Our Dedicated segment provides customized transportation solutions tailored to meet individual customers requirements, utilizing temperature-controlled trailers, dry vans and other specialized equipment within the United States. Our agreements with customers range from three to five years and are subject to annual rate reviews. 

Generally, we are paid by the mile for our Truckload and Dedicated services. We also derive Truckload and Dedicated revenue from fuel surcharges, loading and unloading activities, equipment detention and other accessorial services. The main factors that affect our Truckload and Dedicated revenue are the rate per mile we receive from our customers, the percentage of miles for which we are compensated, the number of miles we generate with our equipment and changes in fuel prices. We monitor our revenue production primarily through average Truckload and Dedicated revenue, net of fuel surcharges, per tractor per week. We also analyze our average Truckload and Dedicated revenue, net of fuel surcharges, per total mile, non-revenue miles percentage, the miles per tractor we generate, our fuel surcharge revenue, our accessorial revenue and our other sources of operating revenue. 

Our Intermodal segment transports our customers freight within the United States utilizing our refrigerated containers on railroad flatcars for portions of trips, with the balance of the trips using our tractors or, to a lesser extent, contracted carriers. The main factors that affect our Intermodal revenue are the rate per mile and other charges we receive from our customers. 

Our Brokerage segment develops contractual relationships with and arranges for third-party carriers to transport freight for our customers in temperature-controlled trailers and dry vans within the United States and into and out of Mexico through Marten Transport Logistics, LLC, which was established in 2007 and operates pursuant to brokerage authority granted by the United States Department of Transportation, or DOT. We retain the billing, collection and customer management responsibilities. The main factors that affect our Brokerage revenue are the rate per mile and other charges that we receive from our customers. 

Operating results of our MRTN de Mexico business which offers our customers door-to-door service between the United States and Mexico with our Mexican partner carriers is reported within our Truckload and Brokerage segments. 

Our customer agreements are typically for one-year terms except for our Dedicated agreements which range from three to five years with annual rate reviews. Under FASB ASC 606, the contract date for each individual load within each of our four reporting segments is generally the date that each load is tendered to and accepted by us. For each load transported within each of our four reporting segments, the entire amount of revenue to be recognized is a single performance obligation and our agreements with our customers detail the per-mile charges for line haul and fuel surcharges, along with the rates for loading and unloading, stop offs and drops, equipment detention and other accessorial services, which is the transaction price. There are no discounts that would be a material right or consideration payable to a customer. We are required to recognize revenue and related expenses over time, from load pickup to delivery, for each load within each of our four reporting segments. We base our calculation of the amount of revenue to record in each period for individual loads picking up in one period and delivering in the following period using the number of hours estimated to be incurred within each period applied to each estimated transaction price. Contract assets for this estimated revenue which are classified within prepaid expenses and other within our consolidated condensed balance sheets were million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. We had no impairment losses on contract assets in the first nine months of 2024 or in 2023. We bill our customers for loads after delivery is complete with standard payment terms of 30 days. 

We account for revenue of our Intermodal and Brokerage segments and revenue on freight transported by independent contractors within our Truckload and Dedicated segments on a gross basis because we are the principal service provider controlling the promised service before it is transferred to each customer. We are primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide each specified service to each customer. We bear the primary risk of loss in the event of cargo claims by our customers. We also have complete control and discretion in establishing the price for each specified service. Accordingly, all such revenue billed to customers is classified as operating revenue and all corresponding payments to carriers for transportation services we arrange in connection with brokerage and intermodal activities and to independent contractor providers of revenue equipment are classified as purchased transportation expense within our consolidated condensed statements of operations. 

The following table sets forth for the periods indicated our operating revenue and operating income by segment. We do not prepare separate balance sheets by segment and, as a result, assets are not separately identifiable by segment.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated condensed financial statements and the related notes appearing elsewhere in this report. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including but not limited to those included in our Form 10-K, Part I, Item 1A for the year ended December 31, 2023. We do not assume, and specifically disclaim, any obligation to update any forward-looking statement contained in this report. 

Overview 

We have strategically transitioned from a refrigerated long-haul carrier to a multifaceted business offering a network of time and temperature-sensitive and dry truck-based transportation and distribution capabilities across our five distinct business platforms Truckload, Dedicated, Intermodal, Brokerage and MRTN de Mexico. 

Our Truckload segment provides a combination of regional short-haul and medium-to-long-haul full-load transportation services. We transport food and other consumer packaged goods that require a temperature-controlled or insulated environment, along with dry freight, across the United States and into and out of Mexico and Canada. Our agreements with customers are typically for one year. 

Our Dedicated segment provides customized transportation solutions tailored to meet each individual customer s requirements, utilizing temperature-controlled trailers, dry vans and other specialized equipment within the United States. Our agreements with customers range from three to five years and are subject to annual rate reviews. 

Generally, we are paid by the mile for our Truckload and Dedicated services. We also derive Truckload and Dedicated revenue from fuel surcharges, loading and unloading activities, equipment detention and other accessorial services. The main factors that affect our Truckload and Dedicated revenue are the rate per mile we receive from our customers, the percentage of miles for which we are compensated, the number of miles we generate with our equipment and changes in fuel prices. We monitor our revenue production primarily through average Truckload and Dedicated revenue, net of fuel surcharges, per tractor per week. We also analyze our average Truckload and Dedicated revenue, net of fuel surcharges, per total mile, non-revenue miles percentage, the miles per tractor we generate, our fuel surcharge revenue, our accessorial revenue and our other sources of operating revenue. 

Our Intermodal segment transports our customers freight within the United States utilizing our refrigerated containers on railroad flatcars for portions of trips, with the balance of the trips using our tractors or, to a lesser extent, contracted carriers. The main factors that affect our Intermodal revenue are the rate per mile and other charges we receive from our customers. 

Our Brokerage segment develops contractual relationships with and arranges for third-party carriers to transport freight for our customers in temperature-controlled trailers and dry vans within the United States and into and out of Mexico through Marten Transport Logistics, LLC, which was established in 2007 and operates pursuant to brokerage authority granted by the United States Department of Transportation, or DOT. We retain the billing, collection and customer management responsibilities. The main factors that affect our Brokerage revenue are the rate per mile and other charges that we receive from our customers. 

Operating results of our MRTN de Mexico business which offers our customers door-to-door service between the United States and Mexico with our Mexican partner carriers is reported within our Truckload and Brokerage segments. 

In addition to the factors discussed above, our operating revenue is also affected by, among other things, the United States economy, inventory levels, the level of truck and rail capacity in the transportation market, a contracting driver market, severe weather conditions and specific customer demand. 

11

Our operating revenue decreased 130.0 million, or 15.1 , in the first nine months of 2024 from the first nine months of 2023. Our operating revenue, net of fuel surcharges, decreased 105.5 million, or 14.2 , compared with the first nine months of 2023. Truckload segment revenue, net of fuel surcharges, decreased 5.3 from the first nine months of 2023, primarily due to a decrease in our average revenue per tractor, despite an increase in our average fleet size. Dedicated segment revenue, net of fuel surcharges, decreased 21.4 from the first nine months of 2023, primarily due to decreases in both our average fleet size and our average revenue per tractor. Intermodal segment revenue, net of fuel surcharges, decreased 36.6 from the first nine months of 2023, primarily due to decreases in both our number of loads and our revenue per load. Brokerage segment revenue decreased 10.0 from the first nine months of 2023, primarily due to a decrease in our revenue per load. Fuel surcharge revenue decreased to 96.1 million in the first nine months of 2024 from 120.6 million in the first nine months of 2023. 

Our profitability is impacted by the variable costs of transporting freight for our customers, fixed costs, and expenses containing both fixed and variable components. The variable costs include fuel expense, driver-related expenses, such as wages, benefits, training and recruitment, and independent contractor costs, which are recorded under purchased transportation. Expenses that have both fixed and variable components include maintenance and tire expense and our cost of insurance and claims. These expenses generally vary with the miles we travel, but also have a controllable component based on safety, fleet age, efficiency and other factors. Our main fixed costs relate to the acquisition and subsequent depreciation of long-term assets, such as revenue equipment and operating terminals. We expect our annual cost of tractor and trailer ownership will increase in future periods as a result of higher prices of new equipment, along with any increases in fleet size. Although certain factors affecting our expenses are beyond our control, we monitor them closely and attempt to anticipate changes in these factors in managing our business. For example, fuel prices have significantly fluctuated over the past several years. We manage our exposure to changes in fuel prices primarily through fuel surcharge programs with our customers, as well as through volume fuel purchasing arrangements with national fuel centers and bulk purchases of fuel at our terminals. To help further reduce fuel expense, we have installed and tightly manage the use of auxiliary power units in our tractors to provide climate control and electrical power for our drivers without idling the tractor engine, and also have improved the fuel usage in the temperature-control units on our trailers. For our Intermodal and Brokerage segments, our profitability is impacted by the percentage of revenue which is payable to the providers of the transportation services we arrange. This expense is included within purchased transportation in our consolidated condensed statements of operations. 

Our operating income declined 64.4 to 26.5 million in the first nine months of 2024 from 74.5 million in the first nine months of 2023. Our operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue, or operating ratio, was 96.4 in the first nine months of 2024 and 91.4 in the first nine months of 2023. Operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue, with both amounts net of fuel surcharges, increased to 95.8 in the first nine months of 2024 from 90.0 in the first nine months of 2023. Our net income declined 63.3 to 21.3 million, or 0.26 per diluted share, in the first nine months of 2024 from 58.0 million, or 0.71 per diluted share, in the first nine months of 2023. 

Our business requires substantial ongoing capital investments, particularly for new tractors and trailers. At September 30, 2024, we had 43.0 million of cash and cash equivalents, 766.5 million in stockholders equity and no long-term debt outstanding. In the first nine months of 2024, net cash flows provided by operating activities of 111.0 million were primarily used to purchase new revenue equipment, net of proceeds from dispositions, in the amount of 102.3 million, to pay cash dividends of 14.7 million and to construct and upgrade regional operating facilities in the amount of 3.9 million, resulting in a 10.2 million decrease in cash and cash equivalents. We estimate that capital expenditures, net of proceeds from dispositions, will be approximately 43 million for the remainder of 2024. Quarterly cash dividends of 0.06 per share of common stock were paid in each of the first three quarters of 2024 which totaled 14.7 million. We believe our sources of liquidity are adequate to meet our current and anticipated needs for at least the next twelve months. Based upon anticipated cash flows, existing cash and cash equivalents balances, current borrowing availability and other sources of financing we expect to be available to us, we do not anticipate any significant liquidity constraints in the foreseeable future. 

We continue to invest considerable time and capital resources to actively implement and promote long-term environmentally sustainable solutions that drive reductions in our fuel and electricity consumption and decrease our carbon footprint. These initiatives include (i) reducing idle time for our tractors by installing and tightly managing the use of auxiliary power units, which are powered by solar panels and provide climate control and electrical power for our drivers without idling the tractor engine, (ii) improving the energy efficiency of our newer, more aerodynamic and well-maintained tractor and trailer fleets by optimizing the equipment s specifications, weight and tractor speed, equipping our tractors with automatic transmissions, converting the refrigeration units in our refrigerated trailers to the new, more-efficient CARB refrigeration units along with increasing the insulation in the trailer walls and installing trailer skirts, and using ultra-fuel efficient and wide-based tires, and (iii) upgrading all of our facilities to indoor and outdoor LED lighting along with converting all of our facilities to solar power. Additionally, we are an active participant in the United States Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, SmartWay Transport Partnership, in which freight shippers, carriers, logistics companies and other voluntary stakeholders partner with the EPA to measure, benchmark and improve logistics operations to reduce their environmental footprint.

This Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations includes discussions of operating revenue, net of fuel surcharge revenue; Truckload, Dedicated and Intermodal revenue, net of fuel surcharge revenue; operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue, each net of fuel surcharge revenue; and net fuel expense (fuel and fuel taxes net of fuel surcharge revenue and surcharges passed through to independent contractors, outside drayage carriers and railroads). We provide these additional disclosures because management believes these measures provide a more consistent basis for comparing results of operations from period to period. These financial measures in this report have not been determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Pursuant to Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K, we have included the amounts necessary to reconcile these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures of operating revenue, operating expenses divided by operating revenue, and fuel and fuel taxes.

Our operating revenue decreased 42.2 million, or 15.1 , to 237.4 million in the 2024 period from 279.5 million in the 2023 period. Our operating revenue, net of fuel surcharges, decreased 31.2 million, or 13.0 , to 207.9 million in the 2024 period from 239.1 million in the 2023 period. This decrease in the 2024 period was due to a 20.1 million decrease in Dedicated revenue, net of fuel surcharges, a 5.8 million decrease in Intermodal revenue, net of fuel surcharges, a 3.2 million decrease in Truckload revenue, net of fuel surcharges, and a 2.1 million decrease in Brokerage revenue. Fuel surcharge revenue decreased to 29.5 million in the 2024 period from 40.5 million in the 2023 period. 

14

In addition to the factors discussed below, our profitability across each segment in the 2024 period was impacted by a freight market which has considerably softened from the conditions during the 2023 period. 

Truckload segment revenue decreased 5.8 million, or 5.1 , to 108.4 million in the 2024 period from 114.2 million in the 2023 period. Truckload segment revenue, net of fuel surcharges, decreased 3.2 million, or 3.4 , to 93.3 million in the 2024 period from 96.5 million in the 2023 period, primarily due to a decrease in both our average revenue per tractor and in our average fleet size. The operating ratio increased to 100.1 in the 2024 period from 97.6 in the 2023 period. Impacting the 2024 period operating ratio was the decrease in our average revenue per tractor along with higher depreciation, insurance and claims, maintenance and a lower gain on disposition of revenue equipment, partially offset by lower net fuel expense, all as a percentage of revenue. 

Dedicated segment revenue decreased 26.8 million, or 26.3 , to 75.0 million in the 2024 period from 101.8 million in the 2023 period. Dedicated segment revenue, net of fuel surcharges, decreased 24.2 , primarily due to decreases in both our average fleet size and our average revenue per tractor. The operating ratio increased to 95.9 in the 2024 period from 88.9 in the 2023 period. Impacting the 2024 period operating ratio was the decrease in our average revenue per tractor along with higher company driver compensation, depreciation, insurance and claims and a lower gain on disposition of revenue equipment, as a percentage of revenue. 

Intermodal segment revenue decreased 7.5 million, or 34.2 , to 14.5 million in the 2024 period from 22.0 million in the 2023 period. Intermodal segment revenue, net of fuel surcharges, decreased 32.2 from the 2023 period, primarily due to a decrease in our number of loads. The operating ratio in the 2024 period increased to 110.6 from 104.9 in the 2023 period. Impacting the 2024 period operating ratio was higher purchased transportation and depreciation costs, as a percentage of revenue. 

Brokerage segment revenue decreased 2.1 million, or 5.0 , to 39.4 million in the 2024 period from 41.5 million in the 2023 period, primarily due to a decrease in our revenue per load. The operating ratio in the 2024 period of 92.6 was up from 89.7 in the 2023 period. This increase was primarily due to an increase in amounts payable to carriers for transportation services which we arranged as a percentage of our Brokerage revenue.

Salaries, wages and benefits consist of compensation for our employees, including both driver and non-driver employees, employees health insurance, 401(k) plan contributions and other fringe benefits. These expenses vary depending upon the size of our Truckload, Dedicated and Intermodal tractor fleets, the ratio of company drivers to independent contractors, our efficiency, our experience with employees health insurance claims, changes in health care premiums and other factors. Salaries, wages and benefits expense decreased 9.2 million, or 9.9 , in the 2024 period from the 2023 period. This decrease resulted primarily from lower company driver compensation expense of 8.2 million and a 946,000 decrease in non-driver compensation expense. 

Purchased transportation consists of amounts payable to railroads and carriers for transportation services we arrange in connection with Brokerage and Intermodal operations and to independent contractor providers of revenue equipment. This category will vary depending upon the amount and rates, including fuel surcharges, we pay to third-party railroad and motor carriers, the ratio of company drivers versus independent contractors and the amount of fuel surcharges passed through to independent contractors. Purchased transportation expense decreased 4.8 million in total, or 9.7 , in the 2024 period from the 2023 period. Amounts payable to carriers for transportation services we arranged in our Brokerage segment decreased 823,000 to 33.3 million in the 2024 period from 34.1 million in the 2023 period, primarily due to a decrease in our cost per load. Amounts payable to railroads and drayage carriers for transportation services within our Intermodal segment decreased to 8.0 million in the 2024 period from 11.6 million in the 2023 period, primarily due to a decrease in our number of loads. The portion of purchased transportation expense related to independent contractors within our Truckload and Dedicated segments, including fuel surcharges, decreased 406,000 in the 2024 period. 

16

Fuel and fuel taxes decreased by 12.9 million, or 26.5 , in the 2024 period from the 2023 period. Net fuel expense (fuel and fuel taxes net of fuel surcharge revenue and surcharges passed through to independent contractors, outside drayage carriers and railroads) decreased 3.4 million, or 28.1 , to 8.7 million in the 2024 period from 12.1 million in the 2023 period. Fuel surcharges passed through to independent contractors, outside drayage carriers and railroads decreased to 2.4 million from 3.9 million in the 2023 period. The United States Department of Energy, or DOE, national average cost of fuel decreased to 3.69 per gallon from 4.24 per gallon in the 2023 period. Due to these factors, our net fuel expense decreased to 5.2 of Truckload, Dedicated and Intermodal segment revenue, net of fuel surcharges, in the 2024 period from 6.1 in the 2023 period. We have worked diligently to control fuel usage and costs by improving our volume purchasing arrangements and optimizing our drivers fuel purchases with national fuel centers, focusing on shorter lengths of haul, installing and tightly managing the use of auxiliary power units in our tractors to minimize engine idling and improving fuel usage in the temperature-control units on our trailers. Auxiliary power units, which we have installed in our company-owned tractors, provide climate control and electrical power for our drivers without idling the tractor engine. 

Depreciation relates to owned tractors, trailers, containers, auxiliary power units, communication units, terminal facilities and other assets. The 1.6 million, or 5.6 , decrease in depreciation in the 2024 period was primarily due to a decrease in our average tractor fleet size, partially offset by higher prices of new equipment. We expect our annual cost of tractor and trailer ownership will increase in future periods as a result of continued higher prices of new equipment, which will result in greater depreciation over the useful life. 

Insurance and claims consist of the costs of insurance premiums and accruals we make for claims within our self-insured retention amounts, primarily for personal injury, property damage, physical damage to our equipment, cargo claims and workers compensation claims. These expenses will vary primarily based upon the frequency and severity of our accident experience, our self-insured retention levels and the market for insurance. The 505,000, or 3.8 , increase in insurance and claims in the 2024 period was primarily due to an increase in our insurance premiums, partially offset by a decrease in our self-insured workers compensation claim costs. Our significant self-insured retention exposes us to the possibility of significant fluctuations in claims expense between periods which could materially impact our financial results depending on the frequency, severity and timing of claims. 

Gain on disposition of revenue equipment was 881,000 in the 2024 period, down from 3.0 million in the 2023 period due to decreases in the average gain for our tractor and trailer sales. Future gains or losses on dispositions of revenue equipment will be impacted by the market for used revenue equipment, which is beyond our control. 

Our operating income declined 75.2 to 4.3 million in the 2024 period from 17.2 million in the 2023 period as a result of the foregoing factors. Our operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue, or operating ratio, was 98.2 in the 2024 period and 93.8 in the 2023 period. The operating ratio for our Truckload segment was 100.1 in the 2024 period and 97.6 in the 2023 period, for our Dedicated segment was 95.9 in the 2024 period and 88.9 in the 2023 period, for our Intermodal segment was 110.6 in the 2024 period and 104.9 in the 2023 period, and for our Brokerage segment was 92.6 in the 2024 period and 89.7 in the 2023 period. Operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue, with both amounts net of fuel surcharges, was 97.9 in the 2024 period and 92.8 in the 2023 period. 

Our effective income tax rate increased to 27.7 in the 2024 period from 25.5 in the 2023 period. 

As a result of the factors described above, net income declined 72.4 to 3.8 million, or 0.05 per diluted share, in the 2024 period from 13.6 million, or 0.17 per diluted share, in the 2023 period.

Our operating revenue decreased 130.0 million, or 15.1 , to 733.3 million in the 2024 period from 863.2 million in the 2023 period. Our operating revenue, net of fuel surcharges, decreased 105.5 million, or 14.2 , to 637.1 million in the 2024 period from 742.6 million in the 2023 period. This decrease in the 2024 period was due to a 55.2 million decrease in Dedicated revenue, net of fuel surcharges, a 22.0 million decrease in Intermodal revenue, net of fuel surcharges, a 15.8 million decrease in Truckload revenue, net of fuel surcharges, and a 12.5 million decrease in Brokerage revenue. Fuel surcharge revenue decreased to 96.1 million in the 2024 period from 120.6 million in the 2023 period. 

18

In addition to the factors discussed below, our profitability across each segment in the 2024 period was impacted by a freight market which has considerably softened from the conditions during the 2023 period. 

Truckload segment revenue decreased 19.5 million, or 5.5 , to 332.5 million in the 2024 period from 352.0 million in the 2023 period. Truckload segment revenue, net of fuel surcharges, decreased 15.8 million, or 5.3 , to 284.3 million in the 2024 period from 300.1 million in the 2023 period, primarily due to a decrease in our average revenue per tractor, despite an increase in our average fleet size. The operating ratio increased to 99.6 in the 2024 period from 93.7 in the 2023 period. Impacting the 2024 period operating ratio was the decrease in our average revenue per tractor along with higher company driver compensation, depreciation, maintenance and a lower gain on disposition of revenue equipment, as a percentage of revenue. 

Dedicated segment revenue decreased 70.5 million, or 22.5 , to 242.7 million in the 2024 period from 313.2 million in the 2023 period. Dedicated segment revenue, net of fuel surcharges, decreased 21.4 , primarily due to decreases in both our average fleet size and our average revenue per tractor. The operating ratio increased to 92.2 in the 2024 period from 87.5 in the 2023 period. Impacting the 2024 period operating ratio was the decrease in our average revenue per tractor along with higher company driver compensation, depreciation, purchased transportation and a lower gain on disposition of revenue equipment, as a percentage of revenue. 

Intermodal segment revenue decreased 27.5 million, or 37.6 , to 45.5 million in the 2024 period from 73.0 million in the 2023 period. Intermodal segment revenue, net of fuel surcharges, decreased 36.6 from the 2023 period, primarily due to decreases in both our number of loads and our revenue per load. The operating ratio in the 2024 period increased to 105.3 from 100.6 in the 2023 period. Impacting the 2024 period operating ratio was the decrease in our revenue per load along with higher depreciation, maintenance and purchased transportation costs, as a percentage of revenue. 

Brokerage segment revenue decreased 12.5 million, or 10.0 , to 112.5 million in the 2024 period from 125.0 million in the 2023 period, primarily due to a decrease in our revenue per load. The operating ratio in the 2024 period of 92.5 was up from 89.3 in the 2023 period. This increase was primarily due to an increase in amounts payable to carriers for transportation services which we arranged as a percentage of our Brokerage revenue.

Salaries, wages and benefits expense decreased 28.7 million, or 10.0 , in the 2024 period from the 2023 period. This decrease resulted primarily from both lower company driver compensation expense of 23.2 million and non-driver compensation expense of 2.9 million. 

Purchased transportation expense decreased 22.2 million in total, or 14.6 , in the 2024 period from the 2023 period. Amounts payable to carriers for transportation services we arranged in our Brokerage segment decreased 8.1 million to 94.4 million in the 2024 period from 102.4 million in the 2023 period, primarily due to a decrease in our cost per load. Amounts payable to railroads and drayage carriers for transportation services within our Intermodal segment decreased to 24.0 million in the 2024 period from 37.9 million in the 2023 period, primarily due to decreases in both our number of loads and cost per load. The portion of purchased transportation expense related to independent contractors within our Truckload and Dedicated segments, including fuel surcharges, decreased 197,000 in the 2024 period. 

Fuel and fuel taxes decreased by 23.6 million, or 17.1 , in the 2024 period from the 2023 period. Net fuel expense (fuel and fuel taxes net of fuel surcharge revenue and surcharges passed through to independent contractors, outside drayage carriers and railroads) decreased 3.6 million, or 12.3 , to 25.9 million in the 2024 period from 29.5 million in the 2023 period. Fuel surcharges passed through to independent contractors, outside drayage carriers and railroads decreased to 7.8 million from 12.4 million in the 2023 period. The DOE national average cost of fuel decreased to 3.83 per gallon from 4.20 per gallon in the 2023 period. Despite this price decrease, our net fuel expense increased to 4.9 of Truckload, Dedicated and Intermodal segment revenue, net of fuel surcharges, in the 2024 period from 4.8 in the 2023 period. 

The 3.8 million, or 4.4 , decrease in depreciation in the 2024 period was primarily due to a decrease in our average tractor fleet size, partially offset by higher prices of new equipment. 

The 2.8 million, or 6.9 , decrease in insurance and claims in the 2024 period was primarily due to decreases in our self-insured auto liability and workers compensation claim costs and in our self-insured cost of physical damage claims related to our revenue equipment, partially offset by higher insurance premiums. 

20

Gain on disposition of revenue equipment was 4.6 million in the 2024 period, down from 11.8 million in the 2023 period due to decreases in the average gain for our tractor and trailer sales, despite an increase in the number of units sold. 

Our operating income declined 64.4 to 26.5 million in the 2024 period from 74.5 million in the 2023 period as a result of the foregoing factors. Our operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue, or operating ratio, was 96.4 in the 2024 period and 91.4 in the 2023 period. The operating ratio for our Truckload segment was 99.6 in the 2024 period and 93.7 in the 2023 period, for our Dedicated segment was 92.2 in the 2024 period and 87.5 in the 2023 period, for our Intermodal segment was 105.3 in the 2024 period and 100.6 in the 2023 period, and for our Brokerage segment was 92.5 in the 2024 period and 89.3 in the 2023 period. Operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue, with both amounts net of fuel surcharges, was 95.8 in the 2024 period and 90.0 in the 2023 period. 

Our effective income tax rate increased to 27.2 in the 2024 period from 25.1 in the 2023 period. 

As a result of the factors described above, net income declined 63.3 to 21.3 million, or 0.26 per diluted share, in the 2024 period from 58.0 million, or 0.71 per diluted share, in the 2023 period.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Our business requires substantial ongoing capital investments, particularly for new tractors and trailers. Our primary sources of liquidity are funds provided by operations and our revolving credit facility. A portion of our tractor fleet is provided by independent contractors who own and operate their own equipment. We have no capital expenditure requirements relating to those drivers who own their tractors or obtain financing through third parties. 

The table below reflects our net cash flows provided by operating activities, net cash flows used for investing activities and net cash flows used for financing activities for the periods indicated.

In August 2019, our Board of Directors approved and we announced an increase from current availability in our existing share repurchase program providing for the repurchase of up to 34.0 million, or approximately 1.8 million shares, of our common stock, which was increased by our Board of Directors to 2.7 million shares in August 2020 to reflect the three-for-two stock split effected in the form of a stock dividend on August 13, 2020. On May 3, 2022, our Board of Directors approved and we announced an additional increase from current availability in our existing share repurchase program providing for the repurchase of up to 50.0 million, or approximately 3.1 million shares, of our common stock. The share repurchase program allows purchases on the open market or through private transactions in accordance with Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act. The timing and extent to which we repurchase shares depends on market conditions and other corporate considerations. The repurchase program does not have an expiration date. 

We repurchased and retired 1.3 million shares of common stock for 25.0 million in the first quarter of 2022, and 963,000 shares of common stock for 16.8 million in the second quarter of 2022. We did not repurchase any shares in the first nine months of 2024, in 2023, or in the third or fourth quarters of 2022. As of September 30, 2024, future repurchases of up to 33.2 million, or approximately 2.2 million shares, were available in the share repurchase program. 

In the first nine months of 2024, net cash flows provided by operating activities of 111.0 million were primarily used to purchase new revenue equipment, net of proceeds from dispositions, in the amount of 102.3 million, to pay cash dividends of 14.7 million and to construct and upgrade regional operating facilities in the amount of 3.9 million, resulting in a 10.2 million decrease in cash and cash equivalents. In the first nine months of 2023, net cash flows provided by operating activities of 126.3 million were primarily used to purchase new revenue equipment, net of proceeds from dispositions, in the amount of 116.9 million, to pay cash dividends of 14.6 million and to construct and upgrade regional operating facilities in the amount of 7.6 million, resulting in a 12.5 million decrease in cash and cash equivalents. 

We estimate that capital expenditures, net of proceeds from dispositions, will be approximately 43 million for the remainder of 2024. This amount includes commitments to purchase 36.2 million of new revenue equipment, prior to considering proceeds from dispositions. Commitments for new revenue equipment purchases in 2025 total 73.6 million. Additionally, operating lease obligations total 705,000 through 2028. Quarterly cash dividends of 0.06 per share of common stock were paid in each of the first three quarters of 2024 and 2023 which totaled 14.7 million and 14.6 million, respectively. We currently expect to continue to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future. The payment of cash dividends in the future, and the amount of any such dividends, will depend upon our financial condition, results of operations, cash requirements and certain corporate law requirements, as well as other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. We believe our sources of liquidity are adequate to meet our current and anticipated needs for at least the next twelve months. Based upon anticipated cash flows, existing cash and cash equivalents balances, current borrowing availability and other sources of financing we expect to be available to us, we do not anticipate any significant liquidity constraints in the foreseeable future. 

22

In August 2022, we entered into a credit agreement that provides for an unsecured committed credit facility with an aggregate principal amount of 30.0 million which matures in August 2027. The credit agreement amends, restates and continues in its entirety our previous credit agreement, as amended. At September 30, 2024, there was no outstanding principal balance on the facility. As of that date, we had outstanding standby letters of credit to guarantee settlement of self-insurance claims of 23.1 million and remaining borrowing availability of 6.9 million. At December 31, 2023, there was also no outstanding principal balance on the facility. As of that date, we had outstanding standby letters of credit of 20.7 million on the facility. This facility bears interest at a variable rate based on the Term SOFR Rate plus applicable margins. The interest rate for the facility that would apply to outstanding principal balances was 8.0 at September 30, 2024. 

Our credit agreement effective in August 2022 prohibits us from paying, in any fiscal year, stock redemptions and dividends in excess of 150 million. The current credit agreement also contains restrictive covenants which, among other matters, require us to maintain compliance with cash flow leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios. We were in compliance with all covenants at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 

Other than our obligations for revenue equipment and construction purchases and operating lease expenditures, along with our outstanding standby letters of credit to guarantee settlement of self-insurance claims, which are each mentioned above, we did not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements at September 30, 2024. 

Seasonality 

Our tractor productivity generally decreases during the winter season because inclement weather impedes operations and some shippers reduce their shipments. At the same time, operating expenses generally increase, with harsh weather creating higher accident frequency, increased claims, lower fuel efficiency and more equipment repairs. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses in our consolidated condensed financial statements and related notes. We base our estimates, assumptions and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors believed to be relevant at the time our consolidated condensed financial statements are prepared. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions, and such differences could be material. We believe that the following area involves critical accounting estimates due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment that are necessary to account for its highly uncertain matters, the susceptibility of such matters to change and the potentially material impact these estimates and assumptions could have to our financial condition and operating performance. 

Auto Liability and Workers Compensation Claims Reserves. We self-insure for our portion of claims exposure resulting from auto liability and workers compensation claims. We renewed our liability insurance policies effective June 1, 2024 and are responsible for the first 2.0 million on each auto liability claim with an annual 5.0 million aggregate for claims between 10.0 million and 20.0 million. For the policy years effective June 1, 2022 and June 1, 2023, we are responsible for the first 1.0 million on each auto liability claim with no aggregates. We continue to be responsible for the first 750,000 on each workers compensation claim. Additionally, we have 23.1 million in standby letters of credit to guarantee settlement of claims under agreements with our insurance carriers and regulatory authorities. We maintain insurance coverage for per-incident and total losses in excess of these risk retention levels in amounts we consider adequate based upon historical experience and our ongoing review. However, we could suffer a series of losses within our self-insured retention limits or losses over our policy limits which could negatively affect our financial condition and operating results. Our auto liability and workers compensation claims expense and the related claims reserves will vary primarily based upon the frequency and severity of our accident experience. The total auto liability and workers compensation claims reserves within the insurance and claims accruals in our consolidated condensed balance sheets were 36.4 million and 40.3 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The excess of the insurance and claims accruals over these amounts relates to general liability, cargo and property damage claims, along with reserves for physical damage to our equipment and outstanding employees health insurance claims. 

23

We reserve for the estimated cost of the uninsured portion of pending auto liability and workers compensation claims, including legal costs. These case reserves are periodically evaluated and adjusted based on our continuing evaluation of the nature and severity of each individual claim. Claims development factors are applied to the total amount of the individual claims case reserves by year incurred to estimate future claims development based on our historical experience. Our claims development factors phase down each year over nine years for auto liability claims and eleven years for workers compensation claims from the year incurred. We also ensure that our total recorded auto liability and workers compensation claims reserves are within a range of reasonable amounts determined in an independent actuarial analysis. There were no changes to our methodology used to estimate our ultimate claims losses in the first nine months of 2024 or in 2023. Projection of losses is subject to a high level of estimation uncertainty and actual results could differ from these current estimates. Our estimates require judgments concerning the nature and severity of each claim, historical trends, consultation with actuarial experts, settlement patterns, jury awards, litigation trends and legal interpretations, which are difficult to predict. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. 

We are exposed to a variety of market risks, most importantly the effects of the price and availability of diesel fuel. We require substantial amounts of diesel fuel to operate our tractors and power the temperature-control units on our trailers. The price and availability of diesel fuel can vary, and are subject to political, economic and market factors that are beyond our control. Significant increases in diesel fuel costs could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Based upon our fuel consumption in the first nine months of 2024, a 5 increase in the average cost of diesel fuel would have increased our fuel expense by 5.6 million. 

We have historically been able to pass through a significant portion of long-term increases in diesel fuel prices and related taxes to customers in the form of fuel surcharges. Fuel surcharge programs are widely accepted among our customers, though they can vary somewhat from customer-to-customer. These fuel surcharges, which adjust weekly with the cost of fuel, enable us to recover a substantial portion of the higher cost of fuel as prices increase. These fuel surcharge provisions are not effective in mitigating the fuel price increases related to non-revenue miles or fuel used while the tractor is idling. In addition, we have worked diligently to control fuel usage and costs by improving our volume purchasing arrangements and optimizing our drivers fuel purchases with national fuel centers, focusing on shorter lengths of haul, installing and tightly managing the use of auxiliary power units in our tractors to minimize engine idling and improving fuel usage in our trailers refrigeration units. 

While we do not currently have any outstanding hedging instruments to mitigate this market risk, we may enter into derivatives or other financial instruments to hedge a portion of our fuel costs in the future. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 

As required by Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act ), we have carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this report. This evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or that are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. We intend to periodically evaluate our disclosure controls and procedures as required by the Exchange Act Rules.
