 (2) The Syndicated Credit Facility also includes a multicurrency revolving loan facility up to million. There were revolving loan borrowings outstanding as of September 29, 2024 or December 31, 2023. 
 Syndicated Credit Facility 
 The Company s Syndicated Credit Facility (the Facility provides to the Company U.S. denominated and multicurrency term loans and provides to the Company and certain of its subsidiaries a multicurrency revolving credit facility. Interest on base rate loans is charged at varying rates computed by applying a margin depending on the Company s consolidated net leverage ratio as of the most recently completed fiscal quarter. Interest on SOFR-based and alternative currency loans is charged at varying rates computed by applying a margin over the applicable SOFR rate or alternative currency rate, depending on the Company s consolidated net leverage ratio as of the most recently completed fiscal quarter. In addition, the Company pays a commitment fee per annum (depending on the Company s consolidated net leverage ratio as of the most recently completed fiscal quarter) on the unused portion of the Facility. 
 Fees for commercial letters of credit are computed as a percentage of the amount available to be drawn under such letters of credit. Fees for standby letters of credit are charged at varying rates computed by applying a margin of the amount available to be drawn under such standby letters of credit, depending on the Company s consolidated net leverage ratio as of the most recently completed fiscal quarter. As of September 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had million and million, respectively, in letters of credit outstanding under the Facility. 
 As of both September 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the carrying value of the Company s borrowings under the Facility approximated its fair value as the Facility bears interest rates that are similar to existing market rates. The fair value of borrowings under the Facility is estimated using observable market rates and is considered Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. 
 Under the Facility, the Company is required to make quarterly amortization payments of the term loan borrowings, which are due on the last day of the calendar quarter. 
 The Company is in compliance with all covenants under the Facility and anticipates that it will remain in compliance with the covenants for the foreseeable future.

 operating segments organized by geographical area namely (a) Americas AMS and (b) Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia (collectively EAAA ). The AMS operating segment includes the United States, Canada and Latin America geographic areas. 
 Pursuant to the management approach discussed above, the Company s CODM, our chief executive officer, evaluates performance at the AMS and EAAA operating segment levels and makes operating and resource allocation decisions based on segment adjusted operating income AOI ), which includes allocations of corporate selling, general and administrative SG A expenses and allocations of global support SG A as discussed below. AOI excludes: nora purchase accounting amortization; Cyber Event impact; property casualty loss; and restructuring, asset impairment, severance, and other, net. Intersegment revenues for the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024, were million and million, respectively, and intersegment revenues for the three and nine months ended October 1, 2023, were million and million, respectively. Intersegment revenues are eliminated from net sales presented below since these amounts are not included in the information provided to the CODM. 
 The Company has determined that it has reportable segments AMS and EAAA, as each operating segment meets the quantitative thresholds defined in the accounting guidance. 
 During the first quarter of 2024, the Company implemented a cost center realignment initiative to centralize certain global/shared functions. For the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024, SG A expenses for these global support functions were allocated to AOI for each reportable segment consistent with the allocation methodology used to allocate corporate overhead in prior periods. Prior year AOI amounts below were not recast as there was no material impact to the measure of segment profit for each reportable segment. There were no changes to the composition of the Company s operating or reportable segments.

 million on pre-tax income of million resulting in an effective tax rate of , as compared to a total income tax provision of million on pre-tax income of million resulting in an effective tax rate of during the nine months ended October 1, 2023. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the period ended September 29, 2024, as compared to the period ended October 1, 2023, was primarily due to the release of the valuation allowance on interest expense carryforwards, favorable changes related to the limitation on the deduction of business interest expense under Internal Revenue Code section 163(j), an increase in tax benefits related to share-based compensation, and prior period non-deductible charges related to the substantial liquidation of subsidiaries in Brazil and Russia that occurred during the nine months ended October 1, 2023. These favorable changes were partially offset by a decrease in U.S. tax benefits related to foreign tax credit utilization, foreign derived intangible income, and the repatriation of previously taxed foreign earnings realized during the nine months ended October 1, 2023. 
 On December 20, 2021, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development OECD published Pillar Two Model Rules defining the global minimum tax, which calls for the taxation of large corporations at a minimum rate of . The OECD has since issued administrative guidance providing transition and safe harbor rules around the implementation of the Pillar Two global minimum tax. Many non-U.S. tax jurisdictions have either recently enacted legislation to adopt certain components of the Pillar Two Model Rules beginning in 2024 (including the European Union Member States) with the adoption of additional components in later years or announced their plans to enact legislation in future years. For fiscal year 2024, we expect to meet the Transitional Country-by-Country (CbCR) Safe Harbor rules for most if not all jurisdictions and do not expect these provisions to have a material impact on the Company s financial statements. We will continue to closely monitor ongoing developments and evaluate any potential impact on future periods. 
 In the first nine months of 2024, the Company increased its liability for unrecognized tax benefits by million. As of September 29, 2024, the Company had accrued approximately million for unrecognized tax benefits. In accordance with applicable accounting standards, the Company s deferred tax asset as of September 29, 2024, reflects a reduction of million of these unrecognized tax benefits. 
 Unrecognized tax benefits are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are adjusted for changing facts and circumstances, including the progress of tax audits and the closing of statutes of limitations. While it is reasonably possible that some of the unrecognized tax benefits will be recognized within the next 12 months, the Company does not expect the recognition of such amounts will have a material impact on the Company s financial results.

 Executive Overview 
 During the quarter ended September 29, 2024, we had consolidated net sales of 344.3 million, up 10.7 compared to 311.0 million in the third quarter last year, primarily due to higher customer demand particularly in the retail and education market segments. Consolidated operating income was 42.2 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 31.0 million in the third quarter last year, primarily due to higher sales and higher gross profit margin as a result of higher sales volume, raw material cost deflation, and favorable fixed cost absorption. Consolidated net income for the quarter ended September 29, 2024, was 28.4 million or 0.48 per diluted share, compared to 9.9 million or 0.17 per diluted share in the third quarter last year. 
 During the first nine months of 2024, we had consolidated net sales of 980.6 million, up 4.7 compared to 936.4 million in the first nine months of last year, primarily due to higher customer demand particularly in the education, retail, and residential living market segments partially offset by decreases in the healthcare and hospitality market segments. Consolidated operating income was 104.8 million for the first nine months of 2024, compared to 69.4 million in the same period last year, primarily due to higher sales and higher gross profit margin as a result of higher average sales prices and raw material cost deflation. Consolidated net income for the nine months ended September 29, 2024, was 65.2 million or 1.11 per diluted share, compared to 25.0 million or 0.43 per diluted share in the same period last year. 
 Cybersecurity Event 
 As previously disclosed in our current report on Form 8-K filed with the Commission on November 23, 2022, we discovered a cybersecurity attack on November 20, 2022, perpetrated by unauthorized third parties, affecting our IT systems. The investigation of the Cyber Event was completed in fiscal year 2023. We have cyber risk insurance and have recovered 0.5 million of our costs and expenses during the nine months ended September 29, 2024. We anticipate that additional costs, expenses or losses related to the Cyber Event will ultimately be recovered by insurance. 
 Impact of Macroeconomic Trends 
 Recent disruptions in economic markets due to inflation, high interest rates, the Russia-Ukraine war and the Israel-Hamas war, a fairly stabilized but still challenging supply chain environment, slow market conditions in certain parts of the globe, and significant financial pressures in the commercial office market globally, all pose challenges which may adversely affect our future performance . To mitigate these impacts, we plan to continue evaluating our cost structure and global manufacturing footprint to identify and activate opportunities to decrease costs and optimize our global cost structure.

 For the quarter ended September 29, 2024, gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, was 37.1 compared with 35.5 in the same period last year. The increase in gross profit percentage was primarily due to lower costs (approximately 2 driven by raw material cost deflation and lower fixed costs per unit due to higher volume. 
 For the nine months ended September 29, 2024, gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, was 36.8 compared with 34.0 in the same period last year. The increase in gross profit percentage was primarily due to raw material cost deflation (approximately 2 and higher average sales prices (approximately 1 ). 
 Consolidated Selling, General and Administrative SG A Expenses 
 For the quarter ended September 29, 2024, consolidated SG A expenses increased 6.2 million (7.8 versus the comparable period in 2023. Currency fluctuations had no material impact on consolidated SG A expenses in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period last year.

 See Note 14 entitled Assets Disposed of Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information. 
 Other Expense, net 
 During the nine months ended September 29, 2024, the Company received insurance proceeds of approximately 2.4 million related to a property casualty loss that occurred in fiscal year 2023. The insurance proceeds were recognized in other expense, net, in the consolidated condensed statements of operations. During the quarter ended October 1, 2023, the Company substantially liquidated its foreign subsidiaries in Brazil and Russia and 6.2 million of cumulative translation adjustments were reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss and recognized in other expense, net, in the consolidated condensed statements of operations. 
 Interest Expense 
 During the quarter ended September 29, 2024, interest expense was 5.7 million, a decrease of 2.4 million from the comparable period in 2023, primarily due to lower outstanding term loan borrowings under the Facility. For the nine months ended September 29, 2024, interest expense was 18.3 million, a decrease of 6.7 million from the comparable period in 2023, primarily due to lower outstanding term loan borrowings as discussed above. 
 Provision for Income Taxes 
 The effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024, was 21.2 and 24.4 , respectively, compared to 38.7 and 32.0 for the same periods in 2023. The effective tax rate for 2024 was positively impacted by the release of a valuation allowance on interest expense carryforwards, utilization of previously unrealized interest expense carryforwards and an increase in tax benefits related to share-based compensation, partially offset by a decrease in U.S. tax benefits related to foreign tax credit utilization, foreign derived intangible income, and the repatriation of previously taxed foreign earnings. The effective tax rate for 2023 was negatively impacted by the limitation on the deductibility of interest expense under Internal Revenue Code section 163(j) and non-deductible charges related to the substantial liquidation of subsidiaries in Brazil and Russia. 
 Segment Operating Results 
 During the first quarter of 2024, the Company implemented a cost center realignment initiative to centralize certain global/shared functions. For the three and nine months ended September 29, 2024, SG A expenses for these global support functions were allocated to adjusted operating income AOI for each reportable segment consistent with the allocation methodology used to allocate corporate overhead in prior periods. Prior year AOI amounts below were not recast as there was no material impact to the measure of segment profit for each reportable segment. There were no changes to the composition of the Company s operating or reportable segments.

 Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 General 
 At September 29, 2024, the Company had 115.6 million in cash. At that date, the Company had 41.2 million in term loan borrowings, no revolving loan borrowings, and 0.7 million in letters of credit outstanding under our Facility, and we had 300.0 million of Senior Notes outstanding. As of September 29, 2024, we had additional borrowing capacity of 299.3 million under the Facility. We anticipate that our liquidity is sufficient to meet our obligations for the next 12 months, and we expect to generate sufficient cash to meet our long-term obligations. 
 The Senior Notes are unsecured and are guaranteed, jointly and severally, by each of the Company s material domestic subsidiaries, all of which also guarantee the obligations of the Company under its Facility. The Company s foreign subsidiaries and certain non-material domestic subsidiaries are considered non-guarantors. Net sales for the non-guarantor subsidiaries were approximately 149 million and 427 million for the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 29, 2024, respectively, and net sales for the non-guarantor subsidiaries were approximately 148 million and 431 million for the three-month and nine-month periods ended October 1, 2023, respectively. Total indebtedness of the non-guarantor subsidiaries was approximately 130 million and 133 million as of September 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Balance Sheet 
 Accounts receivable, net, were 173.9 million at September 29, 2024, compared to 163.4 million at December 31, 2023. The increase of 10.5 million was primarily due to the impact of higher net sales as a result of increased customer demand in 2024. 
 Inventories, net, were 283.1 million at September 29, 2024, compared to 279.1 million at December 31, 2023. The increase of 4.0 million was primarily due to finished goods inventory build attributable to higher expected customer demand in the remainder of 2024, partially offset by lower raw material costs. 
 Analysis of Cash Flows 
 The following table presents a summary of cash flows for the nine-month periods ended September 29, 2024 and October 1, 2023, respectively: 
 Nine Months Ended September 29, 2024 October 1, 2023 (in thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities 110,387 114,217 Investing activities (16,694) (10,645) Financing activities (89,545) (80,847) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 955 (656) Net change in cash and cash equivalents 5,103 22,069 Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period 110,498 97,564 Cash and cash equivalents at end of period 115,601 119,633 
 Cash provided by operating activities was 110.4 million for the nine months ended September 29, 2024, which represents a decrease of 3.8 million from the prior year comparable period. Higher sales during the first nine months of 2024 contributed to higher accounts receivable balances resulting in a use of cash for the current period. The prior year comparable period includes a source of cash from accounts receivable collections compared with the first nine months of 2024, primarily attributable to delays in customer billings from the Cyber Event, in which those delayed billings were collected in the first quarter of 2023. Additionally, the increase in inventories during the first nine months of 2024, as described above, resulted in a greater use of cash compared with the same period in the prior year. 
 
 35 

Table of Contents 

 Cash used in investing activities was 16.7 million for the nine months ended September 29, 2024, which represents an increase of 6.0 million from the prior year comparable period. The increase was attributable to higher capital expenditures partially offset by cash proceeds received during the first nine months of 2024 from the sale of manufacturing equipment and insurance proceeds for property casualty losses. The first nine months of 2023 include cash proceeds of approximately 6.6 million from the sale of the Company s Thailand manufacturing facility. 
 Cash used in financing activities was 89.5 million for the nine months ended September 29, 2024, which represents an increase of 8.7 million from the prior year comparable period. The increase was primarily attributable to higher prepayments of term loan borrowings during the first nine months of 2024 compared to the prior year period. 
 
 Outlook 
 Cash flows from operations, cash and cash equivalents, and other sources of liquidity are expected to be available and sufficient to meet foreseeable cash requirements. However, the Company s cash flows from operations can be affected by numerous factors including raw material availability and cost, and demand for our products. 
 Backlog 
 As of October 20, 2024, the consolidated backlog of unshipped orders was approximately 242.3 million. As disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, backlog was approximately 195.5 million as of February 4, 2024. Disruptions in supply and distribution chains have resulted in delays of construction projects and flooring installations in many regions worldwide, which have also caused, and may continue to cause, fluctuations in our backlog.

 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 The discussion below in this Item 3 is based upon the more detailed discussions of our market risk and related matters included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, under Part II, Item 7A of that Form 10-K. The discussion here focuses on the nine months ended September 29, 2024, and any material changes from (or other important intervening developments since the time of) the information discussed in that Form 10-K. This discussion should be read in conjunction with that Form 10-K for more detailed and background information. 
 Sensitivity Analysis 
 For purposes of specific risk analysis, we use sensitivity analysis to measure the impact that market risk may have on the fair values of our market sensitive instruments. To perform sensitivity analysis, we assess the risk of loss in fair values associated with the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates on market sensitive instruments. 
 Because the debt outstanding under our Facility has variable interest rates based on an underlying prime lending rate, SOFR, or other benchmark rate, we do not believe changes in interest rates would have any significant impact on the fair value of that debt instrument. Changes in the underlying prime lending rate, SOFR, or other benchmark rate would, however, impact the amount of our interest expense. For a discussion of these hypothetical impacts on our interest expense, please see the discussion in Part II, Item 7A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 As of September 29, 2024, based on a hypothetical immediate 100 basis point increase in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, the fair value of our fixed rate long-term debt would be impacted by a net decrease of 10.6 million. Conversely, a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates would result in a net increase in the fair value of our fixed rate long-term debt of 7.0 million. 
 As of September 29, 2024, a 10 decrease or increase in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar, with all other variables held constant, would result in a respective decrease or increase in the net fair value of our financial instruments of 12.9 million. As the impact of offsetting changes in the fair market value of our net foreign investments is not included in the sensitivity model, these results are not indicative of our actual exposure to foreign currency exchange risk.

 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Act ), pursuant to Rule 13a-14(c) under the Act. 
 No system of controls, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the system of controls are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that the system of controls has operated effectively in all cases. Our disclosure controls and procedures however are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the objectives of disclosure controls and procedures are met. 
 Based on the evaluation, our President and Chief Executive Officer and our Vice President and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report to provide reasonable assurance that the objectives of disclosure controls and procedures are met. 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
