Forward-Looking Statements 
 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). Statements included in this quarterly report that are not historical facts (including any statements concerning plans and objectives of management for future operations or economic performance, or assumptions or forecasts related thereto), including, without limitation, the information set forth in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, are forward-looking statements. These statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology including "forecast," "may," "believe," "will," "expect," "anticipate," "estimate," "continue," or other similar words. These statements discuss future expectations, contain projections of results of operations or of financial condition or state other "forward-looking" information. We and our representatives may from time to time make other oral or written statements that are also forward-looking statements. 
 
 These forward-looking statements are made based upon management s current plans, expectations, estimates, assumptions and beliefs concerning future events impacting us and therefore involve a number of risks and uncertainties. We caution that forward-looking statements are not guarantees and that actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. 
 
 Because these forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements for a number of important reasons, including those discussed under "Item 1A. Risk Factors" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on February 21, 2024, and as may be updated and supplemented from time to time in our future Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K.

 Revenue is measured based on a consideration specified in a contract with a customer and excludes amounts collected on behalf of third parties where the Partnership is acting as an agent. The Partnership recognizes revenue when the Partnership satisfies a performance obligation, which typically occurs when the Partnership transfers control over a product to a customer or as the Partnership delivers a service. 
 
 The following is a description of the principal activities - separated by reportable segments - from which the Partnership generates revenue. 
 
 Terminalling and Storage Segment 
 
 Revenue is recognized for storage contracts based on the contracted monthly tank fixed fee. For throughput contracts, revenue is recognized based on the volume moved through the Partnership s terminals at the contracted rate.

 common limited partner units, representing a partnership interest, and a general partner interest. Martin Resource Management Corporation, through subsidiaries, owned of the Partnership's common limited partner units representing approximately of the Partnership's outstanding common limited partner units. Martin Midstream GP LLC ("MMGP"), the Partnership's general partner, owns the general partnership interest. 
 
 The partnership agreement of the Partnership (the "Partnership Agreement") contains specific provisions for the allocation of net income and losses to each of the partners for purposes of maintaining their respective partner capital accounts. 
 
 Impact on Partners' Capital (Deficit) Related to Transactions Between Entities Under Common Control 
 
 Under ASC 805, assets and liabilities transferred between entities under common control are accounted for at the historical cost of those entities' ultimate parent, in a manner similar to a pooling of interests. Any difference in the amount paid by the transferee versus the historical cost of the assets transferred is recorded as an adjustment to equity (contribution or distribution) by the transferee. This is in contrast with a business combination between unrelated parties, where assets and liabilities are recorded at their fair values at the acquisition date, with any excess of amounts paid over the fair value representing goodwill. From time to time, the most recent being in 2019, the Partnership has entered into common control acquisitions from Martin Resource Management Corporation. The consideration transferred totaling exceeds the historical cost of the net assets received. This excess of the purchase price over the historical cost of the net assets received has resulted in cumulative deemed distributions of reflected as reductions to Partners' capital. 
 
 Distributions of Available Cash 
 
 The Partnership distributes all of its available cash (as defined in the Partnership Agreement) within days after the end of each quarter to unitholders of record and to the general partner. Available cash is generally defined as all cash and cash equivalents of the Partnership on hand at the end of each quarter less the amount of cash reserves its general partner determines in its reasonable discretion is necessary or appropriate to: (i) provide for the proper conduct of the Partnership s business; (ii) comply with applicable law, any debt instruments or other agreements; or (iii) provide funds for distributions to unitholders and the general partner for any one or more of the next four quarters, plus all cash on the date of determination of available cash for the quarter resulting from working capital borrowings made after the end of the quarter. 
 
 Net Income per Unit 
 
 The Partnership follows the provisions of the FASB ASC 260-10 related to earnings per share, which addresses the application of the two-class method in determining income per unit for master limited partnerships having multiple classes of securities that may participate in partnership distributions accounted for as equity distributions. Undistributed earnings are allocated to the general partner and limited partners utilizing the contractual terms of the Partnership Agreement. When current period distributions are in excess of earnings, the excess distributions for the period are to be allocated to the general partner and limited partners based on their respective sharing of income and losses specified in the Partnership Agreement. Additionally, as required under FASB ASC 260-10-45-61A, unvested share-based payments that entitle employees to receive non-forfeitable distributions are considered participating securities, as defined in FASB ASC 260-10-20, for earnings per unit calculations. 
 
 For purposes of computing diluted net income per unit, the Partnership uses the more dilutive of the two-class and if-converted methods. Under the if-converted method, the weighted-average number of subordinated units outstanding for the period is added to the weighted-average number of common units outstanding for purposes of computing basic net income per unit and the resulting amount is compared to the diluted net income per unit computed using the two-class method.

All common unit equivalents were antidilutive for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and the three months ended September 30, 2024 because the limited partners were allocated a net loss in these periods.

trading days immediately preceding the grant date of the award. 
 
 Generally, vesting of an award is subject to a participant remaining continuously employed with the Partnership through the vesting date. However, if prior to the vesting date (i) a participant is terminated without cause (as defined in the award agreement) or terminates employment after the participant has attained both the age of 65 and ten years of employment retirement-eligible ), a prorated portion of the award will vest and be paid in cash no later than the 30 th day following such termination date (subject to a six-month delay in payment for certain retirement-eligible participants) or (ii) there is a change in control of the Partnership (as defined in the Plan), the award will vest in full and be paid in cash no later than the 30 th day following the date of the change of control; provided, that the participant has been in continuous employment through the termination or change in control date, as applicable. 
 
 On July 21, 2021, phantom units and phantom unit appreciation rights were granted to employees of the general partner and its affiliates who perform services for the Partnership. On April 20, 2022, the board of directors of the general partner of the Partnership and the Compensation Committee approved the First Amendment to the Plan, effective as of the same date, which amendment increased the total number of phantom units available for grant under the Plan from units to units. On April 20, 2022, phantom units and phantom unit appreciation rights were granted to employees of the general partner and its affiliates who perform services for the Partnership. On July 19, 2023, phantom units and phantom unit appreciation rights were granted to employees of the general partner and its affiliates who perform services for the Partnership. 
 
 Phantom unit awards are recorded in operating expense and selling, general and administrative expense based on the fair value of the vested portion of the awards on the balance sheet date. The fair value of these awards is updated at each balance sheet date and changes in the fair value of the vested portions of the awards are recorded as increases or decreases to compensation expense within operating expense and selling, general and administrative expense in the Consolidated and Condensed Statements of Operations. All of the Partnership's outstanding phantom unit awards at September 30, 2024, met the criteria to be treated under liability classification in accordance with ASC 718, given that these awards will settle in cash on the vesting date. 
 
 Compensation expense for the phantom awards is based on the fair value of the units as of the balance sheet date as further discussed below, and such costs are recognized ratably over the service period of the awards. As the fair value of liability awards is required to be re-measured each period end, stock compensation expense amounts recognized in future

of unrecognized compensation costs related to non-vested phantom unit awards. These costs are expected to be recognized over a remaining life of years. 
 
 The fair value of the phantom unit awards was estimated using a Monte Carlo valuation model as of the balance sheet date. The Monte Carlo valuation model is based on random projections of stock price paths and must be repeated numerous times to achieve a probabilistic assessment. Expected volatility was calculated based on the historical volatility of the Partnership s common units as well as set of peer companies. 
 
 Restricted Unit Plan 
 
 On May 26, 2017, the unitholders of the Partnership approved the Martin Midstream Partners L.P. 2017 Restricted Unit Plan (the "2017 LTIP"). The 2017 LTIP currently permits the grant of awards covering an aggregate of common units, all of which can be awarded in the form of restricted units. The 2017 LTIP is administered by the Compensation Committee. 
 
 A restricted unit is a unit that is granted to grantees with certain vesting restrictions, which may be time-based and/or performance-based. Once these restrictions lapse, the grantee is entitled to full ownership of the unit without restrictions. The Compensation Committee may determine to make grants under the 2017 LTIP containing such terms as the Compensation Committee shall determine under the 2017 LTIP. With respect to time-based restricted units ("TBRUs"), the Compensation Committee will determine the time period over which restricted units granted to employees and directors will vest. The Compensation Committee may also award a percentage of restricted units with vesting requirements based upon the achievement of specified pre-established performance targets ("Performance Based Restricted Units" or "PBRUs"). The performance targets may include, but are not limited to, the following: revenue and income measures, cash flow measures, net income before interest expense and income tax expense ("EBIT"), net income before interest expense, income tax expense, and depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA"), distribution coverage metrics, expense measures, liquidity measures, market measures, corporate sustainability metrics, and other measures related to acquisitions, dispositions, operational objectives and succession planning objectives.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 You should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the consolidated and condensed financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this quarterly report. 

Overview 
 
 We are a publicly traded limited partnership with a diverse set of operations focused primarily in the Gulf Coast region of the U.S. Our four primary business lines include: 
 
 Terminalling, processing, and storage services for petroleum products and by-products; 
 
 Land and marine transportation services for petroleum products and by-products, chemicals, and specialty products; 
 
 Sulfur and sulfur-based products processing, manufacturing, marketing, and distribution; and 
 
 Marketing, distribution, and transportation services for natural gas liquids and blending and packaging services for specialty lubricants and grease. 
 
 The petroleum products and by-products we collect, transport, store and market are produced primarily by major and independent oil and gas companies who often turn to third parties, such as us, for the transportation and disposition of these products. In addition to these major and independent oil and gas companies, our primary customers include independent refiners, large chemical companies, and other wholesale purchasers of these products. We operate primarily in the Gulf Coast region of the U.S. This region is a major hub for petroleum refining, natural gas gathering and processing, and support services for the exploration and production industry. 
 
 We were formed in 2002 by Martin Resource Management Corporation, a privately-held company whose initial predecessor was incorporated in 1951 as a supplier of products and services to drilling rig contractors. Since then, Martin Resource Management Corporation has expanded its operations through acquisitions and internal expansion initiatives as its management identified and capitalized on the needs of producers and purchasers of petroleum products and by-products and other bulk liquids. Martin Resource Management Corporation is an important supplier and customer of ours. As of September 30, 2024, Martin Resource Management Corporation owned 15.7 of our total outstanding common limited partner units and 100 of MMGP Holdings, LLC ("Holdings"), which is the sole member of Martin Midstream GP LLC ("MMGP"), our general partner. MMGP owns a 2.0 general partner interest in us. 
 
 We entered into the Omnibus Agreement that governs, among other things, potential competition and indemnification obligations among the parties to the agreement, related party transactions, the provision of general administration and support services by Martin Resource Management Corporation and our use of certain of Martin Resource Management Corporation s trade names and trademarks. Under the terms of the Omnibus Agreement, the employees of Martin Resource Management Corporation are responsible for conducting our business and operating our assets. 
 
 Martin Resource Management Corporation has operated our business since our inception in 2002. Martin Resource Management Corporation began operating our NGL business in the 1950s and our sulfur business in the 1960s. It began our land transportation business in the early 1980s and our marine transportation business in the late 1980s. It entered into our fertilizer and terminalling and storage businesses in the early 1990s. 

Significant Recent Developments

 Electronic Level Sulfuric Acid Joint Venture. On October 19, 2022, Martin ELSA Investment LLC, our affiliate, entered into definitive agreements with Samsung C T America, Inc. and Dongjin USA, Inc., an affiliate of Dongjin Semichem Co., Ltd., to form DSM Semichem LLC DSM ). DSM will produce and distribute electronic level sulfuric acid ELSA ). By leveraging our existing assets located in Plainview, Texas and installing additional facilities (the ELSA Facility as required, DSM will produce ELSA that meets the strict quality standards required by the recent advances in semiconductor manufacturing. In addition to owning a 10 non-controlling interest in DSM, we will be the exclusive provider of feedstock to the ELSA Facility. We, through our affiliate MTI, will also provide land transportation services for the ELSA produced by DSM. We expect to fund approximately 27.0 million in aggregate capital expenditures in connection with this joint venture. On April 1, 2024, we contributed 6.5 million to DSM, which represents the cash contribution required pursuant to DSM's limited liability agreement for our 10 non-controlling interest. As of September 30, 2024, we have funded approximately 26.4 million toward ELSA related project costs.

 Approval and Review of Related Party Transactions 
 
 If we contemplate entering into a transaction, other than a routine or in the ordinary course of business transaction, in which a related person will have a direct or indirect material interest, the proposed transaction is submitted for consideration to the board of directors of our general partner or to our management, as appropriate. If the board of directors of our general partner is involved in the approval process, it determines whether to refer the matter to the Conflicts Committee of our general partner's board of directors, as constituted under our limited partnership agreement. If a matter is referred to the Conflicts Committee, the Conflicts Committee obtains information regarding the proposed transaction from management and determines whether to engage independent legal counsel or an independent financial advisor to advise the members of the committee regarding the transaction. If the Conflicts Committee retains such counsel or financial advisor, it considers such advice and, in the case of a financial advisor, such advisor s opinion as to whether the transaction is fair and reasonable to us and to our unitholders.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 To assist management in assessing our business, we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: earnings before interest, taxes, and depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA"), adjusted EBITDA (as defined below), Credit Adjusted EBITDA (as defined below), distributable cash flow available to common unitholders Distributable Cash Flow ), and free cash flow after growth capital expenditures and principal payments under finance lease obligations ("Adjusted Free Cash Flow"). Our management uses a variety of financial and operational measurements other than our financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP to analyze our performance. 
 
 Certain items excluded from EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are significant components in understanding and assessing an entity's financial performance, such as cost of capital and historical costs of depreciable assets. 
 
 EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Credit Adjusted EBITDA . We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA before unit-based compensation expenses, gains and losses on the disposition of property, plant and equipment, impairment and other similar non-cash adjustments. Adjusted EBITDA is used as a supplemental performance and liquidity measure by our management and by external users of our financial statements, such as investors, commercial banks, research analysts, and others, to assess: 
 
 the financial performance of our assets without regard to financing methods, capital structure, or historical cost basis; 
 the ability of our assets to generate cash sufficient to pay interest costs, support our indebtedness, and make cash distributions to our unitholders; and 
 our operating performance and return on capital as compared to those of other companies in the midstream energy sector, without regard to financing methods or capital structure. 
 
 We define Credit Adjusted EBITDA as Adjusted EBITDA excluding net income (loss) and the lower of cost or net realizable value and other non-cash adjustments associated with the butane optimization business, which we exited during the second quarter of 2023. Credit Adjusted EBITDA is used as a supplemental performance and liquidity measure by our management and by external users of our financial statements, such as investors, commercial banks, research analysts, and others to provide additional information regarding the calculation of, and compliance with, certain financial covenants in the Partnership s Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. 
 
 The GAAP measures most directly comparable to adjusted EBITDA and Credit Adjusted EBITDA are net income (loss) and net cash provided by (used in) operating activities. Adjusted EBITDA and Credit Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income (loss), operating income (loss), net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA and Credit Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies because other companies may not calculate Adjusted EBITDA in the same manner. 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA does not include interest expense, income tax expense, and depreciation and amortization. Because we have borrowed money to finance our operations, interest expense is a necessary element of our costs and our ability to generate cash available for distribution. Because we have capital assets, depreciation and amortization are also necessary elements of our costs. Therefore, any measures that exclude these elements have material limitations. To compensate for these limitations, we believe that it is important to consider net income (loss) and net cash provided by (used in) operating activities as determined under GAAP, as well as adjusted EBITDA, to evaluate our overall performance. 
 
 Distributable Cash Flow. We define Distributable Cash Flow as Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities less cash received (plus cash paid) for closed commodity derivative positions included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss), plus changes in operating assets and liabilities which (provided) used cash, less maintenance capital expenditures and plant turnaround costs. Distributable Cash Flow is a significant performance measure used by our management and by external users of our financial statements, such as investors, commercial banks and research analysts, to compare basic cash flows generated by us to the cash distributions we expect to pay unitholders. Distributable Cash Flow is also an important financial measure for our unitholders since it serves as an indicator of our success in providing a cash return on investment. Specifically, this financial measure indicates to investors whether or not we are generating cash flow at a level that can sustain or support an increase in our quarterly distribution rates. Distributable Cash Flow is also a quantitative standard used throughout the investment community with respect to publicly-traded partnerships because the value of a unit of such an entity is generally determined by the unit's yield, which in turn is based on the amount of cash distributions the entity pays to a unitholder. 
 
 Adjusted Free Cash Flow. We define Adjusted Free Cash Flow as Distributable Cash Flow less growth capital expenditures and principal payments under finance lease obligations. Adjusted Free Cash Flow is a significant performance 
 34 

measure used by our management and by external users of our financial statements and represents how much cash flow a business generates during a specified time period after accounting for all capital expenditures, including expenditures for growth and maintenance capital projects. We believe that Adjusted Free Cash Flow is important to investors, lenders, commercial banks and research analysts since it reflects the amount of cash available for reducing debt, investing in additional capital projects, paying distributions, and similar matters. Our calculation of Adjusted Free Cash Flow may or may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities. 
 
 The GAAP measure most directly comparable to Distributable Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow is Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities. Distributable Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow should not be considered alternatives to, or more meaningful than, Net Income (Loss), Operating Income (Loss), Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities, or any other measure of liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. Distributable Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow have important limitations because they exclude some items that affect Net Income (Loss), Operating Income (Loss), and Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities. Distributable Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies because other companies may not calculate these non-GAAP metrics in the same manner. To compensate for these limitations, we believe that it is important to consider Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities determined under GAAP, as well as Distributable Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow, to evaluate our overall liquidity. 

The following tables reconcile the non-GAAP financial measurements used by management to our most directly comparable GAAP measures for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, which represents EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, Credit Adjusted EBITDA, distributable cash flow, and adjusted free cash flow:

 Cost of products sold. Cost of products sold decreased 13.8 million. A 15 decrease in sales volumes resulted in a decrease in cost of products sold of 10.8 million. A 4 decrease in product cost impacted cost of products sold by 3.0 million, resulting from reduced commodity prices. Margin per ton increased 8.97, or 20 . 
 
 Operating expenses. Operating expenses decreased 0.8 million due to reductions of 0.4 million in utilities expense resulting from lower natural gas prices, 0.4 million in marine pass-through expenses (primarily fuel), 0.2 million in outside services, and 0.1 million in marine operating expense. These reductions were offset by an increase of 0.2 million in repairs and maintenance and 0.1 million in employment expenses. 
 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to higher employee-related expenses. 
 
 Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization increased due to the amortization of higher turnaround spend in 2023 as compared to 2022.

 Indirect selling, general and administrative expenses decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, as a result of a decrease in overhead expenses allocated from Martin Resource Management Corporation. Indirect selling, general and administrative expenses decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, as a result of decreases in overhead expenses allocated from Martin Resource Management Corporation of 0.4 million and employee-related expenses of 0.1 million. 
 
 Martin Resource Management Corporation allocates to us a portion of its indirect selling, general and administrative expenses for services such as accounting, legal, treasury, clerical, billing, information technology, administration of insurance, engineering, general office expense and employee benefit plans and other general corporate overhead functions we share with Martin Resource Management Corporation retained businesses. This allocation is based on the percentage of time spent by Martin Resource Management Corporation personnel that provide such centralized services. GAAP also permits other methods for allocation of these expenses, such as basing the allocation on the percentage of revenues contributed by a segment. The allocation of these expenses between Martin Resource Management Corporation and us is subject to a number of judgments and estimates, regardless of the method used. We can provide no assurances that our method of allocation, in the past or in the future, is or will 
 46 

be the most accurate or appropriate method of allocation for these expenses. Other methods could result in a higher allocation of selling, general and administrative expenses to us, which would reduce our net income. 
 
 Under the Omnibus Agreement, we are required to reimburse Martin Resource Management Corporation for indirect general and administrative and corporate overhead expenses. The Conflicts Committee of our general partner approved the following reimbursement amounts during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 General 
 
 Our primary sources of liquidity to meet operating expenses, service our indebtedness, fund capital expenditures and pay distributions to our unitholders have historically been cash flows generated by our operations, borrowings under our credit facility and access to debt and equity capital markets, both public and private. Set forth below is a description of our cash flows for the periods indicated. 

Cash Flows - Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 The following table details the cash flow changes between the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, Variance Percent Change 2024 2023 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities 6,184 106,065 (99,881) (94) Investing activities (49,642) (22,478) (27,164) (121) Financing activities 43,460 (83,578) 127,038 152 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents 2 9 (7) (78) 
 
 Net cash provided by operating activities. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, includes an increase in operating results and other non-cash charges of 1.2 million. This increase was offset by an unfavorable variance in cash flows associated with changes in working capital of 101.1 million, primarily associated with the reduction in working capital associated with the exit of the butane optimization business. 
 
 Net cash used in investing activities. Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased 27.2 million. An increase in cash used of 16.0 million resulted from higher payments for capital expenditures and plant turnaround costs in 2024. Further, investments in unconsolidated entities increased 6.9 million, while net proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment decreased 4.2 million. 
 
 Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities. Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, increased primarily as a result of an decrease in borrowings of long-term debt of 293.4 million, offset by a decrease in repayments of long-term debt of 406.2 million. Additionally, payments of debt issuance costs decreased 14.2 million. 

Total Contractual Obligations 
 
 A summary of our total contractual cash obligations as of September 30, 2024, is as follows: 
 Payments due by period Type of Obligation Total Obligation Less than One Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years Due Thereafter Credit facility 86,500 86,500 11.5 senior secured notes, due 2028 400,000 400,000 Operating leases 71,112 21,084 33,597 12,006 4,425 Finance lease obligations 72 14 31 27 Interest payable on finance lease obligations 11 4 6 1 Interest payable on fixed long-term debt obligations 154,426 46,000 92,000 16,426 Total contractual cash obligations 712,121 67,102 212,134 428,460 4,425 
 
 The interest payable under our credit facility is not reflected in the above table because such amounts depend on the outstanding balances and interest rates, which vary from time to time. 
 48 

Letters of Credit . At September 30, 2024, we had outstanding irrevocable letters of credit in the amount of 9.2 million, which were issued under our credit facility. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. We do not have any off-balance sheet financing arrangements. 
 
 Description of Our Indebtedness 
 
 Credit Facility 
 
 At September 30, 2024, we maintained a 150.0 million credit facility that matures on February 8, 2027. As of September 30, 2024, we had 86.5 million outstanding under the credit facility and 9.2 million of outstanding irrevocable letters of credit, leaving a maximum available amount to be borrowed under our credit facility for future revolving credit borrowings and letters of credit of 54.4 million. After giving effect to our then current borrowings, letters of credit, and the financial covenants contained in our credit facility, we had the ability to borrow approximately 54.4 million in additional amounts thereunder as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 The credit facility is used for ongoing working capital needs and general partnership purposes, and to finance permitted investments, acquisitions and capital expenditures. The level of outstanding draws on our credit facility from January 1, 2024 through September 30, 2024 ranged from a low of 40.5 million to a high of 102.5 million. 
 
 The applicable margin for Adjusted Term SOFR borrowings at September 30, 2024 is 3.25 . The applicable margin for Adjusted Term SOFR borrowings effective October 16, 2024 is 3.50 . 
 
 For a description of our credit facility, see Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Description of Our Long-Term Debt" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 21, 2024. 
 
 2028 Notes 
 
 For a description of our 2028 Notes, see "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Description of Our Long-Term Debt" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 21, 2024. 
 
 Capital Resources and Liquidity 
 
 Historically, we have generally satisfied our working capital requirements and funded our debt service obligations and capital expenditures with cash generated from operations and borrowings under our credit facility. 
 
 On September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 0.06 million and available borrowing capacity of 54.4 million under our credit facility with 86.5 million of borrowings outstanding. After giving effect to our then current borrowings, letters of credit, and the financial covenants contained in our credit facility, we had the ability to borrow approximately 54.4 million in additional amounts thereunder as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 We expect that our primary sources of liquidity to meet operating expenses, service our indebtedness, pay distributions to our unitholders and fund capital expenditures will be provided by cash flows generated by our operations, borrowings under our credit facility and access to the debt and equity capital markets. Our ability to generate cash from operations will depend upon our future operating performance, which is subject to certain risks. For a discussion of such risks, please read "Item 1A. Risk Factors" of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 21, 2024. In addition, due to the covenants in our credit facility, our financial and operating performance impacts the amount we are permitted to borrow under that facility. 
 
 We are in compliance with all debt covenants as of September 30, 2024, and expect to be in compliance for the next twelve months. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 
 We are subject to interest rate risk on our credit facility due to the variable interest rate and may enter into interest rate swaps to reduce this variable rate risk. 
 49 

Seasonality 
 
 A substantial portion of our revenues is dependent on sales prices of products, particularly NGLs and fertilizers, which fluctuate in part based on winter and spring weather conditions. The demand for NGLs is strongest during the winter heating season. The demand for fertilizers is strongest during the early spring planting season. However, our Terminalling and Storage and Transportation business segments and the molten sulfur business are typically not impacted by seasonal fluctuations and a significant portion of our net income is derived from our Terminalling and Storage, Sulfur Services and Transportation business segments. Further, extraordinary weather events, such as hurricanes, have in the past, and could in the future, impact our Terminalling and Storage, Sulfur Services, and Transportation business segments. 

Impact of Inflation 
 
 Inflation did not have a material impact on our results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023. Inflation may increase the cost to acquire or replace property, plant and equipment. It may also increase the costs of labor and supplies. In the future, increasing energy prices for products consumed by our operations, such as diesel fuel, natural gas, chemicals, and other supplies, could adversely affect our results of operations. An increase in price of these products would increase our operating expenses which could adversely affect net income. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to pass along increased operating expenses to our customers. 

Environmental Matters 
 
 Our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations adopted by various governmental authorities in the jurisdictions in which these operations are conducted. 
 
 On June 15, 2024, the Partnership had a spill of less than 2,500 barrels of crude oil originating from the Partnership s transfer pipeline, which connects our Sandyland Terminal to our refinery located in Smackover, Union County, Arkansas. The Partnership is working closely with the U.S Environmental Protection Agency EPA ), Arkansas Department of Energy and Environment ADEE ), and Arkansas Game and Fish Commission to respond to the spill. The Partnership has dedicated the necessary resources, equipment, and personnel to conduct and expedite oil recovery and cleanup activities. As of October 15, 2024, the Partnership s response efforts have moved from emergency response status with the EPA to remediation status, which is to be overseen by the ADEE. A claim related to the crude oil spill has been made with and accepted by, subject to a reservation of rights, the Partnership s insurance carriers. The Partnership s deductibles under the applicable insurance policies total 1.5 million and such deductible expense has been recorded by the Partnership in the Consolidated and Condensed Statements of Operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 We incurred no material environmental costs, liabilities or expenditures to mitigate or eliminate environmental contamination during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 50 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 
 The Partnership is exposed to commodity risk and interest rate risk in its normal business activities. The following disclosures about market risk provide an update to, and should be read in conjunction with, Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 21, 2024. 
 
 Commodity Risk. The Partnership from time to time uses derivatives to manage the risk of commodity price fluctuation. Commodity risk is the adverse effect on the value of a liability or future purchase that results from a change in commodity price. We have established a hedging policy and monitor and manage the commodity market risk associated with potential commodity risk exposure. In addition, we focus on utilizing counterparties for these transactions whose financial condition is appropriate for the credit risk involved in each specific transaction. We had no outstanding hedging positions as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk. We are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our credit facility, which had a weighted-average interest rate of 8.44 as of September 30, 2024. Based on the amount of unhedged floating rate debt owed by us on September 30, 2024, the impact of a 100 basis point increase in interest rates on this amount of debt would result in an increase in interest expense and a corresponding decrease in net income of approximately 0.9 million annually. 
 
 We are not exposed to changes in interest rates with respect to our 2028 Notes as these obligations are at a fixed rate. Based on the quoted prices for identical liabilities in markets that are not active at September 30, 2024, the estimated fair value of the 2028 Note s was 441.6 million. Market risk is estimated as the potential decrease in fair value of our long-term debt resulting from a hypothetical increase of a 100 basis point increase in interest rates . Such an increase in interest rates at September 30, 2024, would result in a 10.1 million decrease in the fair value of our 2028 Notes. 
 51 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. In accordance with Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 of the Exchange Act, we, under the supervision and with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of our general partner, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of our general partner concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective, as of the end of the period covered by this report, to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. 
 
 There were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) that occurred during our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting. 

52 

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 
 From time to time, we are subject to certain legal proceedings, claims and disputes that arise in the ordinary course of our business. Although we cannot predict the outcomes of these legal proceedings, these actions, in the aggregate, could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity. A description of our legal proceedings is included in "Item 1. Financial Statements, Note 13. Commitments and Contingencies", and is incorporated herein by reference. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 There have been no material changes to the Partnership's risk factors since our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 21, 2024, except as follows. 
 
 The Merger is subject to conditions, including some conditions that may not be satisfied on a timely basis, if at all. Failure to complete the Merger, or significant delays in completing the Merger, could negatively affect our business and financial results and the trading prices of our common units. 
 
 The completion of the Merger is not assured and is subject to certain risks, including the risk that certain conditions of the Merger Agreement, such as required regulatory approvals and the approval of our unitholders, some of which are beyond the parties control, are not satisfied or waived, which may prevent, delay or otherwise result in the Merger not occurring. The Merger Agreement contains conditions that, if not satisfied or waived, would result in the Merger not occurring, even though our common unitholders may have voted in favor of the Merger-related proposals presented to them. Failure to complete, or significant delays in completing, the Merger with Martin Resource Management Corporation could negatively affect the price of our common units and may have a material adverse impact on our subsequent financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 
 We may be subject to lawsuits regarding the Merger, which could materially adversely affect our operations and financial condition or prevent or delay completion of the Merger. 
 
 Our directors and officers may be subject to lawsuits relating to the Merger. While we will evaluate and defend against any actions vigorously, the costs of the defense of such lawsuits and other effects of such litigation could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. Failure to complete, or significant delays in completing, the Merger could negatively affect the price of our common units and may have a material adverse impact on our subsequent financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 
 We will be subject to business uncertainties while the Merger is pending, which could adversely affect our business. 
 
 Uncertainty about the effect of the Merger on the Partnership, its subsidiaries and the companies that do business with us may have an adverse effect on us. These uncertainties may impair our ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel and suppliers until the Merger is completed and for a period of time thereafter, and could cause those that transact with us to seek to change their existing business relationships with us. 
 
 We may incur substantial transaction-related costs in connection with the Merger. 
 
 We and Martin Resource Management Corporation expect to incur nonrecurring transaction-related costs associated with completing the Merger. Nonrecurring transaction costs include, but are not limited to, fees paid to legal, financial and accounting advisors, filing fees, proxy solicitation costs and printing costs. 
 
 If the Merger Agreement is terminated, we may, under specified circumstances, be responsible for a termination fee of 2.5 million or the reimbursement of Martin Resource Management Corporation s expenses in an amount up to 5.0 million . 
 
 If the Merger Agreement is terminated, we may, under specified circumstances, be required to pay a termination fee of 2.5 million or make a payment of up to 5.0 million in respect of Martin Resource Management Corporation s expenses. If such termination fee or reimbursement expenses are payable, the payment of any such amount could have an adverse consequence to the financial condition and operations of the party responsible for such payment. 
 
 53 

The Merger is a taxable transaction and the resulting tax liability of our common unitholders, if any, will depend on each such common unitholder s particular situation. 
 
 The receipt of cash in exchange for common units of the Partnership pursuant to the Merger will be treated as a taxable sale by such common unitholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The amount of ordinary income and capital gain or loss recognized by each common unitholder in the Merger will vary depending on each common unitholder s particular situation, including: 
 
 the amount of cash received by the common unitholder as consideration in the Merger; 
 the adjusted tax basis of the common units exchanged by the common unitholder in the Merger; 
 the amount of depreciation and amortization deductions previously allocated to the common unitholder; and 
 the amount of any suspended passive losses that may be available to the common unitholder in respect of its common units to offset a portion of any income or gain recognized by the common unitholder. 

Item 5. Other Information 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, no director or officer of the Partnership or a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement, as each term is defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K.
