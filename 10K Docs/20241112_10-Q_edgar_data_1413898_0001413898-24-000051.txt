Accounts Receivable, Net. Accounts receivable are reported net of the allowance for credit losses calculated based on customer category. For example, trade receivables for advertising customers are evaluated separately from trade receivables from single copy sales. For all trade receivables, the reserve percentage considers the Company s historical loss experience and is applied to each customer category based on aging. In addition, each category has specific reserves for at risk accounts that vary based on the nature of the underlying trade receivables. The calculation of the allowance considers current economic, industry and customer-specific conditions such as high-risk accounts, bankruptcies and other aging specific reserves. The collectability of the Company s trade receivables depends on a variety of factors, including trends in local, regional or national economic conditions that affect its customers ability to pay. Accounts are written-off after all collection efforts fail; generally, after one year has expired. Expense for such uncollectible amounts is included in other production, distribution and operating costs. Credit terms are customary.

Operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date of lease agreements greater than based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. In determining the present value of lease payments, the implicit rate was not readily determinable in the Company s lease agreements. Therefore, the Company used an estimated secured incremental borrowing rate, based on the Company s credit rating, adjusted for the weighted average term of each lease. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and variable lease costs are expensed as incurred. For leases with terms of 12 months or less, asset or liability is recorded and lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The exercise of lease renewal options are at the Company s sole discretion and options are recognized when it is reasonably certain the Company will exercise the option. The recognized right-of-use assets and lease liabilities as calculated do not assume renewal options. The Company does not have lease agreements with residual value guarantees, sale leaseback terms or material restrictive covenants. Additionally, the Company does not separately identify lease and nonlease components, such as maintenance costs.

It em 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations DallasNews Corporation DallasNews or the Company intends for the discussion of its financial condition and results of operations that follows to provide information that will assist in understanding its financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those statements from period to period, and the primary factors that accounted for those changes, as well as how certain accounting principles, policies and estimates affect its financial statements. The following information should be read in conjunction with the Company s consolidated financial statements and related notes filed as part of this report. All dollar amounts presented herein, except share and per share amounts, are in thousands, unless the context indicates otherwise. This section and other parts of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contain certain forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those statements. See Forward-Looking Statements of this Quarterly Report for further discussion. OVERVIEW DallasNews Corporation and its subsidiaries are referred to collectively herein as DallasNews or the Company. DallasNews was formed in February 2008 through a spin-off from its former parent company and is registered on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (Nasdaq trading symbol: DALN). DallasNews is the Dallas-based holding company of The Dallas Morning News and Medium Giant. The Company operates The Dallas Morning News TDMN dallasnews.com ), Texas leading newspaper and winner of nine Pulitzer Prizes. These operations generate revenue from sales of advertising within the Company s newspaper and digital platforms, subscriptions and retail sales of its newspaper, commercial printing and distribution services primarily related to national newspapers. In addition, the Company has a full-service agency, Medium Giant, with capabilities including strategy, creative and media management with a focus on strategic and digital marketing, and data intelligence that provide a measurable return on investment to its clients. Reportable Segments In the second quarter of 2024, based on changes made in the reporting package used by the Company s Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM for purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance, the Company determined it has two reportable segments. The two reportable segments are TDMN and Agency: TDMN is comprised of the Company s traditional print business that includes operating The Dallas Morning News . These operations generate revenue from subscriptions and retail sales of the Company s newspaper, as well as commercial printing and distribution services primarily related to national newspapers. In addition, Medium Giant s cross-functional sales team generates revenue from sales of display and classified advertising within The Dallas Morning News and on related digital platforms to local, regional or national businesses with local operations, affiliates or resellers . Agency is comprised of the Company s full-service agency, Medium Giant. These operations generate revenue from strategic and creative services, website management and content services, media services consisting of paid search, social and targeted digital advertising on third-party platforms (programmatic), as well as traditional media including direct mail, promotional products, out of market print inserts, and over-the-top advertising on streaming platforms. The revenue also includes subscriptions to the Company s multi-channel marketing solutions cloud-based software and services. The Company also has a Corporate and Other category that includes expenses not directly attributable to a specific reportable segment. The prior period information has been recast by segment to reflect current period presentation for comparative purposes. See Note 11 - Segment Reporting . Business Trends Several industry trends have been considered when assessing the Company s business strategy: Traditionally, the Company s primary revenues are generated from advertising within its newspaper and related digital platforms, and from subscription and single copy sales of its printed newspaper. As a result of competitive and economic conditions, the newspaper industry has faced a significant revenue decline over the past decade. Therefore, the Company has sought to diversify its revenues through development and investment in new product offerings, increased circulation rates and leveraging of its existing assets to offer cost efficient commercial printing and distribution services. The Company continually evaluates the overall performance of its core products to ensure existing assets are deployed adequately to maximize return.

The Company s advertising revenue from its newspaper continues to be adversely affected by the shift of advertiser spending to other forms of media and the increased accessibility of free online news content, as well as news content from other sources, which also adversely affects paid print circulation volumes and revenue. In addition, preprint advertising continues to experience a secular decline across the industry and may eventually become obsolete. In the third quarter of 2023, the Company made the strategic decision to exit its shared mail program to deliver weekly preprints, as discussed below. In response to print revenue challenges, the Company built agency capabilities, including strategy, creative and media management with a focus on strategic and digital marketing, and data intelligence that provide a measurable return on investment to its clients. The Company leverages its news content to improve engagement on the Company s digital platforms that results in increased digital subscriptions and associated revenue. The Company also continues to diversify its revenue base by leveraging the available capacity of its existing assets to provide print and distribution services for newspapers and other customers requiring these services, by introducing new advertising and marketing services products, and by increasing circulation prices. Because of declining print circulation, the Company has developed broad digital strategies designed to provide readers with multiple platforms for obtaining online access to local news. The Company continues to obtain additional key demographic data from readers, which allows the Company to provide content desired by readers and to modify marketing and distribution strategies to target and reach audiences valued by advertisers. The Company has access to programmatic digital advertising platforms that provide digital ad placement and targeting efficiencies and increases utilization of digital inventory within the Company s platforms. Additionally, in order to optimize owned and operated digital advertising revenue, the Company has adopted a holistic yield management approach powered by real-time bidding technologies and data analysis to ensure the optimal mix of direct sales and programmatic ad sales is achieved. Macroeconomic Environment The Company and its business partners are subject to risks and uncertainties caused by factors beyond its control, including macroeconomic factors such as inflation. If inflation were to increase, for an extended period, certain operating costs could increase or advertiser spending could be impacted. If a pandemic were to affect a significant number of the workforce employed in printing operations, the Company may experience delays or be unable to produce, print and deliver its publications and other third-party print publications on a timely basis. The Company continues to evaluate for any future material impacts on its consolidated financial statements. Overview of Significant Transactions On May 14, 2024, the Company announced it will streamline its printing operations, currently located in Plano, Texas, into a smaller, leased facility that will require fewer employees and capital investments of approximately 8,000 in a more efficient press and related equipment. The Company entered into a five-year lease that commenced on June 28, 2024, for a 67,600 square-foot facility located in Carrollton, Texas. This transition will allow the Company to keep its operations in North Texas and continue to produce a seven-day print edition for the foreseeable future. The new facility is expected to be operational in early 2025, and until then, all operations will remain in the current facility. Once the transition is completed, the Company expects to benefit from annual expense savings of approximately 5,000. In the third quarter of 2024, the Company began actively marketing the Plano facility for sale, including the land, building and most of the production assets, and recorded severance expense of 2,982, primarily related to the Company s transition to a smaller printing facility. In addition, the Company made capital investments of 5,164 in the new printing facility in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the Company no longer held short-term investments, which consisted of Certificates of Deposit CD s with original maturities of more than 90 days but one year or less. In the third quarter, 500 in CD s matured and in May 2024, the Company terminated, without penalty, its short-term investments of 9,909 in CD s that were purchased in the first quarter of 2024 ; see Note 3 Financial Instruments and Accounts Receivable, Net for additional information.

 Revenues Advertising and marketing services Advertising and marketing services r evenue, including print, digital, and marketing and media services revenues, was 38.4 percent and 38.6 percent of total revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and 42.6 percent and 43.7 percent of total revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Print advertising Revenue is primarily comprised of display and classified advertising space within the Company s newspaper. Display revenue results from sales of advertising space within the Company s newspaper to local, regional or national businesses with local operations, affiliates or resellers. Classified revenue, which includes automotive, real estate, employment, obituaries, immigration, and other, results from sales of advertising space in the classified and other sections of the Company s newspaper. At the end of August 2023, the Company exited its shared mail program to deliver weekly preprints and discontinued print-only editions of its niche publications. Digital advertising R evenue is generated by digital sales of banner, classified and native advertisements on the Company s news websites, social media platforms and mobile apps. Prior to the segment reporting change, digital advertising, and marketing and media services revenues were reported in aggregate. Prio r period was recast in the revenue table below. Marketing and media services Revenue is primarily comprised of strategic and creative services, website management and content services, media services consisting of paid search, social and targeted digital advertising on third-party platforms (programmatic), as well as traditional media including direct mail, promotional products, out of market print inserts, and over-the-top advertising on streaming platforms. The revenue also includes subscriptions to the Company s multi-channel marketing solutions cloud-based software and services.

Circulation Circulation r evenue, including print and digital revenues, was 51.6 percent and 51.5 percent of total revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and 46.9 percent and 45.6 percent of total revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Print circulation R evenue is generated primarily by selling home delivery subscriptions, including premium publications, and from single copy sales to non-subscribers. Home delivery revenue is recognized over the subscription period based on the days of actual delivery over the total subscription days and single copy revenue is recognized at a point in time when the paper is purchased. Revenue is directly reduced for any non-payment for the grace period of home delivery subscriptions where the Company recorded revenue for newspapers delivered after a subscription expired. Digital circulation R evenue is generated by digital-only subscriptions and is recognized over the subscription period based on daily or monthly access to the content in the subscription period. Printing, distribution and other Printing, distribution and other r evenue was 10.0 percent and 9.9 percent of total revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and 10.5 percent and 10.7 percent of total revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Revenue is primarily generated from printing and distribution of other newspapers, mailed advertisements for business customers, and sublease income. In the third quarter, t he Company s partner for its program to distribute mailed advertisements for business customers, located in Tempe, Arizona, gave their six-month termination notice. The program generates approximately 350,000 a month in revenue, although recently this program is experiencing revenue declines, consistent with the overall industry trend of declining mailed advertisements. The Company does not expect a significant financial impact from the termination of this agreement in April 2025. Operating Expenses Employee compensation and benefits Includes labor and employee benefits costs, as well as severance expense that is not allocated to the two segments since management believes this expense is not indicative of each segment s core operations. Other production, distribution and operating costs Includes distribution and outside services expenses, as well as other miscellaneous expenses such as travel and entertainment, advertising and promotion, and lease cost. Newsprint, ink and other supplies Includes expenses for all printing supplies used for the TDMN segment, which includes operating The Dallas Morning News, as well as commercial printing primarily related to national newspapers. In addition, beginning in the latter half of 2023 , the Agency segment began incurring costs associated with printing out of market inserts for media services clients. Depreciation This is not allocated to the two segments since management believes this expense is not indicative of each segment s core operations.

Other Non-Operating Components The table below sets forth the other components of the Company s results of operations. Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Percentage Change 2023 2024 Percentage Change 2023 Other income, net 536 56.7 342 1,788 65.2 1,082 Income tax provision 345 148.2 139 322 (18.9) 397 
 Other income, net Other income, net primarily includes net periodic pension and other post-employment benefit, and interest income. Net periodic pension and other post-employment benefit was 474 and 225 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 1,422 and 674 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. I n the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded 5 and 118, respectively, and 164 and 287 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, of interest income from the Company s investment in CD s. Income tax provision The Company recognized an income tax provision of 345 and 139 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 322 and 397 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, due to the effect of the Texas franchise tax. Effective income tax rates were (9.2) percent and (8.8) percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The 2023 income tax expense was reduced by the release of a 66 federal uncertain tax reserve, included in other liabilities, as a result of the statute of limitations lapsing in June 2023. In connection with the release of a federal uncertain tax reserve, the Company released a reserve for interest and penalties included in other liabilities and recognized 36 in other income, net in the second quarter of 2023. Legal proceedings From time to time, the Company is involved in a variety of claims, lawsuits and other disputes arising in the ordinary course of business. Management routinely assesses the likelihood of adverse judgments or outcomes in these matters, as well as the ranges of probable losses to the extent losses are reasonably estimable. Accruals for contingencies are recorded when, in the judgment of management, adverse judgments or outcomes are probable and the financial impact, should an adverse outcome occur, is reasonably estimable. The determination of likely outcomes of litigation matters relates to factors that include, but are not limited to, past experience and other evidence, interpretation of relevant laws or regulations and the specifics and status of each matter. Predicting the outcome of claims and litigation and estimating related costs and financial exposure involves substantial uncertainties that could cause actual results to vary materially from estimates and accruals. In the opinion of management, liabilities, if any, arising from other currently existing claims against the Company would not have a material adverse effect on DallasNews results of operations, liquidity or financial condition.

 N/M-not meaningful Employee compensation and benefits TDMN expense decreased 922 and 3,952 in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, due to headcount reductions resulting from the 2023 Voluntary Severance Program (the VSO ). Agency expense declined 348 and 901 in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as a result of first quarter headcount reductions at Medium Giant. Total Company employee headcount is 534, a decrease of 74 or 12.2 percent when compared to September 30, 2023, primarily resulting from the VSO, which also resulted in reduced Corporate headcount. In the third quarter of 2024, the Company recorded severance expense of 2,982, primarily related to the Company s transition to a smaller printing facility , resulting in increased Corporate and Other expense. Other production, distribution and operating costs TDMN e xpense decreased 1,881 and 8,061 in the three and nine months ended September 30 2024, respectively, primarily due to reduced distribution expense associated with lower circulation, including discontinuing print-only editions of the Company s niche publications and ending its shared mail program to distribute preprinted advertisements. Agency expense increased 404 and 111 in the three and nine months ended September 30 2024, respectively, due to revenue-related outside services expense for two new customer contracts focused on media services that began in the third quarter of 2024. In the second quarter of 2023, the Company recorded a non-recurring lease cost benefit of 556 included in Corporate and Other expense. Newsprint, ink and other supplies TDMN expense decreased 1,109 and 3,399 in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, due to reduced newsprint pricing and lower circulation. Beginning in the third quarter of 2023, the Agency segment began incurring costs associated with printing out of market inserts for media services clients. Newsprint consumption for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, approximated 1,179 and 1,521 metric tons, respectively, at an average cost per metric ton of 626 and 770, respectively. Newsprint consumption for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, approximated 3,556 and 5,076 metric tons, respectively, at an average cost per metric ton of 650 and 800, respectively. Depreciation Expense increased in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to print production assets, and office and computer equipment upgrades that were put in-service, causing a higher depreciable asset base.

Adjusted Operating Income (Loss) by Reportable Segment (unaudited) The CODM uses adjusted operating income (loss) for the purposes of evaluating performance and allocating resources. Adjusted operating income (loss) does not include depreciation or severance expense. Adjusted operating income (loss) is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles GAAP ). Management believes that the non-GAAP measure presented is an important metric that provides a focus on the underlying ongoing operating performance of its businesses on a consistent basis across reporting periods. Adjusted operating income (loss) should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for other comparable measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, this non-GAAP measure may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures of other companies. The table below sets forth adjusted operating income (loss) by reportable segment, and Corporate and Other category. Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 TDMN Total net operating revenue 26,723 30,883 81,885 94,169 Adjusted operating expense 21,965 25,877 65,562 80,974 Adjusted Operating Income 4,758 5,006 16,323 13,195 Agency Total net operating revenue 4,417 3,616 12,418 11,544 Adjusted operating expense 4,372 4,288 12,744 13,160 Adjusted Operating Income (Loss) 45 (672) (326) (1,616) Corporate and Other Total net operating revenue Adjusted operating expense 5,528 5,224 16,329 14,890 Adjusted Operating Loss (5,528) (5,224) (16,329) (14,890) Total Adjusted Operating Loss (725) (890) (332) (3,311) Excluded expenses: Depreciation 411 388 1,216 1,118 Severance expense 2,982 336 3,758 1,161 Operating Loss (4,118) (1,614) (5,306) (5,590) Other income, net 536 342 1,788 1,082 Loss Before Income Taxes (3,582) (1,272) (3,518) (4,508) 
 TDMN Adjusted operating income decreased 248 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and improved 3,128 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to expense savings from the Company ending its shared mail program and print-only niche publications, as well as headcount reductions resulting from the VSO. Print advertising revenue decreased 9.7 percent and 1.8 percent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, excluding the preprint business and niche publications. Circulation revenue was flat for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, driven by increased pricing that is offsetting the decline in digital subscriptions. The Company continues to focus on finding a sustainable strategy that balances price with the ability to continue to grow its digital subscriber base. In the third quarter, the Company modified its digital subscription strategy to a volume-centric strategy, resulting in a slight increase in digital-only subscriptions when compared to March 31, 2024. Agency Adjusted operating income (loss) improved 717 and 1,290 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, primarily due to marketing and media services revenue increasing 25.9 percent and 11.7 percent for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, reflecting Medium Giant s focus on more relevant solutions for media services clients.

Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company s cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, were 13,988 and 11,697, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, the Company no longer held short-term investments . As of December 31, 2023, the Company had 10,781 in short-term investments for CD s, including interest, as discussed below. The Company expects to have cash flow and expense reduction measures in place to help offset future revenue declines. The Company believes it has adequate cash to continue to fund operating activities and capital spending. On May 14, 2024, the Company announced it will streamline its printing operations, currently located in Plano, Texas, into a smaller, leased facility that will require fewer employees. As part of this transition, the Company expects to make capital investments of approximately 8,000 in a more efficient press and related equipment. The Company entered into a five-year lease that commenced on June 28, 2024, for a 67,600 square-foot facility located in Carrollton, Texas. This operating lease resulted in a right-of-use asset and lease liability of 3,537 in aggregate upon commencement. This transition will allow the Company to keep its operations in North Texas and continue to produce a seven-day print edition for the foreseeable future. The new facility is expected to be operational in early 2025, and until then, all operations will remain in the current facility. Once the transition is completed, the Company expects to benefit from annual expense savings of approximately 5,000. In the third quarter of 2024, the Company began actively marketing the Plano facility for sale, including the land, building and most of the production assets. In connection with the transition to a smaller printing facility, the Company currently expects to reduce its headcount by 75, or 14 percent, in the first quarter of 2025. The Company accrued severance of 2,790 for the printing facility transition, included in other accrued expense in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2024. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company made capital investments of 5,164 for this transition and expects to spend approximately 2,500 for the remaining capital needed for the facility. As previously announced on May 14, 2024, based on the required capital investments to support the transition of the print operations, the Company s board of directors authorized suspending the declaration and payment of dividends until further notice. In the third quarter of 2024, DallasNews board of directors approved the termination of the Company s previously authorized repurchase authority. The following discusses the changes in cash flows by operating, investing and financing activities. Operating Cash Flows Net cash used for operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, was 2,317 and 114, respectively. Cash flows used for operating activities increased by 2,203 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the prior year period, primarily due to severance payments to the VSO participants that left the Company in the first quarter, partially offset by an improvement in the loss from operations. Investing Cash Flows Net cash provided by (used for) investing activities was 5,464 and (11,359) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. In 2023, the Company invested 10,500 in CD s with original maturities of one year or less, which resulted in cash proceeds of 120. In the first quarter of 2024, 10,000 matured and the Company reinvested 9,909 in CD s, which the Company terminated, without penalty, in the second quarter. In the third quarter, the remaining 500 in CD s matured . The Company received cash proceeds of 445 in 2024 from the return on the Company s investments in CD s. Cash flows used for investing activities also included 5,481 in 2024, primarily related to t he new printing facility, and 974 of capital spending in 2023. Financing Cash Flows Net cash used for financing activities was 856 and 2,570 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, all attributable to dividend payments.

Forward-looking statements, which are as of the date of this filing, are not updated to reflect events or circumstances after the date of the statement. Ite m 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), are controls that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing disclosure controls and procedures, management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures. The design of any disclosure controls and procedures is also based, in part, upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. The Company s management, with the participation of its Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, as of September 30, 2024, management concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting During the third quarter of 2024, the Company implemented a new cloud-based system for advertising billing. In connection with this system implementation, the Company updated its internal control over financial reporting to accommodate the resulting changes to its existing controls, systems and procedures. There were no other changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the third fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
