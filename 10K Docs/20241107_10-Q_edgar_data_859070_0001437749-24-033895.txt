CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 
 Forward-looking statements in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the accompanying Exhibits, filings incorporated by reference, reports to shareholders, and other communications that represent the Company s beliefs, plans, objectives, goals, guidelines, expectations, anticipations, estimates, and intentions are made in good faith pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that are difficult to predict. The words may, could, should, would, believe, anticipate, estimate, expect, intend, plan, and other similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. The following factors, among others, could cause financial performance to differ materially from that expressed in such forward-looking statements: 

inflation, interest rate, market and monetary fluctuations; 

the strength of the U.S. economy in general and the strength of the local economies in which we conduct operations; 

the effects of, and changes in, trade, monetary, and fiscal policies and laws, including interest rate policies of the Federal Reserve System; 

timely development of competitive new products and services and the acceptance of these products and services by new and existing customers; 

the willingness of customers to substitute competitors products and services for the Company s products and services and vice versa; 

the impact of changes in financial services laws and regulations, including laws about taxes, banking, securities, and insurance; 

the impact of the U.S. Department of the Treasury and federal banking regulators continued implementation of programs to address capital and liquidity in the banking system; 

technological changes; 

the cost and effects of cyber incidents or other failures, interruptions, or security breaches of our systems or those of third-party providers; 

the effect of changes in accounting policies and practices, as may be adopted by the regulatory agencies, as well as the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, and other accounting standard setters; 

the effect of acquisitions, including, without limitation, the failure to achieve the expected revenue growth and/or expense savings from such acquisitions; 

the sustainability of noninterest, or fee, income being less than expected; 

unanticipated regulatory or judicial proceedings; 

changes in consumer spending and saving habits; and 

the Company s success at managing the risks mentioned above. 

This list of important factors is not exclusive. If one or more of the factors affecting these forward-looking statements proves incorrect, actual results, performance, or achievements could differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and other reports we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Therefore, the Company cautions you not to place undue reliance on forward-looking information and statements. The Company does not intend to update any forward-looking statements, whether written or oral, to reflect changes.

NOTES TO COND ENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 

Recent Accounting Standards 
 
 Standards Not Yet Adopted 
 
 In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023 - 09, Income Taxes (Topic 740 ). The amendments in this ASU are related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid disclosures and are designed to improve the transparency of income tax disclosures by requiring 1 consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation and 2 income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction. Early adoption is permitted for annual financial statements that have not yet been issued or made available for issuance. The adoption of this pronouncement is not expected to have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 The Company has not yet adopted any new accounting standards in 2024 that have been issued by the FASB or other standards-setting bodies. The Company does not anticipate any of the recent standards issued to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 

shares of the Company's common stock. The transaction was consummated on April 21, 2023. The total purchase price for the transaction was million. 
 
 The Surrey transaction was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting and, accordingly, assets acquired, liabilities assumed and consideration exchanged were recorded at estimated fair value on the acquisition date. Fair values are preliminary and subject to refinement for up to a year after the closing date of the acquisition. The Company incurred a total of million in merger expenses related to the Surrey transaction, thousand was recorded in the last quarter of 2022 and million in 2023. These costs were primarily related to data conversion, investment banking fees, and legal fees. 
 
 Goodwill arising from business combinations represents the excess of the purchase price over the sum of the estimated fair values of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired less the fair value of the liabilities assumed. The Surrey acquisition resulted in the Company recognizing million in goodwill. 
 
 The primary identifiable intangible asset we typically record in connection with a whole bank or bank branch acquisition is the value of the core deposit intangibles which represents the estimated value of the long-term deposit relationships acquired in the transaction. Determining the amount of identifiable intangible assets and their average lives involves multiple assumptions and estimates and is typically determined by performing a discounted cash flow analysis, which involves a combination of any or all of the following assumptions: customer attrition/runoff, alternative funding costs, deposit servicing costs, and discount rates. The core deposit intangibles are amortized over the estimated useful lives of the deposit accounts based on a method that we believe reasonably approximates the anticipated benefit stream from this intangible. Core deposit intangibles for the Surrey transaction totaled million. 
 
 When loans are acquired they are identified as either purchased credit deteriorated PCD or non-PCD. PCD loans represent assets that are acquired with evidence of more than insignificant credit quality deterioration since the origination of the loans as of the acquisition date. The ACL for PCD assets is recognized within business combination accounting with no initial impact to net income. Changes in estimates of expected credit losses on PCD loans after acquisition are recognized as provision expense (or reversal of provision expense) in subsequent periods as they arise. Non-PCD loans acquired are generally estimated at fair value using a discounted cash flow approach with assumptions of discount rate, remaining life, prepayments, probability of default, and loss given default. The actual cash flows on these loans could differ materially from the fair value estimates. The amount we record as the fair values for the loans is generally less than the contractual unpaid principal balance due from the borrowers, with the difference being referred to as the discount on the acquired loans. Discounts on acquired non-PCD loans are accreted to interest income over their estimated remaining lives, which may include prepayment estimates in certain circumstances. The ACL for non-PCD assets is recognized as provision expense in the same reporting period as the business combination. Estimated loan losses for acquired loans are determined using methodologies and applying estimates and assumptions similar to originated performing loans. The fair value of purchased loans with credit deterioration was million on the date of acquisition with the gross contractual amount totaling million. The Company estimates that million of contractual cash flows specific to the purchased loans with credit deterioration will not be collected. Non purchased credit deteriorated loans acquired had a fair value of million with a gross contractual value of million.

There was no allowance for credit losses for debt securities as of September 30, 2024 ; therefore, it is not presented in the table above. The Company excludes the accrued interest receivable from the amortized cost basis in measuring expected credit losses on the debt securities and does not record an allowance for credit losses on accrued interest receivable. Accrued interest receivable for debt securities was thousand and million as of September 30, 2024 , and December 31, 2023 , respectively. 

The following table presents the amortized cost and aggregate fair value of available-for-sale debt securities by contractual maturity, as of the date indicated. Actual maturities could differ from contractual maturities because issuers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without penalties.

There were individual debt securities in an unrealized loss position as of September 30, 2024 , and the combined depreciation in value represented of the debt securities portfolio. There were individual debt securities in an unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2023 , and their combined depreciation in value represented of the debt securities portfolio. 
 
 Management evaluates securities for impairment where there has been a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis of a security to determine whether there is a credit loss associated with the decline in fair value on at least a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic or market concerns warrant such evaluation. Credit losses are calculated individually, rather than collectively, using a discounted cash flow method, whereby management compares the present value of expected cash flows with the amortized cost basis of the security. The credit loss component would be recognized through the provision for credit losses and the creation of an allowance for credit losses. Consideration is given to 1 the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer including looking at default and delinquency rates, 2 the outlook for receiving the contractual cash flows of the investments, 3 the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, 4 our intent and ability to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value or for a debt security whether it is more-likely-than- not that we will be required to sell the debt security prior to recovering its fair value, 5 the anticipated outlook for changes in the general level of interest rates, 6 credit ratings, 7 third party guarantees, and 8 collateral values. In analyzing an issuer s financial condition, management considers whether the securities are issued by the federal government or its agencies, whether downgrades by bond rating agencies have occurred, the results of reviews of the issuer s financial condition, and the issuer s anticipated ability to pay the contractual cash flows of the investments. All of the U.S. Treasury and Agency-Backed Securities have the full faith and credit backing of the United State Government or one of its agencies. Municipal securities and all other securities that do not have a zero expected credit loss are evaluated quarterly to determine whether there is a credit loss associated with a decline in fair value. All debt securities available-for-sale in an unrealized loss position as of September 30, 2024 , continue to perform as scheduled and we do not believe that there is a credit loss or that a provision for credit losses is necessary. Also, as part of our evaluation of our intent and ability to hold investments for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the market, we consider our investment strategy, cash flow needs, liquidity position, capital adequacy and interest rate risk position. We do not currently intend to sell the securities within the portfolio and it is not more-likely-than- not that we will be required to sell the debt securities. 
 
 Management continues to monitor all of our securities with a high degree of scrutiny. There can be no assurance that we will not conclude in future periods that conditions existing at that time indicate some or all of its securities may be sold or would require a charge to earnings as a provision for credit losses in such periods. 
 
 There were no available-for-sale securities sold during the third quarter or for the first nine months of 2024 . Approximately million in securities available for sale were sold in the first nine months of 2023 . Approximately million of the sales in 2023 were attributable to the sale of the entire portfolio of Surrey comprised primarily of U. S. Treasury Notes. The following table presents gross realized gains and losses from the sale of available-for-sale debt securities for the periods indicated:

Loans are considered past due when either principal or interest payments become contractually delinquent by 30 days or more. The Company s policy is to discontinue the accrual of interest, if warranted, on loans based on the payment status, evaluation of the related collateral, and the financial strength of the borrower. Loans that are 90 days or more past due are placed on nonaccrual status. Management may elect to continue the accrual of interest when the loan is well secured and in process of collection. When interest accruals are discontinued, interest accrued and not collected in the current year is reversed from income, and interest accrued and not collected from prior years is charged to the allowance for credit losses. Nonaccrual loans may be returned to accrual status when all principal and interest amounts contractually due, including past due payments, are brought current the ability of the borrower to repay the obligation is reasonably assured and there is generally a period of at least six months of repayment performance by the borrower in accordance with the contractual terms. There was material nonaccrual loan interest recognized in income during the third quarter or for the first nine months of 2024 or 2023 .

ASC 326 prescribes that when an entity determines foreclosure is probable, the expected credit loss can be measured based on the fair value of the collateral. As a practical expedient, an entity may use the fair value as of the reporting date when recording the net carrying amount of the asset. For the collateral dependent asset ("CDA") a credit loss expense is recorded for loan amounts in excess of fair value of the collateral. The table below summarizes collateral dependent loans, where foreclosure is probable, by type of collateral, and the extent to which they are collateralized during the period.

The Company may make concessions in interest rates, loan terms and/or amortization terms when restructuring loans for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. Effective, January 1, 2023, the Company adopted ASU 2022 - 02, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326 ), Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures. The amendments eliminated TDR accounting guidance for issuers that adopted ASU 2016 - 13, created a single loan modification accounting model, and clarified disclosure requirements for loan modifications and write-offs. Presented below are the amortized cost basis and percentage of loan class for loan modifications made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty by loan class, concession type, and financial effect as of the dates indicated:

Upon the Company's determination that a modified loan (or portion of a loan) has subsequently been deemed uncollectible, the loan (or a portion of the loan) is written off. Therefore, the amortized cost basis of the loan is reduced by the uncollectible amount and the allowance for credit losses is adjusted by the same amount. There were modified loans (or portions of a loan) deemed uncollectible as of September 30, 2024 , or December 31, 2023 . 
 
 The Company closely monitors the performance of the loans that are modified to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty to understand the effectiveness of its modification efforts. The following table depicts the performance of loans that have been modified for the periods indicated:

Assets and Liabilities Reported at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis 
 
 Available-for-sale Debt Securities 

Debt securities available-for-sale are reported at fair value on a recurring basis. The fair value of Level
 1 securities is based on quoted market prices in active markets, if available. If quoted market prices are
 not available, fair values are measured utilizing independent valuation techniques of identical or similar securities for which significant assumptions are primarily derived from or corroborated by observable market data. Level
 2 securities use fair value measurements from independent pricing services obtained by the Company. These fair value measurements consider observable data that
 may include dealer quotes, market spreads, cash flows, the Treasury yield curve, live trading levels, trade execution data, market consensus prepayment speeds, credit information, and bond terms and conditions. The Company s Level
 2 securities include U.S. Agency and Treasury securities, municipal securities, and mortgage-backed securities. Securities are based on Level
 3 inputs when there is limited activity or less transparency to the valuation inputs. In the absence of observable or corroborated market data, internally developed estimates that incorporate market-based assumptions are used when such information is available.

Fair value models may be required when trading activity has declined significantly or does not exist, prices are not current, or pricing variations are significant. For Level 3 securities, the Company obtains the cash flow of specific securities from third parties that use modeling software to determine cash flows based on market participant data and knowledge of the structures of each individual security. The fair values of Level 3 securities are determined by applying proper market observable discount rates to the cash flow derived from third -party models. Securities with increased uncertainty about the receipt of cash flows are discounted at higher rates due to the addition of a deal specific credit premium based on assumptions about the performance of the underlying collateral. Finally, internal fair value model pricing and external pricing observations are combined by assigning weights to each pricing observation. Pricing is reviewed for reasonableness based on the direction of specific markets and the general economic indicators. 
 
 Equity Securities. Equity securities are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company uses Level 1 inputs to value equity securities that are traded in active markets. Equity securities that are not actively traded are classified in Level 2. 
 
 Loans Held for Investment . Loans held for investment that are subject to a fair value hedge are reported at fair value derived from third -party models. Loans designated in fair value hedges are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. 
 
 Deferred Compensation Assets and Liabilities . Securities held for trading purposes are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. These securities include assets related to employee deferred compensation plans, which are generally invested in Level 1 equity securities. The liability associated with these deferred compensation plans is carried at the fair value of the obligation to the employee, which corresponds to the fair value of the invested assets. 
 
 Derivative Assets and Liabilities . Derivatives are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. The Company obtains dealer quotes, Level 2 inputs, based on observable data to value derivatives. 
 
 The following tables summarize financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, by the level of valuation inputs in the fair value hierarchy, as of the dates indicated:

Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis 
 
 Impaired Loans . Fair value is based on appraised value adjusted for customized discounting criteria, Level 3 inputs. 
 
 The Company maintains an active and robust problem credit identification system. The impairment review includes obtaining third -party collateral valuations to help management identify potential credit impairment and determine the amount of impairment to record. The Company s Special Assets staff manages and monitors all impaired loans. Internal collateral valuations are generally performed within two to four weeks of identifying the initial potential impairment. The internal valuation compares the original appraisal to current local real estate market conditions and considers experience and expected liquidation costs. The Company typically receives a third -party valuation within thirty to forty-five days of completing the internal valuation. When a third -party valuation is received, it is reviewed for reasonableness. Once the valuation is reviewed and accepted, discounts are applied to fair market value, based on, but not limited to, our historical liquidation experience for like collateral, resulting in an estimated net realizable value. The estimated net realizable value is compared to the outstanding loan balance to determine the appropriate amount of specific impairment reserve. 
 
 OREO . OREO is recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis using Level 3 inputs. The Company calculates the fair value of OREO from current or prior appraisals that have been adjusted for valuation declines, estimated selling costs, and other proprietary qualitative adjustments that are deemed necessary. 
 
 The following tables present assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, by the level of valuation inputs in the fair value hierarchy, as of the dates indicated:

ITEM 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations MD A is intended to help the reader understand our financial condition, changes in financial condition, and results of operations. MD A contains forward-looking statements and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements, accompanying notes, and other financial information included in this report and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the 2023 Form 10-K ). Unless the context suggests otherwise, the terms First Community, Company, we, our, and us refer to First Community Bankshares, Inc. and its subsidiaries as a consolidated entity. 
 
 Executive Overview

 Critical Accounting Estimates 

We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles GAAP in the U.S. and conform to general practices within the banking industry. Our financial position and results of operations may require management to make significant estimates and assumptions that have a material impact on our financial condition or operating performance. Due to the level of subjectivity and the susceptibility of such matters to change, actual results could differ significantly from management s assumptions and estimates. Estimates, assumptions, and judgments, which are periodically evaluated, are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events believed reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates are generally necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at estimated fair value, when a decline in the value of an asset carried on the financial statements at fair value warrants an impairment write-down or a valuation reserve, or when an asset or liability needs recorded based on the probability of occurrence of a future event. Carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in more financial statement volatility. Fair values and information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based on quoted market prices, when available, or third-party sources. When quoted prices or third-party information is not available, management estimates valuation adjustments primarily through the use of financial modeling techniques and appraisal estimates. 
 
 Our accounting policies are fundamental in understanding MD A and the disclosures presented in Item 1, Financial Statements, of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Our accounting policies are described in detail in Note 1, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of our 2023 Form 10-K. Our critical accounting estimates are detailed in the Critical Accounting Estimates section in Part II, Item 7 of our 2023 Form 10-K.

Results of Operations 
 
 During the last week of September 2024, Hurricane Helene made landfall in Florida s panhandle, and brought the full suite of hurricane impacts to the southern Appalachian region resulting in widespread flooding and washing out of towns and roadways. Hurricane Helene had a significant impact on western North Carolina. Millions have lost access to critical services like water and sewer, electricity, and telecommunications. Thousands of miles of roads and bridges were damaged. The hurricane resulted in property damage to our customers, the closing or disruption of many businesses and damage to infrastructure in communities that we serve. Our branch in Banner Elk, North Carolina was temporarily closed due to lack of power and water, but it is now open to the public. We continue to evaluate the impact of Hurricane Helene on our customers and the Bank s loans. Based on our assessment to date, we do not expect the losses related to Hurricane Helene to have a material impact on the Bank s financial condition or results of operations.

Three - Month Comparison . 
 
 Net income decreased 1.61 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease in net interest income of 1.75 million. While interest income increased 787 thousand for the third quarter of 2024, interest expense increased 2.54 million. The increase in interest expense is primarily attributable to an increase in deposit rates. 
 
 Nine- Month Comparison . 
 
 Net income increased 2.33 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The increase is primarily attributable to a decrease in provision for credit losses of 4.44 million. Noninterest income increased by 2.06 million, as well. These increases were offset by an increase in noninterest expense of 4.06 million compared to the same period in 2023.

 FTE basis based on the federal statutory rate of 21 . 

Three - Month Comparison . Net interest income comprised 75.14 of total net interest and noninterest income in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 77.61 in the same quarter of 2023. Net interest income on a GAAP basis decreased 1.75 million, or 5.26 . Net interest income on a FTE basis decreased 1.75 million, with a percentage decrease of 5.24 . The net interest margin on a FTE basis decreased 10 basis points while the net interest spread on a FTE basis decreased 32 basis points. The decrease in both the net interest margin and the net interest spread was primarily driven by an increase in the yield on interest-bearing liabilities of 58 basis points when compared with the same period of 2023 and is primarily attributable to increased rates on interest-bearing deposit liabilities. 
 
 Average earning assets decreased 80.50 million, or 2.74 , primarily due to a decrease in average securities available for sale of 151.01 million, or 53.05 . In addition, the average balance for loans decreased 149.08 million, or 5.72 . These decreases to earning assets were offset by an increase in the average balance for interest-bearing balances with banks of 219.59 million, or 431.79 . The yield on earning assets increased 26 basis points, or 5.32 , primarily due to an increase in benchmark rates as compared to the same period of 2023. The average loan to deposit ratio decreased to 92.11 from 93.39 reported in the same quarter of 2023. Non-cash accretion income was 592 thousand for the third quarter compared to 874 thousand reported in the same period of 2023. 
 
 Average interest-bearing liabilities, which consist of interest-bearing deposits and borrowings, decreased 36.76 million, or 2.01 , primarily due to a decrease in deposits. Interest-bearing demand deposits decreased 42.29 million, or 6.05 , while time deposits decreased 18.92 million, or 7.17 . These decreases were offset by an increase in savings deposits of 24.65 million, or 2.86 . The yield on interest-bearing liabilities increased 58 basis points and is primarily due to increases in benchmark rates throughout 2023. 
 
 Nine- Month Comparison . Net interest income comprised 76.61 of total net interest and noninterest income for the nine months ending September 30, 2024 compared to 77.99 in the same period of 2023. Net interest income on a GAAP basis decreased 486 thousand, or 0.51 . Net interest income on a FTE basis decreased 481 thousand, with a percentage decrease of 0.50 . The net interest margin on a FTE basis increased 1 basis point while the net interest spread on a FTE basis decreased 24 basis points. The 24 basis point decrease in net interest spread is primarily due to the increase in yield for interest-bearing liabilities of 68 basis points versus the increase in yield for earning assets of 44 basis points. 
 
 Average earning assets decreased 25.70 million, or 0.89 , primarily due to decreases in both securities available for sale and loans. Securities available for sale decrease 134.10 million, or 43.76 . Loans decreased 22.61 million , or 0.90 . These decreases were offset by an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits with banks of 131.01 million, or 253.12 . The yield on earning assets increased 44 basis points, or 9.34 , primarily due to an increase in benchmark rates as compared to the same period of 2023. The average loan to deposit ratio increased to 93.74 from 92.44 reported in the same period of 2023. Non-cash accretion income increased to 2.04 million from 1.95 million reported in the same period of 2023. 
 
 Average interest-bearing liabilities, which consist of interest-bearing deposits and borrowings, decreased 23.65 million, or 1.31 , primarily due to a decrease in deposits. Time deposits decreased 25.35 million, or 9.30 , while interest-bearing demand deposits decreased 20.39 million, or 2.99 . These decreases were offset by an increase in savings deposits of 25.39 million, or 2.99 . The yield on interest-bearing liabilities increased 68 basis points and is primarily due to increases in benchmark rates throughout 2023.

Three - Month Comparison . Noninterest expense increased 1.26 million, or 5.52 , in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same quarter of 2023. The largest increases were primarily due to increases in other operating expense and salaries and employee benefits. The increase in other operating expense of 583 thousand is largely attributable to an increase in loan and deposit fraud losses. The increase in salaries and employee benefits of 456 thousand is attributable to inflationary increases in employee salaries. 
 
 Nine- Month Comparison . Noninterest expense increased 4.06 million, or 5.94 , for the nine months ending September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023. Noninterest expense for the second quarter of 2024 included a non-recurring charge of 1.80 million to settle a putative class action lawsuit. Noninterest expense for the nine month period of 2023 included non-recurring expense of 2.39 million in merger charges related to the Surrey acquisition. Other increases include an increase in salaries and employee benefits, other operating expense, and service fees. The increases are largely attributable to the addition of Surrey branches and inflationary increases. 
 
 I ncome Tax Expense 
 
 The Company s effective tax rate, income tax as a percent of pre-tax income, may vary significantly from the statutory rate due to permanent differences and available tax credits. Permanent differences are income and expense items excluded by law in the calculation of taxable income. The Company s most significant permanent differences generally include interest income on municipal securities and increases in the cash surrender value of life insurance policies. 
 
 Three-Month Comparison . Income tax expense decreased 831 thousand, or 19.29 . The effective tax rate decreased to 21.05 in the third quarter of 2024 from 22.73 in the same quarter of 2023. 
 
 Nine-Month Comparison . Income tax expense decreased 373 thousand, or 3.38 . The effective tax rate decreased to 21.64 for the first nine months of 2024 from 23.32 in the same period of 2023. 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 In addition to financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP, we use certain non-GAAP financial measures that management believes provide investors with important information useful in understanding our operational performance and comparing our financial measures with other financial institutions. The non-GAAP financial measure presented in this report includes net interest income on a FTE basis. We believe FTE basis is the preferred industry measurement of net interest income and provides better comparability between taxable and tax exempt amounts. We use this non-GAAP financial measure to monitor net interest income performance and to manage the composition of our balance sheet. The FTE basis adjusts for the tax benefits of income from certain tax exempt loans and investments using the federal statutory rate of 21 . While we believe certain non-GAAP financial measures enhance understanding of our business and performance, they are supplemental and not a substitute for, or more important than, financial measures prepared on a GAAP basis. Our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to those reported by other financial institutions. The reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP measures are presented below.

 Financial Condition 
 
 Total assets as of September 30, 2024, decreased 44.18 million, or 1.35 , from December 31, 2023. The decrease in assets was primarily driven by decreases in the securities available-for-sale portfolio and loans. Total liabilities decreased 61.58 million, or 2.23 , and was primarily driven by a decrease in deposits. Stockholders' equity increased 17.40 million or 3.46 . 
 
 Investment Securities 
 
 Our investment securities are used to generate interest income through the employment of excess funds, to provide liquidity, to fund loan demand or deposit liquidation, and to pledge as collateral where required. The composition of our investment portfolio changes from time to time as we consider our liquidity needs, interest rate expectations, asset/liability management strategies, and capital requirements. 
 
 Available-for-sale debt securities as of September 30, 2024, decreased 114.29 million, or 40.68 , compared to December 31, 2023. The decrease is primarily due to the maturity of securities of 157.96 million during the first nine months of 2024 offset by purchases of 39.99 million. The market value of debt securities available-for-sale as a percentage of amortized cost was 93.88 as of September 30, 2024, compared to 95.23 as of December 31, 2023. 
 
 Management evaluates securities for impairment where there has been a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis of a security to determine whether there is a credit loss associated with the decline in fair value on at least a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic or market concerns warrant such evaluation. Credit losses are calculated individually, rather than collectively, using a discounted cash flow method, whereby management compares the present value of expected cash flows with the amortized cost basis of the security. The credit loss component would be recognized through the provision for credit losses and the creation of an allowance for credit losses. Consideration is given to (1) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer including looking at default and delinquency rates, (2) the outlook for receiving the contractual cash flows of the investments, (3) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, (4) our intent and ability to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value or for a debt security whether it is more-likely-than-not that we will be required to sell the debt security prior to recovering its fair value, (5) the anticipated outlook for changes in the general level of interest rates, (6) credit ratings, (7) third party guarantees, and (8) collateral values. In analyzing an issuer s financial condition, management considers whether the securities are issued by the federal government or its agencies, whether downgrades by bond rating agencies have occurred, the results of reviews of the issuer s financial condition, and the issuer s anticipated ability to pay the contractual cash flows of the investments. U.S. Treasury Securities, Agency-Backed Securities including GNMA, FHLMC, FNMA, FHLB, FFCB and SBA. All of the U.S. Treasury and Agency-Backed Securities have the full faith and credit backing of the United State Government or one of its agencies. Municipal securities and all other securities that do not have a zero expected credit loss are evaluated quarterly to determine whether there is a credit loss associated with a decline in fair value. All debt securities available-for-sale in an unrealized loss position as of September 30, 2024 continue to perform as scheduled and we do not believe that a provision for credit losses is necessary. 
 
 Loans Held for Investment 
 
 Loans held for investment, which generates the largest component of interest income, are grouped into commercial, consumer real estate, and consumer and other loan segments. Each segment is divided into various loan classes based on collateral or purpose.

The largest decrease occurred in the commercial loans segment with an overall decrease of 72.76 million, or 4.38 . Within this segment, the largest decreases occurred in construction and non-farm, non-residential loans with decreases of 31.37 million and 31.22 million, respectively. The consumer real estate segment decreased 36.58 million, or 4.62 , primarily due to a decrease in single family owner occupied of 34.05 million, or 4.89 . 
 
 Risk Elements 
 
 We seek to mitigate credit risk by following specific underwriting practices and by ongoing monitoring of our loan portfolio. Our underwriting practices include the analysis of borrowers prior credit histories, financial statements, tax returns, and cash flow projections; valuation of collateral based on independent appraisers reports; and verification of liquid assets. We believe our underwriting criteria are appropriate for the various loan types we offer; however, losses may occur that exceed the reserves established in our allowance for loan losses. We track certain credit quality indicators that include: trends related to the risk rating of commercial loans, the level of classified commercial loans, net charge-offs, nonperforming loans, and general economic conditions. The Company's loan review function performs an independent credit analysis on a risk-based sample of commercial loan relationships annually, and performs a qualitative review of a sample of smaller commercial and retail loans. 
 
 Nonperforming assets consist of nonaccrual loans, accrual loans contractually past due 90 days or more, and modified loans past due 90 days or more, and OREO. Ongoing activity in the classification and categories of nonperforming loans include collections on delinquencies, foreclosures, loan restructurings, and movements into or out of the nonperforming classification due to changing economic conditions, borrower financial capacity, or resolution efforts.

When restructuring loans for borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, we generally make concessions in interest rates, loan terms, or amortization terms. Total loans modified as of September 30, 2024, were 2.32 million. As of September 30, 2024, 326 thousand of these loans were 30-89 days past due. 
 
 OREO, which is carried at the lesser of estimated net realizable value or cost, increased 154 thousand, or 80.21 , as of September 30, 2024, compared to December 31, 2023, and consisted of 6 properties with an average holding period of approximately 2 months. The net loss on the sale of OREO totaled 29 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a net loss of 94 thousand for the same period of the prior year.

Allowance for Credit Losses 
 
 The ACL reflects management s estimate of losses that will result from the inability of our borrowers to make required loan payments. Management uses a systematic methodology to determine its ACL for loans held for investment and certain off-balance-sheet credit exposures. The ACL is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis to present the net amount expected to be collected on the loan portfolio. Management considers the effects of past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts on the collectability of the loan portfolio. The Company s estimate of its ACL involves a high degree of judgment; therefore, management s process for determining expected credit losses may result in a range of expected credit losses. It is possible that others, given the same information, may at any point in time reach a different reasonable conclusion. The Company s ACL recorded in the balance sheet reflects management s best estimate of expected credit losses. The Company recognizes in net income the amount needed to adjust the ACL for management s current estimate of expected credit losses. The Company s measurement of credit losses policy adheres to GAAP as well as interagency guidance. The Company's ACL is calculated using collectively evaluated and individually evaluated loans. 
 
 For collectively evaluated loans, the Company in general uses two modeling approaches to estimate expected credit losses. The Company projects the contractual run-off of its portfolio at the segment level and incorporates a prepayment assumption in order to estimate exposure at default. Financial assets that have been individually evaluated can be returned to a pool for purposes of estimating the expected credit loss insofar as their credit profile improves and that the repayment terms were not considered to be unique to the asset. 
 
 In addition to its own loss experience, management also includes peer bank historical loss experience in its assessment of expected credit losses to determine the ACL. The Company utilized call report data to measure historical credit loss experience with similar risk characteristics within the segments. For the majority of segment models for collectively evaluated loans, the Company incorporated at least one macroeconomic driver either using a statistical regression modeling methodology or simple loss rate modeling methodology.

Included in its systematic methodology to determine its ACL for loans held for investment and certain off-balance-sheet credit exposures. Management considers the need to qualitatively adjust expected credit losses for information not already captured in the loss estimation process. These qualitative adjustments either increase or decrease the quantitative model estimation (i.e. formulaic model results). Each period the Company considers qualitative factors that are relevant within the qualitative framework. For further discussion of our Allowance for Credit Losses - See Note 1, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the balance of the ACL for loans was 35.12 million, or 1.44 of total loans. The ACL at September 30, 2024, decreased 1.07 million from the balance of 36.19 million recorded at December 31, 2023. This decrease included a 2.82 million provision offset by net charge-offs for the nine months of 3.89 million. 
 
 The Company is working with borrowers and customers in North Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and southern West Virginia affected by the devastating floods, power outages, and water shortages from Hurricane Helene. This includes payment relief for affected borrowers. We will continue to monitor the situation over the coming weeks as it relates to asset quality. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, the Company also had an allowance for unfunded commitments of 441 thousand which was recorded in Other Liabilities on the Balance Sheet. During the first nine months of 2024, the Company recorded a recovery of provision for credit losses for loan commitments of 305 thousand compared to a provision of provision of 438 thousand recorded in the same period of 2023. 
 
 Deposits 
 
 Total deposits as of September 30, 2024, decreased 63.07 million, or 2.32 , compared to December 31, 2023. The largest decreases in deposits occurred in noninterest-bearing demand of 62.20 million, or 6.67 , and interest-bearing demand of 36.22 million, or 5.22 . Time deposits decreased 9.04 million or 3.57 . Theses decreases were offset by an increase in savings of 44.38 million or 5.26 . 
 
 Total borrowings in the form of retail repurchase agreements as of September 30, 2024, decreased 165 thousand, or 14.75 , compared to December 31, 2023. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Liquidity 
 
 Liquidity is a measure of our ability to convert assets to cash or raise cash to meet financial obligations. We believe that liquidity management should encompass an overall balance sheet approach that draws together all sources and uses of liquidity. Poor or inadequate liquidity risk management may result in a funding deficit that could have a material impact on our operations. We maintain a liquidity risk management policy and contingency funding policy Liquidity Plan to detect potential liquidity issues and protect our depositors, creditors, and shareholders. The Liquidity Plan includes various internal and external indicators that are reviewed on a recurring basis by our Asset/Liability Management Committee ALCO of the Board of Directors. ALCO reviews liquidity risk exposure and policies related to liquidity management; ensures that systems and internal controls are consistent with liquidity policies; and provides accurate reports about liquidity needs, sources, and compliance. The Liquidity Plan involves ongoing monitoring and estimation of potentially credit sensitive liabilities and the sources and amounts of balance sheet and external liquidity available to replace outflows during a funding crisis. The liquidity model incorporates various funding crisis scenarios and a specific action plan is formulated, and activated, when a financial shock that affects our normal funding activities is identified. Generally, the plan will reflect a strategy of replacing liability outflows with alternative liabilities, rather than balance sheet asset liquidity, to the extent that significant premiums can be avoided. If alternative liabilities are not available, outflows will be met through liquidation of balance sheet assets, including unpledged securities.

As a financial holding company, the Company s primary source of liquidity is dividends received from the Bank, which are subject to certain regulatory limitations. Other sources of liquidity include cash, investment securities, and borrowings. As of September 30, 2024, the Company s cash reserves and short-term investment securities totaled 6.50 million and 7.71 million, respectively. The Company s cash reserves and investments provide adequate working capital to meet obligations for the next twelve months. 
 
 In addition to cash on hand and deposits with other financial institutions, we rely on customer deposits, cash flows from loans and investment securities, and lines of credit from the FHLB and the Federal Reserve Bank FRB Discount Window to meet potential liquidity demands. These sources of liquidity are immediately available to satisfy deposit withdrawals, customer credit needs, and our operations. Secondary sources of liquidity include approved lines of credit with correspondent banks and unpledged available-for-sale securities. As of September 30, 2024, our unencumbered cash totaled 315.34 million, unused borrowing capacity from the FHLB totaled 353.31 million, available credit from the FRB Discount Window totaled 5.85 million, available lines from correspondent banks totaled 100.00 million , and unpledged available-for-sale securities totaled 139.56 million. 
 
 Capital Resources 
 
 We are committed to effectively managing our capital to protect our depositors, creditors, and shareholders. Failure to meet certain capital requirements may result in actions by regulatory agencies that could have a material impact on our operations. Total stockholders equity as of September 30, 2024, increased 17.40 million, or 3.46 , to 520.69 million from 503.29 million as of December 31, 2023. Capital increased due to net income of 38.56 million. The increase was offset by dividends declared of 16.35 million as well as the repurchase of our common stock totaling 8.72 million. Book value per share at September 30, 2024, was 28.47, an increase of 1.27 from year-end 2023. 

Capital Adequacy Requirements 
 
 Risk-based capital guidelines, issued by state and federal banking agencies, include balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet arrangements weighted by the risks inherent in the specific asset type. Our current risk-based capital requirements are based on the international capital standards known as Basel III. A description of the Basel III capital rules is included in Part I, Item 1 of the 2023 Form 10-K. Our current required capital ratios are as follows: 

4.5 Common Equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets (effectively 7.00 including the capital conservation buffer) 

6.0 Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets (effectively 8.50 including the capital conservation buffer) 

8.0 Total capital to risk-weighted assets (effectively 10.50 including the capital conservation buffer) 

4.0 Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets Tier 1 leverage ratio

Our risk-based capital ratios as of September 30, 2024, increased from December 31, 2023, primarily due to a decrease in risk weighted assets and increased capital levels. The decrease in risk-weighted assets was primarily driven by a decrease in both the loan and securities available for sale portfolios. As of September 30, 2024, we continued to meet all capital adequacy requirements and were classified as well-capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. Management believes there have been no conditions or events that would change the Bank s classification. Additionally, our capital ratios were in excess of the minimum standards under the Basel III capital rules as of September 30, 2024.

Market Risk and Interest Rate Sensitivity 
 
 Market risk represents the risk of loss due to adverse changes in current and future cash flows, fair values, earnings, or capital due to movements in interest rates and other factors. Our profitability is largely dependent upon net interest income, which is subject to variation due to changes in the interest rate environment and unbalanced repricing opportunities. We are subject to interest rate risk when interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities reprice at differing times, when underlying rates change at different levels or in varying degrees, when there is an unequal change in the spread between two or more rates for different maturities, and when embedded options, if any, are exercised. ALCO reviews our mix of assets and liabilities with the goal of limiting exposure to interest rate risk, ensuring adequate liquidity, and coordinating sources and uses of funds while maintaining an acceptable level of net interest income given the current interest rate environment. ALCO is also responsible for overseeing the formulation and implementation of policies and strategies to improve balance sheet positioning and mitigate the effect of interest rate changes. 
 
 In order to manage our exposure to interest rate risk, we periodically review internal simulation and third-party models that project net interest income at risk, which measures the impact of different interest rate scenarios on net interest income, and the economic value of equity at risk, which measures potential long-term risk in the balance sheet by valuing our assets and liabilities at fair value under different interest rate scenarios. Simulation results show the existence and severity of interest rate risk in each scenario based on our current balance sheet position, assumptions about changes in the volume and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, and estimated yields earned on assets and rates paid on liabilities. The simulation model provides the best tool available to us and the industry for managing interest rate risk; however, the model cannot precisely predict the impact of fluctuations in interest rates on net interest income due to the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Actual results will differ from simulated results due to the timing, magnitude, and frequency of interest rate changes; changes in market conditions and customer behavior; and changes in our strategies that management might undertake in response to a sudden and sustained rate shock. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Federal Open Market Committee had set the benchmark federal funds rate to a range of 475 to 500 basis points. The following table presents the sensitivity of net interest income from immediate and sustained rate shocks in various interest rate scenarios over a twelve-month period for the periods indicated:

Inflation and Changing Prices 
 
 Our consolidated financial statements and related notes are presented in accordance with GAAP, which requires the measurement of results of operations and financial position in historical dollars. Inflation may cause a rise in price levels and changes in the relative purchasing power of money. These inflationary effects are not reflected in historical dollar measurements. The primary effect of inflation on our operations is increased operating costs. In management s opinion, interest rates have a greater impact on our financial performance than inflation. Interest rates do not necessarily fluctuate in the same direction, or to the same extent, as the price of goods and services; therefore, the effect of inflation on businesses with large investments in property, plant, and inventory is generally more significant than the effect on financial institutions. 
 
 Astronomic federal government spending alongside labor shortages and supply chain complications have contributed to rising inflation. The timing and impact of inflation and rising interest rates on our business and related financial results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and difficult to predict.

Item 3. 
 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

The information required in this item is incorporated by reference to Market Risk and Interest Rate Sensitivity in Item 2 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

Item 4. 
 Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 In connection with this report, we conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO ), of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures under the Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b). Based upon that evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
 
 Disclosure controls and procedures are our Company s controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information we are required to disclose in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information we are required to disclose in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions about required disclosure. 
 
 Management, including the CEO and CFO, does not expect that our disclosure controls and internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, collusion of two or more people, or management s override of the controls. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 We assess the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting quarterly and enhance our controls in response to internal control assessments and internal and external audit and regulatory recommendations. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II. 
 OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. 
 Legal Proceedings 

We are currently a defendant in various legal actions and asserted claims in the normal course of business. Although we are unable to assess the ultimate outcome of each matter with certainty, we believe that the resolution of these actions should not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. 

ITEM 1A. 
 Risk Factors 

The risk factors set forth in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, discuss potential events, trends, or other circumstances that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity, access to capital resources, and, consequently, cause the market value of our common stock to decline. These risks could cause our future results to differ materially from historical results and expectations of future financial performance. If any of the risks occur and the market price of our common stock declines significantly, individuals may lose all, or part, of their investment in our Company. Individuals should carefully consider our risk factors and information included in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 before making an investment decision. There may be risks and uncertainties that we have not identified or that we have deemed immaterial that could adversely affect our business; therefore, such risk factors are not intended to be an exhaustive list of all risks we face. There have been no material changes to the risk factors included in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.
