 million gallons of ethanol but have a history of outperforming the nameplate capacity. The Company owns of TAMH's common units and management has determined that TAMH is a VIE in which the Company is the primary beneficiary. Accordingly, TAMH is consolidated within the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements and records noncontrolling interest for the share of the entity owned by Marathon. 
 
 ELEMENT was structured as a limited liability company which began operations in 2019 for the primary purpose of producing ethanol and additional co-products such as dried distillers grain and corn oil. The Company held of the membership units and the Company had acted as the manager of the facility. As a result, ELEMENT was concluded to be a VIE in which the Company was the primary beneficiary and had been consolidated within the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements. On April 18, 2023, ELEMENT was placed into receivership and a receiver was appointed, which took possession and control of the rights and interests of ELEMENT. With this appointment, while retaining its investment in ELEMENT, the Company ceased to have a controlling financial interest and was no longer deemed to be the primary beneficiary in the subsidiary. Accordingly, the Company deconsolidated ELEMENT at that time and began accounting for the subsidiary as an equity method investment.

Specialty Liquids Engineered Granules Total 
 
 The Nutrient Industrial segment is organized into three divisions: Ag Supply Chain, which includes wholesale distribution centers and retail farm centers; Specialty Liquids, which includes manufactured liquid products intended for agricultural and industrial uses; and Engineered Granules, which includes granular products for turf and agricultural uses, contract manufacturing and cob products. Prior period amounts above were recast to conform to this organization. 
 
 Substantially all of the Nutrient Industrial segment revenues presented in the preceding table occurred within the United States and are recorded at a point in time instead of over time. 
 
 Contract balances 
 
 The balances of the Nutrient Industrial segment's contract liabilities were million and million as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. The difference between the opening and closing balances of the Company s contract liabilities is primarily a result of timing differences between the Company s performance and the customer s payment. The main driver of the contract liabilities balance are payments for primary and specialty nutrients within the Nutrient Industrial segment received in advance of fulfilling our performance obligations under our customer contracts. Due to the seasonality of this business, contract liabilities are built up through the first quarter in preparation for the spring application season. Revenue is then recognized in the throughout the spring application season as the Company fulfills its contract obligations which is why the balance is much lower in the current quarter when compared to December 31, 2023.

 Income tax provision Effective tax rate 
 
 On a quarterly basis, the Company estimates the effective tax rate expected to be applicable for the full year and makes changes, if necessary, based on new information or events. The estimated annual effective tax rate is forecasted based on actual historical information and forward-looking estimates and is used to provide for income taxes in interim reporting periods. The Company also recognizes the tax impact of certain unusual or infrequently occurring items, such as the effects of changes in tax laws or rates and impacts from settlements with tax authorities, discretely in the quarter in which they occur. 
 
 The difference between the effective tax rate and the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21.0 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, is primarily attributable to the tax impact of noncontrolling interest and federal tax credits offset by state and local income taxes, tax impacts of foreign operations, nondeductible compensation, and changes in other discrete tax adjustments.

 The difference between the effective tax rate and the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21.0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, is primarily attributable to the tax impact of noncontrolling interest, federal tax credits, stock-based compensation, and the reversal of certain unrecognized tax benefits offset by state and local income taxes, tax impacts of foreign operations, and nondeductible compensation.

 Level 1 commodity derivatives reflect the fair value of the exchanged-traded futures and options contracts that the Company holds, net of the cash collateral, that the Company has in its margin account. 
 
 The majority of the Company s assets and liabilities measured at fair value are based on the market approach valuation technique. With the market approach, fair value is derived using prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. 
 
 The Company s net commodity derivatives primarily consist of futures or options contracts via regulated exchanges and contracts with producers or customers under which the future settlement date and bushels (or gallons in the case of ethanol contracts) of commodities to be delivered (primarily wheat, corn, soybeans and ethanol) are fixed and the price may or may not be fixed. Depending on the specifics of the individual contracts, the fair value is derived from the futures or options prices quoted on various exchanges for similar commodities and delivery dates as well as observable quotes for local basis adjustments (the difference, which is attributable to local market conditions, between the quoted futures price and the local cash price). Because basis for a particular commodity and location typically has multiple quoted prices from other agribusinesses in the same geographical vicinity and is used as a common pricing mechanism in the agribusiness industry, the Company has concluded that basis is typically a Level 2 fair value input for purposes of the fair value disclosure requirements related to our commodity derivatives, depending on the specific commodity. Although nonperformance risk, both of the Company and the counterparty, is present in each of these commodity contracts and is a component of the estimated fair values, based on the Company s historical experience with its producers and customers and the Company s knowledge of their businesses, the Company does not view nonperformance risk to be a significant input to fair value for these commodity contracts.

 (a) The Company considers observable price changes and other additional market data available to estimate fair value, including additional capital raising, internal valuation models, progress towards key business milestones, and other relevant market data points.

 Patronage income - As a part of the Company s normal operations it relies on short-term lines of credit to support working capital needs in addition to long-term debt. The Company receives patronage income from its lenders as a part of these programs. 
 
 Gain on deconsolidation of joint venture - On April 18, 2023, ELEMENT was placed into receivership. As the receiver took control of ELEMENT, under the VIE consolidation model, the Company was deemed to have lost control of the entity and therefore deconsolidated ELEMENT from its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. As a result of these activities, the Company recognized a gain on deconsolidation in the second quarter of 2023. The Company recognized an additional million gain in the first quarter of 2024 as the amount of cash distributed to the Company related to its receivables from ELEMENT exceeded management's estimate at the time of deconsolidation.

The Company purchased its ownership interest in Skyland for million in cash, subject to customary working capital adjustments, and was financed by cash on hand. 
 
 The Company will apply the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations, to account for the transaction and expect to record any purchase price accounting adjustments in the fourth quarter of 2024. The Company will record the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their fair values as of the acquisition date. Due to the limited time since the closing of the acquisition, the valuation efforts and related acquisition accounting is incomplete at the time of the filing of these unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. As a result, the Company is unable to provide amounts recognized as of the acquisition date for major classes of assets and liabilities acquired, including goodwill and other intangible assets.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 Forward Looking Statements 
 
 The following Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward-looking statements which relate to future events or future financial performance and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Such factors include, but are not limited to, the effects of economic, weather and agricultural conditions, regulatory conditions, competition globally and in the markets the Company serves, geopolitical risk, fluctuations in cost and availability of commodities, the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting and the unpredictability of existing and possible future litigation. However, it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. The reader is urged to carefully consider these risks and others, including those risk factors listed under Item 1A of the 2023 Form 10-K. In some cases, the reader can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as may, anticipates, believes, estimates, predicts, or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. These statements are only predictions. Actual events or results may differ materially. These forward-looking statements relate only to events as of the date on which the statements are made and the Company undertakes no obligation, other than any imposed by law, to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Although management believes that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 Our critical accounting policies and critical accounting estimates, as described in our 2023 Form 10-K, have not materially changed through the third quarter of 2024. 
 
 Executive Overview 
 
 Our operations are organized, managed and classified into three reportable business segments: Trade, Renewables and Nutrient Industrial. Each of these segments is generally based on the nature of products and services offered and aligns with the management structure. 
 
 The agricultural commodity-based business is one in which changes in selling prices generally move in relationship to changes in purchase prices. Therefore, increases or decreases in prices of the agricultural commodities that the business deals in will have a relatively equal impact on sales and merchandising revenues and cost of sales and merchandising revenues and a much less significant impact on gross profit. As a result, changes in sales and merchandising revenues and cost of sales and merchandising revenues between periods may not necessarily be indicative of the overall performance of the business and greater emphasis should be placed on changes in gross profit. 
 
 Trade 
 
 The Trade segment s third quarter operating results were ahead of the prior year. Results from our grain asset footprint improved when compared to the prior year, due to strong elevation margins and space income. Trade's growing specialty food and feed ingredients business continued to benefit from recent growth investments. The merchandising business remained profitable with well-supplied commodity markets and limited volatility. Prior year results also included a 19 million pretax foreign currency loss in Egypt. As expected, farmer engagement ramped up during the quarter to bring significant old crop bushels to market and forward sell new crop in anticipation of an early and robust harvest. 
 
 The portfolio mix of assets, ingredients, and merchandising businesses provides a solid foundation for us to benefit from large crops and carry markets, as well as tight, demand-driven markets. Assets are well-positioned for the anticipated early and large harvest, which should allow Trade to purchase grains at low basis levels. Domestic specialty ingredient demand is also expected to stay solid and should continue to support recent capital growth investments. 
 
 Agricultural inventories on hand were 113.2 million and 91.4 million bushels at September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, respectively. These bushels consist of inventory held at company-owned or leased facilities, transload inventory, in-transit inventory, and third-party held inventory. Total Trade storage space capacity at company-owned or leased facilities, including temporary pile storage, was approximately 170 million bushels at September 30, 2024, which is consistent with the prior year.

 Renewables 
 
 The Renewables segment's solid third quarter operating results were slightly improved when compared to the prior year. Margins on ethanol production improved year-over-year on significantly lower corn basis in the eastern plants, despite a reduction in ethanol board crush margins in the quarter. Production facilities continued to operate efficiently in the quarter with increased volume and higher ethanol yields. Plant co-product values were lower, with feed ingredients following the overall price reduction of corn despite improved demand. Renewable diesel feedstock volumes continue to grow albeit with compressed margins on industry fundamentals. All four plants completed their semi-annual maintenance shutdowns in the third quarter. A favorable ethanol margin environment should continue, supported by exports, higher blending rates and lower corn basis levels in the east. 
 
 Ethanol and related co-products volumes were as follows: Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, (in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Ethanol (gallons shipped) 212,336 190,368 585,213 575,567 E-85 (gallons shipped) 12,142 11,786 37,927 30,867 Vegetable oils (pounds shipped) (a) 
 415,505 343,619 1,191,077 908,976 DDG (tons shipped) (b) 
 636 497 1,737 1,534 
 (a) Includes corn oil, soybean oil, and other fats, oils, and greases. 
 (b) Dried distillers grains ("DDG") tons shipped converts wet tons to a dry ton equivalent amount. 
 
 Nutrient Industrial 
 
 The Nutrient Industrial segment's third quarter operating results improved from the prior year. Overall volumes improved during a seasonally slow third quarter, but margins in base nutrients have reset to more normalized levels and did not repeat outsized margin opportunities seen in recent years. The engineered granules business saw significant improvement in the quarter on higher sales volume and margins, as the Company has continued to focus on operational improvements in this business. Looking forward, the fourth quarter should benefit from high yields and an early harvest, allowing for fall applications, dependent on grower sentiment. 
 
 Storage capacity at our Ag Supply Chain and Specialty Liquids facilities, including leased storage, was approximately 457 thousand tons for dry nutrients and approximately 511 thousand tons for liquid nutrients at September 30, 2024, which is similar to the prior year. 
 
 Tons of product sold were as follows: 
 Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, (in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Ag Supply Chain 205 209 982 1,053 Specialty Liquids 62 59 270 282 Engineered Granules 39 25 161 134 Total tons 306 293 1,413 1,469 
 
 In the table above, Ag Supply Chain represents facilities principally engaged in the wholesale distribution and retail sale and application of primary agricultural nutrients such as bulk nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Specialty Liquid locations produce and sell a variety of low-salt liquid starter fertilizers, micronutrients for agricultural use, and specialty products for use in various industrial processes. Engineered Granules include a variety of corncob-based products and facilities that primarily manufacture granulated dry products for use in specialty turf and agricultural applications. 
 
 Other 
 
 Our Other activities include corporate income and expense and cost for functions that provide support and services to the operating segments. The results include expenses and benefits not allocated to the operating segments and other elimination and consolidation adjustments.

The Company uses Income (loss) before income taxes attributable to the Company, a non-GAAP financial measure as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission, to evaluate the Company s financial performance. This performance measure is not defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, GAAP financial measures. Management believes that Income (loss) before income taxes attributable to the Company is a useful measure of the Company s performance as it provides investors additional information about the Company's operations, allowing evaluation of underlying business performance and period-to-period comparability. This measure is not intended to replace or be an alternative to Income (loss) before income taxes, the most directly comparable measure reported under GAAP.

 Trade 
 
 Operating results for the Trade segment improved from the same period of the prior year. Sales and merchandising revenues decreased by 891.3 million and cost of sales and merchandising revenues decreased by 904.1 million resulting in increased gross profit of 12.8 million. A majority of the decrease in sales and merchandising revenues and cost of sales and merchandising revenues can be attributed to reduced commodity prices across all of our business lines as the oversupply of commodities has shifted to a carry market. The remainder of the decrease from the prior year can be attributed to management making a prudent decision to intentionally pull back on volumes traded in certain regions due to the recent geopolitical unrest. The 12.8 million increase in gross profit can be attributed to a 17.2 million improvement in the international merchandising business as currency liquidity issues in Egypt impacted results in the prior period. Our asset-based business realized strong elevation margins and space income in the current carry market and our specialty ingredients business continues to perform well, realizing the benefits of its recent acquisition and other growth investments. 
 
 Operating, administrative and general expenses decreased by 3.4 million. Substantially all of the decrease from the prior year can be attributed to decreased incentives. 
 
 Interest expense decreased by 1.1 million due to reduced short-term borrowings from lower commodity prices. 
 
 Renewables 
 
 Operating results for the Renewables segment increased by 2.2 million from the same period last year. Sales and merchandising revenues decreased by 122.9 million and cost of sales and merchandising revenues decreased by 130.2 million compared to prior year results. As a result, gross profit increased by 7.3 million compared to 2023 results. The decrease in both sales and merchandising revenues and cost of sales and merchandising revenues can be attributed to 23 lower ethanol prices, a similar reduction in DDG prices, and declines in values across the various renewable diesel feedstocks. Sales volumes remained consistent for the base ethanol business and increased in our feed and renewable diesel feedstocks products by 30 and 21 , respectively. The 7.3 million increase to gross profit in the current period results reflect a 10.1 million increase at the ethanol plants from efficient production combined with strong ethanol margins. The improved gross profit performance at the ethanol plants was partially offset by lower results in the third-party trading business on compressed margins despite higher sales volumes. 
 
 Other income, net decreased from the prior year by 1.6 million due to 2.2 million in USDA Biofuel Producer Program proceeds received in the third quarter of 2023 that did not recur. 
 
 Nutrient Industrial 
 
 Operating results for the Nutrient Industrial segment increased by 2.3 million compared to the same period in the prior year. Sales and merchandising revenues and cost of sales and merchandising revenues were flat from the prior year resulting in gross profit largely consistent with the prior year. Although overall gross profit was flat, our Ag Supply Chain business fell short of the prior year by 6.6 million due to a weaker margin environment as margins dropped approximately 50 from outsized levels in the prior year. This gross profit shortfall was almost entirely offset by the improved performance in our Engineered Granules and Specialty liquids businesses as both margins and volumes improved. 
 
 Operating, administrative and general expenses decreased from the prior year by 1.6 million mainly due to 1.2 million of reduced incentives from lower operating results. 
 
 Other income, net increased by 2.7 million in which substantially all of the increase from prior year was related to interest income from cash on hand. 
 
 Other 
 
 Results for the quarter declined by 2.2 million compared to the same period in the prior year. The decrease from the prior year was primarily driven by a 4.8 million revaluation gain of a cost method investment in the prior year which was partially offset by lower incentive compensation in the current year.

 Income Taxes 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded income tax expense of 10.7 million. The Company's effective tax rate was 17.3 on income before taxes of 62.2 million. The difference between the 17.3 effective tax rate and the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21 is primarily attributable to the tax impact of noncontrolling interest and federal tax credits offset by state and local income taxes, tax impacts of foreign operations, nondeductible compensation, and changes in other discrete tax adjustments. 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded income tax expense of 7.9 million. The Company's effective tax rate was 20.5 on income of 38.4 million. The difference between the 20.5 effective tax rate and the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21.0 was primarily attributable to the tax impact of noncontrolling interest offset by state and local income taxes, nondeductible compensation, and other discrete tax adjustments.

Trade 
 
 Operating results for the Trade segment decreased by 14.8 million from the prior year. Sales and merchandising revenues decreased by 2,814.3 million, and cost of sales and merchandising revenues decreased by 2,787.2 million for a decreased gross profit impact of 27.2 million. A majority of the decrease in sales and merchandising revenues and cost of sales and merchandising revenues can be attributed to reduced commodity prices across all of our business lines as the oversupply of commodities has shifted to a carry market. The remainder of the decrease from the prior year can be attributed to management making a prudent decision to intentionally pull back on volumes traded in certain regions due to the recent geopolitical unrest. Of the 27.2 million decrease in gross profit, 20.3 million was related to damaged inventory insurance recoveries recorded in the prior year within the asset-based business. This was followed by a 14.7 million decrease in the merchandising businesses as there were less trading opportunities in a less volatile commodity market, which was partially offset by 6.6 million of improved results in our specialty ingredients business as recent acquisitions and growth investments were accretive to results. 
 
 Interest expense decreased by 12.7 million due to reduced short-term borrowings from lower commodity prices. 
 
 Renewables 
 
 Operating results for Renewables increased by 39.8 million from the same period of prior year. Sales and merchandising revenues decreased by 497.0 million, and cost of sales and merchandising revenues decreased by 493.6 million compared to prior year. As a result, gross profit decreased by 3.5 million. The decrease in both sales and merchandising revenues and cost of sales and merchandising revenues can be attributed to 26 lower ethanol prices, a similar reduction in DDG prices, and declines in values across the various renewable diesel feedstocks. Sales volumes remained consistent for the base ethanol business and increased in our feed and renewable diesel feedstocks products by 16 and 31 , respectively. The 3.5 million decrease in gross profit from the prior period can mainly be attributed to margin compression in our third-party trading business. 
 
 An asset impairment charge of 87.2 million related to ELEMENT was recorded in the prior year. As ELEMENT was a consolidated subsidiary of the Company at the time, the entire impairment charge is reflected in Asset impairment. 
 
 Interest expense decreased by 3.5 million from the prior year, of which 2.2 million of the decrease was due to the deconsolidation of ELEMENT non-recourse debt with the remainder due to lower working capital usage. 
 
 Other income, net decreased from the prior year by 4.0 million as the Company recorded an additional 3.4 million in gains as a result of the deconsolidation of the ELEMENT ethanol plant in the prior year. 
 
 Nutrient Industrial 
 
 Operating results for the Nutrient Industrial segment decreased by 8.2 million when compared to the same period of the prior year. Sales and merchandising revenues decreased 91.3 million, and cost of sales and merchandising revenues decreased by 75.2 million resulting in decreased gross profit of 16.2 million. Over 90 of the decrease in sales and merchandising revenues and cost of sales and merchandising revenues was due to margin compression as the prior year experienced outsized pricing opportunities in the spring application season. Specifically, our Ag Supply Chain business was impacted the most by a lower price environment and reduced volumes from a wet and delayed spring application season, as it contributed 13.1 million of the 16.2 million gross profit shortfall when compared to the outsized prior year results. 
 
 Interest expense decreased 1.2 million from prior year due to lower working capital usage. 
 
 Other income, net increased by 2.9 million in which substantially all of the increase from prior year was related to interest income from cash on hand. 
 
 Other 
 
 Results for the quarter decreased by 4.6 million compared to the same period in the prior year due to a 4.8 million revaluation gain of a cost method investment in the prior year.

 Income Taxes 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded income tax expense of 16.9 million. The Company's effective tax rate was 12.7 on income before taxes of 133.5 million. The difference between the 12.7 effective tax rate and the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21.0 is primarily attributable to the tax impact of noncontrolling interest, federal tax credits, stock-based compensation, and the reversal of certain unrecognized tax benefits offset by state and local income taxes, tax impacts of foreign operations, and nondeductible compensation. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded an income tax expense of 23.7 million. The Company s effective tax rate was 30.5 on income before income taxes of 77.8 million. The difference between the 30.5 effective tax rate and the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21.0 is primarily attributable to the tax impact of noncontrolling interest, state and local income taxes, and nondeductible compensation, and other discrete tax adjustments. Other discrete tax adjustments include a net income tax benefit of 10.6 million, recorded on a net loss before taxes of 88.8 million related to the operations, impairment charge, and gain on deconsolidation associated with ELEMENT. 
 
 The Company s subsidiary partnership returns are under U.S. federal and certain state tax examinations for tax years 2018 through 2022. The Company s subsidiary is under federal tax examination by the Mexican tax authorities for tax year 2015. The U.S. federal, state, and Mexican tax authorities examinations could potentially be resolved within the next 12 months. The resolution of these examinations could change our unrecognized tax benefits and favorably impact income tax expense by a range of 5.7 million to 10.1 million. 
 
 On December 20, 2021, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development ("OECD") issued Pillar Two model rules introducing a global minimum tax of 15 on large corporations. Although the U.S. has not yet adopted the Pillar Two model rules, several foreign countries enacted legislation in 2023 which closely follow OECD s Pillar Two guidance to be effective January 1, 2024. The impact of Pillar Two legislation on the Company's 2024 effective tax rate is expected to be minimal. Management will continue to monitor Pillar Two legislation in our relevant jurisdictions to determine any changes to the Company's effective tax rate. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Working Capital 
 At September 30, 2024, the Company had working capital of 1,153.2 million, an increase of 33.7 million from the prior year. This increase was attributable to changes in the following components of current assets and current liabilities: 
 
 (in thousands) September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 Variance Current Assets: Cash and cash equivalents 454,065 418,055 36,010 Accounts receivable, net 756,618 816,686 (60,068) Inventories 884,339 985,292 (100,953) Commodity derivative assets current 122,326 239,595 (117,269) Other current assets 113,726 67,471 46,255 Total current assets 2,331,074 2,527,099 (196,025) Current Liabilities: Short-term debt 14,716 14,138 578 Trade and other payables 774,347 822,153 (47,806) Customer prepayments and deferred revenue 67,899 211,867 (143,968) Commodity derivative liabilities current 85,640 142,511 (56,871) Current maturities of long-term debt 27,727 27,535 192 Accrued expenses and other current liabilities 207,543 189,430 18,113 Total current liabilities 1,177,872 1,407,634 (229,762) Working Capital 1,153,202 1,119,465 33,737

Table of Contents 

 Current assets as of September 30, 2024, decreased 196.0 million in comparison to those as of September 30, 2023. This decrease related to the reduction of all current asset accounts with the exception of the increase in cash and other current assets. The decreases in these current asset accounts can largely be attributed to the reduction and stabilization of agricultural commodity prices over the last year in comparison to historically high price levels of agricultural commodities, including fertilizer, in the same period of the prior year. The decreases in the working capital asset accounts also had a direct impact on cash as the Company was not deploying cash to hold working capital as it had done in the previous year. 
 
 Current liabilities decreased 229.8 million from the prior year. Current liabilities have decreased in trade payables, customer prepayments and deferred revenue, and commodity derivative liabilities as commodity prices have continued to stabilize over the last year compared to the historically high commodity prices in the same period of the prior year. 
 
 Sources and Uses of Cash 
 Nine months ended September 30, 
 (in thousands) 2024 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 62,695 696,087 Net cash used in investing activities (90,592) (117,263) Net cash used in financing activities (162,595) (275,846) 
 
 Operating Activities 
 Operating activities provided cash of 62.7 million and 696.1 million in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in the amount of cash provided in operating activities is mainly due to an unfavorable change of 620.4 million in operating assets and liabilities through the normal course of business. Cash generation excluding working capital changes remains consistent and strong in changing markets. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 Investing activities used cash of 90.6 million through the first nine months of 2024 compared to 117.3 million in the prior period. Cash used in investing activities decreased from the prior year mainly due to reduced capital spending combined with 14.8 million in reduced spending on business acquisitions in the current year. 
 We expect to invest approximately 150 million in property, plant, and equipment in 2024, depending on project timing. Approximately 50 of capital spending will be to maintain current facilities. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 Financing activities used cash of 162.6 million and 275.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. This decrease in cash used from the prior year is mainly due to the change in the Company's borrowings on its short-term credit facility as the Company had sufficient cash on hand in 2024 to cover a large amount of settled payables and other changes in working capital. 
 
 The Company paid 19.5 million in dividends in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 18.8 million paid in the prior period. The Company paid dividends of 0.19 and 0.185 per common share in January, April, and July of 2024 and 2023, respectively. On August 15, 2024, the Company declared a cash dividend of 0.19 per common share payable on October 22, 2024, to shareholders of record on October 1, 2024. 
 
 The Company is party to borrowing arrangements with a syndicate of banks that provide a total of 1,859.4 million in borrowing capacity. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 1,841.0 million available for borrowing. 
 
 Certain of our long-term borrowings include covenants that, among other things, impose minimum levels of working capital and various debt leverage ratios. The Company is in compliance with all covenants as of September 30, 2024. In addition, certain of our long-term borrowings are collateralized by mortgages on various facilities. 
 
 The Company is typically in a net short-term borrowing position in the first two quarters of the year. The majority of these short-term borrowings bear interest at variable rates, and an increase in interest rates could have a significant impact on our profitability. In addition, periods of high grain prices could require us to make additional margin deposits on our exchange traded futures contracts. Conversely, in periods of declining prices, the Company could receive a return of cash. 
 Management believes the Company's sources of liquidity will be adequate to fund operations, capital expenditures and service indebtedness. At September 30, 2024, the Company had standby letters of credit outstanding of 3.7 million.

 For further information, refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. There were no material changes in market risk, specifically commodity and interest rate risk during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Based on an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act were effective as of September 30, 2024, to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the third quarter of 2024, identified in connection with management s evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

Part II. Other Information 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 
 The Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. Refer to Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Note 11, Commitments and Contingencies, In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims. 
 
 The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts above management s expectations, the Company s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 The business, financial condition and operating results of the Company can be affected by a number of factors, whether currently known or unknown, including but not limited to those described in Part I, Item 1A of the 2023 Form 10-K under the heading Risk Factors, any one or more of which could, directly or indirectly, cause the Company s actual financial condition and operating results to vary materially from past, or from anticipated future, financial condition and operating results. Any of these factors, in whole or in part, could materially and adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition, operating results and stock price.
