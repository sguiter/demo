Evoke Pharma, Inc. 
 Notes to Condensed Financial Statements 
 (Unaudited) 
 . The Company is a specialty pharmaceutical company focused primarily on the development and commercialization of drugs to treat gastroenterological disorders and disease. Since its inception, the Company has devoted its efforts to developing its sole product, Gimoti (metoclopramide) nasal spray, the first and only nasally-administered product indicated for the relief of symptoms in adults with acute and recurrent diabetic gastroparesis. The Company launched U.S. commercial sales of Gimoti in October 2020 through its commercial partner Eversana Life Science Services, LLC Eversana ). The Company s activities are subject to the significant risks and uncertainties associated with any specialty pharmaceutical company that has launched its first commercial product, including market acceptance of the product and the potential need to obtain additional funding for its operations. Going Concern The financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has incurred recurring losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception and expects to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future until such time, if ever, that it can generate significant revenues from the sale of Gimoti. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents. The Company anticipates that it will continue to incur losses from operations due to commercialization activities, including manufacturing Gimoti, conducting the post-marketing commitment single-dose pharmacokinetics PK clinical trial of Gimoti to characterize dose proportionality of a lower dose strength of Gimoti, and for other general and administrative costs to support the Company s operations. Both the Company and Eversana may terminate the commercial services agreement pursuant to the Net Profit Quarterly Termination Right NPQTR (as defined in Note 4); however, the Company has no intent to terminate the Eversana Agreement. Although Eversana has not exercised its right pursuant to the NPQTR, there can be no assurance it won t. Should Eversana exercise its right under the NPQTR, the Commercial Services and Loan Agreements, as described in Note 4 Commercial Services and Loan Agreement with Eversana, would also be terminated and the Company would be responsible to repay the principal and interest on the loan, which amounted to million as of September 30, 2024 , within days. As a result, there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for one year after the date these financial statements are issued. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty. The Company s net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. The Company anticipates that it will be required to raise additional funds through debt, equity or other forms of financing, such as potential collaboration arrangements, to fund future operations and continue as a going concern. There can be no assurance that additional financing will be available when needed or on acceptable terms. If the Company is not able to secure adequate additional funding, the Company may be forced to make reductions in spending, extend payment terms with suppliers, and/or suspend or curtail commercialization activities. Any of these actions could materially harm the Company s business, results of operations, financial condition and future prospects. Because the Company s business is entirely dependent on the success of Gimoti, if the Company is unable to secure additional financing, or identify and execute on strategic alternatives for Gimoti or the Company, the Company will be required to curtail all activities and may be required to liquidate, dissolve or otherwise wind down its operations. Notices of Delisting and Reverse Stock Split On May 24, 2023, the Company received a written notice from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC Nasdaq indicating that, based on the Company's stockholders equity of million as of March 31, 2023, as reported in the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2023, the Company was not in compliance with the minimum stockholders equity requirement for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) (the Minimum Stockholders Equity Requirement ). As required by Nasdaq, the Company submitted its plan to regain compliance with the Minimum Stockholders Equity Requirement and Nasdaq granted the Company an extension until November 20, 2023 to regain compliance. Following notice on November 21, 2023 from Nasdaq that the Company had not met the Minimum Stockholders Equity Requirement, the Company requested a hearing before the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the Panel and on December 9, 2023, Nasdaq notified the Company that the hearing was scheduled for February 15, 2024. On February 15, 2024, the Company had the hearing before the Panel.

million, and the potential for additional capital from the exercise of the warrants issued in the February 2024 financing. The Panel also noted that it is a requirement during the exception period that the Company provide prompt notification to the Panel of any significant events that occur during this time that may affect the Company s compliance with Nasdaq s requirements. This includes, but is not limited to, any event that may call into question the Company s ability to meet the terms of the exception granted. The Panel reserved the right to reconsider the terms of the granted exception based on any event, condition or circumstance that exists or develops that would, in the opinion of the Panel, make continued listing of the Company s securities on the Nasdaq Capital Market inadvisable or unwarranted. On May 14, 2024, the Company filed its Form 10-Q reporting approximately million in stockholders equity. On June 4, 2024, the Company was formally notified that the Panel determined that the Company has regained compliance with the Minimum Stockholders Equity Requirement. Pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5815(d)(4)(A), the Company will be subject to a discretionary panel monitor through June 4, 2025. If, within that one-year monitoring period, the Company fails to maintain compliance with any Nasdaq continued listing requirement, the Listing Qualifications Staff (the Staff of Nasdaq will issue a Delist Determination Letter, and the Company will have an opportunity to request a new hearing with the initial Panel or a newly convened Hearings Panel if the initial Panel is unavailable. Notwithstanding Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(2), the Company will not be permitted to provide the Staff with a plan of compliance with respect to any deficiency that arises during the one-year monitoring period, and the Staff will not be permitted to grant additional time for the Company to regain compliance with respect to any deficiency. As of September 30, 2024, the Company remained in compliance with the Minimum Stockholder's Equity Requirement. On February 21, 2024, the Company received a letter from Nasdaq indicating that, for the last thirty consecutive business days, the bid price for the Company's common stock had closed below the minimum per share requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the Minimum Bid Price Requirement ). In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), the Company was provided an initial period of 180 calendar days, or until August 19, 2024, to regain compliance. The letter states that Nasdaq will provide written notification that the Company has achieved compliance with its rules if at any time before August 19, 2024, the bid price of the Company's common stock closes at per share or more for a minimum of ten consecutive business days. The Nasdaq letter had no immediate effect on the listing or trading of the Company's common stock and the common stock continued to trade on The Nasdaq Capital Market. On August 15, 2024, the Company received a letter from Nasdaq stating the Company has regained compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement and the minimum bid price matter is now closed.

related to the filing of a shelf registration statement in August 2024. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had deferred offering costs of related to the public offering that was completed in February 2024, which was reclassified to additional paid-in capital in February 2024 upon completion of such offering. 
 
 and were recorded as accounts payable and accrued expenses in the condensed balance sheets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Co-payment assistance is recorded as an offset to gross revenue at the time revenue from the product sale is recognized based on expected and actual program participation. Co-pay liabilities are estimated using prescribing data available from customers. The Company's analysis also contemplates application of the constraint in accordance with the guidance, under which it determines a significant reversal of revenue would not occur in a future period. If actual results in the future vary from estimates, the Company will adjust these estimates, which could affect net product revenue and earnings in the period such variances become known. Liabilities for co-pay assistance of approximately and as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively, are classified as accounts payable and accrued expenses in the condensed balance sheets. 
 shares of the Company's common stock underlying the Pre-Funded Warrants, Modified Series A Warrants and Modified Series C Warrants described in Note 3 Stockholders Equity, are included in the weighted average outstanding common stock in the calculation of basic and diluted net loss per share due to their nominal exercise price. The Company considers Series A Warrants, Series B Warrants, Series C Warrants, and Representatives Warrants to be participating securities, because holders of such instruments participate in th e event a dividend is paid on common stock. The holders of the Series A Warrants, Series B Warrants, Series C Warrants, and

common stock units (the Common Stock Units at a public offering price of per Common Stock Unit and, to certain investors, pre-funded warrant units (the PFW Units at a public offering price of per PFW Unit (the February 2024 Offering ). Each Common Stock Unit consisted of (i) share of common stock, (ii) a Series A Warrant to purchase share of common stock (the Series A Warrant ), (iii) a Series B Warrant to purchase share of common stock (the Series B Warrant ), and (iv) a Series C Warrant to purchase share of common stock (the Series C Warrant ). Each PFW Unit consisted of (i) a pre-funded warrant to purchase one share of common stock (the Pre-Funded Warrants ), (ii) a Series A Warrant, (iii) a Series B Warrant, and (iv) a Series C Warrant. The Company also issued warrants to the Underwriters to purchase up to shares of common stock, equal to of the securities sold in the February 2024 Offering (the Representatives Warrants ). The Series A Warrants are fully exercisable and recognized as a freestanding instrument. In accordance with the terms and provisions of the Series C Warrants, the Series C Warrants are not exercisable, in part or in whole, at any time unless the Series B Warrants have been exercised. If Series B Warrants are not exercised before November 13, 2024, the corresponding Series C Warrants are no longer deemed outstanding and cannot be exercised. Furthermore, the Series B Warrants and Series C Warrants cannot be transferred by the holder without the consent of the Company, and, therefore the Series B Warrants and Series C Warrants are accounted for as a single unit of account. Net cash proceeds from the February 2024 Offering was million after deducting underwriter and offering expenses. The Pre-Funded Warrants, Series A Warrants, Series B Warrants, and Series C Warrants are equity classified and were recognized as additional paid-in capital in the condensed balance sheets.

million of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants, and/or units, subject to the Baby Shelf Limitation which limits the amount that the million . The Shelf Registration Statement was declared effective by the SEC on September 6, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, there have been shares of common stock nor preferred stock, debt securities, warrants, and/or units issued under the August 2024 Shelf Registration Statement. At The Market Equity Offering The Company had previously entered into a Sales Agreement (the Sales Agreement with H.C. Wainwright Co., LLC Wainwright ), under which the Company may, from time to time, sell shares of its common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to approximately million through Wainwright (the ATM Offering ). The Shelf Registration Statement included a prospectus covering the offering, issuance and sale of up to approximately million of the Company s common stock from time to time through the ATM Offering. The shares to be sold under the Sales Agreement may be issued and sold pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement. The Company did t issue any shares of common stock in the ATM Offering during the three month period ended September 30, 2024. Warrant Amendments In each of March, June and September 2024, the Company entered into substantially similar amendments with certain holders of its Series B Warrants and Series C Warrants (individually, the March 2024 Warrant Amendment, June 2024 Warrant Amendment, and the September 2024 Warrant Amendment, respectively and collectively, the Warrant Amendments ). Pursuant to the Warrant Amendments, to the extent a holder exercised its Series B Warrants prior to their respective exercise deadlines, as defined in the amendment documents (the Amendment Exercise Deadline ), the holder s corresponding Series C Warrants vested and were exercisable for the lesser of (i) three times the number of Series B Warrants exercised by the Holder and (ii) the total number of Series C Warrants outstanding to the holder. Following each Amendment Exercise Deadline, if the holder exercised any remaining Series B Warrants, the remaining Series C Warrants, if any, vested and became exercisable on a one-for-one basis as to the same number of Series B Warrants exercised. The Warrant Amendments allowed a holder to elect to receive Pre-Funded Warrants upon exercise of Series B Warrants and Series C Warrants in lieu of shares of the Company s common stock, at a purchase price of per warrant exercised and an exercise price of per Pre-Funded Warrant. Net cash proceeds from the March, June and September 2024 Warrant Amendment were million, million and million, respectively, after deducting underwriter commissions and offering expenses. The Warrant Amendments were entered into to encourage the exercise of Series B Warrants in order to obtain capital to meet the Minimum Stockholders Equity Requirement. The Warrant Amendments neither changed the number of shares of common stock underlying each series of warrants nor its equity classification. The incremental change in fair value from the Warrant Amendments was accounted for as equity issuance costs and recognized within additional paid-in capital in the condensed balance sheets. September 2024 Exercise Price Warrant Amendment In September 2024, the Company also entered into an amendment with certain holders of its Series A Warrants, Series B Warrants and Series C Warrants (the September 2024 Exercise Price Warrant Amendment ). Pursuant to the September 2024 Exercise Price Warrant Amendment, such holders agreed to pay a non-refundable up-front payment of per Series A Warrant or Series C Warrant to reduce the exercise price of the Series A Warrants and Series C Warrants from to (such Series A Warrants and Series C Warrants modified to have a reduced exercise price referred to as the Modified Series A Warrants and Modified Series C Warrants ).

The September 2024 Exercise Price Warrant Amendment was entered to encourage the modification of Series A Warrants and Series C Warrants in order to obtain capital to meet the Minimum Stockholders Equity Requirement.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan Stock-based compensation expense also includes charges related to common stock issued under the Amended and Restated 2013 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the ESPP ). The Company allows eligible employees to purchase shares of the Company s common stock through payroll deductions at a price equal to of the lesser of the fair market value of the Company s common stock on the first trading day of the offering period or on the applicable purchase date. The offering period is determined by the compensation committee and may be up to 27 months long. Pursuant to the approval of the ESPP, current offering periods commence on each of September 1 and March 1 during the term. Purchase dates will be set for the last trading day in each six-month and will occur on each of August 31 and February 28 (unless such days are not trading days). In January 2024, the number of shares of common stock available for issuance under the ESPP was increased by shares as a result of the automatic increase provision in the ESPP. During the third quarter of 2024, an offering period was initiated. There have been shares of common stock issued under the ESPP during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, shares under the ESPP remain available for purchase.

 of net product profits once both parties costs are reimbursed. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, approximately million and million of Eversana profit sharing costs were included as selling, general and administrative costs, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, approximately million and million of Eversana profit sharing costs were included as selling, general and administrative costs, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, unreimbursed commercialization costs to Eversana were approximately million. Such costs will generally be payable only as net product profits are recognized or upon certain termination events. Eversana will receive reimbursement of its commercialization costs pursuant to an agreed upon budget and a percentage of product profits in the mid-to-high teens. Net product profits are the net sales (as defined in the Eversana Agreement) of Gimoti, less (i) reimbursed commercialization costs, (ii) manufacturing and administrative costs set at a fixed percentage of net sales, and (iii) third party royalties. During the term of the Eversana Agreement, Eversana agreed to not market, promote, or sell a competing product in the United States. , unless terminated earlier pursuant to its terms. This amendment also increased the percentage of net product profit retained by the Company and increased the proportion of costs that are reimbursed to Eversana to the extent Eversana has accumulated unreimbursed costs . Upon expiration or termination of the agreement, the Company will retain all profits from product sales and assume all corresponding commercialization responsibilities. Within 30 days after each of the first three annual anniversaries of commercial launch, either party may terminate the agreement if net sales of Gimoti do not meet certain annual thresholds. Either party may terminate the agreement: for the material breach of the other party, subject to a 60-day cure period; in the event an insolvency, petition of the other party is pending for more than 60 days; upon 30 days written notice to the other party if Gimoti is subject to a safety recall; the other party is in breach of certain regulatory compliance representations under the agreement; if the Company discontinues the development or production of Gimoti; if the net profit is negative for any two consecutive calendar quarters (the Net Profit Quarterly Termination Right beginning with the measurement date of June 30, 2023; if the cumulative net product profits fail to reach certain thresholds in the first three years following launch; or if there is a change in applicable laws that makes operation of the services as contemplated under the agreement illegal or commercially impractical. Either party may also terminate the Eversana Agreement upon a change of control of the Company s ownership. The Company's net profits were negative for the two preceding calendar quarters as of September 30, 2024, and therefore, Eversana or the Company can exercise the Net Profit Quarterly Termination Right during the 60-day period after quarter-end. Since the note payable and accrued interest payable can be accelerated by Eversana by terminating the Eversana Agreement as of September 30, 2024, those payments were recorded as current liabilities as of September 30, 2024. Each party will continue to have the option to exercise the Net Profit Quarterly Termination Right for the 60-day period following the end of future quarters so long as the net profit under the Eversana Agreement remains negative for consecutive quarters. In the event that the Company initiates such termination, the Company shall pay to Eversana a one-time payment equal to all of Eversana s unreimbursed cost plus a portion of Eversana s commercialization costs incurred in the 12 months prior to termination. Such payment amount would be reduced by the amount of previously reimbursed commercialization costs and profit split paid for the related prior twelve-month period and any revenue which occurred prior to the termination yet to be collected. If Eversana terminates the agreement due to an uncured material breach by the Company, or if the Company terminates the Eversana Agreement in certain circumstances, i ncluding pursuant to the Net Profit Quarterly Termination Right, the Company has agreed to reimburse Eversana for its unreimbursed commercialization costs for the prior twelve-month period and certain other costs. In addition, Eversana may terminate the Eversana Agreement if the Company withdraws Gimoti from the market for more than 90 days. If Eversana terminates the Eversana Agreement for convenience, the Company is under no obligation to reimburse Eversana for unreimbursed commercialization costs.

 Overview 
 We are a specialty pharmaceutical company focused primarily on the development and commercialization of drugs to treat gastrointestinal, or GI, disorders and diseases. Since our inception, we have devoted our efforts to developing our sole product, Gimoti (metoclopramide) nasal spray, the first and only nasally-administered product indicated for the relief of symptoms in adults with acute and recurrent diabetic gastroparesis. In June 2020, we received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for our 505(b)(2) New Drug Application, or NDA, for Gimoti. We launched commercial sales of Gimoti in the United States in October 2020 through our commercial partner Eversana. 
 Diabetic gastroparesis is a GI disorder affecting millions of patients worldwide, in which food in an individual s stomach takes too long to empty resulting in a variety of serious GI symptoms and systemic metabolic complications. The gastric delay caused by gastroparesis can compromise absorption of orally administered medications. In May 2023, we reported results from a study conducted by Eversana which showed diabetic gastroparesis patients taking Gimoti had significantly fewer physician office visits, emergency department visits, and inpatient hospitalizations compared to patients taking oral metoclopramide. This overall lower health resource utilization reduced patient and payor costs by approximately 15,000 during a six-month time period for patients taking Gimoti compared to patients taking oral metoclopramide. 
 In January 2020, we entered into a commercial services agreement with Eversana, or the Eversana Agreement, for the commercialization of Gimoti. Pursuant to the Eversana Agreement, Eversana commercializes and distributes Gimoti in the United 
 16 

States. Eversana also manages the marketing of Gimoti to targeted health care providers, as well as the sales and distribution of Gimoti in the United States. Eversana also provided a 5 million revolving credit facility, or the Eversana Credit Facility, that became available upon FDA approval of the Gimoti NDA. In 2020 we borrowed 5 million under the Eversana Credit Facility, which expires on December 31, 2026, unless terminated earlier pursuant to its terms. 
 We have primarily funded our operations through the sale of our convertible preferred stock prior to our initial public offering in September 2013, borrowings from loans, and the sale of shares of our common stock, warrants, and pre-funded warrants in public offerings. We launched commercial sales of Gimoti in late October 2020 with Eversana and, to date, have generated modest sales. 
 We have incurred losses in each year since our inception. These operating losses resulted from expenses incurred in connection with advancing Gimoti through development activities, pre-commercial and commercialization activities, and other general and administrative costs associated with our operations. We expect to continue to incur operating losses until revenues from sales of Gimoti exceed our expenses, if ever. We may never become profitable, or if we do, we may not be able to sustain profitability on a recurring basis. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately 11.3 million. Current cash on hand is intended to fund commercialization activities for Gimoti, including manufacturing Gimoti, conducting the post-marketing commitment single-dose pharmacokinetics, or PK, clinical trial of Gimoti to characterize dose proportionality of a lower dose strength of Gimoti and any additional development activities should we seek additional indications, protecting our intellectual property portfolio and for other general and administrative costs to support our operations. We believe, based on our current operating plan, excluding any potential early repayment of the Eversana Credit Facility, that our existing cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024, as well as cash flows from future net sales of Gimoti, will be sufficient to fund our operations into the fourth quarter of 2025. However, should Eversana terminate the Eversana Agreement under the NPQTR (as defined in Note 1 to our financial statements), repayment of the Eversana Credit Facility, in addition to our other ongoing obligations, would raise substantial doubt out our ability to continue as a going concern. As such, we have concluded there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern as our existing cash on hand as of September 30, 2024, is not sufficient to fund our operations 12 months from the issuance of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. This period could be further shortened if future net sales of Gimoti are less than expected or if there are any significant increases in planned spending on commercialization activities, including for marketing and manufacturing of Gimoti, and our selling, general and administrative costs to support operations, including as a result of any termination of the Eversana Agreement. We anticipate that we will be required to raise additional funds in order to continue as a going concern. Because our business is entirely dependent on the success of Gimoti, if we are unable to secure additional financing or identify and execute on other development or strategic alternatives for Gimoti or our company, we will be required to curtail all of our activities and may be required to liquidate, dissolve or otherwise wind down our operations. Any of these events could result in a complete loss of your investment in our securities. 
 Nasdaq Listing and Reverse Stock Split 
 On May 24, 2023, we received a written notice from Nasdaq indicating that, based on our stockholders equity of 2.1 million as of March 31, 2023, as reported in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2023, we were not in compliance with the minimum stockholders equity requirement for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1), or the Minimum Stockholders Equity Requirement. As required by Nasdaq, we submitted our plan to regain compliance with the Minimum Stockholders Equity Requirement and Nasdaq granted us an extension until November 20, 2023 to regain compliance. Following notice on November 21, 2023 from Nasdaq that we had not met the Minimum Stockholders Equity Requirement, we requested a hearing before the Nasdaq Hearings Panel, or the Panel, and on December 9, 2023, Nasdaq notified us that the hearing was scheduled for February 15, 2024. On February 15, 2024, we had the hearing before the Panel. 
 On March 18, 2024, we announced that the Panel granted our request to continue our listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market, subject to the filing a Form 10-Q on or before May 15, 2024, demonstrating that, as of March 31, 2024, we are in compliance with the Minimum Stockholders Equity Requirement. The Panel noted our steps to maintain compliance with the Minimum Stockholders Equity Requirement on a long-term basis, including the equity financing completed in February 2024, which provided us net proceeds of 6.2 million, and the potential for additional capital from the exercise of the warrants issued in the February 2024 financing. The Panel also noted that it is a requirement during the exception period that we provide prompt notification to the Panel of any significant events that occur during this time that may affect our compliance with Nasdaq s requirements. This includes, but is not limited to, any event that may call into question our ability to meet the terms of the exception granted. The Panel reserved the right to reconsider the terms of the granted exception based on any event, condition or circumstance that exists or develops that would, in the opinion of the Panel, make continued listing of our securities on the Nasdaq Capital Market inadvisable or unwarranted. 
 On May 14, 2024, we filed its Form 10-Q reporting approximately 3.5 million in stockholders equity. 
 On June 4, 2024, we were formally notified that the Panel determined that we have regained compliance with the Minimum Stockholders Equity Requirement. Pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5815(d)(4)(A), we will be subject to a discretionary panel monitor through June 4, 2025. If, within that one-year monitoring period, we fail to maintain compliance with any Nasdaq continued listing requirement, the Listing Qualifications Staff, or the Staff, of Nasdaq will issue a Delist Determination Letter, and we will have 
 17 

an opportunity to request a new hearing with the initial Panel or a newly convened Hearings Panel if the initial Panel is unavailable. Notwithstanding Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(2), we will not be permitted to provide the Staff with a plan of compliance with respect to any deficiency that arises during the one-year monitoring period, and the Staff will not be permitted to grant additional time for us to regain compliance with respect to any deficiency. 
 On February 21, 2024, we received a letter from Nasdaq indicating that, for the last thirty consecutive business days, the bid price for our common stock had closed below the minimum 1.00 per share requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2), or the Minimum Bid Price Requirement. 
 In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), we were provided an initial period of 180 calendar days, or until August 19, 2024, to regain compliance. The letter states that Nasdaq will provide written notification that we have achieved compliance with its rules if at any time before August 19, 2024, the bid price of our common stock closes at 1.00 per share or more for a minimum of ten consecutive business days. The Nasdaq letter had no immediate effect on the listing or trading of our common stock and the common stock continued to trade on The Nasdaq Capital Market. 
 In May 2024, our stockholders granted our board of directors the authority to effect a reverse stock split of our outstanding common stock. In order to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement by August 19, 2024, on July 31, 2024, we filed an amendment, or the Amendment, to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to effectuate a reverse stock split of our common stock. Pursuant to the Amendment, at the effective time of 12:01 a.m. Eastern Time on August 1, 2024, each twelve (12) shares of our common stock issued and outstanding was combined into one (1) validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock, or the Reverse Stock Split. The par value and the authorized shares of our common stock were not adjusted as a result of the Reverse Stock Split. All of our issued and outstanding common stock, warrants to purchase common stock, options to purchase common stock, per-share data and related information have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the Reverse Stock Split for all periods presented. 
 On August 15, 2024, we received a letter from Nasdaq stating we had regained compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement and the minimum bid price matter is now closed. 
 Financial Operations Overview 
 Revenue Recognition 
 Our ability to generate revenue and become profitable depends on our ability to successfully commercialize Gimoti, which we launched in the United States through prescription in October 2020 through our commercial partner Eversana. If we or Eversana fail to successfully grow sales of Gimoti, we may never generate significant revenues and our results of operations and financial position will be adversely affected. 
 In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , we recognize revenue when a customer obtains control of promised goods in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for the goods provided. Customer control is determined upon the customer s physical receipt of the product. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements within the scope of ASC 606, we perform the following five steps: identify the contracts with the customer; identify the performance obligations in the contract; determine the transaction price; allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and recognize revenue when (or as) it satisfies a performance obligation. At contract inception, we assess the goods promised within each contract and determine those that are performance obligations and assess whether each promised good is distinct. We then recognize as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when the customer obtains control of the product. 
 Product revenues are recorded net of sales-related adjustments, wherever applicable, including patient support programs, rebates, and other sales related discounts. We use judgment to estimate variable consideration. We are subject to rebates under Medicaid and Medicare programs. The rebates for these programs are determined based on statutory provisions. We estimate Medicaid and Medicare rebates based on the expected number of claims and related cost associated with the customer transaction. 
 We also make estimates about co-payment assistance to commercially insured patients meeting certain eligibility requirements, as well as to uninsured patients. Co-payment assistance is recorded as an offset to gross revenue at the time revenue from the product sale is recognized based on expected and actual program participation. Co-pay liabilities are estimated using prescribing data available from customers. Actual amounts of consideration ultimately received may differ from our estimates. If actual results in the future vary from estimates, we will adjust these estimates, which would affect net product revenue and earnings in the period such variances become known. Liabilities for Medicare and Medicaid rebates, as well as co-pay assistance, are classified as accounts payable and accrued expenses in the balance sheets. 
 Sales of Gimoti Metrics 
 Gimoti prescriptions, prescribers, and other revenue metrics continue to increase. Net product sales during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, were approximately 2.7 million which is a 0.1 million increase compared to net product sales for the quarter 
 18 

ended June 30, 2024. Gimoti pharmacy services were fully transitioned to ASPN Pharmacy, or ASPN, from vitaCare Prescription Services, or vitaCare, during the fourth quarter of 2023. The ASPN platform offers a seamless path for processing and filling prescriptions, helps patients understand coverage and identify available savings opportunities, and facilitates communications between providers and payors. We believe this transition has improved the proportion of prescriptions covered by insurance payors through increased patient communication and electronic automation of processes and speed of communication. In addition to the ASPN transition, we added several new pharmacies to our pharmacy platform during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which has allowed for better insurance coverages due to geographic restrictions for filling prescriptions. Adding pharmacies has also added redundancy and capacity to fill prescriptions and reduced reliance on having a single pharmacy partner. ASPN is now processing inbound prescriptions at a pace that is showing improved patient capture and conversion to reimbursed fills by insurers, and reduced reliance on savings programs. 
 There were approximately 1,602 new inbound prescriptions into the ASPN reimbursement center during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, which is a slight decrease compared to the quarter ended June 30, 2024. Copay coverage expenses were relatively flat compared to the quarter ended June 30, 2024, as patients have worked through copay deductibles, resulting in an increased proportion of covered prescriptions. Patients who have an opportunity to refill the product (that is, patients who have completed their first fill and have additional refills on their prescription) received a refill approximately 71 of the time. We believe some patients choose not to refill their prescriptions due to remission of symptoms. Cumulatively, new prescribers increased 8 during the quarter ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 The ASPN team accesses the Medicare and Medicaid systems to facilitate product reimbursement submissions for patients seeking treatment. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, these government programs made up approximately 34 of the filled prescriptions for Gimoti. From the commercial launch of Gimoti through September 30, 2024, the majority of patients have been between the ages of 31 and 65 years old. The vast majority of patients are female and were being treated by a gastroenterologist, or a nurse practitioner or physician assistant on their staff. 
 In October 2024, we announced the presentation of data studying diabetic gastroparesis DGP patients using glucagon-like peptide-1 GLP-1 receptor agonists and also using GIMOTI (metoclopramide nasal spray) at the American College of Gastroenterology ACG 2024 Annual Meeting. The real-world retrospective study evaluated the impact of GIMOTI in patients with DGP who were concurrently using GLP-1 receptor agonists. GLP-1 drugs are commonly prescribed for type 2 diabetes, and with the significant increase in usage of GLP-1 medications, there have been increasing reports of these drugs exacerbating gastrointestinal symptoms, specifically gastroparesis, due to their mechanism of action which delays gastric emptying. The study compared healthcare resource utilization HRU between patients using GIMOTI nasal metoclopramide NMCP and those on oral metoclopramide OMCP ), specifically focusing on individuals with a prior GLP-1 prescription. Adult patients with a DGP diagnosis and at least 6 months of data pre- and post-index (treatment initiation), continuous data were included. Significant reductions in both all-cause and gastroparesis-related office and emergency room visits were observed in patients treated with GIMOTI versus oral metoclopramide. 
 
 Key Study Findings Presented at ACG 2024 include- 
 19 

Patients with prior GLP-1 history had reduced HRU after taking NMCP. 

o In NMCP patients, all-cause emergency department (ED) visits decreased by 55 (mean [SD]: 0.25 [1.13] post-index vs. 0.55 [1.30] pre-index; P=0.063); and 

o DGP- related ED visits decreased by 28 (mean [SD]: 0.18 [0.99] post-index vs 0.25 [1.28] pre-index; P=0.203) 

In patients taking GLP-1, those that took NMCP had fewer healthcare visits compared to those taking OMCP. 

o All-cause and DGP-related ED visits were 91 lower (cIRR: 0.09, 95 CI: 0.01, 0.42; P=0.001) and 89 lower (cIRR: 0.11, 95 CI: 0, 0.93; P=0.046) for NMCP vs. OMCP; and 

o All-cause and DGP-related office visits were 41 lower (cIRR: 0.59, 95 CI: 0.37, 0.94; P=0.027) and 66 lower (cIRR: 0.34, 95 CI: 0.017, 0.65; P=0.001) for NMCP vs.OMCP. 

NMCP can be used to effectively treat patients with gastroparesis taking GLP-1 treatment and avoid costly healthcare visits. 

o All-cause clinic, outpatient, and inpatient visits showed similar trends favoring NMCP vs. OMCP. 

o In DGP patients with a prior claim for GLP-1, NMCP use was associated with numerically and significantly reduced all-cause and DGP-related HRU compared to pre-treatment utilization and OMCP-treated controls. 

The study's specific cohort consisted of 92 total patients between the nasal metoclopramide (NMCP, N=51) and oral metoclopramide (OMCP, N=41) groups. The NMCP group had a slightly older average age (55.1 years) compared to the OMCP group (53.1 years). A notable portion of the NMCP group (31.4 had experienced hospitalizations or emergency department visits prior to treatment, compared to 19.5 in the OMCP group. 
 
 A separate post-hoc analysis focused on safety data for a female subgroup from a previous Phase 3 study that included 36 women using GLP-1 drugs during the 28-day study. The patients had an average age of 51.4 years, with 67 identifying as Caucasian and 33 as Black. Among these, 13 were treated with GIMOTI and 23 with placebo. The majority (94 of the participants completed the study, with no serious adverse events reported in either group. This analysis indicated no series safety issues and a trend toward nausea improvement when GLP-1 drugs were used with NMCP. 
 
 Key Opinion Leaders, or KOLs, are actively presenting data regarding the safety profile for Gimoti. Data presented at the May 2024 Digestive Disease Week indicated a far lower incidence of tardive dyskinesia, or TD, than previously published. This retrospective data was generated from a U.S. based database covering over 270 million patient lives. The outcome showed a 0.12 incidence of TD for gastroparesis patients taking any form of metoclopramide for any diagnosis. 
 20 

At the May 2023 Digestive Disease Week conference, a head-to-head (oral v. nasal metoclopramide), real world evidence data in 514 patients was presented. Compared to patients in the oral metoclopramide cohort, patients taking Gimoti experienced fewer visits to a physician s office and emergency room (60 reduction), and had fewer inpatient admissions (68 reduction). This was elevated to the top plenary presentation for the conference by the clinical gastroenterology selection committee for the conference. To our knowledge, this study is the first such head-to-head data ever to be presented regarding the product and a clear support for improved outcomes for patients using Gimoti. This data was further validated in October 2023 at the American College of Gastroenterology conference, when the related cost data was presented at a plenary session showing a 15,000 savings for those patients taking Gimoti compared to oral metoclopramide over the six-month period following initiation of therapy. These data have recently been provided to our commercialization field force to inform physicians and payers of the potential benefits seen in these real-world trials. 
 Research and Development Expenses 
 We expense all research and development expenses as they are incurred. Research and development expenses primarily include: 
 clinical and regulatory-related costs; 

expenses incurred under agreements with contract research organizations, or CROs; 

manufacturing and stability testing costs and related supplies and materials used in clinical trials; and 

employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits, travel and stock-based compensation expense. 

All of our research and development expenses to date have been incurred in connection with the development of Gimoti. Since FDA approval of Gimoti in June 2020, research and development costs have decreased and shifted to commercialization and selling costs. We are in discussion with FDA related to the design, for an FDA post-marketing commitment single-dose PK clinical trial of Gimoti to characterize dose proportionality of a lower dose strength of Gimoti to accommodate patients that may require further dosage adjustments. We are unable to estimate with any certainty the costs we will incur related to this trial, or the regulatory review of such lower dose of Gimoti, though such costs may be significant and will substantially increase research and development expenses once this trial is initiated. We may also incur additional costs to the extent we pursue additional clinical trials to expand the indication of Gimoti. Clinical development timelines, the probability of success and development costs can differ materially from expectations. 
 The costs of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project owing to, but not limited to, the following: 
 per subject trial costs; 

the number of sites included in the trials; 

the length of time required to enroll eligible subjects; 

the number of subjects that participate in the trials; 

the number of doses that subjects receive; 

the cost of comparative agents used in trials; 

the drop-out or discontinuation rates of subjects; 

potential additional safety monitoring or other studies requested by regulatory agencies; and 

the duration of patient follow-up. 

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related benefits, including stock-based compensation. Other selling, general and administrative expenses include professional fees for accounting, tax, patent costs, legal services, insurance, facility costs and costs associated with being a publicly-traded company, including fees associated with investor relations and directors and officers liability insurance premiums. We expect that selling, general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as we continue to progress with the commercialization of Gimoti and we reimburse Eversana from the net profits attained from the sales of Gimoti. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates 
 O ur management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our condensed financial statements, which we have prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed financial statements, as well as the reported expenses during the reporting periods. We evaluate these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of 
 21 

which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 There have been no new or significant changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates discussed in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on May 14, 2024, except as it relates to the fair value of warrants as discussed below. 
 Fair Value of Warrants 
 Upon issuance and modification, warrants are measured at fair value and reviewed for the appropriate classification (liability or equity). Equity classified warrants are valued using an option pricing model (OPM), such as a Black-Scholes, based on the applicable assumptions, or a Monte-Carlo simulation to model the future stock price as an input to a Black-Scholes model for combined warrants. We re-evaluate the classification of our warrants at each subsequent quarterly period end date while the warrants are outstanding to determine the proper balance sheet classification. The assumptions used in the OPM include, but are not limited to, the market price of our common stock, which is a level 1 assumption, our volatility and the risk-free interest rate, which are level 2 assumptions, and the dividend yield and the expected term the warrants will be held prior to exercise, which are level 3 assumptions.

Net Product Sales. Net product sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 increased by approximately 1.1 million. The increase in product sales is due to increased product adoption as commercialization efforts continue, expanded pharmacy networks, and a greater number of physicians within larger gastroenterology teams prescribing Gimoti after first-physician adoption. 
 Cost of Goods Sold. Cost of goods sold for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 increased by approximately 0.1 million due to the timing of completion of stability testing on commercial batches of Gimoti. 
 Research and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 increased due to personnel-related costs. 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 increased by approximately 0.7 million. Costs incurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024 primarily included approximately 0.7 million for wages, taxes and employee insurance, including approximately 0.1 million of stock-based compensation expense, approximately 2.5 million for marketing and Eversana profit sharing, and approximately 0.5 million for legal, accounting, directors and officers liability insurance and other costs associated with being a public company. Costs incurred during the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily included approximately 1.0 million for wages, taxes and employee insurance, including approximately 0.3 million of stock-based compensation expense, approximately 1.5 million for marketing and Eversana profit sharing, and approximately 0.6 million for legal, accounting, directors and officers liability insurance and other costs associated with being a public company.

Net Product Sales. Net product sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 increased by approximately 3.4 million. The increase in product sales is due to increased product adoption as commercialization efforts continue, expanded pharmacy network, and a greater number of physicians within larger gastroenterology teams prescribing Gimoti after first-physician adoption. 
 Cost of Goods Sold. Cost of goods sold for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 increased by approximately 0.1 million, primarily due to the timing of completion of stability testing on commercial batches of Gimoti. 
 Research and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 decreased by approximately 0.1 million due to fewer expenses for ongoing stability testing of batches of Gimoti manufactured prior to receipt of FDA approval of the Gimoti NDA in June 2020. 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 increased by approximately 2.0 million. Costs incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily included approximately 2.3 million for wages, taxes and employee insurance, including approximately 0.5 million of stock-based compensation expense, approximately 6.5 million for marketing and Eversana profit sharing, and approximately 1.6 million for legal, accounting, directors and officers liability insurance and other costs associated with being a public company. Costs incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily included approximately 3.0 million for wages, taxes and employee insurance, including approximately 0.8 million of stock-based compensation expense, approximately 3.4 million for marketing and Eversana profit sharing, and approximately 1.9 million for legal, accounting, directors and officers liability insurance and other costs associated with being a public company. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 The financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has incurred recurring losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception and expects to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future until such time, if ever, that it can generate significant revenues from the sale of Gimoti. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had approximately 11.3 million in cash and cash equivalents. The Company anticipates that it will continue to incur losses from operations due to commercialization activities, including manufacturing Gimoti, conducting the post-marketing commitment single-dose pharmacokinetics PK clinical trial of Gimoti to characterize dose proportionality of a lower dose strength of Gimoti, and for other general and administrative costs to support the Company s operations. Both the Company and Eversana may terminate the commercial services agreement pursuant to the Net Profit Quarterly Termination Right (NPQTR) (as defined in Note 4); however, the Company has no intent to terminate the Eversana Agreement. Although Eversana has not exercised its right pursuant to the NPQTR, and we believe it has no intent to do so, there can be no assurance it won t. Should Eversana exercise its right under the NPQTR, the Commercial Services and Loan Agreement, as described in Note 4 Commercial Services and Loan Agreement with Eversana, would also be terminated and the Company would be responsible to repay the principal and interest on the loan, which amounted to 7.0 million as of September 30, 2024, within 90 days. As a result, the Company believes that there is substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern for one year after the date these financial statements are issued. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 
 The Company anticipates that it will be required to raise additional funds through debt, equity or other forms of financing, such as potential collaboration arrangements, to fund future operations and continue as a going concern on a short-term and long-term basis while it achieves profitability. There can be no assurance that additional financing will be available when needed or on acceptable terms. Because our business is entirely dependent on the success of Gimoti, if we are unable to secure additional financing or identify and execute on other development or strategic alternatives for Gimoti or our company, we will be required to curtail all of our activities and may be required to liquidate, dissolve or otherwise wind down our operations. 
 Recent Events 
 In February 2024, we sold 427,886 common stock units (the Common Stock Units ), at a public offering price of 8.16 per Common Stock Unit and, to certain investors, 491,221 pre-funded warrant units (the PFW Units ), at a public offering price of 8.1588 per PFW Unit. Each Common Stock Unit consists of (i) one share of common stock, (ii) a Series A Warrant to purchase one share of common stock (the Series A Warrant ), (iii) a Series B Warrant to purchase one share of common stock (the Series B Warrant ), and (iv) a Series C Warrant to purchase one share of common stock (the Series C Warrant ). Each PFW Unit consists of (i) a pre-funded warrant to purchase one share of common stock, (ii) a Series A Warrant, (iii) a Series B Warrant, and (iv) a Series C Warrant. After deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses paid by us, the estimated net proceeds to us from this offering were approximately 6.2 million. 
 As discussed in Note 3 Stockholders Equity, during March, June and September 2024, we amended certain warrant agreements with our Series B and Series C warrant holders (the Warrant Amendments). Pursuant to the Warrant Amendments to the extend a warrant holder exercised their Series B warrants prior to their respective exercise deadlines, as defined in the amendment documents (the 
 23 

Amendment Exercise Deadline ), the holders corresponding Series C Warrants vested and became exercisable for the lesser of (i) three times the number of Series B Warrants exercised by the holder and (ii) the total number of Series C Warrants outstanding to the holder. Following each Amendment Exercise Deadline, if such holder exercised any remaining Series B Warrants, the remaining Series C Warrants, if any, vested and became exercisable on a one-for-one basis as to the same number of Series B Warrants exercised. The Warrant Amendments allowed a holder to elect to receive Pre-Funded Warrants upon exercise of Series B Warrants and Series C Warrants in lieu of shares of the our common stock, at a purchase price of 8.1588 per warrant exercised and an exercise price of 0.0012 per Pre-Funded Warrant. Net cash proceeds from the March, June and September 2024 Warrant Amendment were 1.2 million, 0.3 million and 0.4 million, respectively, after deducting underwriter commissions and offering expenses. The Series B Warrants will expire on November 13, 2024, which is nine months from the date of issuance. The Series C Warrants will also expire on November 13, 2024, provided that to the extent and in proportion to a holder of the Series C Warrants exercising its corresponding Series B Warrants included in the applicable unit, such Series C Warrant will expire on February 13, 2029. 
 In September 2024, we entered into an amendment with certain holders of our Series A Warrants, Series B Warrants and Series C Warrants (the September 2024 Exercise Price Warrant Amendment ), pursuant to which such holders agreed to pay 3.99 per Series A Warrant or Series C Warrant to reduce the exercise price of the Series A Warrants and Series C Warrants from 8.16 to 0.01. To the extent the holder did not elect to modify all outstanding Series A Warrants and Series C Warrants, the remaining Series A Warrants and Series C Warrants held by each holder retained an exercise price of 8.16 per Series A Warrant or Series C Warrant. Net proceeds from the September 2024 Exercise Price Warrant Amendment were approximately 2.5 million

Operating Activities. The primary use of our cash has been to fund our clinical research, prepare our NDA, manufacture Gimoti, commercial sales of Gimoti, and other general operations. The cash used in operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was primarily related to commercialization activities for Gimoti and other general operational activities. We expect that cash used in operating activities during the remainder of 2024 will be in-line with cash used during similar periods in 2023 because growing sales are expected to offset commercialization activities, including manufacturing Gimoti, and the planned post-marketing commitment to conduct a single-dose PK clinical trial of Gimoti to characterize dose proportionality of a lower dose strength of Gimoti. 
 Financing Activities. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash provided by financing activities was 10.8 million primarily due to the sale of 513,424 shares of common stock at 8.16 per share, 683,475 Pre-Funded Warrants at 8.1588 per share, and 373,176 Series A Warrants and 250,627 Series C Warrants at 3.99 per share in connection with the September 2024 Exercise Price Warrant Amendment. 
 Capital Resource Requirements 
 On October 16, 2024, we entered into the Seventh Amendment to our existing lease agreement, to amend the office lease agreement. The Seventh Amendment Extends the term of the lease from October 31, 2024 to March 31, 2027. The Seventh Amendment provides for an initial monthly base rent of approximately 6,500, with stated escalation clauses each November first through the lease term. We are also responsible for common area maintenance costs associated with the leased space. 
 The amount and timing of our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including but not limited to: 
 the costs of commercialization activities, including costs associated with commercial manufacturing; 

the commercial success of Gimoti, including competition with well-established products approved earlier by FDA, including oral and intravenous forms of metoclopramide, the same active ingredient in the nasal spray for Gimoti; 

our ability to manufacture sufficient quantities of Gimoti to meet demand, including whether our contract manufacturers, suppliers, and/or consultants are able to meet appropriate timelines; 

the progress and costs of the post-marketing commitment to conduct a single-dose PK clinical trial of Gimoti to characterize dose proportionality of a lower dose strength of Gimoti and the costs of any additional clinical trials we may pursue to expand the indication of Gimoti; 

our ability to obtain, maintain and enforce our patents and other intellectual property rights, and the costs incurred to do so; 

24 

the terms and timing of any collaborative, licensing, co-promotion or other arrangements that we may establish; and 

costs associated with any other product candidates that we may develop, in-license or acquire. 

We expect to continue to incur expenses as we: 
 continue the commercial activities for Gimoti; 

manufacture Gimoti; 

conduct the post-marketing commitment single-dose PK clinical trial of Gimoti and any additional development activities should we seek additional indications; 

maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio; and 

continue to fund the accounting, legal, insurance and other costs associated with being a public company. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk 
 As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide the information required by this Item. 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Conclusions Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the timelines specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and in reaching a reasonable level of assurance, management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. In addition, the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 
 As required by SEC Rule 13a-15(e), as of September 30, 2024, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report. Management identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to ineffectively designed controls over review of the Eversana Credit Facility, ongoing compliance monitoring and the proper application of GAAP for such agreement. 
 Based on the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2024, due to the material weakness described above. The material weakness will not be considered remediated until the enhanced controls operate for a sufficient period of time, and management is able to conclude, through testing, that the related controls are effective. Therefore, the material weakness existed as of September 30, 2024. 
 Remediation Plan 
 Our management, under the oversight of the Audit Committee, has developed a remediation plan which includes, but is not limited to, designing controls over review over debt contracts, including the Eversana Credit Facility, ongoing compliance monitoring and the proper application of GAAP for such agreement. To strengthen our review procedures, we have engaged external support with extensive U.S. GAAP knowledge to advise on technical accounting and financial reporting matters. We will monitor the effectiveness of its remediation plan and will refine its remediation plan as appropriate. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management s evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-15(d) of the Exchange Act during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

v. In the event that the amounts payable under Section 4(b) are subject to Section 409A of the Code and the timing of the delivery of Executive s Release could cause such amounts to be paid in one or another taxable year, then notwithstanding the payment timing set forth in such Section, such amounts shall not be payable until the later of (i) the payment date specified in such section or (ii) the first business day of the taxable year following the Executive s Separation from Service.
