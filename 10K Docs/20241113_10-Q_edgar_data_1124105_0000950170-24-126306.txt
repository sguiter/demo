In October 2023, immediately following the closing of the Contributions, the Company issued shares of Convertible Preferred Stock and Preferred Stock Warrants to GNI USA under the Private Placement. For additional information, see Note 3 Fair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments . In November 2023, GNI USA provided notice to the Company to convert its shares of Convertible Preferred Stock. Each share of Convertible Preferred Stock was convertible into approximately shares of common stock. On January 22, 2024, subject to the terms and conditions of the Convertible Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation, shares of common stock were issued to GNI USA upon such conversion.

Valuation Assumptions The Company estimated the fair value of stock options granted using the Black-Scholes option-pricing formula and a single option award approach. Due to its limited relevant historical data, the Company estimated its volatility considering a number of factors, including the use of the volatility of comparable public companies. The expected term of options granted under the 2023 Omnibus Incentive Plan, all of which qualify as plain vanilla per SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin 107, is determined based on the simplified method due to the Company s limited relevant history. The risk-free rate is based on the yield of a U.S. Treasury security with a term consistent with the option. This fair value is being amortized ratably over the requisite service periods of the awards, which is generally the vesting period. Since stock options were granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 , all weighted-average assumptions for that period were not applicable.

The CVRs are not transferable, except in certain limited circumstances as provided for in the CVR Agreement, will not be certificated or evidenced by any instrument, and will not be registered with the SEC or listed for trading on any exchange. In February 2023, Catalyst sold its legacy rare bleeding disorder program to GCBP. As a result, the Company distributed the net cash proceeds received from the GCBP asset sale of million to the CVR Holders as well as recorded a million long-term CVR derivative liability for the future distribution of the hold-back amount to be received in May 2025. As of December 31, 2023 , the carrying value of the CVR derivative liability was million on the condensed consolidated balance sheet. Refer to Note 3 Fair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments for additional information regarding the CVR derivative liability and GCBP asset sale. On October 30, 2023, pursuant to the CVR Agreement, the Company recorded a million CVR excess closing cash payable upon closing of the Contributions. As of September 30, 2024 , the CVR Holders have received all requisite cash payable under the CVR Agreement and there are outstanding distributions. Litigation and Legal Matters The Company is subject to claims and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. Such matters are inherently uncertain, and there can be no guarantee that the outcome of any such matter will be decided favorably to the Company or that the resolution of any such matter will not have a material adverse effect upon the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements. Purchasing Commitments Property and Equipment The Company s commitments related to purchase of property and equipment contracted but not yet reflected in the condensed consolidated financial statements were million as of September 30, 2024 and were expected to be incurred within one year. F351 In September 2020, Gyre Pharmaceuticals entered into an intellectual property IP transfer agreement (the F351 Transfer Agreement with GNI Japan and certain of its wholly owned subsidiaries (the GNI Group or GNI ). According to the F351 Transfer Agreement, Gyre Pharmaceuticals acquired the exclusive right to use Hydronidone IP rights in mainland China and the right of first offer for the global IP rights (the F351 IP Rights ). Under the F351 Transfer Agreement, in exchange for the F351 IP Rights, Gyre Pharmaceuticals is obligated to pay GNI Group million upon submission of the F351 New Drug Application (the NDA to Center for Drug Evaluation of the National Medical Products Administration (the NMPA of the PRC, million after the NDA passes the NMPA s Center for Food and Drug Review and Inspection s on-site registration inspection for the F351 product, and million upon NMPA s approval of the NDA. Research and Development Programs In addition to the F351 program, as of September 30, 2024, Gyre Pharmaceuticals has committed to allocate million toward future research and development activities for various programs.

Effective tax rate 

The change of effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was primarily due the consummation of the Contributions in October 2023 and the fluctuation of the nondeductible expenses of Gyre Pharmaceuticals. As of September 30, 2024, after consideration of certain limitations (see below), the Company had approximately million federal and million state net operating loss NOL carryforwards for U.S. tax purposes available to reduce future taxable income which, if unused, will begin to expire in for federal and for state tax purposes. The federal NOL carryforward includes million that have an indefinite life. If the Company experiences a greater than 50 aggregate change in ownership over a three-year period (a Section 382 ownership change), utilization of its pre-change NOL carryforwards are subject to annual limitation under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (California has similar provisions). The annual limitation is determined by multiplying the value of the Company s stock at the time of such ownership change by the applicable long-term tax-exempt rate. Such limitations may result in expiration of a portion of the NOL carryforwards before utilization. The Company determined that ownership changes under Section 382 occurred on December 31, 2007, August 20, 2015, April 13, 2017, February 15, 2018, February 18, 2020, and December 26, 2022. Approximately million and million of the NOL carryforwards will expire unutilized for federal and California state income tax purposes, respectively. The ability of the Company to use its remaining NOL and tax credit carryforwards may be further limited if the Company experiences a Section 382 ownership change as a result of future changes in its stock ownership. 

million and million , respectively. research and development fees were paid to GNI during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had million and million related parties payable due to GNI. Other Receivables from GNI As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had recorded million in other receivables from GNI, of which million was from CPI s restructuring transaction (see Note 8 Restructuring in the Annual Report) and million was from Gyre s cost sharing with GNI.

million and million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The total contributions for such employee benefits were million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Defined-Contribution Savings Plan In the U.S., the Company maintains a defined-contribution savings plan pursuant to Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The plan is available to employees who meet the minimum age and length of service requirements. The contributions made during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were immaterial. 

distinct operating segments: Gyre Pharmaceuticals and Gyre after the Contributions. The Company s reportable segments are based upon internal organizational structure, the manner in which operations are managed, the criteria used by CODM to evaluate segment performance, the availability of separate financial information, and overall materiality considerations. All Gyre s operations are within the U.S., while all of Gyre Pharmaceuticals operations are in mainland China. Gyre Pharmaceuticals Gyre Pharmaceuticals has one major commercial drug product, ETUARY, and several product candidates in pre-clinical and clinical development. Gyre Pharmaceuticals product revenues are mainly generated from the sale of ETUARY and certain generic drugs. Gyre Pharmaceuticals primarily sells its pharmaceutical products to distributors in the PRC, who ultimately sell the products to hospitals, other medical institutions and pharmacies. Gyre Pharmaceuticals also generates revenue from license agreements. However, the license agreements did not generate any revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Gyre Gyre is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of F351 for the treatment of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis-associated liver fibrosis in the United States. Other than the IP associated with F351 in the U.S., Gyre has no other product candidates since the Company sold all of its legacy IP assets prior to the closing of the Contributions. Subsequent to the closing of the Contributions, Gyre has not generated any revenue. Other Other represents the financial information from other subsidiaries, consisting of mainly CPI, GNI HK, and Continent Pharmaceuticals U.S., Inc. During the year ended December 31, 2023, prior to the Contributions, CPI divested almost all of its assets other than its indirect ownership interest in Gyre Pharmaceuticals (see Note 8 Restructuring in the Annual Report).

 Overview 
 We are a financially-sustainable commercial-stage biotechnology company with a record of success in developing and commercializing small-molecule anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic drugs targeting organ diseases, focusing specifically on organ fibrosis. Fibrotic diseases represent a large patient population with significant unmet medical needs. Fibrosis involves a complex, multi-stage process with multiple pathways. While there are numerous potential targets for anti-fibrotic therapy, both established and emerging, addressing a single molecular pathway may not be sufficient to prevent, halt, or reverse fibrosis. 
 Our strategy is to use our experience in the successful development and commercialization of ETUARY (Pirfenidone) to expand into new indications and develop similar drug candidates. Pirfenidone, the first anti-fibrotic drug approved for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis IPF in Japan, the European Union, the United States, and the People s Republic of China PRC ), is a small molecule drug that inhibits the synthesis of Transforming Growth Factor TGF )- 1, Tumor Necrosis Factor- , and other fibrosis and inflammation modulators. We have obtained approval for ETUARY (pirfenidone) in the PRC for IPF. 
 Gyre Pharmaceuticals successfully advanced Pirfenidone from research and development to commercialization in the PRC for the treatment of IPF. In addition to IPF, Pirfenidone is undergoing three additional Phase 3 clinical trials for connective tissue disease-associated interstitial lung diseases (sclerosis-related interstitial lung disease and dermatomyositis-related interstitial lung disease) and pneumoconiosis to broaden its indications and market. In May 2024, Gyre Pharmaceuticals executed a comprehensive agreement with Jiangsu Wangao Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd. to acquire the commercial rights to nintedanib, a small-molecule drug for the treatment of IPF. With this acquisition, we acquired the other product approved for the treatment of IPF, which is currently approved globally for the treatment of IPF. Nintedanib is expected to provide patients more choices and benefits, and further enhance Gyre Pharmaceuticals leading position in the pulmonary fibrosis market. Gyre Pharmaceutical is planning to initiate commercialization of the nintedanib product in the PRC in 2025, which is anticipated to offset any declines in ETUARY sales as a result of the fluctuations in the Chinese economy significantly affecting demand for anti-fibrosis drugs and decreasing healthcare spending generally . 
 24 

F351, our lead development candidate in both the United States and the PRC, is a structural derivative of ETUARY (Pirfenidone). It is a new oral chemical entity with an anti-fibrotic, TGF- 1-targeting mechanism of action. Studies suggest that F351 and its major metabolites have minimal drug-drug interaction risks. We are prioritizing F351 for the treatment of liver fibrosis due to the large potential addressable market and significant unmet need. 
 Gyre Pharmaceuticals has completed a Phase 2 trial of F351 in the PRC for chronic hepatitis B CHB )-associated liver fibrosis. The Phase 2 trial showed that F351 was well-tolerated without notable toxicity and patients treated showed statistically-significant improvement of liver fibrosis, with the best efficacy results achieved at 270 mg/day dosing. Based on these results, a confirmatory Phase 3 trial is ongoing in the PRC with a primary endpoint of the reduction of the liver fibrosis score (Ishak Scoring System) by at least one stage after taking F351 in combination with Entecavir. In October 2024, the last patient completed the 52-week pivotal Phase 3 trial. Gyre Pharmaceuticals expects to report top-line data from this trial by the first quarter of 2025. 
 In the United States, we have completed a Phase 1 clinical trial of F351 in healthy volunteers. Following results from the PRC Phase 3 trial in CHB-associated liver fibrosis and pending approval of an IND submission, we expect to initiate a Phase 2 trial to evaluate F351 for the treatment of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH )-associated liver fibrosis in 2025. We cannot guarantee that a Phase 2 trial will be initiated or estimate the funding needed for such trial at this time, but may need to raise additional capital to fund this program. 
 In parallel, we are also conducting a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical trial in the PRC to assess the safety and efficacy of F573, a caspase inhibitor for the treatment of acute/acute on-chronic liver failure. In addition, in May 2024, we obtained the approval from the PRC s National Medical Products Administration NMPA for the IND to launch a new clinical trial in the PRC of another new drug candidate, F230, a selective endothelin receptor agonist for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension. We are preparing for the anticipated launch of the clinical trial in the PRC. We are also evaluating F528, a novel anti-inflammation agent that targets the inhibition of multiple inflammatory cytokines, in preclinical studies as a potential first-line therapy for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 
 In June 2024, Gyre Pharmaceuticals received approval from the NMPA for avatrombopag maleate tablets for the treatment of thrombocytopenia TP associated with chronic liver disease CLD in adult patients undergoing elective diagnostics procedures or therapy. TP is the most common hematologic complication in patients with CLD and can be life threatening in severe cases. Avatrombopag is an oral thrombopoietin receptor agonist. Avatrombopag was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of adults with CLD-associated TP in May 2018, and its indication was subsequently expanded to include the treatment of immune thrombocytopenia in June 2019. Gyre Pharmaceuticals acquired avatrombopag under a transfer agreement with Nanjing Healthnice Pharmaceutical Technology, Co., Ltd. Nanjing Healthnice in June 2021 and is planning to start commercializing the avatrombopag product by the first half of 2025. 
 Nasdaq Continued Listing Requirements Compliance 
 On June 28, 2024, Nassim Usman, Ph.D. resigned from our Board of Directors (the Board and stepped down as a chair of the Audit Committee of the Board (the Audit Committee ), effective as of June 30, 2024. Dr. Usman s resignation was not due to any disagreements with the Company relating to our operations, policies or practices. In connection with his resignation, we agreed to a full acceleration of all of Dr. Usman's outstanding stock options (the Outstanding Option Awards ). On June 30, 2024, we notified Nasdaq that, following Dr. Usman s resignation as a member of the Board and as a member of the Audit Committee, we have a vacancy on our Audit Committee and intend to rely on the cure period set forth in the Nasdaq Listing Rules while we recruit a new Audit Committee member. 
 On July 2, 2024, we received a letter from Nasdaq confirming that we are no longer in compliance with Nasdaq s audit committee composition requirements as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5605, which requires that the audit committee of a listed company be comprised of at least three independent directors (as defined in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5605(a)(2)). 
 25 

On August 6, 2024, the Board appointed Rodney Nussbaum as the new Audit Committee Chair and David Epstein, Ph.D., as a Class II director. Dr. Epstein will serve until our 2026 Annual Meeting of Stockholders and until his successor is duly elected and qualified. Dr. Epstein was also appointed as a member of the Board s Audit Committee and Compensation Committee. On August 9, 2024, we informed Nasdaq that, following Dr. Epstein s appointment as a member of the Board and as a member of the Audit Committee we regained compliance with Nasdaq s audit committee composition requirements as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5605, which requires that the audit committee of a listed company be comprised of at least three independent directors (as defined in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5605(a)(2)). On October 3, 2024, Nasdaq issued the formal determination which confirmed our compliance with Nasdaq s audit committee composition requirements as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5605. 
 Business Combination Agreement 
 On December 26, 2022, Catalyst Biosciences, Inc., a Delaware corporation Catalyst entered into a Business Combination Agreement, as amended on March 29, 2023 and August 30, 2023 (the Business Combination Agreement with GNI USA, Inc., a Delaware corporation GNI USA ), GNI Japan, GNI Hong Kong Limited GNI HK ), Shanghai Genomics, Inc., a company organized under the laws of the PRC (collectively with GNI USA, GNI Japan and GNI HK, the Contributors, and each a Contributor ), certain individuals and Continent Pharmaceuticals Inc., a Cayman Islands company limited by shares CPI . On October 30, 2023 (the Effective Time ), the Contributions (as defined below) became effective and Catalyst acquired an indirect controlling interest in Gyre Pharmaceuticals. 
 Pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, at the Effective Time of the Contributions: 
 a) GNI USA contributed all of its ordinary shares in the capital of CPI to Catalyst in exchange for 45,923,340 shares of Common Stock (the CPI Contribution ), 

b) GNI USA contributed its interest in Further Challenger International Limited Further Challenger for 17,664,779 shares of Common Stock (the FC Contribution and together with the CPI Contribution, the GNI USA Contributions ), and 

c) each Minority Holder contributed 100 of the interest he or she held in his or her respective entity in exchange for an aggregate of 10,463,627 shares of Common Stock (the Minority Holder Contributions and together with the GNI USA Contributions, the Contributions ). 

As a result of the GNI USA Contributions, Gyre directly and indirectly holds 100 of CPI s shares. Through Gyre s ownership of CPI, prior to the Minority Holder Contributions, Gyre held a 56.0 indirect interest in Gyre Pharmaceuticals. Upon completion of the Minority Holder Contributions, Gyre obtained additional indirect interests in Gyre Pharmaceuticals and holds, in aggregate, a 65.2 indirect interest in Gyre Pharmaceuticals. Each share of Common Stock and option to purchase Common Stock that was issued and outstanding at the Effective Time remained issued and outstanding, and such shares and options were unaffected by the Contributions. 
 At the Effective Time, Gyre Pharmaceuticals terminated its 2021 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2021 Plan and the options (the Gyre Pharmaceuticals Options outstanding under the 2021 Plan were terminated and replaced with options granted under a subplan for Chinese participants under the Gyre 2023 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the 2023 Omnibus Incentive Plan that are substantially similar in all material respects to the Gyre Pharmaceuticals Options previously outstanding under the 2021 Plan. 
 The majority shareholder of Gyre Pharmaceuticals is BJContinent Pharmaceuticals Limited BJC ). The immediate holding company of BJC is CPI. Immediately following the GNI USA Contributions, the immediate holding company of CPI is Gyre. The majority stockholder of Gyre is GNI USA, which is indirectly wholly owned by GNI Japan. 
 The GNI USA Contributions were treated as an asset acquisition under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, with CPI treated as the accounting acquirer and presented as the predecessor for post-acquisition reporting purposes. Since Catalyst is the legal acquirer, the GNI USA Contributions were accounted for as a reverse asset acquisition. This determination was based upon the terms of the Business Combination Agreement and other factors including that, immediately following the GNI USA Contributions: (i) GNI USA (as the parent company of CPI immediately prior to the GNI USA Contributions) owns a substantial majority of the voting power of the combined company; (ii) GNI USA has the ability to control the board of directors of the combined company; and (iii) senior management of 
 26 

Gyre Pharmaceuticals and GNI USA hold a majority of the key positions in senior management of the combined company. Immediately prior to the closing of the GNI USA Contributions, Catalyst did not meet the definition of a business because Catalyst did not have an organized workforce that significantly contributed to its ability to create output, and substantially all of its fair value was concentrated in in-process research and development IPR D ). 
 As of the closing date of the GNI USA Contributions, the net assets of Catalyst were recorded at their acquisition-date relative fair values in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report and the reported operating results prior to the GNI USA Contributions are those of CPI. 
 The Minority Holder Contributions were treated as an equity transaction, where we obtained additional indirect interests in and maintained our control over Gyre Pharmaceuticals. 
 Contingent Value Rights Agreement 
 Concurrent with the signing of the Business Combination Agreement on December 26, 2022, Catalyst and the Rights Agent (as defined in the CVR Agreement) executed a contingent value rights agreement (the CVR Agreement ), as amended on March 29, 2023, pursuant to which each CVR Holder, excluding GNI Japan and GNI HK, received one contractual contingent value right (a CVR issued by the Company for each share of Catalyst common stock held by such holders. Each CVR entitles the CVR Holder thereof to receive certain cash payments in the future. For additional information, see Note 12 Commitments and Contingencies to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report. 
 Private Placement and Securities Purchase Agreement 
 On October 27, 2023, we entered into the Securities Purchase Agreement for a private placement with GNI USA (the Private Placement ). Pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement, GNI USA agreed to purchase (i) 811 shares of Series X Convertible Preferred Stock, par value 0.001 per share (the Convertible Preferred Stock and (ii) warrants to purchase up to 811 shares of Convertible Preferred Stock (the Preferred Stock Warrants for an aggregate purchase price of 5.0 million. The Private Placement closed immediately after the closing of the Contributions. 
 The Preferred Stock Warrants are exercisable at an exercise price of 4,915.00 per share of Convertible Preferred Stock and expire on October 30, 2033. In January 2024, all shares of Convertible Preferred Stock were converted into Gyre common stock. The Preferred Stock Warrants issued are considered freestanding financial instruments and classified as a liability. 
 Jiangsu Wangao Agreement 
 In May 2024, Gyre Pharmaceuticals entered into an agreement with Jiangsu Wangao Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd. (the Jiangsu Wangao Agreement ), effective from May 7, 2024 to May 6, 2035. Pursuant to the Jiangsu Wangao Agreement, Gyre Pharmaceuticals obtained the drug registration certificate for and became the marketing authorization holder of nintedanib, a small-molecule drug for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, within the PRC. The total minimum payments under the Jiangsu Wangao Agreement are RMB 35.0 million, or approximately 4.8 million, based on the May 7, 2024 spot exchange rate. This includes an upfront transfer fee of RMB 15.0 million, or approximately 2.1 million, payable in three installments, and subsequent low- to mid-single-digit royalty payments over eight years following the commencement of sales.

 Research and Development Expenses 
 Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services used in research and development are initially deferred and capitalized in prepaid and other current assets. The capitalized amounts are then expensed as the related goods are delivered or services are performed, or until it is no longer expected that the goods or services will be delivered. 
 Research and development costs consist primarily of costs related to the pre-clinical and clinical development of our product candidates, which include payroll and other personnel-related expenses, laboratory supplies and reagents, contract research and development services for pre-clinical research and clinical trials, materials, and consulting costs, as well as allocations of facilities, depreciation, and other overhead costs. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses consist of (i) accounting, IT, legal, administrative, and other internal service staff costs; (ii) stock-based compensation representing share options granted to our functional employees; (iii) professional service fees, primarily for legal and accounting services; and (iv) other miscellaneous expenses. 
 Other Income (Expense), Net 
 Interest Income, Net 
 Interest income consists primarily of interest earned on our certificates of deposit. Interest income is recognized on an accrual basis using the effective interest method by applying the rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash 
 28 

receipts over the expected life of the financial instrument or a shorter period, when appropriate, to the net carrying amount of the financial asset. 
 Other (Expense) Income, Net 
 Other income consists mostly of government grants. Government grants are recognized at their fair value where there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received, and all attaching conditions will be complied with. When the grant relates to an expense item, it is recognized as income on a systematic basis over the periods that the costs, for which it is intended to compensate, are expensed. Where the grant relates to an asset, the fair value is credited to a deferred income account and is released to profit or loss over the expected useful life of the relevant asset by equal annual installments or deducted from the carrying amount of the asset and released to profit or loss by way of a reduced depreciation charge. 
 Other expenses consist of any non-operating costs, such as loss from equity method investments. 
 Change in Fair Value of Warrant Liability 
 In connection with the Private Placement, we issued the Preferred Stock Warrants, which are freestanding financial instruments classified as warrant liability since the underlying securities are contingently redeemable upon the occurrence of events which are outside of our control. The Preferred Stock Warrants are recorded at fair value upon issuance and are subject to remeasurement at the end of each reporting period, with any change in fair value recognized in our statements of operations as other (income) expense. 
 Provision for Income Taxes 
 Provision for income taxes are comprised primarily of current income tax provision, mainly attributable to the profitable Gyre Pharmaceuticals operations in the PRC, and deferred income tax provision, mainly including deferred tax recognized for temporary differences in relation to research and development tax credit and net operating loss carryforwards for U.S. tax purposes, deemed income inclusions from controlled foreign corporations for U.S. tax purposes, and fixed and intangible assets, net of valuation allowances.

 Revenues 
 Revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 25.5 million and 32.0 million, respectively. The 6.5 million decrease was primarily driven by a 6.4 million decrease in anti-fibrosis drug sales and a 0.1 million decrease in generic drug sales due to fluctuations in the Chinese economy significantly affecting demand for anti-fibrosis drugs and decreasing healthcare spending generally. To support future revenue growth, we plan to commercially launch new products, such as nintedanib and avatrombopag, in early 2025, which will be supported by our extensive sales and marketing platform across the PRC. 
 Cost of Revenues 
 Cost of revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 1.0 million and 1.2 million, respectively. T he decrease was primarily driven by a 0.1 million factory stoppage loss due to factory renovation in 2023 and a 0.1 million decrease in sales quantity. 
 Selling and Marketing Expenses 
 Selling and marketing expenses decreased by 0.2 million, or 2 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by a 0.9 million decrease in conference costs due to a decrease in conference activity, a 0.9 million decrease in staff cost as well as a 0.1 million decrease in other expenses, partially offset by a 1.5 million increase in promotional expenses and a 0.2 million increase in travel expense.

Research and development expenses decreased by 0.2 million, or 8 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily from Gyre Pharmaceuticals, and was driven by a 0.5 million decrease in pre-clinical research expense and a 0.2 million decrease in staff cost due to the decrease in headcount in the research and development department, partially offset by a 0.5 million increase in our clinical trial expense and clinical trial expense from Gyre Pharmaceuticals. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 
 General and administrative expenses increased by 2.7 million, or 230 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by costs associated with being a public company, including a 0.9 million increase in functional and administrative department's personnel and stock compensation costs, a 0.6 million increase in miscellaneous expenses, and a 1.2 million increase in professional expense. 
 Other Income (Expense), Net 
 Interest income increased by 0.2 million, or 85 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to additional investments in certificates of deposit. 
 Other expenses, net decreased by 0.7 million, or 55 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decline was primarily due to a 0.7 million decrease from the combination of equity method investments loss and a 0.3 million decrease in donation expense from Gyre Pharmaceuticals. These decreases were partially offset by a 0.3 million increase in our dividend and miscellaneous non-operating loss. 
 Loss on disposal of assets was 0.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, which was related to the dispose fixed assets from Gyre Pharmaceuticals. There was no loss on disposal of assets for the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Change in fair value of warrant liability was 0.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. It was related to the remeasurement of the Preferred Stock Warrants liability. 
 Provision for Income Taxes 
 Provision for income taxes was 1.1 million and 3.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease was primarily attributable to a lower profit from Gyre Pharmaceuticals operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024.

Revenues 
 Revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 77.9 million and 86.3 million, respectively. The 8.4 million decrease was primarily driven by a 8.0 million decrease in anti-fibrosis drug sales and a 0.4 million decrease in generic drugs due to the same factors mentioned above. If approved by the NMPA for commercial use, we expect that F351 for the treatment of CHB-associated liver fibrosis in the PRC will support revenue growth in the future, which will be supported by our extensive sales and marketing platform across the PRC. 
 Cost of Revenues 
 Cost of revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 2.7 million and 3.4 million, respectively. The decrease was primarily driven by a 0.4 million factory stoppage loss due to factory renovation in 2023, and a 0.4 million decrease in generic drug cost due to the decrease of sales, offset by a 0.1 million increase of the staff cost and new equipment depreciation. 
 Selling and Marketing Expenses 
 Selling and marketing expenses decreased by 4.0 million, or 9.0 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by a 5.3 million decrease in conference costs due to a decrease in conference activity, partially offset by a 1.0 million increase in promotional expenses, a 0.2 million increase in staff costs due to an increase in staff headcount, and a 0.1 million increase in other expenses.

Research and development expenses decreased by 0.9 million, or 10 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The 1.5 million decrease from Gyre Pharmaceuticals was primarily driven by a 1.0 million decrease in pre-clinical research expenses, a 0.3 million decrease in materials and utilities, and a 0.2 million decrease in staff cost due to the decrease in headcount in the research and development department. These decreases were offset by a 0.6 million increase in our clinical trial costs and research and development consulting costs. 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses increased by 6.0 million, or 131 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by costs associated with being a public company, including a 2.9 million increase in functional and administrative department s personnel and stock compensation costs, a 1.8 million increase in miscellaneous expenses, and a 1.3 million increase in professional expense. 
 Other Income (Expense), Net 
 Interest income increased by 0.5 million, or 67 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to additional investments in certificates of deposit. 
 Other expenses, net decreased by 0.1 million, or 4 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a 0.9 million decrease in government grants, and a 1.1 million decrease from the combination of equity method investments loss, partially offset by a 0.3 million increase in our miscellaneous non-operating loss. 
 Loss on disposal of assets was 0.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which was related to the disposition of fixed assets from Gyre Pharmaceuticals. There was no loss on disposal of assets for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Change in fair value of warrant liability was 7.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which was related to the remeasurement of the Preferred Stock Warrants liability. 
 Provision for Income Taxes 
 Provision for income taxes was 5.1 million and 7.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to the projected effective tax rate decreased and a lower profit from Gyre Pharmaceuticals operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 Refer to Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report for more information about recent accounting pronouncements. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Sources of Liquidity 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 15.9 million, short-term bank deposits of 9.2 million and long-term certificates of deposit of 29.5 million, which are available to fund operations, and an accumulated deficit of 73.4 million. Our net income during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 2.9 million and 17.3 million, respectively, while cash provided by and used in operating activities was 1.7 million and 0.9 million, respectively. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations, and access to capital markets will be sufficient to fund our operating activities and obligations for at least 12 months following the filing date of this Quarterly Report. 
 Future Funding Requirements 
 We expect to use cash flows from operations to meet our current and future financial obligations, including funding our operations, and capital expenditures. Our ability to make these payments depends on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory, and other factors, many of which we cannot control. In particular, following results from the PRC Phase 3 trial in CHB-associated liver fibrosis and pending approval of an IND submission, we expect to initiate a Phase 2 trial to evaluate F351 for the treatment of MASH-associated liver fibrosis in 2025. We cannot guarantee that a Phase 2 trial will be initiated or estimate the funding needed for such trial at this time, but may need to raise additional capital to fund this program. Factors that may affect financing requirements include, but are not limited to: 
 the timing, progress, cost and results of our clinical trials, preclinical studies and other discovery and research and development activities; 

the timing and outcome of, and costs involved in, seeking and obtaining marketing approvals for our products, and in maintaining quality systems standards for our products; 

the timing of, and costs involved in, commercial activities, including product marketing, sales and distribution; 

our ability to successfully commercialize and to obtain regulatory approval for, and successfully commercialize our other or future product candidates; 

increases or decreases in revenue from our marketed products, including decreases in revenue resulting from generic entrants or health epidemics or pandemics; 

the number and development requirements of other product candidates that we pursue; 

our ability to manufacture sufficient quantities of our products to meet expected demand; 

the costs of preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights, litigation costs and the results of litigation; 

our ability to enter into collaboration, licensing or distribution arrangements and the terms and timing of these arrangements; 

the potential need to expand our business, resulting in additional payroll and other overhead expenses; 

the potential in-licensing of other products or technologies; 

the emergence of competing technologies or other adverse market or technological developments; and 

the impacts of inflation and resulting cost increases. 

Future capital requirements will also depend on the extent to which we acquire or invest in additional complementary businesses, products and technologies.

Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
 Cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 0.9 million, reflecting our net income of 17.3 million, offset by non-cash items of 6.1 million primarily related to the change in fair value of warrant liability of 7.0 million. Additionally, cash used in operating activities reflected changes in net operating assets and liabilities of 12.1 million. 
 Cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 22.5 million, reflecting our net income of 15.5 million and additional positive non-cash items impact of 1.0 million. Additionally, cash provided by operating activities reflected changes in net operating assets and liabilities of 6.0 million. 
 Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
 Cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 17.9 million, which consisted of 14.1 million in purchases of certificates of deposit, 2.4 million in purchases of property and equipment, and 1.7 million in equity method investment, partially offset by 0.3 million proceeds from sale of equipment. 
 Cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 21.1 million, which consisted of 14.3 million in purchases of certificates of deposit, 6.2 million in purchases of property and equipment and 1.0 million in equity method investment, partially offset by 0.5 million in proceeds from sale of equipment.

 Restricted Net Assets 
 Under PRC laws and regulations, Gyre Pharmaceuticals is subject to restrictions on foreign exchange and cross-border cash transfers, including to parent companies and U.S. stockholders. The ability to distribute earnings to the parent companies and U.S. stockholders is also limited. Current PRC regulations permit Gyre Pharmaceuticals to pay dividends to BJC only out of its accumulated profits as determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. Amounts restricted include paid-in capital and the statutory reserves of Gyre Pharmaceuticals. The aggregate amounts of restricted capital and statutory reserves of the relevant subsidiaries not available for distribution were 64.3 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. We do not expect the restrictions described above to have a material impact on our ability to meet our cash obligations. 
 Contractual Obligations and Other Commitments 
 Leases 
 We have entered into lease arrangements in (1) San Diego, California for our headquarters, which expires on the last day of the 38th full calendar month beginning on or after November 11, 2023, and (2) the PRC, for office and laboratory spaces through May 2027. As of September 30, 2024, our fixed lease payment obligations were 1.9 million, with 0.7 million payable within 12 months. 
 
 35 

Other Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
 In June 2021, we entered into a transfer agreement with Nanjing Healthnice, an independent third party, pursuant to which Nanjing Healthnice agreed to transfer to us the avatrombopag maleate tablets for the treatment of CLD-associated thrombocytopenia and all relevant technologies, complete any research or trials and transfer to us all materials necessary for the application of marketing approval by the NMPA. We were approved by the NMPA as the marketing authorization holder of the avatrombopag maleate tablets on June 25, 2024. In exchange, we paid a total of approximately 2.3 million upon certain milestones (e.g., the completion of bioequivalence study, or the registration application to the NMPA) being met. We have completed the bioequivalence study and received NMPA acceptance on August 1, 2022, and as of September 30, 2024, we have made total payments of approximately 2.3 million. 
 In September 2022, we entered into a transfer agreement with New Jiyuan (Beijing) Pharmaceutical Technology Co., Ltd. New Jiyuan ), an independent third party, pursuant to which New Jiyuan agreed to transfer to us the minocycline hydrochloride foam for the treatment of moderate to severe acne and all relevant technologies, complete product development and transfer to us all materials necessary for the application of marketing approval of the NMPA. Upon the completion of the transfer, we expect that we will be approved by the NMPA as the marketing authorization holder of the minocycline hydrochloride foam. In exchange, we will pay a total amount of 1.0 million and the payments will be made by installments conditioned upon certain milestones (e.g., the completion of bioequivalence study, or the registration application to the NMPA) being met. Process verification has been completed. As of September 30, 2024, we have made total payments of approximately 0.7 million. 
 
 Research and Development Programs 
 As of September 30, 2024, we have committed to allocate 34.3 million toward future research and development activities for various programs. 
 Property and Equipment 
 Our commitments related to the purchase of property and equipment contracted but not yet reflected in the unaudited consolidated condensed financial statements were 1.6 million as of September 30, 2024 and are expected to be incurred within one year. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 There have been no significant changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates as compared to the critical accounting policies and estimates disclosed in our Annual Report. 
 Smaller Reporting Company and Accelerated Filer Status 
 We are a smaller reporting company as defined in the Exchange Act. We may take advantage of certain of the scaled disclosures available to smaller reporting companies and will be able to take advantage of these scaled disclosures for so long as our common stock held by non-affiliates is less than 250.0 million measured on the last business day of our second fiscal quarter, or our annual revenue is less than 100.0 million during the most recently completed fiscal year and our common stock held by non-affiliates is less than 700.0 million measured on the last business day of our second fiscal quarter. 
 Based on the aggregate market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates as of June 30, 2024, we believe we will remain a smaller reporting company, but will become an accelerated filer as of December 31, 2024. Because we believe our non-accelerated filer status will expire on December 31, 2024, we will be required, pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, to include in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2024 an attestation report as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting that is issued by our independent registered public accounting firm. However, we expect to continue to take advantage of the reduced reporting requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies. 
 36 

ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We are a smaller reporting company, as defined by Rule 12b-2 under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K, and are not required to provide the information under this item. 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As of September 30, 2024, our management, with the participation and supervision of our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, evaluated our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024 to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 We are currently not a party to any material legal proceedings. From time to time, we may become involved in legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business. Regardless of outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us due to defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources, negative publicity, reputational harm and other factors, and there can be no assurances that favorable outcomes will be obtained. 
 ITEM 1A. RI SK FACTORS 
 You should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors in our Annual Report, which could materially affect our business, financial position, or future results of operations. The risks described in our Annual Report are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial position, or future results of operations. We may disclose changes to such factors or disclose additional factors from time to time in our future filings with the SEC. Except as disclosed below, there have been no material changes from the risk factors disclosed in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors in our Annual Report. 
 If we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls over financial reporting our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired. 
 Pursuant to Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the Sarbanes-Oxley Act ), our management is required to report upon the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Beginning with our annual report for our fiscal year ending December 31, 2024, we expect that we will become an accelerated filer. By becoming an accelerated filer, Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act will require our independent auditors to express an opinion on our internal control over financial reporting. Ensuring that we have adequate internal controls in place so that we can produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is a costly and time-consuming effort that will need to be evaluated frequently. If we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, we may not have adequate, accurate or timely financial information, our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse, and we may be unable to meet our reporting obligations as a public company or comply with the requirements of the SEC or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. This could result in a restatement of our financial statements, the imposition of sanctions, including the inability of registered broker dealers to make a market in our common stock, or investigation by regulatory authorities. Any such action or other negative results caused by our inability to meet our reporting requirements or comply with legal and regulatory requirements or by disclosure of an accounting, reporting or control issue could adversely affect the trading price of our securities and our business. To achieve compliance with Section 404 within the prescribed period, we are engaged in a process to document and evaluate our internal control over financial reporting, which is both costly and challenging. In this regard, we will need to continue to dedicate internal resources, engage outside consultants and adopt a detailed work plan to assess and document the adequacy of internal control over financial reporting, continue steps to improve control processes as appropriate, validate through testing that controls are functioning as documented and implement a continuous reporting and improvement process for internal control over financial reporting. This process will be time-consuming, costly and complicated. 
 Any failure to maintain internal control over financial reporting could severely inhibit our ability to accurately report our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. If we are unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm determines we have a material weakness or significant deficiency in our internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our common stock could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by Nasdaq, the SEC, or other regulatory authorities. Failure to remedy any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, or to implement or maintain other effective control systems required of public companies, could also restrict our future access to the capital markets. 
 We may identify material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting in the future or fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, which may result in material misstatements of our consolidated financial statements or cause us to fail to meet our periodic reporting obligations. 
 A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, 
 38 

in internal control over financial reporting that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those responsible for oversight of the registrant s financial reporting. 
 Remediation measures to remediate a material weakness or significant deficiency may be time consuming, may result in us incurring significant costs, and may place significant demands on our financial and operational resources. 
 Our failure to identify and address any material weaknesses or significant deficiencies that may be identified in the future could result in material misstatements to our financial statements and could also impair our ability to comply with applicable financial reporting requirements and related regulatory filings on a timely basis, which could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which may result in volatility in and a decline in the market price of our securities.

EXHIBIT A 
 RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION OF GYRE THERAPEUTICS, INC. 
 FIRST : The name of the corporation (hereinafter called the Corporation is Gyre Therapeutics, Inc. 
 SECOND : The address, including street, number, city and county of the registered office of the Corporation in the State of Delaware, is 251 Little Falls Drive, Wilmington, New Castle County, Delaware 19808; and the name of the registered agent of the Corporation in the State of Delaware at such address is Corporation Service Company. 
 THIRD : The purpose of the Corporation is to engage in any lawful act or activity for which corporations may be organized under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the DGCL ), as the same now exists or may hereafter be amended. 
 FOURTH : 
 1. The total number of shares that the Corporation is authorized to issue is Four Hundred Five Million (405,000,000), of which: (1) Four Hundred Million (400,000,000) shares shall be designated as Common Stock, 0.001 par value per share Common Stock ); and (2) Five Million (5,000,000) shares shall be designated as Preferred Stock, 0.001 par value per share Preferred Stock ). 

2. The board of directors of the Corporation (the Board is authorized, subject to any limitations prescribed by law, to provide for the issuance of shares of Preferred Stock in one or more series, to establish from time to time the number of shares to be included in each such series, to increase or decrease the number of shares of any series subsequent to the issue of shares of that series, but not below the number or shares of such series then outstanding, and to fix the designation, powers, preferences, relative, participating optional or other special rights, and any qualifications, limitations and restrictions of the shares of each such series. In case the number of shares of any series shall be so decreased, the shares constituting such decrease shall resume the status that they had prior to the adoption of the resolution originally fixing the number of shares of such series. 

3. Each outstanding share of Common Stock shall entitle the holder thereof to one vote on each matter properly submitted to the stockholders of the Corporation for a vote; provided, however, that, except as otherwise required by law, holders of Common Stock shall not be entitled to vote on any amendment (including any certificate of designation relating to any series of Preferred Stock (each hereinafter referred to as a Preferred Stock Designation )) to this Certificate of Incorporation that relates solely to the terms of one or more outstanding series of Preferred Stock if the holders of such affected series are entitled, either separately or together as a class with the holders of one or more other such series, to vote thereon by law or pursuant to this Certificate of Incorporation (including any Preferred Stock Designation). 

FIFTH : The Corporation is to have perpetual existence. 
 SIXTH : For the management of the business and for the conduct of the affairs of the Corporation, and in further definition, limitation and regulation of the powers of the Corporation and of its directors and of its stockholders or any class thereof, it is further provided: 
 1. The business and the conduct of the affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of the Board. 

2. Any action required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders of the Corporation must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Corporation and may not be effected by any written consent by such stockholders. 

3. Special meetings of stockholders of the Corporation may be called only by the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, the President or the Board acting pursuant to a resolution adopted by a majority of the Whole Board and any power of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders is specifically denied. Only such business as shall have been stated in the notice of a special meeting of stockholders shall be considered at such special meeting. For purposes of this Certificate of Incorporation, the Whole Board shall mean the total number of directors then fixed in accordance with this Certificate of Incorporation, whether or not there are any vacancies. 

SEVENTH : 
 1. Subject to any rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock to elect additional directors under specified circumstances, the number of directors shall be fixed from time to time exclusively by the Board. The directors, other than those who may be elected by the holders of any series of Preferred Stock under specified circumstances, shall be divided into three classes, as nearly equal in number as possible, with the term of office of the first class to expire at the Corporation s first annual meeting of stockholders following the initial classification of the Board upon the effectiveness of this Certificate of Incorporation, with the term of office of the second class to expire at the Corporation s second annual meeting of stockholders following the initial classification of the Board upon the effectiveness of this Certificate of Incorporation and with the term of office of the third class to expire at the Corporation s third annual meeting of stockholders following the initial classification of the Board upon the effectiveness of this Certificate of Incorporation, and thereafter for each such term to expire at each third succeeding annual meeting of stockholders after such election and with each director to hold office until his or her successor shall have been duly elected and qualified. At each annual meeting of stockholders, directors elected to succeed those directors whose terms expire shall be elected for a term of office to expire at the third succeeding annual meeting of stockholders after their election, with each director to hold office until his or her successor shall have been duly elected and qualified or until his or her death, retirement, resignation or removal. 

2. Newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors or any vacancies in the Board resulting from death, retirement, resignation, removal from office or other cause may be filled only by a majority vote of the directors then in office even though less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director, and not by the stockholders. In the event of any increase or decrease in the authorized number of directors, (a) each director then serving as such shall nevertheless continue as a director of the class of which he or she is a member until the expiration of his or her current term or his or her prior death, retirement, resignation or removal and (b) the newly created or eliminated directorships resulting from such increase or decrease shall if reasonably possible be apportioned by the Board among the three classes of directors so as to ensure that no one class has more than one director more than any other class. To the extent reasonably possible, consistent with the foregoing rule, any newly created directorships shall be added to those classes whose terms of office are to expire at the latest dates following such allocation and newly eliminated directorships shall be subtracted from those classes whose terms of office are to expire at the earliest dates following such allocation, unless otherwise provided for from time to time by resolution adopted by a majority of the directors then in office, although less than a quorum. In the event of a vacancy in the Board, the remaining directors, except as otherwise provided by law or this Certificate of Incorporation, may exercise the powers of the full Board until the vacancy is filled. No decrease in the number of directors constituting the Board shall shorten the term of any incumbent director. 

3. No election of directors need be by written ballot unless the Bylaws of the Corporation so provide. 

4. No stockholder will be permitted to cumulate votes at any election of directors. 

5. Advance notice of stockholder nominations for the election of directors and of business to be brought by stockholders before any meeting of the stockholders of the Corporation shall be given in the manner provided in the Bylaws of the Corporation. 

6. Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock then outstanding and except as otherwise provided in this certificate of incorporation or required by law, any director, or all of the directors, may be removed from the Board with or without cause, but only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 of the aggregate voting power of the then-outstanding shares of capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote in the election of directors, voting together as a single class. 

EIGHTH : The power to adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws of the Corporation may be exercised by the Board. The stockholders shall also have the power to adopt, amend or repeal the Bylaws; provided, however, that, in addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of stock of the Corporation required by law or this Certificate of Incorporation, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 of the aggregate voting power of the then-outstanding voting shares of voting stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required to adopt, amend or repeal all or any portion of Section 2.10 of Article II, Section 3.2 of Article III, Article VI and Section 10.1 of Article X of the Bylaws. 
 NINTH : A director or officer of the Corporation shall not be personally liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director or officer, as applicable, except to the extent such exemption from liability, or limitation thereof, is not permitted under the DGCL. If the DGCL is hereafter amended to authorize the further elimination or limitation of the liability of a director or officer, as applicable, then the liability of a director or officer of the Corporation, as applicable, shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, as so amended. Any repeal or modification of the foregoing provisions of this Article NINTH by the stockholders of the Corporation shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director or officer of the Corporation existing at the time of such repeal or modification. 
 TENTH : The Corporation shall, to the fullest extent permitted by the provisions of Section 145 of the DGCL, as the same may be amended and supplemented, indemnify any person who is or was a director or officer of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer or trustee of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise, from and against any and all of the expenses, liabilities, or other matters referred to in or covered by said section, and the indemnification provided for herein shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which such persons may be entitled under any Bylaw, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in his or her official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office, and shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a director or officer and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors, and administrators of such a person. In addition, the Corporation may, to the extent authorized from time to time by the Board, grant indemnification rights to other employees or agents of the Corporation or other persons serving the Corporation and such rights may be equivalent to, or greater or less than, those indemnification rights of directors and officers set forth in this article or the Bylaws. Neither any amendment, repeal or modification of this article nor the adoption of any provision of this Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws of the Corporation inconsistent with this article shall adversely affect any right or protection of a director or officer of the Corporation existing at the time of such amendment, repeal, modification or adoption. 

ELEVENTH : From time to time any of the provisions of this Certificate of Incorporation may be amended, altered or repealed and other provisions authorized by the laws of the State of Delaware at the time in force may be added or inserted in the manner and at the time prescribed by said laws; provided, however, that, notwithstanding any other provision of this certificate of incorporation, or any provision of law that might otherwise permit a lesser vote or no vote, but in addition to any vote of the holders of any class or series of the stock of this Corporation required by law or by this certificate of incorporation, the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66 of the voting power of the then-outstanding shares of voting stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class, shall be required to amend or repeal Article SIXTH, Article SEVENTH, Article EIGHTH, Article NINTH, Article TENTH or this Article ELEVENTH. All rights conferred upon stockholders of the Corporation by this certificate of incorporation are granted subject to the provisions of this Article ELEVENTH.
