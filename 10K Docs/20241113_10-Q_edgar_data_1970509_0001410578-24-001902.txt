Each Unit consists of one Public Share and one-half of one redeemable warrant (each a Public Warrant, and together with the Private Placement Warrants (as defined below), the Warrants ). Each whole Warrant entitles the holder to purchase Class A Ordinary Share at a price of per share. Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company consummated the private sale (the Private Placement of Units (the Private Placement Units and, with respect to the shares of the Class A Ordinary Shares and warrants included in the Private Placement Units, the Private Placement Shares and Private Placement Warrants , respectively) to Haymaker Sponsor IV LLC (the Sponsor at a price of per Private Placement Unit, generating gross proceeds of (see Note 4). Following the closing of the Initial Public Offering on July 28, 2023, an amount of from the net proceeds of the sale of the Units in the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Units in the Private Placement was placed in a U.S.-based trust account (the Trust Account ), with Continental Stock Transfer Trust Company Continental acting as trustee, and will be invested only in U.S. government treasury obligations and/or held as cash or cash equivalents (including in demand deposit accounts) with maturities of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act ), which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations and/or held as cash or cash items (including in a demand deposit account at bank), as determined by the Company, until the earlier of (i) the completion of a Business Combination and (ii) the distribution of the funds held in the Trust Account, as described below.

The Company s management Management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating a Business Combination. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to complete a Business Combination successfully. The Company must complete one or more initial Business Combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least of the net assets held in the Trust Account (excluding the amount of deferred underwriting discounts held in the Trust Account and taxes payable on the income earned on the Trust Account) at the time of the agreement to enter into the initial Business Combination.

 either immediately prior to or upon consummation of such a Business Combination and, if the Company seeks shareholder approval, a majority of the shares voted are voted in favor of the Business Combination. If a shareholder vote is not required by law and the Company does not decide to hold a shareholder vote for business or other reasons, the Company will, pursuant to its amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (the Amended and Restated Charter ), conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC and file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing a Business Combination. If, however, shareholder approval of the transaction is required by law, or the Company decides to obtain shareholder approval for business or other reasons, the Company will offer to redeem shares in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to the proxy rules and not pursuant to the tender offer rules. If the Company seeks shareholder approval in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor has agreed to vote its Founder Shares (as defined in Note 5) and any Public Shares purchased during or after the Initial Public Offering in favor of approving a Business Combination. Additionally, each Public Shareholder may elect to redeem their Public Shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction or do not vote at all. Notwithstanding the above, if the Company seeks shareholder approval of a Business Combination and the Company does not conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, the Amended and Restated Charter provides that a Public Shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a group (as defined under Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of or more of the Public Shares, without the prior consent of the Company. The Sponsor has agreed to waive redemption rights with respect to any Founder Shares and any Public Shares it may acquire during or after the Initial Public Offering in connection with the completion of Business Combination. The Company has until July 28, 2025, or until such earlier date as its board of directors (the Board may approve, unless otherwise extended in accordance with the Amended and Restated Charter, to complete a Business Combination (the Combination Period ). The underwriters have agreed to waive their rights to their deferred underwriting commission held in the Trust Account in the event the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and, in such event, such amounts will be included with the other funds held in the Trust Account that will be available to fund the redemption of the Public Shares. In order to protect the amounts held in the Trust Account, the Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to the Company if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has entered into a written letter of intent, confidentiality or other similar agreement or Business Combination agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below the lesser of (i) per Public Share and (ii) the actual amount per Public Share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account, if less than per Public Share due to reductions in the value of the Trust Account assets, less taxes payable, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party or prospective target business who executed a waiver of any and all rights to the monies held in the Trust Account (whether or not such waiver is enforceable) nor will it apply to any claims under the indemnity of the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ).

 in cash held outside of the Trust Account and working capital deficit of . The Company s obligations due within one year of the date the accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements are issued are expected to exceed those amounts. The Company s liquidity condition raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of time within one year after the date that the accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements are issued. Management plans to address this uncertainty through a Business Combination. If a Business Combination is not consummated by the end of the Combination Period, currently July 28, 2025, there will be a mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution of the Company, . No adjustments have been made to the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities should the Company be required to liquidate after the Combination Period. The Company intends to complete the initial Business Combination before the end of the Combination Period. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to consummate any Business Combination by the end of the Combination Period. Risks and Uncertainties As a result of the military action commenced in February 2022 by the Russian Federation and Belarus in the country of Ukraine and related economic sanctions, the Company s ability to consummate a Business Combination, or the operations of a target business with which the Company ultimately consummates a Business Combination, may be materially and adversely affected. Further, the Company s ability to consummate a transaction may be dependent on the ability to raise equity and debt financing which may be impacted by these events, including as a result of increased market volatility, or decreased market liquidity in third-party financing being unavailable on terms acceptable to the Company or at all. The impact of this action and related sanctions on the world economy and the specific impact on the Company s financial position, results of operations and/or ability to consummate a Business Combination are not yet determinable. The accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

 per share (the Class B Ordinary Shares, and together with the Class A Ordinary Shares, the Ordinary Shares ). Income and losses are shared pro rata between the two classes of shares. Net income per Ordinary Share is calculated by dividing the net income by the weighted average shares of Ordinary Shares outstanding for the respective period. The calculation of diluted net income does not consider the effect of the Public Warrants underlying the Units sold in the Initial Public Offering (including the consummation of the over-allotment) and the Private Placement Warrants to purchase an aggregate of shares of Class A Ordinary Shares in the calculation of diluted income per ordinary share, because their exercise is contingent upon future events. As a result, diluted net income per Ordinary Share is the same as basic net income per Ordinary Share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and for the period from March 7, 2023 (inception) through September 30, 2023. Accretion associated with the redeemable Class A Ordinary Shares is excluded from earnings per share as the redemption value approximates fair value.

On July 28, 2023, the underwriters exercised the over-allotment option in full, so those Class B Ordinary Shares are longer subject to forfeiture. The Sponsor has agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of the Founder Shares (except to certain permitted transferees as disclosed in the IPO Registration Statement) until the earlier of (i) following the consummation of a Business Combination; or (ii) subsequent to the consummation of a Business Combination, the date on which the Company consummates a transaction that results in all of its shareholders having the right to exchange their shares for cash, securities, or other property.

Once the Warrants become exercisable, the Company may call the Warrants for redemption for cash: in whole and not in part; at a price of per Public Warrant; upon not less than prior written notice of redemption (the - Day Redemption Period to each warrant holder; and if, and only if, the closing price of the Ordinary Shares equals or exceeds per share (as adjusted for share sub divisions, share capitalizations, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like and for certain issuances of Class A Ordinary Shares and equity-linked securities for capital raising purposes in connection with the closing of the initial Business Combination as described in the IPO Registration Statement) on each of trading days within a - trading day period commencing once the Warrants become exercisable and ending three business days before the Company sends to the notice of redemption to the warrant holders and there is an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the Class A Ordinary Shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrants and a current prospectus relating to those Class A Ordinary Shares is available throughout the - Day Redemption Period.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements All statements other than statements of historical fact included in this Report including, without limitation, statements under this Item regarding our financial position, business strategy and the plans and objectives of Management for future operations, are forward-looking statements. When used in this Report, words such as anticipate, believe, estimate, expect, intend and similar expressions, as they relate to us or our Management, identify forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are based on the beliefs of our Management, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, our Management. Actual results could differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors detailed in our filings with the SEC. All subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are qualified in their entirety by this paragraph. The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed financial statements and the notes thereto included in this Report under Item 1. Financial Statements . Overview We are a blank check company incorporated in the Cayman Islands on March 7, 2023, formed for the purpose of entering into a Business Combination with one or more businesses. To date, our efforts have been limited to organizational activities, activities related to our Initial Public Offering, and searching for a Business Combination target. We have not selected any Business Combination target. We are focusing our search for an initial Business Combination with a business in the consumer and consumer-related products and services industries. We must complete our initial Business Combination by July 28, 2025, the end of our Combination Period, which is 24 months from the closing of our Initial Public Offering. If our initial Business Combination is not consummated by the end of the Combination Period, then we will distribute all amounts in the Trust Account to our Public Shareholders (net of taxes paid or payable and up to 100,000 to pay dissolution expenses). We may, however, elect to seek to extend the Combination Period consistent with applicable laws, regulations and stock exchange rules. Such an extension requires the approval of our Public Shareholders, who will be provided the opportunity to at that time to redeem all or a portion their Public Shares (which would likely have a material adverse effect on the amount held in our Trust Account and other adverse effects on our Company, such as our ability to maintain our listing on NYSE. Our Sponsor may also explore transactions under which it would sell its interest in our Company to another management team. The SEC has adopted the 2024 SPAC Rules, which became effective on July 1, 2024. The 2024 SPAC Rules require, among other matters, (i) additional disclosures relating to SPAC Business Combination transactions (ii) additional disclosures relating to dilution and to conflicts of interest involving sponsors and their affiliates in both SPAC initial public offerings and Business Combination transactions; (iii) additional disclosures regarding projections included in SEC filings in connection with proposed Business Combination transactions and (iv) the requirement that both the SPAC and its target company be co-registrants for Business Combination registration statements. In addition, the SEC s adopting release provided guidance describing circumstances in which a SPAC could become subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act, including its duration, asset composition, business purpose, and the activities of the SPAC and its management team in furtherance of such goals. The 2024 SPAC Rules may materially affect our ability to negotiate and complete our initial Business Combination and may increase the costs and time related thereto. Recent Developments June 2024 Promissory Note On October 28, 2024, we withdrew an additional 150,000, in connection with our working capital expenses, under the June 2024 Promissory Note. Results of Operations We have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenues to date. Our only activities for the period from March 7, 2023 (inception) through September 30, 2024, were organizational activities, those necessary to prepare for our Initial Public Offering, and

 subsequent to the Initial Public Offering, identifying a target company for a Business Combination. We do not expect to generate any operating revenues until after the completion of our initial Business Combination. We generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on investments held in our Trust Account after the Initial Public Offering. We incur expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had a net income of 2,877,078, which consisted of interest earned on investments held in our Trust Account of 3,154,569, offset by general and administrative expenses of 277,491. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had a net income of 8,686,281, which consisted of interest earned on investments held in our Trust Account of 9,397,868, offset by general and administrative expenses of 711,587. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, we had a net income of 864,290, which consisted of interest earned on investments held in our Trust Account of 1,066,459, offset by general and administrative expenses of 202,169. For the period from March 7, 2023 (inception) through September 30, 2023, we had a net income of 854,809, which consisted of interest earned on investments held in our Trust Account of 1,066,459, offset by general and administrative expenses of 211,650. Factors That May Adversely Affect our Results of Operations Our results of operations and our ability to complete an initial Business Combination may be adversely affected by various factors that could cause economic uncertainty and volatility in the financial markets, many of which are beyond our control. Our business could be impacted by, among other things, downturns in the financial markets or in economic conditions, increases in oil prices, inflation, increases in interest rates, supply chain disruptions, declines in consumer confidence and spending, public health considerations, and geopolitical instability, such as the military conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. We cannot at this time predict the likelihood of one or more of the above events, their duration or magnitude or the extent to which they may negatively impact our business and our ability to complete an initial Business Combination. Liquidity, Capital Resources and Going Concern For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in operating activities was 255,160. We had a net income of 8,686,281, which was affected by interest of 9,397,868 earned on investments held in our Trust Account and changes in operating assets and liabilities, which used 456,427 of cash. For the period from March 7, 2023 (inception) through September 30, 2023, net cash used in operating activities was 646,133. The company had a net income of 854,809, which was affected by interest of 1,066,459 earned on investments held in our Trust Account and changes in operating assets and liabilities which used 434,483 of cash. On July 28, 2023, we consummated the Initial Public Offering of 23,000,000 Units, including 3,000,000 Units issued pursuant to the exercise of the underwriters over-allotment option in full, generating gross proceeds for our Company of 230,000,000. Commencing on September 15, 2023, the holders of the Units may elect to separately trade the underlying the Public Shares and Public Warrants. Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, pursuant to the Unit Subscription Agreement, we consummated the sale of 797,600 Private Placement Units to the Sponsor at a price of 10.00 per Private Placement Unit in the Private Placement, including 30,000 Private Placement Units in connection with the exercise of the underwriters over-allotment option in full, generating gross proceeds for our Company of 7,976,000. Following the closing of the Initial Public Offering on July 28, 2023, an amount of 232,300,000 10.10 per Unit) from the net proceeds of the sale of the Units in the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Units was placed in the Trust Account. We intend to use substantially all of the funds held in the Trust Account, including any amounts representing interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes (which interest shall be net of taxes payable and excluding deferred underwriting commissions) to complete our initial Business Combination. We may withdraw interest to pay our taxes, if any. Our annual income tax obligations will depend on the amount of interest and other income earned on the amounts held in the Trust Account. We expect the interest earned on the amount in the Trust Account will be sufficient to pay our taxes. To the extent 

 23 

Table of Contents 
 that our Ordinary Shares or debt is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to complete our initial Business Combination, the remaining proceeds held in the Trust Account will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses, make other acquisitions and pursue our growth strategies. As of September 30, 2024, we had 15,815 in cash held outside of the Trust Account and working capital deficit of 281,223. Our obligations due within one year of the date of the unaudited condensed financial statements included in this Report under Item 1. Financial Statements issued are expected to exceed to those amounts. Our liquidity condition raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern one year from the date that the unaudited condensed financial statements and the notes thereto included in this Report under Item 1. Financial Statements were issued. We currently have until July 28, 2025 to consummate a Business Combination. If a Business Combination is not consummated by the end of the Combination Period, there will be a mandatory liquidation and our subsequent dissolution after the end of the Combination Period. We intend to complete the initial Business Combination before the end of the Combination Period; however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so. Contractual Obligations Registration Rights The holders of (i) the 5,750,000 Founder Shares, which were issued to the Sponsor on March 15, 2023, including any Class A Ordinary Shares issuable upon conversion of the Founder Shares, (ii) the Private Placement Units, including any Private Placement Shares issuable upon the exercise of the Private Placement Warrants underlying the Private Placement Units, and (iii) any WCL Units that may be issued upon conversion of any Working Capital Loans, including any Class A Ordinary Shares issuable upon the exercise of the warrants underlying the WCL Units, will be entitled to registration rights pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, requiring us to register such securities for resale (in the case of the Founder Shares, only after conversion to the Class A Ordinary Shares). The holders of these securities are entitled to make up to three demands, excluding short form demands, that we register such securities. In addition, the holders have certain piggyback registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to our initial Business Combination. IPO Promissory Note On March 13, 2023, the Sponsor agreed to loan us an aggregate of up to 300,000 to cover expenses related to the Initial Public Offering pursuant to the IPO Promissory Note. This loan was non-interest bearing and payable on the earlier of December 31, 2023 or the date on which we consummated the Initial Public Offering. Prior to the Initial Public Offering, we had borrowed 272,550 under the IPO Promissory Note. On July 28, 2023, we repaid the outstanding balance under the IPO Promissory Note in full, and borrowings under the IPO Promissory Note are no longer available. Underwriters Agreement Simultaneously with the Initial Public Offering and sale of 20,000,000 Units, the underwriters fully exercised the over-allotment option to purchase an additional 3,000,000 Option Units at an offering price of 10.00 per Option Unit for an aggregate purchase price of 30,000,000. The underwriters were paid a cash underwriting discount of 0.20 per Unit, or 4,000,000 in the aggregate, upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering. In addition, 0.35 per Unit and 0.55 per Option Unit, or 8,650,000 in the aggregate, will be payable to the representatives of the underwriters for deferred underwriting commissions. The deferred fee will become payable to the underwriters from the amounts held in the Trust Account solely in the event that we complete an initial Business Combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement we entered into on July 25, 2023. Administrative Services Agreement Pursuant to the Administrative Services Agreement, we pay an affiliate of our Chief Executive Officer 20,000 per month for office space, secretarial and administrative services provided to members of our Management Team. Upon completion of our initial Business Combination or our liquidation, any remaining monthly payments from the 24-month term will be accelerated and due at the closing of our initial Business Combination or our liquidation. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, for the three months 

 24 

Table of Contents 
 ended September 30, 2023 and for the period from March 7, 2023 (inception) through September 30, 2023, we incurred expenses of 60,000 and 180,000, 44,516 and 104,516, respectively, for services under the Administrative Services Agreement. Advisory Services Agreement Pursuant to the Advisory Services Agreement, we pay an affiliate of our Chief Financial Officer 20,000 per month for services rendered prior to the consummation of our initial Business Combination; such amounts will be accrued and will only be payable upon the successful completion of our initial Business Combination. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the contingent fee payable for these services amounted to 120,000 and 104,516, respectively. June 2024 Promissory Note On June 10, 2024, we issued the June 2024 Promissory Note in the principal amount of up to 1,500,000 to the Sponsor. The June 2024 Promissory Note was issued in connection with advances the Sponsor may make in the future to us from time to time for working capital expenses. The June 2024 Promissory Note is non-interest bearing and payable upon the earlier of (i) completion of our initial Business Combination or (ii) the date the winding up of us is effective. At the election of the Sponsor, all or a portion of the unpaid principal amount of the June 2024 Promissory Note may be converted into units at a price of 10.00 per unit, which will be identical to the Private Placement Units. These units and their underlying securities are entitled to the registration rights set forth in the June 2024 Promissory Note. As of September 30, 2024, we had 150,000 drawn on this June 2024 Promissory Note. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of unaudited condensed financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP requires Management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the unaudited condensed financial statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have identified the following critical accounting policies: Net Income Per Share We have two classes of shares, the (i) redeemable Class A Ordinary Shares and the non-redeemable Class A Ordinary Shares and (ii) Class B Ordinary Shares. Income and losses are shared pro rata between the two classes of shares. Net income per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares outstanding for the period. The calculation of diluted income per share does not consider the effect of the Warrants issued in connection with the Initial Public Offering since the exercise of the Warrants are contingent upon the occurrence of future events. Class A Ordinary Shares Subject to Possible Redemption The Public Shares contain a redemption feature that allows for the redemption of such Public Shares in connection (i) with our liquidation, (ii) if there is a shareholder vote or tender offer in connection with the initial Business Combination and (iii) with certain amendments to the Amended and Restated Charter. In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity ASC 480 ), conditionally redeemable Class A Ordinary Shares (including Class A Ordinary Shares that feature redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within our control) are classified as temporary equity. Ordinary liquidation events, which involve the redemption and liquidation of all of the entity s equity instruments, are excluded from the provisions of ASC 480. Although we did not specify a maximum redemption threshold, our Amended and Restated Charter provides that currently, we will only redeem our Public Shares. However, the threshold in the Amended and Restated Charter would not change the nature of the underlying shares as redeemable and thus Public Shares are required to be disclosed outside of permanent equity. We recognize change in redemption value immediately as they occur and adjusts the carrying value of redeemable Ordinary Shares to equal the redemption value at the end of each reporting period. Such changes are reflected in additional paid-in capital, or in the absence of additional paid-in capital, in accumulated deficit. Recent Accounting Standards In August 2020, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU Topic 2020-06, Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Contracts in Entity s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and 

 25 

Table of Contents 
 Contracts in an Entity s Own Equity ASU 2020-06 ), which simplifies accounting for convertible instruments by removing major separation models required under current GAAP. As a result of ASU 2020-06, more convertible debt instruments will be accounted for as a single liability measured at its amortized cost and more convertible preferred stock will be accounted for as a single equity instrument measured at its historical cost, as long as no features require bifurcation and recognition as derivatives. The amendments are effective for smaller reporting companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. We adopted ASU 2020-06 effective March 7, 2023 (inception). The adoption of ASU 2020-06 did not have an impact on the unaudited condensed financial statements included in this Report under Item 1. Financial Statements . . Management does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the unaudited condensed financial statements included in this Report under Item 1. Financial Statements . Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information otherwise required under this Item. Item 4. Controls and Procedures. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to Management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (together, the Certifying Officers ), or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Under the supervision and with the participation of our Management, including our Certifying Officers, we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on the foregoing, our Certifying Officers concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the quarterly period ended September 30, 2024. We do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all our control deficiencies and instances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have been no changes to our internal control over financial reporting during the quarterly period ended September 30, 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
