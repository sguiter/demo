Cash and cash equivalents include currency on hand, demand deposits with banks or financial institutions, and short-term, highly liquid investments that are both readily convertible to known amounts of cash and so near their maturity that they present minimal risk of changes in value because of changes in interest rates. The following table summarizes the Company's cash and cash equivalents: 

Certificates of Deposit (original 3-month maturity)

Total cash and cash equivalents 

The carrying amount of accounts receivable is reduced by an allowance for credit losses that reflects the Company s best estimate of the amounts that will not be collected as of the balance sheet date. This allowance is based on the credit losses expected to arise over the life of the asset and is based on the Current Expected Credit Losses CECL ). At September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, the allowance for credit losses related to accounts receivable amounted to and , respectively. 

During 2024 and 2023, the Company participated in various government drug rebate programs related to the sale of Renacidin , its most important pharmaceutical product. These programs include the Veterans Affairs Federal Supply Schedule (FSS), and the Medicare Part D Coverage Gap Discount Program (CGDP). These programs require the Company to sell its product at a discounted price. The Company s sales, as reported, are net of these product rebates and discounts, some of which are estimated, and are recorded in the same period that the revenue is recognized. 

In August of 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act IRA was signed into law. The IRA made significant changes to the current Medicare Part D benefit design as it relates to discounts available to enrollees from pharmaceutical manufacturers of brand name drugs. Beginning on January 1, 2025, the Centers for Medicare Medicaid Services CMS will implement a new Medicare Part D Manufacturer Discount Program discount program ), which will replace the current CGDP. The new discount program eliminates the coverage gap benefit phase, introduces pharmaceutical manufacturer discounts in the initial and catastrophic coverage phases and lowers the cap on enrollee out-of-pocket costs. Under the new discount program, additional rebates are expected to be owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers due to the restructuring of the benefit periods. The overall financial impact of this new program will vary depending on the products being reimbursed but does have the potential to increase Medicare Part D rebates for drug manufacturers. At this time, the Company is unable to predict what future impact this new program will have on its financial condition; however, on January 31, 2024, the Company was notified by CMS that it qualified as a specified small manufacturer and will be entitled to a multi-year phase-in period during which it will pay a lower percentage discount on drugs dispensed to beneficiaries. 

The Company does not make sales on consignment, and the collection of the proceeds of the sale of any of the Company s products is not contingent upon the customer being able to sell the goods to a third party. 

Any allowances for returns are taken as a reduction of sales within the same period the revenue is recognized. Such allowances are determined based on historical experience under ASC Topic 606-10-32-8. The Company has not experienced significant fluctuations between estimated allowances and actual activity. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had an allowance of and , respectively, for possible outdated material returns, which is included in accrued expenses. There is no value associated with these outdated material returns, as these products are destroyed. 

The Company has distribution fee contracts with certain distributors of its pharmaceutical products that entitle them to distribution and service-related fees. The Company estimates distribution fees and records distribution fees as offsets to revenue.

The fair values of the Company s marketable securities are determined in accordance with US GAAP, with fair value being defined as the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. As a basis for considering such assumptions, the Company utilizes the three-tier value hierarchy, as prescribed by US GAAP, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows: 

Level 1 - inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. 

Level 2 - inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. 

Level 3 inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement. 

The Company s marketable equity securities, which are considered available for sale securities, are re-measured to fair value on a recurring basis and are valued using Level 1 inputs using quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets in active markets. The Company s fixed income Certificates of Deposit and U.S. Treasury Bills are considered held-to-maturity securities and are valued at amortized cost.

OVERVIEW 

The Company is a Delaware corporation that, through its Guardian Laboratories division, manufactures and markets cosmetic ingredients, pharmaceuticals, medical lubricants, and sexual wellness products. Prior to July 1, 2023, the Company manufactured and reported sales of a line of specialty industrial products; however, this product line was discontinued after the second quarter of 2023 due to low sales volume with no growth prospects. In October 2023, the Company entered into an agreement with Brenntag Specialties, a global market leader in chemicals and ingredients distribution, for the marketing of the Company s new line of sexual wellness ingredients, specifically called the Natrajel line of products, in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Central America and South America. Although there were no sales of these products during 2023 or year-to-date in 2024, the Company anticipates that it will begin manufacturing and reporting sales of this new line of products in 2025. 

The Company also conducts research and product development. The Company s research and development department also modifies, refines, and expands the uses for existing products, with the goal of further developing the market for its products. The Company also develops new products using natural and environmentally friendly raw materials, which is a priority for many of the Company s cosmetic customers. All the products that the Company markets, except for Renacidin, are produced at its facility in Hauppauge, New York. Renacidin, a urological product, is manufactured and packaged for the Company by an outside contract manufacturer. 

The Company s most important product line is its Lubrajel line of multifunctional hydrogels, which are designed to provide hydration, sensory enhancement, lubrication, and texture to both personal care and medical products. 

The Company s cosmetic ingredients are marketed worldwide for cosmetic uses by five distributors, each handling a different geographic area, with the largest being U.S.-based ASI. In the last few years, to meet the growing demand for green and sustainable products, the Company has focused on developing and launching new products which only contain ingredients that are considered natural . The Lubrajel products in the new natural line have been certified by the Cosmetic Organic and Natural Standard COSMOS ). This standard is recognized globally by the cosmetic industry. 

Renacidin and the Company s other pharmaceutical product, Clorpactin WCS-90, are distributed through full-line drug wholesalers and marketed only in the United States. Those wholesalers in turn sell the products to pharmacies, hospitals, nursing homes, and other long-term care facilities, and to government agencies, primarily the VA. The Company promotes Renacidin through a dedicated website. Clorpactin WCS-90, as well as the Company s other products, are marketed through information provided on the Company s corporate website. 

Page 18 of 26

The Company s medical lubricants, which consist of multifunctional hydrogels designed mainly to provide sensory enhancement and lubrication to medical device products, are sold directly to medical customers, or to contract manufacturers employed by these medical customers. 

The Company does have competition in the marketplace for some of its products, particularly its cosmetic ingredients, some of its pharmaceutical products, and its medical lubricants. These competitive products are usually sold at a lower price than the Company s products; however, they may not compare favorably to the level of performance and quality of the Company s products. 

As long as a valid purchase order has been received and future collection of the sale amount is reasonably assured, the Company recognizes revenue from sales of its products when those products are shipped, which is when the Company s performance obligation is satisfied. The Company s cosmetic ingredients are shipped Ex-Works from the Company s facility in Hauppauge, NY, and the risk of loss and responsibility for the shipment passes to the customer upon shipment. Sales of the Company s non-pharmaceutical medical products are deemed final upon shipment, and there is no obligation on the part of the Company to repurchase or allow the return of these goods unless they are defective. Sales of the Company s pharmaceutical products are final upon shipment unless (a) they are found to be defective; (b) the product is damaged in shipping; (c) the product cannot be sold because it is too close to its expiration date; or (d) the product has expired (but it is not more than one year after the expiration date). This return policy conforms to standard pharmaceutical industry practice. The Company estimates an allowance for outdated material returns based on previous years historical returns of its pharmaceutical products. 

In recent years the Company has elected to rely on trade secret protection to protect its intellectual property for the proprietary product formulations and manufacturing methods. The Company will file for patent protection in situations where the Company believes that relying on trade secret protection alone would not provide sufficient protection. The Company owns the Lubrajel , Natrajel , Renacidin , and Clorpactin trademarks. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

As disclosed in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, the discussion and analysis of the Company s financial condition and results of operations are based on its financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with US GAAP. The preparation of those financial statements required the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the carrying value of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses reported in those financial statements. Those estimates and assumptions can be subjective and complex, and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. The Company s most critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition, concentration of credit risk, investments, inventory, and income taxes. Since December 31, 2023, there have been no significant changes to the assumptions and estimates related to those critical accounting policies. 

The following discussion and analysis cover material changes in the financial condition of the Company since the year ended December 31, 2023, and a comparison of the results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. All references in this quarterly report to sales or Sales shall mean Net Sales unless specified otherwise.

In accordance with ASU-2016-13, the Company recognizes an allowance for credit losses for financial assets carried at amortized cost to present the net amount expected to be collected as of the balance sheet date. Such allowance is based on the credit losses expected to arise over the life of the asset 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Net Sales 

Net sales for the third quarter of 2024 increased by 2,595 (less than 1 when compared with the same period in 2023. Net sales for the first nine months of 2024 increased by 1,427,121(17 as compared with the corresponding period in 2023. The increase in sales for the third quarter of 2024 and the first nine months of 2024 were attributable to changes in sales of the following product lines: 

Cosmetic ingredients : 

a) 

Third quarter sales : For the third quarter of 2024, the Company s sales of cosmetic ingredients increased by 92,409 (8 when compared with the third quarter of 2023. The increase in third quarter sales was due primarily to an increase of 245,168 (25 in sales of the Company s cosmetic products to ASI. Based on information provided to the Company by ASI, the majority of the increase in sales of the Company s products were to customers in China. 

Third quarter sales in 2024 to the Company s four other distributors, as well as to two direct cosmetic ingredient customers, decreased by a net of 152,759 (70 compared with the third quarter of 2023. This sales decline was due to reformulations and overstocking that is now corrected. 

b) 

Nine-month sales: For the first nine months of 2024, the Company s sales of cosmetic ingredients increased by 1,853,477 (68 when compared with the same period in 2023. This increase was due primarily to an increase of 2,238,221 (109 in sales to ASI. Based on information provided to the Company by ASI, the increase in sales was due to two main factors 1) higher restocking rate in Asia Pacific after a long destocking period in 2023 and 2) regaining market share at certain key accounts in China. 

Cosmetic ingredient sales for the first nine months of the year to the Company s four other cosmetic distributors, as well as to two direct cosmetic customers, decreased by a net of 384,744 (57 compared with the same period in 2023. This sales decline was due to reformulations and overstocking in 2023. 

Pharmaceuticals: 

Because there are fees, rebates and allowances associated with sales of the Company s two pharmaceutical products, Renacidin and Clorpactin, discussion of the Company s pharmaceutical sales includes references to both gross sales (before fees, rebates and allowances) and net sales (after fees, rebates and allowances). 

Page 20 of 26

Gross sales of the Company s pharmaceutical products for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 181,540 (12 compared with the corresponding period in 2023, while gross sales for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 502,500 (11 ). The decrease in sales for the three- and nine-month periods was due primarily to decreases of 123,412 (10 and 436,581 (11 ), respectively, in gross sales of Renacidin due to the temporary shutdown of the Company s contract manufacturer during the latter part of 2023 and the beginning of 2024. During this time, the Company was unable to fill full orders of Renacidin and was allocating product to all its pharmaceutical distributors. The Company began filing orders in full towards the end of March 2024. 

The Company typically experiences fluctuations in sales of its pharmaceutical products due to the timing of orders from its distributors. The Company has invested additional resources to better understand the market for its pharmaceutical products and will continue to invest resources to broaden market awareness. 

Net sales of the Company s pharmaceutical products for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 saw a similar pattern, decreasing by 74,386 (6 for the three-month period and decreasing by 441,224 (11 for the nine-month period, with those decreases due primarily to the reason noted above. 

The difference between the change in net sales compared with the change in gross sales for these products is due to a combination of the change in gross sales of those products combined with changes in pharmaceutical sales allowances related to these products. Typically, these allowances have a direct relationship with the sales of the Company s pharmaceutical products. For the three and nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, sales allowances related to the Company s pharmaceutical products decreased by 107,154 (41 and 61,277 (7 ), respectively, and was primarily related to a decrease in VA and Medicare CDGP Program rebates. 

Medical lubricants : 

Sales of the Company s medical lubricants decreased by 15,428 (2 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, compared with the same period in 2023, while sales for the nine-month period increased by 66,462 (4 ), compared with the same period in 2023. The changes in medical lubricant sales for the three and nine-month periods were primarily attributable to normal customer ordering patterns. 

Industrial and other products : 

Sales of the Company's industrial products, as well as other miscellaneous products, for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, decreased by 51,594 (100 ), when compared with the corresponding period in 2023. The decrease in sales was due to the discontinuation of this product line after the second quarter of 2023. There were no sales of this product line in the third quarters of both 2024 and 2023. 

Page 21 of 26

Cost of Sales 

Cost of sales as a percentage of sales decreased to 46 in the third quarter of 2024, down from 57 in the third quarter of 2023. For the first nine months of 2024, cost of sales as a percentage of sales decreased to 47 , down from 52 in 2023. The decreases in both periods were the result of the Company s cosmetic ingredient sales represented a larger percentage of the Company s total sales for both the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 compared with the same periods in 2023. These products carry a higher gross margin than the Company s pharmaceutical products. In addition, there were lower per unit overhead costs in 2024, which was the result of an increase in production of cosmetic products due to higher demand in 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023. 

Operating Expenses 

Operating expenses, consisting of selling and general and administrative expenses, increased by 102,583 (21 for the third quarter of 2024 compared with the equivalent period in 2023 and increased by 182,186 (12 for the first nine months of 2024, compared with the equivalent period in 2023. The increase in operating expenses for both periods was due primarily to increases in fees paid to the Company s Board of Directors and increases in payroll and payroll related expenses. 

Research and Development Expenses 

Research and development expenses increased by 12,931 (13 for the third quarter of 2024, and decreased by 28,115 (8 for the first nine months of 2024 compared with the same periods in 2023. The increase in the third quarter was primarily due to an increase in payroll and payroll-related expenses. 

Investment Income 

Investment income increased by 20,252 (25 and 115,750 (64 for the three- and nine-month periods, respectively, ending September 30, 2024, compared with the equivalent periods in 2023. The increases in both periods were primarily due to an increase in interest income from investments in U. S. Treasury Bills and Certificates of Deposit compared with the dividend income on the Company s equity and fixed income mutual funds recorded during the same periods in 2023. 

The change in the makeup of the Company s investment income was attributable to the Company repositioning its marketable securities portfolio late in the second quarter of 2023. During that time, the Company liquidated most of its holdings of equity and fixed income mutual funds. The Company used the proceeds from these sales to take advantage of higher interest rates by purchasing U.S. Treasury Bills. 

Net Gain (Loss) on Marketable Securities 

The net gain (loss) on marketable securities increased from a loss of 14,357 for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, to a gain of 47,223 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. For the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, the net gain on marketable securities increased from 65,823 to 79,218, respectively. These increased gains were primarily due to the factors discussed above regarding the Company s repositioning of its marketable securities portfolio. For a significant part of 2023, the Company s marketable securities portfolio was primarily invested in equity and fixed income mutual funds, and for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, these funds were invested primarily in U.S. Treasury Bills and Certificates of Deposit, which are recorded at amortized cost and are not subject to the same market volatility that the equity and fixed income mutual funds experience. The Company s management and Board of Directors continue to closely monitor the Company's investment portfolio, and have made and will continue to make any changes they believe may be necessary or appropriate to minimize the future impact on the Company s financial position that the volatility of the global financial markets may have.

Provision for Income Taxes 

The Company's effective income tax rate was approximately 21 for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023. The Company s tax rate is expected to remain at 21 for the current fiscal year. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

Working capital decreased from 10,718,457 at December 31, 2023 to 10,609,401 at September 30, 2024, a decrease of 109,056. The current ratio decreased from 8.0 to 1 at December 31, 2023 to 6.7 to 1 at September 30, 2024. The decrease in working capital and the current ratio was primarily due to an increase in accounts payable which was partially offset by an increase in the combination of cash and marketable securities. 

The Company believes that its working capital is, and will continue to be, sufficient to support its operating requirements for at least the next twelve months. 

The Company is in the process of upgrading its building sprinkler system and has incurred costs of 155,000 to date and expects to incur additional costs of 23,000 during the fourth quarter of 2024. The project is expected to be completed by the end of 2024. 

The Company is in the process of replacing the roof on a portion of its facility in Hauppauge, NY. at an estimated cost of 250,000. The project is due to be completed by the end of 2024. 

The Company generated cash from operations of 3,196,954 and 2,016,910 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The increase in cash from operations was primarily due to an increase in net income, combined with an increase in accounts payable. 

Cash used in investing activities for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 was 6,241,837. Cash provided by investing activities for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023 was 4,728,156 The fluctuation was due to the following: 1) during the first nine months of 2023, the Company liquidated a majority of its marketable equity and fixed income investments and repurchased U.S. Treasury Bills with maturities of less than 3 months, which were classified as cash and cash equivalents, and 2) during the first nine months of 2024, the Company liquidated a significant portion of its 3-month U.S Treasury Bills and reinvested in longer term U.S Treasury Bills, which are now classified as marketable securities. 

Cash used in financing activities was 2,756,323 and 459,387 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The increase was due to an increase in the dividends paid from 0.10 per share in 2023 to 0.60 per share in 2024. 

Page 23 of 26

The Company expects to continue to use its cash to make dividend payments, to purchase marketable securities, and to take advantage of growth opportunities that are in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders. 

OFF BALANCE-SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 

The Company has no off balance-sheet transactions that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future effect on the Company s financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
