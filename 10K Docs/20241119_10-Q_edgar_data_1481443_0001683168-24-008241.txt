ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

You should
read this discussion together with the Financial Statements, related Notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this
Form 10-Q. The following discussion contains assumptions, estimates and other forward-looking statements that involve a number of
risks and uncertainties, including those discussed under Risk Factors, and elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. These risks
could cause our actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements. 

This discussion is intended to further the reader s
understanding of the Company s financial condition and results of operations and should be read in conjunction with the Company s
financial statements and related notes included elsewhere herein. This discussion also contains forward-looking statements. The Company s
actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of the risks and uncertainties
set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report and in the Company s other SEC filings. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance
on any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. The Company is not party to any transactions that would be
considered off balance sheet pursuant to disclosure requirements under Item 303(c) of Regulation S-K. 

Overview 

The Company is a non-operating holding company.
Historically, the Company has been involved and invested in gaming and vending businesses, the focus of which was on the entertainment,
travel and leisure industries. Current management acquired control of the Company through purchase of preferred shares in July 2021 and
is in the process of identifying operating businesses that are potential candidates for acquisition. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

The relevant accounting policies are listed below. 

Basis of Accounting 

The basis is United States generally accepted
accounting principles. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents 

The Company considers all short-term investments
with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash and cash equivalents. 

Use of Estimates 

In preparing financial statements in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues
and expenses during the reported period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Advertising 

Advertising costs are expensed when incurred.
 The Company incurred 0 of sales and marketing expenses, including advertising, for the three and nine months ended September 30,
2024 and 2023. 

11 

Comprehensive Income (Loss) 

Net income (loss) is equal to comprehensive income
(loss). 

Income Taxes 

The Company maintains deferred tax assets that
reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes
and the amounts used for income tax purposes. These deferred tax assets consist of net operating loss carry forwards. The net deferred
tax asset has been fully offset by a valuation allowance because of the Company s history of losses. Utilization of operating losses
and credits may be subject to substantial annual limitation due to ownership change provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended and similar state provisions. The annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits before utilization. 

Due to our lack of revenues, we have not incurred
any tax obligations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. However, we would anticipate that income tax obligations will
arise as we begin to generate significant revenue in the future. 

The Company did not identify any material uncertain
tax positions. The Company did not recognize any interest or penalties for unrecognized tax benefits. 

The federal income tax returns of the Company
are subject to examination by the IRS generally for three years after they file. 

Year end 

The Company s fiscal year-end is December
31. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

In May 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-04, Earnings
Per Share (Topic 260), Debt-Modifications and Extinguishments (Subtopic 470-50), Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718), and Derivatives
and Hedging-Contracts in Entity s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40) , ASU 2021-04 ). This ASU reduces diversity in an
issuer s accounting for modifications or exchanges of freestanding equity-classified written call options (for example, warrants)
that remain equity classified after modification or exchange. This ASU provides guidance for a modification or an exchange of a freestanding
equity-classified written call option that is not within the scope of another Topic. It specifically addresses: (1) how an entity should
treat a modification of the terms or conditions or an exchange of a freestanding equity-classified written call option that remains equity
classified after modification or exchange; (2) how an entity should measure the effect of a modification or an exchange of a freestanding
equity-classified written call option that remains equity classified after modification or exchange; and (3) how an entity should recognize
the effect of a modification or an exchange of a freestanding equity-classified written call option that remains equity classified after
modification or exchange. This ASU is effective for all entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021. An entity should
apply the amendments prospectively to modifications or exchanges occurring on or after the effective date of the amendments. Early adoption
is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The adoption of ASU 2021-04 on January 1, 2022 did not have a material impact on
the Company s condensed financial statements or disclosures. 

In January 1, 2023, the Company adopted ASU 2022-02, Financial
Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures, which requires disclosure of gross
write-offs of finance receivables by year of origination. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our disclosures. 

In December 2023, the
FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures , which would require additional
transparency for income tax disclosures, including the income tax rate reconciliation table and cash taxes paid both in the United States
and foreign jurisdictions. This standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. We are currently assessing
the impact this standard will have on our disclosures.

Results of Operations for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 

For the three and nine months ended September
30, 2024 and 2023, we had no revenue. 

Costs of revenue during these above same periods
were 0. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and
2023, professional and administrative expenses were 44,730 and 58,008, respectively. These expenses were primarily for the daily operations
and legal services. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and
2023, professional expenses were 38,248 and 25,277, respectively. The professional expenses in the nine months ended September 30, 2024
and 2023 were mainly for the SEC filing preparations. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and
2023, general and administrative expenses were 6,482 and 32,731, respectively. The expenses incurred were primarily general and administrative
expenses. The decrease in general and administrative expenses was due to the decrease in management services. 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024
and 2023, professional and administrative expenses were 18,830 and 11,829, respectively. These costs were primarily the costs for the
daily operations and professional services. 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024
and 2023, professional expenses were 17,371 and 1,219, respectively. The increase of 16,152 compared with the prior period was due
to the increase of legal fees and fees for due diligence. 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024
and 2023, general and administrative expenses were 1,459 and 10,610, respectively. Costs incurred were primarily general and administrative
expenses. The decrease in general and administrative was due to reduced management fees. 

Going Concern 

The accompanying financial statements have been
prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the liquidation
of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company currently has no operations and had a stockholders deficit of 246,661 with
an accumulated deficit of 2,666,227 at September 30, 2024. The Company intends to find a merger target in the form of an operating entity.
The Company cannot be certain that it will be successful in this strategy. 

These factors, among others, raise substantial
doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments
that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

13 

Summary of any product research and development
that we will perform for the term of our plan of operation 

The Company is a shell company with no operations
and does not have specific products. Our research and development will depend on future merger with an operational company or companies. 

Expected purchase or sale of plant and significant
equipment 

We do not anticipate the purchase or sale of any
plant or significant equipment; as such, items are not required by us at this time. 

Significant changes in the number of employees 

As of September 30, 2024, we did not have any
paid employees. We are dependent upon our officers and directors for our future business development. As our operations expand,
we anticipate that we need to hire additional employees. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

As of September 30, 2024, we had cash of 0. 

A critical component of our operating plan impacting
our continued existence is our ability to obtain additional capital through additional equity and/or debt financing. 

We have limited financial resources available,
which has had an adverse impact on our liquidity, activities and operations. These limitations have adversely affected our ability
to obtain certain projects and pursue additional business. Without realization of additional capital, it would be unlikely for us
to continue as a going concern. In order for us to remain a going concern, we will need to obtain additional capital. Additional
working capital may be sought through additional debt or equity private placements, additional notes payable to banks or related parties
(officers, directors or stockholders), from other funding sources at market rates of interest, or a combination of these. The ability
to raise necessary financing will depend on many factors, including the nature and prospects of any business to be acquired and the economic
and market conditions prevailing at the time financing is sought. No assurances can be given that any necessary financing can be obtained
on terms favorable to us, or at all. 

As a result of our current cash status, no officer
or director received cash compensation through September 30, 2024. 

Future funding could result in potentially dilutive
issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities and/or amortization expenses related to goodwill and other
intangible assets, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Any future
acquisitions of other businesses, technologies, services or products might require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing, which
might not be available on terms favorable to us, or at all, and such financing, if available, might be dilutive. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements
that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues
or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Revenue Recognition: We recognize revenue from
product sales when all of the following criteria for revenue recognition have been met: pervasive evidence that an agreement exists; the
services have been rendered; the fee is fixed and determinable and not subject to refund or adjustment; and collection of the amount due
is reasonable assured.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

The information to be reported under this Item is not required of smaller
reporting companies. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the specified time periods. Our President (principal executive officer) and our Treasurer (principal financial officer)
(collectively, the Certifying Officers are responsible for maintaining our disclosure controls and procedures. The controls
and procedures established by us are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the issuer
in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the Commission s rules and forms. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
our Certifying Officers evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this
report. Based on the evaluation, the Certifying Officers concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide
reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the applicable rules and forms, and that it is accumulated and
communicated to our management, including the Certifying Officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting 

There was no change in our internal control over
financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that has materially affected, or is
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. We are aware that any system of controls, however
well designed and operated, can only provide reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system are met, and that
maintenance of disclosure controls and procedures is an ongoing process that may change over time.
