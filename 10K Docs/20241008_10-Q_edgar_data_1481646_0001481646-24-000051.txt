 SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements about us and our industry that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. All statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as "anticipate," "believe," "contemplate," "continue," "could," "estimate," "expect," "intend," "may," "plan," "potential," "predict," "project," "should," "target," "will," or "would" or the negative of these words or other similar terms or expressions. Forward-looking statements include information related to our financial performance and possible or assumed future results of operations and expenses, our outlook, business strategies and plans, business environment, market size, product capabilities, timing of new product releases, the impact of our focus areas and key initiatives, and potential future growth. Forward-looking statements include all statements that are not historical facts. 
 You should not rely on forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. We have based the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q primarily on our current expectations and projections about future events and trends that we believe may affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. The outcome of the events described in these forward-looking statements is subject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors described in the section titled "Risk Factors" and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all risks and uncertainties that could have an impact on the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The results, events, and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements may not be achieved or occur, and actual results, events, or circumstances could differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. 
 In addition, statements that "we believe" and similar statements reflect our beliefs and opinions on the relevant subject. These statements are based on information available to us as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. While we believe that such information provides a reasonable basis for these statements, that information may be limited or incomplete. Our statements should not be read to indicate that we have conducted an exhaustive inquiry into, or review of, all relevant information. These statements are inherently uncertain, and investors are cautioned not to unduly rely on these statements. 
 The forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q relate only to events as of the date on which the statements are made. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or to reflect new information or the occurrence of unanticipated events, except as required by law. We may not actually achieve the plans, intentions, or expectations disclosed in our forward-looking statements, and you should not place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements do not reflect the potential impact of any future acquisitions, mergers, dispositions, joint ventures, or investments we may make.

These costs are recorded as deferred contract acquisition costs in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company capitalized commission costs of and for the three months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company capitalized commission costs of and for the six months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Payments to direct sales personnel are typically made upon signature of the contract. The Company does not pay commissions on contract renewals. 
 Deferred commissions paid on the initial acquisition of a contract are amortized ratably over an estimated period of benefit of , which is the estimated customer life. The Company determined the period of amortization for deferred commissions by taking into consideration current customer contract terms, historical customer retention, and other factors. Amortization is included in sales and marketing expenses in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations and totaled and for the three months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and and for the six months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

The Company recorded deferred implementation costs of and for the three months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and and for the six months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

 Annually, and upon the identification of a triggering event, management is required to perform an evaluation of the recoverability of goodwill. Triggering events potentially warranting an interim goodwill impairment test include, among other factors, declines in historical or projected revenue, operating income or cash flows, and sustained declines in the Company s stock price or market capitalization, considered both in absolute terms and relative to peers. During the three months ended August 31, 2024, the Company determined that the decline in the price of its stock, which resulted in a corresponding decline in market capitalization, constituted a triggering event. The Company evaluated whether changes in the Company's market capitalization indicated that the carrying value of goodwill was impaired. As a result of this evaluation, the Company determined that there was impairment as of August 31, 2024. While management cannot predict if or when future goodwill impairments may occur, goodwill impairments could have material adverse effects on the Company s operating income, net assets, and/or the Company s cost of, or access to, capital.

 of Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 (the Notes) that mature in April 2026, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased. The Notes bear interest at a rate of per annum, payable semiannually in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year, beginning on October 1, 2021 and are convertible into cash, shares of the Company s common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, at the Company s election. The Company incurred costs of in connection with the Notes and the capped calls, of which was allocated to the Notes and recorded as a debt discount and was allocated to the capped call and recorded directly to additional paid-in capital. Net proceeds from the issuance of Notes were , and the Company used of the net proceeds to pay the costs of the capped call transactions described below. 
 Pursuant to the terms of the Notes, a holder may convert all or any portion of its Notes at its option at any time prior to October 1, 2025 and only under the following circumstances: (1) during any fiscal quarter commencing after the fiscal quarter ending on August 31, 2021, if the last reported sale price of the Company s common stock for at least trading days during a period of consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter is greater than or equal to of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (2) during the business day period after any consecutive trading day period (the measurement period in which the trading price (as defined in the Indenture) per 1 principal amount of Notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than of the product of the last reported sale price of the Company s common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; (3) if the Company calls such Notes for redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding the redemption date, but only with respect to the Notes called (or deemed called) for redemption; or (4) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. On or after October 1, 2025 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert all or any portion of their Notes at any time, regardless of the foregoing circumstances. 
 The initial conversion rate is 19.8088 shares of the Company s common stock per 1 principal amount of Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately per share of the Company s common stock). The conversion rate is subject to adjustment in some events but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, following certain corporate events that occur prior to the maturity date, or if the Company delivers a notice of redemption, the Company will, in certain circumstances, increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert its Notes in connection with such a corporate event or convert its Notes called (or deemed called) for redemption in connection with such notice of redemption, as the case may be. 
 The Company was not able to redeem the Notes prior to April 6, 2024. On or after April 6, 2024, the Company may redeem for cash all or any portion of the Notes (subject to the partial redemption limitation set forth in the Indenture),

of the conversion price then in effect for at least trading days, including the trading day immediately preceding the date on which the Company provides notice of redemption, during any consecutive trading day period ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which the Company provides notice of redemption at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. No sinking fund is provided for the Notes. 
 Upon a fundamental change (as defined in the Indenture), holders may, subject to certain exceptions, require the Company to purchase their Notes in whole or in part for cash at a price equal to the principal amount of the Notes to be purchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date (as defined in the Indenture). In addition, upon a Make-Whole Fundamental Change (as defined in the Indenture), the Company will, under certain circumstances, increase the applicable conversion rate for a holder that elects to convert its Notes in connection with such Make-Whole Fundamental Change. 
 Under the Indenture, the Notes may be accelerated upon the occurrence of certain customary events of default. If certain bankruptcy and insolvency-related events of default with respect to the Company occur, the principal of, and accrued and unpaid interest on, all of the then outstanding Notes shall automatically become due and payable. The Indenture provides that the sole remedy for an event of default relating to certain failures by the Company to comply with reporting covenants, including timely filings, consists exclusively of the right to receive additional interest on the Notes. 
 As of August 31, 2024, none of the conditions of the Notes to early convert had been met. The Notes are the Company s senior, unsecured obligations that rank senior in right of payment to the Company s future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated to the Notes, rank equally in right of payment with the Company s future senior unsecured indebtedness that is not so subordinated, effectively subordinated to the Company s existing and future secured indebtedness, to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness, and structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables and preferred equity (to the extent the Company is not a holder thereof)) of the Company s subsidiaries. The Notes contain both affirmative and negative covenants. As of August 31, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all covenants in the Notes. 
 The Company concluded the Notes are accounted for as debt, with no bifurcation of the embedded conversion feature. Transaction costs were recorded as a direct deduction from the related debt liability in the consolidated balance sheet and are amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the Notes. The effective interest rate for the Notes is .

Following the Repurchases, the Company cancelled the repurchased Notes. The repurchase and cancellation of the Notes was accounted for as a debt extinguishment and the resulting gain of , net of related unamortized issuance costs of and accrued interest of that were written-off, has been recorded within other income (expense) on the condensed consolidated statement of operations.

of the initial purchasers and/or their respective affiliates and another financial institution (the Option Counterparties). The capped call transactions are expected to offset the potential dilution to Accolade s common stock as a result of any conversion of Notes, with such offset subject to a cap initially equal to (which represented a premium of over the last reported sale price of the Company s common stock on March 24, 2021). The capped call transactions are separate transactions, entered into by the Company with the Option Counterparties, and are not part of the terms of the Notes. 
 As the capped call options are both legally detachable and separately exercisable from the Notes, the Company accounts for the capped call options separately from the Notes. The capped call options are indexed to the Company s own common stock and classified in stockholders equity. As such, the premiums paid for the capped call options were included as a net reduction to additional paid-in capital in the consolidated balance sheet. 
 (b) Revolving Credit Facility 
 During July 2019, the Company entered into a revolving credit facility (as amended, the 2019 Revolver) with a syndicate of banks. Under the 2019 Revolver, the Company has the capacity to borrow up to on a revolving facility. Availability of borrowings on the 2019 Revolver is calculated as a multiple of the Company s eligible monthly recurring revenues (as defined in the 2019 Revolver).

 (e) Employee Stock Purchase Plan 
 In July 2020, the Board of Directors adopted the Company s 2020 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the ESPP). As of August 31, 2024, there was a total of shares of common stock authorized for issuance under the ESPP, of which shares were available for future issuance . 
 Under the ESPP, eligible employees can purchase the Company s common stock through accumulated payroll deductions at such times as are established by the compensation committee. Eligible employees may purchase the Company s common stock at of the lower of the fair market value of the Company s common stock on the first day of the offering period or on the last day of the offering period. Eligible employees may contribute up to of their eligible compensation. Under the ESPP, a participant may not accrue rights to purchase more than worth of the Company s common stock for each calendar year in which such right is outstanding. 
 Employees who elect to participate in the ESPP commence payroll withholdings that accumulate through the end of the respective period. In accordance with the guidance in ASC 718-50 Compensation Stock Compensation , the ability to purchase shares of the Company s common stock for of the lower of the price on the first day of the offering period or the last day of the offering period (i.e. the purchase date) represents an option and , therefore, the ESPP is a compensatory plan under this guidance. Accordingly, share-based compensation expense is determined based on the option s grant-date fair value as estimated by applying the Black Scholes option-pricing model and is recognized over the withholding period. The Company recognized share-based compensation expense of and during the three months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and and during the six months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, related to the ESPP.

 Overview 
 We provide an advocacy-led, nationwide care delivery service comprised of personalized, technology-enabled solutions that help people better understand, navigate, and utilize the healthcare system and their workplace benefits. Our customers are primarily employers that deploy Accolade solutions in order to provide employees and their families (our members a single place to turn for their health, healthcare, and benefits needs. We also offer expert medical opinion services to commercial customers (which includes employers, health plans, and governmental entities) and virtual primary care and mental health therapy, both directly to consumers and to commercial customers. Our innovative platform combines open, cloud-based intelligent technology with multimodal support from a team of empathetic and knowledgeable Accolade Care Advocates and clinicians, including primary care physicians, registered nurses, physician medical directors, pharmacists, behavioral health specialists, women s health specialists, case management specialists, and expert medical opinion providers. We leverage our integrated capabilities, connectivity with providers and the broader healthcare ecosystem, and longitudinal data to engage across the entire member population, rather than focusing solely on high-cost claimants or those with chronic conditions. Our goal is to build trusted relationships with our members that ultimately position us to deliver personalized recommendations and interventions. We believe that our platform dramatically improves the member experience, encourages better health outcomes, and lowers costs for both our members and our customers. 
 We offer our solutions as standalone or bundled offerings. Our solution portfolio combines the capabilities of Accolade s historical navigation and advocacy solutions with our primary care, mental health, and expert medical opinion services, augmented by artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data-driven recommendations. Our offerings include: 
 Plus and Connect A benefits navigation and care solution designed to work with our customers existing benefits ecosystem, incorporating elements of all Accolade solutions including Advocacy, Accolade Expert MD, Accolade Care, and the Accolade partner ecosystem.

 Accolade Expert MD Expert medical consultations that connect patients to highly qualified condition-specific specialists for both adult and pediatric care 
 Accolade Care and PlushCare Integrated primary care and mental health support delivered for both commercial customers and direct consumers 
 Trusted Partner Ecosystem - In addition to Accolade s owned solutions, we have assembled a roster of high-quality partners whose condition-specific solutions are complementary to our services and capable of delivering additional value to our members and customers or capabilities that meet specific customer needs. 
 We were founded in 2007 and launched our initial offering in 2009. We have seen significant growth in recent years since the changes to our executive management team in 2015 and the subsequent investments we have made in product, technology, sales, and distribution. As of February 29, 2024, we had over 1,200 commercial customers comprising more than 14 million members. Our customers represent a diversified set of industries, including technology, financial

Table of Contents 

 services, healthcare, manufacturing, transportation, education, retail, and the public sector. Additionally, as of February 29, 2024, we had more than 150,000 consumers subscribed to virtual primary care services through our PlushCare solution. 
 For the three months ended August 31, 2024, our total revenue was 106.4 million, representing 10 year-over-year growth compared to total revenue of 96.9 million for the three months ended August 31, 2023. For the six months ended August 31, 2024, our total revenue was 216.8 million, representing 14 year-over-year growth compared to total revenue of 190.1 million for the six months ended August 31, 2023. For the three months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023, our net loss was 23.9 million and 32.8 million, respectively. For the six months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023, our net loss was 51.5 million and 71.2 million, respectively. 
 
 Our Business Model 
 We provide our solutions primarily to employers that deploy Accolade offerings to our members and to consumers who directly purchase our PlushCare virtual primary care services. We earn revenue from providing personalized health guidance solutions, expert medical opinion services, and virtual primary care services to the members of our commercial customers' health plans and to members of fully insured plans offered via health insurance companies. Our advocacy solutions are priced based on a recurring per-member-per-month (PMPM) fee, typically consisting of both a base fee and a performance-based fee component. As a result, generally, a portion of our potential revenue is variable, subject to our achievement of performance metrics and the realization of savings in healthcare spend by our customers resulting from the utilization of our solutions. We typically achieve a substantial portion of the contractual performance metrics and realization in savings of healthcare spend. We also provide expert medical opinion services, which are typically charged on a PMPM or case rate basis, and virtual primary care services which are typically priced on a fee per visit basis for consumers and a visit fee basis or PMPM plus visit fee basis for commercial customers. 
 The primary cost of delivering our service includes the personnel costs of Accolade Care Advocates and clinicians, including registered nurses, physician medical directors, pharmacists, behavioral health specialists, women's health specialists, case management specialists, expert medical opinion providers and primary care physicians, as well as software and tools for telephony, workforce management, business analytics, allocated overhead costs, and other expenses related to delivery and implementation of our solutions. As we support more customers with an increasing number of members over time, we expect that our support costs per member will decline due to economies of scale and improved operational efficiencies driven by continued enhancements of our technology platform and capabilities. We have experienced and expect to continue to achieve operational efficiencies realized from continued enhancements of our technology platform and capabilities. 
 We employ a multipronged go-to-market strategy to increase adoption of our solutions to new and existing customers. We principally sell our solutions through our direct salesforce which is stratified by account size (i.e., strategic (more than 35,000 employees), enterprise (5,000 to 35,000 employees), and mid-market (500 to 5,000 employees)), region, and existing versus prospective customer. Our sales team possesses deep domain expertise in health benefits management and brings substantial experience selling to key decision makers within our current and prospective customer organizations (human resource officers, CFOs, benefits executives, consultants, and brokers). We believe the effectiveness of our sales organization is evidenced by growing adoption of our platform by large strategic customers, recent traction with enterprise and mid-market customers and demonstrated demand for add-on offerings from existing customers. 
 We have chosen to invest significantly in growing our customer base, and plan to continue both adding new customers and expanding our relationships with existing customers, which we believe will allow us to increase margins over time. When a customer renews their contract or purchases additional solutions or enhancements, the value realized from that customer increases because we generally do not incur significant incremental acquisition or implementation costs for the renewal or expansion. We believe that as our customer base grows and a higher percentage of our revenue is attributable to renewals and upsells or cross-sells to existing customers, relative to acquisition of new customers, associated sales and marketing expenses and other upfront costs will decrease as a percentage of revenue. 
 In addition, we have strategically curated our offering portfolio to ensure we have a compelling value proposition at an appropriate price point that resonates with each identified customer segment. Based on our experience, the opportunity to cross-sell is meaningfully enhanced once a customer has been on-boarded onto our platform and has benefited from a measurable and compelling return on their investment. Our customer success team provides strategic insights, point solution recommendations, and day-to-day account support to our customers. They are focused on existing customer retention, cross-sell, and upsell. 
 We maintain relationships with a range of third parties, including brokers, agents, benefits consultants, carriers, third-party administrators, suppliers in our Trusted Partner Ecosystem, and co-marketing and co-selling partners. These 
 23 

Table of Contents 

 third parties provide an important source of referrals for our sales organization. We also selectively form strategic alliances to further drive customer acquisition and adoption of our solutions. We believe the breadth of our go-to-market and distribution strategy enables us to reach customers of nearly every size and across markets. 
 We have demonstrated a consistent track record of product and technology innovation over time as evidenced by continuous improvement of our platform and new offerings. This innovation is driven by feedback we receive from our customers, industry experts, and the market generally. Our technology platform has enabled us to unbundle aspects of our core navigation capability to create various offerings for our customers, while integrating capabilities from our recent acquisitions to deliver our Personalized Healthcare solution that combines our core navigation with expert medical consultations and virtual primary care. Our investments in product and technology have been focused on increasing the value we provide via our personalized member health guidance solutions and expanding the market segments we can serve with a portfolio of offerings and associated price points. 
 
 Business Environment and Trends 
 While macroeconomic factors including inflation and geopolitical risk have not had a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations to date, the future impact of these factors on our operational and financial performance will depend on certain developments, including U.S. unemployment and economic growth, changes in interest rates, impact on our customers and our sales cycles, impact on our marketing efforts, and any decreases of workforce or benefits spending by our customers, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. Changing macroeconomic factors may affect our customers' desire to renew their contracts. If our customers undergo layoffs or reductions in force, our membership numbers would decrease, which would reduce our revenues. We may experience increased member attrition to the extent our existing customers reduce their respective workforces in response to changes in economic conditions. Any layoffs or reductions in employee headcounts by our commercial customers would result in a reduction in our base and variable PMPM fees. When customer headcount reductions occur, we may not experience the impact of changes to our customers headcounts immediately because employees that are on furlough or are receiving continued health coverage pursuant to COBRA may still have access to our services during such periods and would be included in our member count. 
 We believe our value proposition resonates with a broad audience of employers. Disruptions to traditional care consumption ignited by the COVID-19 pandemic have reinforced the need for navigation services, and that projected increases in healthcare costs (due to some combination of complications stemming from neglected conditions, pent-up demand for elective services, and strain on individuals mental health) prompt the need for solutions such as ours that bend the cost curve, and improve health outcomes, by driving good utilization up and wasteful utilization down. 
 
 Factors Affecting Our Performance 
 The following factors have been important to our business and we expect them to impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition in future periods: 
 Growth and Retention of Our Customer Base 
 We believe there is a substantial opportunity to further grow our customer base in our large and under-penetrated market through our sales and marketing strategy. Across our existing customer base and as we acquire new customers, we intend to expand and deepen these relationships. As we build trust through our proven model, we seek to cross-sell our Accolade Expert MD and Accolade Care solutions as well as Accolade partner ecosystem programs. We refer to such add-on sales as platform-connected revenues. We plan to continue to invest in sales and marketing in order to grow our customer base and increase sales to existing customers. Any investments we make in our sales and marketing organization will occur in advance of experiencing any benefits from such investments, so it may be difficult for us to determine if we are efficiently allocating our resources in these areas. 
 Adoption of Current and Future Solutions 
 We are constantly innovating to enhance our model and develop new offerings. Our ability to act as a trusted advisor to our members and customers positions us to identify new opportunities for additional offerings that can meet their existing and emerging needs. Our open technology platform also allows us to efficiently add and integrate new offerings and applications on top of our existing technology stack that target specific challenges faced by our customers.

 Achievement of Performance-Based Revenue 
 In most of our contracts, a portion of our potential fee is variable, subject to our achievement of performance metrics and the realization of savings in healthcare spend by our customers resulting from the utilization of our solutions, and thus we might record higher revenue in some quarters compared to others. Examples of performance metrics included in our customer contracts are achievement of specified member engagement levels, member satisfaction levels, and various operational metrics. Although we have earned over 90 of the aggregate maximum potential revenue under our contracts (measured on the corresponding calendar year basis) in fiscal years 2024 and 2023, our revenue and financial results in the future may vary as a result of our ability to earn this performance-based revenue. In addition, because our customers typically pay both the base PMPM fees and variable PMPM fees in advance on a periodic basis, any required refund as a result of our failure to earn the performance-based revenue could have a negative impact on cash flows. 
 Investments in Technology 
 Significant investments in our technology platform have enhanced our capabilities with respect to how we engage with our members and deliver our solutions and care interventions. By leveraging our technology in areas such as machine learning, predictive analytics, and multimodal communication, we believe we can generate more efficiencies in our operating model while simultaneously improving our ability to deliver better health outcomes and lower costs for both our members and our customers. We will continue to invest in our technology platform to empower our Accolade Care Advocates, our clinicians, and our members to further improve and optimize efficiencies in our operating model. However, our investments in our technology platform may be more expensive or take longer to develop than we expect and may not result in operational efficiencies. 
 
 Seasonality 
 There are seasonal factors that may cause us to record higher revenue in some quarters compared with others. We have historically recorded a disproportionate amount of revenue during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year relative to the first three quarters of our fiscal year. This timing is caused, in part, by the measurement, achievement, and associated revenue recognition of performance metrics and healthcare costs savings components of certain of our customer contracts during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. Additionally, services launch on January 1 for the majority of our commercial customer contracts which is during our fiscal fourth quarter. While we believe we have visibility into the seasonality of our business, our rapid growth rate and acquisitions over the last several years have made seasonal fluctuations more difficult to detect. 
 
 Basis of Presentation and Components of Revenue and Expenses 
 We operate our business through a single reportable segment. We operate on a fiscal year ending at the end of February of each year, and our fiscal quarters end on May 31, August 31, November 30, and the last day of February. 
 
 Revenue 
 We earn revenue from providing personalized health guidance solutions (advocacy), expert medical opinion, and virtual primary care services to the members of our commercial customers' health plans and to members of fully insured plans offered via health insurance companies. Access fees for these services are priced primarily using a recurring PMPM fee, typically with a portion of the fee calculated as the product of a fixed rate times the number of members, and a variable PMPM fee calculated as the product of a variable rate times the number of members. The fees associated with variable PMPM charges are earned through the achievement of performance metrics and/or the realization of healthcare cost savings resulting from use of our services. We also earn revenue from providing virtual primary care services directly to consumers on a monthly or yearly fixed fee subscription basis. Our expert medical opinion and virtual primary care services typically also include a variable rate charged based on utilization for commercial customers (i.e. case rate or fee-per-visit). As a result, a portion of our total potential fee is typically variable, subject to our achievement of performance metrics, the realization of savings in healthcare spend by our customers resulting from the utilization of our solutions, and the number of eligible members during the respective period. 
 
 Cost of Revenue, Excluding Depreciation and Amortization 
 Our cost of revenue, excluding depreciation and amortization, consists primarily of personnel costs including salaries, wages, bonuses, stock-based compensation expense and benefits, as well as software and tools for telephony, workforce management, business analytics, allocated overhead costs, certain member outreach costs, and other expenses related to delivery and implementation of our personalized technology-enabled solutions, expert medical opinion services, 
 25 

Table of Contents 

 and virtual primary care services. We expect cost of revenue, excluding depreciation and amortization, to increase along with revenue growth over time but decrease as a percentage of revenue. 
 
 Operating Expenses 
 Product and technology. Product and technology expenses include costs to build new offerings, add new features to our existing solutions, and to manage, operate, and ensure the reliability and scalability of our existing technology platform. Product and technology expenses consist of personnel expenses, including salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation expense, and benefits for employees and contractors for our engineering, product, and design teams, and allocated overhead costs, as well as costs of software and tools for business analytics, data management, and IT applications that are not directly associated with delivery of our solutions to customers. Over time, we expect product and technology expenses to decrease as a percentage of revenue. 
 Sales and marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist of personnel expenses, including sales commissions for our direct sales force and our market and business development workforce, as well as digital marketing costs, promotional costs, customer conferences, public relations, other marketing events, and allocated overhead costs. Sales and marketing expenses also include advertising and digital media costs associated with our efforts to acquire new consumer customers and build awareness for our direct-to-consumer offering. Personnel expenses include salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation expense, and benefits for employees and contractors. We expect sales and marketing expense to increase in absolute dollars but remain relatively stable as a percentage of revenue over time. 
 General and administrative. General and administrative expenses consist of personnel expenses and related expenses for our executive, finance and accounting, human resources, legal, and corporate organizations. Personnel expenses include salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation expense, and benefits for employees and contractors. In addition, general and administrative expenses include external legal, accounting, and other professional fees, as well as tools for financial and human capital management, and allocated overhead costs. Over time, we expect general and administrative expenses to decrease as a percentage of revenue. 
 Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expenses are primarily attributable to our capital investments and consist of fixed asset depreciation, amortization of intangibles considered to have definite lives, and amortization of capitalized internal-use software costs.

 Certain Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 We use the following non-GAAP financial measures to help us evaluate trends, establish budgets, measure the effectiveness and efficiency of our operations, and determine employee incentives. 
 Three months ended August 31, Six months ended August 31, 2024 2023 2024 2023 (in thousands, except percentages) 
 (in thousands, except percentages) 
 Adjusted Gross Profit 50,304 42,841 103,057 83,409 Adjusted Gross Margin 47.3 44.2 47.5 43.9 Adjusted EBITDA (2,832) (8,764) (6,178) (21,346) 
 Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Margin 
 Adjusted Gross Profit is a non-GAAP financial measure that we define as revenue less cost of revenue, excluding depreciation and amortization, and excluding stock-based compensation and severance costs. We define Adjusted Gross Margin as our Adjusted Gross Profit divided by our revenue. We expect Adjusted Gross Margin to continue to improve over time to the extent that we are able to gain efficiencies through technology and successfully cross-sell and upsell our current and future offerings. However, our ability to improve Adjusted Gross Margin over time is not guaranteed and will be impacted by the factors affecting our performance discussed above and the risks outlined in the section titled Risk Factors. We believe Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Margin are useful to investors, as they eliminate the impact of certain non-cash expenses and allow a direct comparison of these measures between periods without the impact of non-cash expenses and certain other nonrecurring operating expenses. 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that we define as net income (loss) adjusted to exclude interest expense (income), net, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, acquisition and integration-related costs, goodwill impairment, change in fair value of contingent consideration, severance costs, and other expense (income). Severance costs include severance payments related to the realignment of our resources. Other expense (income) includes debt extinguishment gain or loss and foreign exchange gain or loss. We believe Adjusted EBITDA provides investors with useful information on period-to-period performance as evaluated by management and comparison with our past financial performance. We believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry, as this measure generally eliminates the effects of certain items that may vary from company to company for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance. 
 Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Gross Margin and Adjusted EBITDA have certain limitations, including that they exclude the impact of certain non-cash charges, such as depreciation and amortization, whereas underlying assets may need to be replaced and result in cash capital expenditures, and stock-based compensation expense, which is a recurring charge. These non-GAAP financial measures may also not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies because they may not calculate such measures in the same manner, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. In evaluating these non-GAAP financial measures, you should be aware that in the future we expect to incur expenses similar to the adjustments in this presentation. Our presentation of non-GAAP financial measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by these expenses or any unusual or nonrecurring items. When evaluating our performance, you should consider these non-GAAP financial measures alongside other financial performance measures, including the most directly comparable GAAP measures set forth in the reconciliation tables below and our other GAAP

 GAAP gross margin for the three months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023, increased to 38.8 from 34.5 , respectively, and Adjusted Gross Margin for the three months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023 increased to 47.3 from 44.2 , respectively. GAAP gross margin for the six months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023 increased to 39.2 from 33.9 , respectively, and Adjusted Gross Margin for the six months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023 increased to 47.5 from 43.9 , respectively. The increases in GAAP gross margin and Adjusted Gross Margin during the three and six months ended August 31, 2024 were primarily due to the timing of high gross margin revenues recognized during the first half of fiscal 2025 that did not occur during the first half of fiscal 2024, as well as through cost efficiencies resulting from initiatives to optimize staffing costs and service delivery by leveraging technology to automate elements of service delivery and member experience processes, and by hiring certain roles in lower cost geographies. 
 The following table presents, for the periods indicated, a reconciliation of our Adjusted EBITDA to our net loss:

 (1) For the three and six months ended August 31, 2023, acquisition and integration-related costs represent expenses associated with litigation inherited through the PlushCare acquisition. 
 (2) Severance costs represent expenses associated with workforce realignment actions taken by management.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We had cash and cash equivalents of 173.3 million and marketable securities of 61.0 million as of August 31, 2024 totaling an aggregate of 234.4 million of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. Our cash equivalents are comprised primarily of money market accounts held at banks, as well as in commercial paper and U.S. treasury bills with original maturities less than three months. Marketable securities are comprised of U.S. government debt, commercial paper, and U.S. agency debt with original maturities greater than three months. Management believes the Company s cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, plus customer revenues and advances and available borrowings under its debt facility, are sufficient to fund its operations through at least the next 12 months from the issuance of these condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 Our Debt Arrangements 
 In March 2021, we issued an aggregate of 287.5 million principal amount of 0.50 Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 (the Notes), including the exercise in full by the initial purchasers of their option to purchase up to an additional 37.5 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes, pursuant to an Indenture dated as of March 29, 2021 (the Indenture), between us and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee. During November 2023, we entered into separate, privately negotiated transactions with certain holders of the Notes to repurchase 76.5 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes for an aggregate cash repurchase price of 66.2 million. We subsequently cancelled the repurchased Notes. After the cancellation, 211.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes remained outstanding. The Notes bear interest at a rate of 0.50 per annum, payable semiannually in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year. The Notes mature on April 1, 2026, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased. The Notes are convertible into cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election. 
 We currently have a revolving credit facility (2019 Revolver), which we entered into in July 2019. The 2019 Revolver provides for a senior secured revolving line of credit in the amount of up to 80.0 million, with borrowing availability subject to certain monthly recurring revenue calculations. The interest rate on any outstanding borrowings are at the Bloomberg Short-Term Bank Yield Index rate (BSBY) plus 350 basis points or Base Rate (as defined) plus 250 basis points, with the BSBY rate and Base Rate subject to minimum levels, subject to certain floors, and interest payments are to be made in installments of one, two, or three months as chosen by us. We also have outstanding letters of credit to serve as office landlord security deposits in the amount of 1.2 million, which are secured through the revolving credit facility and reduce our borrowing capacity. The capacity of the revolving credit facility was 63.5 million as of August 31, 2024. Under the terms of the 2019 Revolver, as we had more than 200.0 million of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities as of May 31, 2024, the 2019 Revolver term was automatically extended until July 19, 2025. 
 We were in compliance with all such applicable covenants as of August 31, 2024, and believe we are in compliance as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We do not expect to need to draw on the 2019 Revolver, but our access to draw on the 2019 Revolver could be limited in the future if we do not have enough monthly recurring revenues to cover the borrowing availability calculations. 
 Cash Flows 
 The following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated: 
 Six months ended August 31, 2024 2023 (in thousands) Net cash used in operating activities (2,976) (27,325) Net cash used in investing activities (11,504) (6,663) Net cash provided by financing activities 2,077 5,092 
 Operating Activities. Net cash used in operating activities decreased by 24.3 million to 3.0 million during the six months ended August 31, 2024 from 27.3 million during the six months ended August 31, 2023, primarily due to increased performance of the business including growth in revenues and gross profit which resulted in a reduction in cash used in operating activities. 
 Investing Activities. Net cash used in investing activities increased by 4.8 million to 11.5 million during the six months ended August 31, 2024, from 6.7 million during the six months ended August 31, 2023, primarily due to 
 33 

Table of Contents 

 purchases of marketable securities in fiscal 2025, partially offset by maturities of marketable securities and lower purchases of property and equipment and capitalized software development costs. 
 Financing Activities. Net cash provided by financing activities decreased by 3.0 million to 2.1 million during the six months ended August 31, 2024 from 5.1 million during the six months ended August 31, 2023 primarily due to lower proceeds from stock option exercises. 
 
 Material Cash Requirements 
 As of August 31, 2024, our material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations, which we expect to fund through available cash, future cash generated from operations, and our existing financing arrangements, are as follows: 
 Principal and interest obligations on convertible debt As discussed in detail above, the 211.0 million principal amount of the Notes matures on April 1, 2026. See Our Debt Arrangements above and Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for more details. 
 Operating leases We have entered into operating leases, primarily for office space. The amount and composition of our leases have not changed significantly during the three months ended August 31, 2024. 
 Other purchase obligations We have entered into certain arrangements that include obligations to make significant future purchases. The majority of these purchases are not expected to be made over the next 12 months. See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements for more details. 
 Other material cash requirements In addition to the above, our material cash requirements also include compensation and benefits expenses for our employees, severance for terminated employees, expenses for software and third-party services, and other miscellaneous expenses. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other purposes. We did not have any other off-balance sheet arrangements, except to the extent reflected under Material Cash Requirements above and in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses, as well as related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates. 
 There have been no significant changes in our critical accounting policies and estimates during the six months ended August 31, 2024, as compared to the critical accounting policies and estimates described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended February 29, 2024 filed with the SEC. 
 
 Recently Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 
 For more information on recently issued accounting pronouncements, see Note 2 in the accompanying Notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We had cash and cash equivalents of 173.3 million and marketable securities of 61.0 million as of August 31, 2024 totaling an aggregate of 234.4 million of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. Our cash equivalents are comprised primarily of money market accounts held at banks, as well as in commercial paper and U.S. treasury bills with 
 34 

Table of Contents 

 original maturities less than three months. Marketable securities are comprised of U.S. government debt, commercial paper, and U.S. agency debt with original maturities greater than three months. Due to the short-term nature of these instruments, we believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio as a result of changes in interest rates. Declines in interest rates, however, would reduce future interest income. 
 In addition, our 2019 Revolver has a variable interest rate which, if drawn upon, would subject us to risks associated with changes in that interest rate. We had no borrowings under the 2019 Revolver during the three months ended August 31, 2024. 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Risk 
 We have in the past and may in the future be exposed to foreign currency exchange risks in the ordinary course of our business, but that exposure is not currently material to our business or results of operations. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of August 31, 2024 . Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of August 31, 2024 , our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rules 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 
 Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and are effective at the reasonable assurance level. However, our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
