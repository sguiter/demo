 EXPLANATORY NOTE 
 This report combines the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2024 of BXP, Inc. and Boston Properties Limited Partnership. Unless stated otherwise or the context otherwise requires, references to BXP mean BXP, Inc. (formerly known as Boston Properties, Inc.), a Delaware corporation and real estate investment trust REIT ), and references to BPLP and the Operating Partnership mean Boston Properties Limited Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership. BPLP is the entity through which BXP conducts substantially all of its business and owns, either directly or through subsidiaries, substantially all of its assets. BXP is the sole general partner and also a limited partner of BPLP. As the sole general partner of BPLP, BXP has exclusive control of BPLP s day-to-day management. Therefore, unless stated otherwise or the context requires, references to the Company, we, us and our refer collectively to BXP, BPLP and those subsidiaries consolidated by BXP. 
 As of September 30, 2024, BXP owned an approximate 89.6 ownership interest in BPLP. The remaining approximate 10.4 interest was owned by limited partners. The other limited partners of BPLP (1) contributed their direct or indirect interests in properties to BPLP in exchange for common units of limited partnership interest in BPLP or (2) received long-term incentive plan units of BPLP pursuant to BXP s Stock Option and Incentive Plans, or both. Under the limited partnership agreement of BPLP, unitholders may present their common units of BPLP for redemption at any time (subject to restrictions agreed upon at the time of issuance of the units that may restrict such right for a period of time, generally one year from issuance). Upon presentation of a common unit for redemption, BPLP must redeem the unit for cash equal to the then value of a share of BXP s common stock. In lieu of a cash redemption by BPLP, however, BXP may elect to acquire any common units so tendered by issuing shares of BXP common stock in exchange for the common units. If BXP so elects, its common stock will be exchanged for common units on a one-for-one basis. This one-for-one exchange ratio is subject to specified adjustments to prevent dilution. BXP generally expects that it will elect to issue its common stock in connection with each such presentation for redemption rather than having BPLP pay cash. With each such exchange or redemption, BXP s percentage ownership in BPLP will increase. In addition, whenever BXP issues shares of its common stock other than to acquire common units of BPLP, BXP must contribute any net proceeds it receives to BPLP and BPLP must issue to BXP a number of common units of BPLP that equals the number of shares of BXP common stock so issued. This structure is commonly referred to as an umbrella partnership REIT, or UPREIT. 
 The Company believes that combining the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q of BXP and BPLP into this single report: 
 enhances investors understanding of BXP and BPLP by enabling them to view the business as a whole in the same manner as management views and operates the business; 
 eliminates duplicative disclosure and provides a more concise and readable presentation because a substantial portion of the disclosure applies to both BXP and BPLP; and 
 creates time and cost efficiencies through the preparation of one combined report instead of two separate reports. 
 The Company believes it is important to understand the few differences between BXP and BPLP in the context of how BXP and BPLP operate as a consolidated company. The financial results of BPLP are consolidated into the financial statements of BXP. BXP does not have any other significant assets, liabilities or operations, other than its investment in BPLP, nor does it have employees of its own. BPLP, not BXP, generally executes all significant business relationships other than transactions involving the securities of BXP. BPLP holds substantially all of the assets of BXP, including ownership interests in subsidiaries and joint ventures. BPLP conducts the operations of the business and is structured as a partnership with no publicly traded equity. Except for the net proceeds from equity issuances by BXP, which are contributed to the capital of BPLP in exchange for common or preferred units of partnership in BPLP, as applicable, BPLP generates all remaining capital required by the Company s business. These sources include working capital, net cash provided by operating activities, borrowings under its credit facilities, the issuance of secured and unsecured debt and equity securities and proceeds received from the disposition of certain properties and interests in joint ventures. 
 Shareholders equity, partners capital and noncontrolling interests are the main areas of difference between the consolidated financial statements of BXP and BPLP. The limited partners of BPLP are accounted for as partners capital in BPLP s financial statements and as noncontrolling interests in BXP s financial statements. The noncontrolling interests in BPLP s financial statements include the interests of unaffiliated partners in various consolidated partnerships. The noncontrolling interests in BXP s financial statements include the same 

Table of Contents 

 noncontrolling interests in BPLP and limited partners of BPLP. The differences between shareholders equity and partners capital result from differences in the equity issued by each of BXP and BPLP. 
 In addition, the consolidated financial statements of BXP and BPLP differ in total real estate assets resulting from previously applied acquisition accounting by BXP for the issuance of common stock in connection with non-sponsor redemptions of common units of BPLP. This accounting resulted in a step-up of the real estate assets of BXP at the time of such redemptions, resulting in a difference between the net real estate of BXP as compared to BPLP of approximately 237.8 million, or 1.2 at September 30, 2024, and a corresponding difference in depreciation expense, impairment losses and gains on sales of real estate upon the sale of these properties having an allocation of the real estate step-up. The acquisition accounting was nullified on a prospective basis beginning in 2009 as a result of the Company s adoption of a new accounting standard requiring any subsequent redemptions to be accounted for solely as an equity transaction. 
 To help investors better understand the key differences between BXP and BPLP, the following items in this report present information separately for BXP and BPLP: 
 Item 1. Financial Statements (unaudited), which includes the following specific disclosures for BXP and BPLP:

 BXP, INC. AND BOSTON PROPERTIES LIMITED PARTNERSHIP 
 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
 at December 31, 2023) general and limited partnership interest in BPLP. Unless stated otherwise or the context requires, the Company refers to BXP and its subsidiaries, including BPLP and its consolidated subsidiaries. Partnership interests in BPLP include: 
 common units of partnership interest (also referred to as OP Units and 
 long term incentive units of partnership interest (also referred to as LTIP Units 
 Unless specifically noted otherwise, all references to OP Units exclude units held by BXP. A holder of an OP Unit may present the OP Unit to BPLP for redemption at any time (subject to restrictions agreed upon at the time of issuance of OP Units to particular holders that may restrict such redemption right for a period of time, generally year from issuance). Upon presentation of an OP Unit for redemption, BPLP is obligated to redeem the OP Unit for cash equal to the value of a share of common stock of BXP Common Stock ). In lieu of such cash redemption, BXP may elect to acquire the OP Unit for share of Common Stock. Because the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at all times equals the number of OP Units that BXP owns, share of Common Stock is generally the economic equivalent of OP Unit, and the quarterly distribution that may be paid to the holder of an OP Unit equals the quarterly dividend that may be paid to the holder of a share of Common Stock. 
 The Company uses LTIP Units as a form of time-based, restricted equity compensation and as a form of performance-based equity compensation for employees, and has previously granted LTIP Units in the form of (1) 2012 outperformance plan awards 2012 OPP Units and (2) 2013 - 2024 multi-year, long-term incentive program awards (also referred to as MYLTIP Units ), each of which, upon the satisfaction of certain performance-based and time-based vesting conditions, is convertible into one OP Unit. The three -year measurement periods for the 2012 OPP Units and the 2013 - 2021 MYLTIP Units have ended and BXP s total stockholder return TSR was sufficient for employees to earn and therefore become eligible to vest in a portion of the awards. Unless and until they are earned, the rights, preferences and privileges of the 2022 - 2024 MYLTIP Units differ from other LTIP Units granted to employees (including the 2012 OPP Units and the 2013 - 2021 MYLTIP Units, which have been earned). Therefore, unless specifically noted otherwise, all references to LTIP Units exclude the 2022 - 2024 MYLTIP Units. LTIP Units (including the earned 2012 OPP Units and the earned 2013 - 2021 MYLTIP Units), whether vested or not, receive the same quarterly per unit distributions as OP Units, which equal per share dividends on Common Stock (See Notes 9 and 13). 
 Properties 
 At September 30, 2024, the Company owned or had joint venture interests in a portfolio of commercial real estate properties (the Properties aggregating approximately million net rentable square feet of primarily office properties, including properties under construction/redevelopment totaling approximately million net rentable square feet. At September 30, 2024, the Properties consisted of: 
 office and life sciences properties (including properties under construction/redevelopment); 
 retail properties (including property under construction); 
 residential properties (including properties under construction); and

Variable Interest Entities (VIEs) 
 The Company has identified entities that are VIEs as of September 30, 2024 and has determined that it is the primary beneficiary for all of these entities as of September 30, 2024. 
 Consolidated Variable Interest Entities 
 As of September 30, 2024, BXP has identified consolidated VIEs, including BPLP. Excluding BPLP, the consolidated VIEs consisted of (i) the following in-service properties: 767 Fifth Avenue (the General Motors Building), Times Square Tower, 601 Lexington Avenue, Atlantic Wharf Office Building and 100 Federal Street, (ii) 343 Madison Avenue, which is categorized as land held for future development and (iii) 290 Binney Street and 300 Binney Street, which are currently under development / redevelopment (See Note 14). 
 The Company consolidates these VIEs because it is the primary beneficiary. The third parties interests in these consolidated entities (excluding BPLP s interest) are reflected as noncontrolling interests in property partnerships in the accompanying consolidated financial statements (See Note 9). 
 In addition, BXP s only significant asset is its investment in BPLP and, consequently, substantially all of BXP s assets and liabilities are the assets and liabilities of BPLP. 
 Variable Interest Entities Not Consolidated 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company does have any unconsolidated joint ventures that are classified as VIEs. 
 Fair Value Measurements

Table of Contents 

Because the Company s valuations of its financial instruments are based on the above Levels and involve the use of estimates, the actual fair values of its financial instruments may differ materially from those estimates. In addition, the Company s estimated fair values for these instruments as of the end of the applicable reporting period are not projections of, nor necessarily indicative of, estimated or actual fair values in future reporting periods. 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had outstanding three -month United States Treasury Bills with a maturity date of November 21, 2024 and January 30, 2024, respectively, that were classified as held to maturity because the Company determined that it had the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity. Because these securities are considered short-term investments, they are reflected at amortized cost within Cash and Cash Equivalents on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the amortized cost of these securities were approximately million and million, respectively. 
 At September 30, 2024, the Company had million outstanding under its unsecured commercial paper program (See Note 6). Due to their short-term maturity and stated interest rates at approximate current market rates, the fair value of outstanding commercial paper borrowings approximates the Company's carrying amount at September 30, 2024. 
 The Company s investment in non-real estate investments is shown within Prepaid and Other Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and was approximately million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The non-real estate investments utilize net asset value as the practical expedient.

The Company s obligation under the plans is that of an unsecured promise to pay the deferred compensation to the plan participants in the future. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had maintained approximately million and million, respectively, in separate accounts, which are not restricted as to their use.

 At March 31, 2024, the Company evaluated the expected hold period for a portion of its Shady Grove property, consisting of 2 Choke Cherry Road, 2094 Gaither Road and a land parcel, located in Rockville, Maryland. Based on a shorter-than-expected hold period, the Company reduced the carrying value of a portion of the property that the Company anticipates selling to a third-party developer to its estimated fair value at March 31, 2024.

The lease requires annual base rental payments of until the commencement of construction, as defined in the lease. If the Company commences construction of a project on the site on or before August 1, 2028, then a final fixed rental payment is due in accordance with the lease at that time.

In May 2024 and as of the date of this report, the lessor has not exercised this option and the Company reassessed the accounting for the ground lease and determined that the purchase option continues to be considered a bargain purchase option and the ground lease will continue to be accounted for as a finance lease. The lease requires monthly base rental payments of a nominal amount until the purchase occurs, which the Company now estimates will be in 2030. As a result of the reassessment, the lease liability was remeasured and reduced to approximately million.

BPLP has formally documented all of its relationships between hedge instruments and hedging items, as well as its risk-management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. While management believes its judgments are reasonable, a change in a derivative's effectiveness as a hedge could materially affect expenses, net income (loss) and equity. 
 Ineffective Hedging Instruments 
 During the year ended December 31, 2023, to satisfy a lender requirement, the Company entered into agreements with the same third-party to purchase and sell a million interest rate cap. The Company did not elect hedge accounting, and as such, any change in market value will be recognized in Gain (losses) from interest rate contracts in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized impact to its Consolidated Statement of Operations from entering into these agreements.

 Certain of the Company s joint venture agreements include provisions whereby, at certain specified times, each partner has the right to initiate a purchase or sale of its interest in the joint venture. From time to time, under certain of the Company s joint venture agreements, if certain return thresholds are achieved, either the Company or its partners may be entitled to receive an additional promoted interest or payments. 
 From time to time, the Company (or ventures in which the Company has an ownership interest) has agreed, and may in the future agree, to (1) guarantee portions of the principal, interest and other amounts in connection with their borrowings, (2) provide customary environmental indemnifications and nonrecourse carve-outs (e.g., guarantees against fraud, misrepresentation and bankruptcy) in connection with their borrowings and (3) provide guarantees to lenders, tenants and other third parties for the completion of development projects. The Company has agreements with its third-party joint venture partners whereby the partners agree to reimburse the joint venture for their share of any payments made under the guarantee. In some cases, the Company earns a fee from the applicable joint venture for providing the guarantee. 
 In connection with the refinancing of 767 Fifth Avenue s (the General Motors Building) secured loan by the Company s consolidated joint venture entity, 767 Venture, LLC, the Company guaranteed the consolidated entity s obligation to fund various reserves for tenant improvement costs and allowances, leasing commissions and free rent obligations in lieu of cash deposits. As of September 30, 2024, the maximum funding obligation under the guarantee was approximately million. The Company earns a fee from the joint venture for providing the guarantee and has an agreement with the outside partners to reimburse the joint venture for their share of any payments made under the guarantee. As of September 30, 2024, no amounts related to the guarantee were recorded as liabilities in the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
 In connection with the sale of Metropolitan Square, an approximately square foot office building in Washington, DC in which the Company had a equity interest, the Company agreed to become a co-lender of up to million under a mezzanine loan.

 million as an estimate of the fees it would owe the seller. In 2020, the seller filed suit against the Company in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, claiming that consideration significantly in excess of the initial reserve amount is owed under the agreement. The disagreement between the Company and the seller involves material issues of contract interpretation and, more importantly, the method of calculating fees, including various inputs (both facts and assumptions) that drive the calculations. In February 2024, the court granted the seller s motion for summary judgement interpreting certain sections of the agreement in favor of the seller s claims. The Company is disputing the seller s calculations and intends to continue defending itself vigorously. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will prevail in the lawsuit. If the court ultimately agrees with the seller s calculations, then amounts due to the seller could theoretically be as high as the additional million claimed in the seller s complaint, plus interest. Although the Company disputes those calculations, there can be no assurance that the Company s ultimate liability will not be significantly greater than its established accrual. 
 On April 26, 2024, Brammer Bio MA, LLC Brammer ), a subsidiary of Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. and an abutter to the Company s 290 Binney Street development project located in Cambridge, Massachusetts, filed a complaint in Superior Court in Suffolk County, Massachusetts against the Company relating to certain ongoing construction activities. 
 In the first quarter of 2023, the Company commenced development of 290 Binney Street, an approximately net rentable square foot laboratory/life sciences property that is pre-leased to AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals AstraZeneca ). The Company has a interest in the joint venture that owns 290 Binney Street. Brammer subleases the premises at 250 Binney Street, the Company s approximately net rentable square foot life sciences property that is adjacent to 290 Binney Street. 
 Brammer alleges that, as a result of the Company s construction of 290 Binney Street, it is threatened with irreparable harm due to intrusion onto the 250 Binney Street premises and the loss of its property rights. Brammer also alleges that the 290 Binney Street development project has caused and is causing major disruption to its manufacturing operations, and that it has suffered and will continue to suffer damages in the form of losses to its clients and customers. Brammer brought the action for quiet title, breach of contract, trespass and nuisance, and it is seeking declaratory and injunctive relief and specific performance purportedly to protect its property interests in the premises located at 250 Binney Street. 
 The Company believes it has meritorious defenses against Brammer s claims and intends to defend against them vigorously. However, there can be no assurance the Company will prevail in the litigation. If the Company is enjoined from further construction activities, it could suffer delays in construction that could result in its failure to deliver a completed building on the schedule contemplated by the Company s lease with AstraZeneca or at all, and this could result in owing financial penalties to AstraZeneca and other third parties. Although the Company is unable to estimate a range of loss for all related matters for which losses are reasonably possible, if the court grants injunctive relief or awards monetary damages to Brammer, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company s results of operations and financial condition. 
 On May 16, 2024, Brammer s motion for a preliminary injunction was denied by the trial court. Brammer subsequently appealed that decision, electing pursuant to Massachusetts civil procedure rules to petition for appeals to both a single justice of the Massachusetts Appeals Court and to a full appellate panel. On July 16, 2024, the single justice assigned to the appeal issued an order declining to rule on the substance of the appeal petition, which means that the appeal will be decided by the full panel. A date has not yet been set for the full panel hearing. 
 Insurance 
 The Company s property insurance program per occurrence limits are billion for its portfolio insurance program, including coverage for acts of terrorism other than nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological terrorism Terrorism Coverage ). The Company also carries billion of property insurance in excess of the billion of coverage in the Company s property insurance program for 601 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York, consisting

 million of property and Terrorism Coverage in excess of the Company s property insurance program and million of Terrorism Coverage only in excess of the billion of coverage. Certain properties, including the General Motors Building located at 767 Fifth Avenue in New York, New York 767 Fifth Avenue ), are currently insured in separate insurance programs. The property insurance program per occurrence limits for 767 Fifth Avenue are billion, including Terrorism Coverage. The Company also currently carries nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological terrorism insurance coverage for acts of terrorism certified under the Federal Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (as amended, TRIA ( NBCR Coverage ), which is provided by IXP as a direct insurer, for the properties in the Company s portfolio, including 767 Fifth Avenue, but excluding certain other properties owned in joint ventures with third parties or which the Company manages. The per occurrence limit for NBCR Coverage is billion. Under TRIA, after the payment of the required deductible and coinsurance, the NBCR Coverage provided by IXP is backstopped by the Federal Government if the aggregate industry insured losses resulting from a certified act of terrorism exceed a program trigger. The program trigger is million, the coinsurance is and the deductible is of the premiums earned by the insurer for the year prior to a claim. If the Federal Government pays out for a loss under TRIA, it is mandatory that the Federal Government recoup the full amount of the loss from insurers offering TRIA coverage after the payment of the loss pursuant to a formula in TRIA. The Company may elect to terminate the NBCR Coverage if the Federal Government seeks recoupment for losses paid under TRIA, if TRIA is not extended after its expiration on December 31, 2027, if there is a change in its portfolio or for any other reason. The Company intends to continue to monitor the scope, nature and cost of available terrorism insurance. 
 The Company also currently carries earthquake insurance on its properties located in areas known to be subject to earthquakes. Specifically, the Company currently carries earthquake insurance which covers its San Francisco and Los Angeles regions with a million per occurrence limit, and a million annual aggregate limit, million of which is provided by IXP, as a direct insurer. This insurance is subject to a deductible in the amount of of the value of the affected property. In addition, the Company currently carries earthquake insurance which covers its Seattle region with a million per occurrence limit, and a million annual aggregate limit. This insurance is subject to a deductible in the amount of of the value of the affected property. The amount of the Company s earthquake insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover losses from earthquakes. In addition, the amount of earthquake coverage could impact the Company s ability to finance properties subject to earthquake risk. The Company may discontinue earthquake insurance or change the structure of its earthquake insurance program on some or all of its properties in the future if the premiums exceed the Company s estimation of the value of the coverage. 
 IXP, a captive insurance company which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, acts as a direct insurer with respect to a portion of the Company s earthquake insurance coverage for its Greater San Francisco and Los Angeles properties and the Company s NBCR Coverage. Insofar as the Company owns IXP, it is responsible for its liquidity and capital resources, and the accounts of IXP are part of the Company s consolidated financial statements. In particular, if a loss occurs which is covered by the Company s NBCR Coverage but is less than the applicable program trigger under TRIA, IXP would be responsible for the full amount of the loss without any backstop by the Federal Government. IXP would also be responsible for any recoupment charges by the Federal Government in the event losses are paid out and its insurance policy is maintained after the payout by the Federal Government. If the Company experiences a loss and IXP is required to pay under its insurance policy, the Company would ultimately record the loss to the extent of the required payment. Therefore, insurance coverage provided by IXP should not be considered as the equivalent of third-party insurance, but rather as a modified form of self-insurance. In addition, BPLP has issued a guarantee to cover liabilities of IXP in the amount of million. 
 The Company continues to monitor the state of the insurance market in general, and the scope and costs of coverage for acts of terrorism, earthquakes, pandemics and cybersecurity incidents, in particular, but the Company cannot anticipate what coverage will be available on commercially reasonable terms in future policy years. There are other types of losses, such as from wars, for which the Company cannot obtain insurance at all or at a reasonable cost. With respect to such losses and losses from acts of terrorism, earthquakes, pandemics or other catastrophic events, if the Company experiences a loss that is uninsured or that exceeds policy limits, the Company could lose the capital invested in the damaged properties, as well as the anticipated future revenues from those properties. Depending on the specific circumstances of each affected property, it is possible that the Company could be liable for mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the property. Any such loss could materially and adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations.

 Noncontrolling Interests Property Partnerships 
 The noncontrolling interests in property partnerships consist of the outside equity interests in ventures that are consolidated with the financial results of the Company because the Company exercises control over the entities that own the properties. The equity interests in these ventures that are not owned by the Company, totaling approximately billion and billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, are included in Noncontrolling Interests Property Partnerships on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 On March 21, 2024, the Company completed the sale of a interest in 290 Binney Street in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The institutional investor funded approximately million in cash at closing, which is less than of the agreed upon carrying value of the property immediately prior to the transaction. The institutional investor will fund all construction costs until its equity balance is proportionate to its ownership percentage, after which the Company and the institutional investor will fund the development project based on their respective ownership interests. The Company retains a ownership interest in the joint venture. The transaction did not qualify as a sale of real estate for financial reporting purposes as the Company continues to effectively control the property and thus will continue to account for the property on a consolidated basis in its financial statements and no gain was recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company provides customary development, property management and leasing services to the joint venture. 
 The Company has accounted for the transaction as an equity transaction and as of March 21, 2024 has recognized noncontrolling interest in its Consolidated Balance Sheets totaling approximately million, which is equal to of the aggregate carrying value of the total equity of the property immediately prior to the transaction. The difference between the cash proceeds received and the noncontrolling interest recognized, which was approximately million, has been reflected as a decrease in additional paid-in capital in the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets. At the end of each reporting period, there will be a reallocation of the partners equity balances such that the ending balance in each partners capital account reflects each partners claim on net assets. These adjustments will impact additional paid-in capital and noncontrolling interest in property partnerships in the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets.

 Net operating income NOI is a non-GAAP financial measure equal to net income (loss) attributable to BXP, Inc. and net income (loss) attributable to Boston Properties Limited Partnership, as applicable, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, plus (1) net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests, interest expense, impairment loss, depreciation and amortization expense, transaction costs, payroll and related costs from management services contracts and corporate general and administrative expense less (2) unrealized gain (loss) on non-real estate investment, gains (losses) from investments in securities, interest and other income (loss), gains on sales of real estate, income (loss) from unconsolidated joint ventures, direct reimbursements of payroll and related costs from management services contracts and development and management services revenue. The Company believes NOI is useful to investors as a performance measure and believes it provides useful information to investors regarding its results of operations and financial condition because, when compared across periods, it reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs and acquisition and development activity on an unleveraged basis, providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income (loss) attributable to BXP, Inc. and net income (loss) attributable to Boston Properties Limited Partnership. For example, interest expense is not necessarily linked to the operating performance of a real estate asset and is often incurred at the corporate level as opposed to the property level. Similarly, interest expense may be incurred at the property level even though the financing proceeds may be used at the corporate level (e.g., used for other investment activity). In addition, depreciation and amortization expense, because of historical cost accounting and useful life estimates, may distort operating performance measures at the property level. NOI presented by the Company may not be comparable to NOI reported by other REITs or real estate companies that define NOI differently.

Earned awards will range from to a maximum of LTIP Units depending on BXP s performance under the three components, with a target of approximately LTIP Units. Under ASC 718 Compensation - Stock Compensation, the 2024 MYLTIP awards have an aggregate value of approximately million. 
 On February 1, 2024, the measurement period for the Company s 2021 MYLTIP awards ended and, based on BXP s absolute and relative TSR performance, the final payout was determined to be of target, or an aggregate of approximately million (after giving effect to employee separations). As a result, an aggregate of 2021 MYLTIP Units that had been previously granted were automatically forfeited. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, BXP issued shares of restricted common stock and BPLP issued LTIP Units and 2024 MYLTIP Units to employees and non-employee directors under the 2021 Plan. Employees and non-employee directors paid per share of restricted common stock and per LTIP Unit and 2024 MYLTIP Unit. When issued, LTIP Units are not economically equivalent in value to a share of Common Stock, but over time can increase in value to one-for-one parity with Common Stock if there is sufficient appreciation in the value of the Company s assets. The aggregate value of the LTIP Units is included in noncontrolling interests in the Consolidated Balance Sheets of BXP and BPLP. A substantial majority of the grants of restricted common stock and LTIP Units to employees vest in equal annual installments. Restricted common stock is measured at fair value on the date of grant based on the number of shares granted and the closing price of BXP s Common Stock on the date of grant as quoted on the New York Stock Exchange. Such value is recognized as an expense ratably over the corresponding employee service period. The shares of restricted common stock

 million. The LTIP Units granted were valued at approximately million using a Monte Carlo simulation method model. Because the 2012 OPP Units and 2013 - 2024 MYLTIP Units are subject to both a service condition and a market condition, the Company recognizes the related compensation expense under the graded vesting attribution method. Under the graded vesting attribution method, each portion of the award that vests at a different date is accounted for as a separate award and recognized over the period appropriate to that portion so that the compensation cost for each portion should be recognized in full by the time that portion vests. The Company recognizes forfeitures as they occur on its awards of stock-based compensation. Dividends paid on both vested and unvested shares of restricted stock are charged directly to Dividends in Excess of Earnings in BXP, Inc. s Consolidated Balance Sheets and Partners Capital in Boston Properties Limited Partnership s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Aggregate stock-based compensation expense associated with restricted stock, LTIP Units and MYLTIP Units was approximately million and million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. At September 30, 2024, there was (1) an aggregate of approximately million of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested restricted stock and LTIP Units and (2) an aggregate of approximately ) of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested 2022 - 2024 MYLTIP Units that is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately years.

 On October 8, 2024, the Company modified the mortgage loan collateralized by its Santa Monica Business Park properties located in Santa Monica, California. The mortgage loan had an outstanding principal balance of million, bore interest at a variable rate equal to Daily Simple SOFR + per annum and was scheduled to mature on July 19, 2025 (See Note 6). The modified loan is scheduled to mature on and continues to bear interest at a variable rate equal to Daily Simple SOFR + per annum until July 19, 2025. Beginning July 19, 2025, the mortgage loan will bear interest at Daily Simple SOFR + per annum through the maturity date. The entire principal is subject to interest rate swap contracts to fix Daily Simple SOFR at a weighted-average fixed interest rate of approximately per annum through April 1, 2025 (See Note 7). The mortgage loan requires monthly interest-only payments during the term of the loan, with the entire principal due at maturity. Santa Monica Business Park is an office park consisting of buildings totaling approximately million net rentable square feet. 
 On October 31, 2024, the Company completed and fully placed in-service 300 Binney Street, a laboratory/life sciences redevelopment project with approximately net rentable square feet located in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The property is fully leased to a life sciences tenant.

 Overview 
 BXP is one of the largest publicly traded office real estate investment trusts (REITs) (based on total market capitalization as of September 30, 2024) in the U.S. that develops, owns, and manages primarily premier workplaces. Our properties are concentrated in six dynamic gateway markets in the U.S. - Boston, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, DC. BPLP is the entity through which BXP conducts substantially all of its business and owns (either directly or through subsidiaries) substantially all of its assets. We generate revenue and cash primarily by leasing premier workplaces to our clients. When making leasing decisions, we consider, among other things, the creditworthiness of the client and the industry in which it conducts business, the length of the lease, the rental rate to be paid at inception and throughout the lease term, the amount of any security deposit or letter of credit posted by the client, the costs of tenant improvement allowances, free rent periods and other landlord concessions, anticipated operating expenses and real estate taxes, current and anticipated vacancy in our properties and the market overall (including sublease space), current and expected future demand for the space, the impact of other clients expansion rights and general economic factors. 
 We believe our key competitive advantages are our commitment to the office asset class and to our clients as many competitors disinvest in the sector, a strong balance sheet with access to capital in the secured and unsecured debt and private and public equity markets, and one of the highest quality portfolios of premier workplaces in the U.S. assembled over several decades of intentional development, acquisitions and dispositions.

 Today, clients and their advisors are more focused than ever on these attributes for their building owners, which distinguishes BXP among its competitors. 
 We consider premier workplaces to be well-located buildings that are modern structures or have been modernized to compete with newer buildings, are professionally managed and maintained, and offer a number and type of amenities that are in high demand by clients that are focused on the importance of the physical work environment in recruiting and retaining the best and brightest employees. As such, these properties attract creditworthy clients and command upper-tier rental rates in their markets. We do not consider the expression premier workplaces a classification of our properties in accordance with any standard listing criteria in the real estate industry. We therefore caution investors that our use and definition of premier workplaces may be different than the use and definition of similar expressions and traditional classifications that may be used by other companies. 
 Our core strategy has always been to develop, acquire and manage premier workplaces in gateway markets with high barriers-to-entry and attractive demand drivers, and to focus on executing long-term leases with financially strong clients that are diverse across market sectors. We believe this strategy provides a competitive advantage that helps BXP distinguish itself from competitors as our clients are interested in leasing space in vibrant, amenitized and accessible premier workplaces to encourage more in-person work. This interest has accelerated the flight to quality in the office industry. Over the past several years, BXP s experience and performance has diverged from the larger market and media sentiment, as premier workplaces have outperformed the broader office market consistently and substantially in both rental rates achieved and occupancy. We believe this divergence validates our strategy and differentiates BXP from other office companies. 
 Premier workplaces in our five traditional central business district CBD markets (Boston, New York, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, DC) have consistently outperformed the broader office market in those CBDs on several key metrics, including occupancy, net absorption levels, rental rates and landlord concessions. This outperformance is evident in BXP s portfolio where approximately 90 of our share of net operating income NOI comes from predominantly premier workplaces located in CBDs. As of September 30, 2024, these CBD assets are 90.1 occupied and 92.1 leased (including vacant space for which we have signed leases that have not yet commenced in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles GAAP )). For a detailed discussion of our share of NOI, including the reasons management believes the metric is useful to investors and a reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measure, see page 39 . 
 As of September 30, 2024, the weighted-average remaining lease term (1) for our in-place leases, based on square feet, including those signed by our unconsolidated joint ventures but excluding residential units, was approximately 7.6 years, and (2) for our 20 largest clients, based on square feet, was approximately 10.0 years. 
 Outlook 
 We believe the most important market forces driving occupancy, rental rates and earnings for BXP are interest rates, corporate earnings growth, return-to-office behaviors, and outperformance of premier workplaces, all of which are currently trending in BXP s favor, serving as tailwinds for BXP s performance. 
 In particular, corporate earnings growth is an important driver for BXP s performance given its correlation to leasing activity. After remaining flat for all of 2023, S P 500 earnings, which are viewed as a proxy for corporate health, are expected to grow 9.9 in 2024. Our experience tells us that companies with earnings growth are much more likely to invest, hire and expand their leased space, as demonstrated in BXP s growing leasing volumes this year. We do not currently see evidence of a looming recession in the decision-making of our clients. 
 Return-to-office behaviors continue to improve in the cities in which we operate. Several large companies have recently announced more stringent in-office work requirements for their employees, and 84 of the CEOs surveyed in a recent third-party study believe there will be a full return-to-office work at their companies within three years, up from 64 of those surveyed just one year ago. The reasons cited by the CEOs include concerns about diminished collaboration, innovation and productivity, inadequate supervision and training for younger employees, and the cost of maintaining vacant offices. 
 The evolving operating environment impacts various aspects of our operating activities as: 
 labor market conditions shift, which has gradually increased employer demand for mandatory in-person workdays; 
 52 

Table of Contents 

 volatility in the capital markets has led companies to be more reticent in their capital outlays and slowed down decision-making, including capital required for leasing new space; 
 private market debt financing, both for construction and existing assets, is significantly more challenging to arrange; and 
 construction costs have increased and, although much of the cost for our active development pipeline is fixed, the cost of potential future construction activity continues to increase. 
 In light of the uncertain trajectory of the U.S. and global economies, we continue to position BXP for success by ensuring ample liquidity, managing our leverage, pursuing additional capital raising opportunities and maintaining discipline in discretionary capital expenditures, while continuing to selectively invest (including through both acquisitions and developments) in premier workplace opportunities. We remain focused on: 
 continuing to embrace our leadership position in the premier workplace segment and leveraging our strength in portfolio quality, client relationships, development skills, market penetration and sustainability to profitably build market share; 
 leasing available space in our in-service and development properties, as well as proactively focusing on future lease expirations; 
 completing the construction and leasing of our development properties; 
 pursuing attractive asset class adjacencies where we have a track record of success, such as life sciences and residential development; 
 continuing to enhance the overall quality of our portfolio and actively recycling capital by selling assets, subject to market conditions, that we believe no longer fit within our portfolio strategy or could attract premium pricing in the current market; 
 actively managing our operations in a sustainable and responsible manner; and 
 prioritizing risk management by actively managing liquidity, investing more extensively with joint venture partners to manage our debt levels, and being highly selective in new investment commitments. 
 The following is an overview of leasing and investment activity in the third quarter of 2024 and recent business highlights. 
 Leasing Activity and Occupancy 
 To be successful in any leasing environment, we believe we must consider all aspects of the client-landlord relationship. In this regard, we believe that our competitive leasing advantage is based on the following attributes: 
 our understanding of our client s short- and long-term space utilization and amenity needs in the local markets; 
 our track record of developing and operating premier workplaces in a sustainable and responsible manner; 
 our reputation as a high-quality developer, owner and manager of premier workplaces in our markets; 
 our financial strength, including our ability to fund our share of lease obligations and maintain premier building standards; and 
 our relationships with local brokers. 
 Overall, the environments in which we operate are improving. Although all the markets in which we operate still need consistent incremental absorption to constitute a macro recovery, we have started to see pockets of strength where low availability is driving constructive client behavior. As clients choose premier workplaces in sound financial condition, with building owners that are committed for the long term to their properties operated by the best property management teams, we expect to continue to be successful in gaining market share. 
 In the third quarter of 2024, we executed 74 leases totaling more than 1.1 million square feet with a weighted-average lease term of approximately 7.2 years. We signed leases for a total of approximately 3.3 million square feet in the first three quarters of 2024, representing a 25 increase compared to the same period in 2023.

Table of Contents 

 BXP s CBD portfolio was 90.1 occupied and 92.1 leased (including vacant space for which we have signed leases that have not yet commenced in accordance with GAAP) at September 30, 2024. Approximately 90 of our share of NOI comes from assets located in our CBD portfolio, underscoring the strength of BXP s strategy to invest in the highest quality buildings in dynamic urban gateway markets. For a detailed discussion of our share of NOI, including the reasons management believes the metric is useful to investors and a reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measure, see page 39 . 
 The overall occupancy of our in-service office and retail properties was 87.0 at September 30, 2024, a decrease of 10 basis points from June 30, 2024. We define occupancy as space with signed leases for which revenue recognition has commenced in accordance with GAAP. Including vacant space for which we have signed leases that have not yet commenced revenue recognition in accordance with GAAP, our in-service office and retail properties were approximately 89.1 leased at September 30, 2024. 
 Investment Activity 
 We remain in active pursuit of opportunities in our core markets and asset types with primarily two types of counterparties: lenders to highly leveraged assets that require recapitalization and institutional owners seeking to diversify from the office asset class. To date, there has been limited market transaction activity for higher-quality office assets, though owners are increasingly testing the market to understand pricing. With lenders, there are fewer premier workplaces that are struggling with leverage, and in the few cases involving premier workplaces, lenders are generally electing to extend loans to borrowers who agree to invest modestly in their assets. Institutional owners are less interested in selling their higher quality assets, and there remains a material bid-ask spread given that, in most cases, assets have not been marked down to market-clearing levels. Notwithstanding these current challenges, we expect that transactions and our investment activity will increase in the coming quarters given the volume of maturing financings and continued mark downs in institutional portfolios. Our pipeline of potential opportunities is growing, including property and note acquisitions, sites with near term preleasing potential and new residential developments. No agreements are imminent, but we are encouraged by the activity. We also have interest from institutional investors in co-investing with us for select opportunities. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our development/redevelopment pipeline consisted of nine properties that, when completed, we expect will total approximately 2.7 million net rentable square feet. Our share of the estimated total cost for these projects is approximately 2.2 billion, of which approximately 1.1 billion remains to be invested. The commercial space in the pipeline, which excludes the residential projects, was 54 pre-leased as of October 31, 2024. 
 In the third quarter of 2024, we completed and fully placed in-service 180 CityPoint, an approximately 329,000 square foot laboratory/life sciences project located in Waltham, Massachusetts. BXP also partially placed in-service Skymark, a luxury residential property in Reston, Virginia that consists of 508 residential units across a five-story low-rise building and an iconic 39-story tower, which is one of the tallest buildings in Northern Virginia. The residential property is owned by a joint venture in which BXP has a 20 ownership interest. 
 As we continue to focus on new investments to drive future growth, we regularly review our portfolio to identify properties as potential sales candidates that either no longer fit within our portfolio strategy or could attract premium pricing in the current market. In addition, the BXP regional teams are pursuing alternative uses for some of our suburban land holdings, which includes vacant office buildings for which the highest and best use may not be office. 
 We are currently in active negotiations for the disposition of three land positions which, if successful, would generate approximately 70.0 million of proceeds in 2025. However, there can be no assurance that we will complete any of these transactions on the terms currently contemplated or at all. 
 A brief overview of each of our markets follows. 
 Boston 
 During the third quarter of 2024, we executed approximately 647,000 square feet of leases and approximately 421,000 square feet of leases commenced in the Boston region.

 At September 30, 2024 and 2023, we owned or had joint venture interests in a portfolio of 184 and 190 commercial real estate properties, respectively (in each case, the Total Property Portfolio ). As a result of changes within our Total Property Portfolio, the financial data presented below shows significant changes in revenue and expenses from period-to-period. Accordingly, we do not believe that our period-to-period financial data with respect to the Total Property Portfolio provides a complete understanding of our operating results. Therefore, the comparison of operating results for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 show separately the changes attributable to the properties that were owned by us and in-service throughout each period compared (the Same Property Portfolio and the changes attributable to the properties included in the Acquired, Placed In-Service, In or Held for Development or Redevelopment or Sold Portfolios. 
 In our analysis of operating results, particularly to make comparisons of NOI between periods more meaningful, it is important to provide information for properties that were in-service and owned by us throughout each period presented. We refer to properties acquired or placed in-service prior to the beginning of the earliest period presented and owned by us and in-service through the end of the latest period presented as our Same Property Portfolio. The Same Property Portfolio therefore excludes properties acquired, placed in-service or in or held for development or redevelopment after the beginning of the earliest period presented or disposed of prior to the end of the latest period presented.

 NOI is a non-GAAP financial measure equal to net income attributable to BXP, Inc. and net income attributable to Boston Properties Limited Partnership, as applicable, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, plus (1) net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, interest expense, impairment loss, depreciation and amortization expense, transaction costs, payroll and related costs from management services contracts and corporate general and administrative expense less (2) unrealized gain on non-real estate investment, gains from investments in securities, interest and other income (loss), gains on sales of real estate, income (loss) from unconsolidated joint ventures, direct reimbursements of payroll and related costs from management services contracts and development and management services revenue. We use NOI internally as a performance measure and believe it provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations and financial condition because, when compared across periods, it reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs and acquisition and development activity on an unleveraged basis, providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income attributable to BXP, Inc. and net income attributable to Boston Properties Limited Partnership. For example, interest expense is not necessarily linked to the operating performance of a real estate asset and is often incurred at the corporate level as opposed to the property level. Similarly, interest expense may be incurred at the property level even though the financing proceeds may be used at the corporate level (e.g., used for other investment activity). In addition, depreciation and amortization expense, because of historical cost accounting and useful life estimates, may distort operating performance measures at the property level. NOI presented by us may not be comparable to NOI reported by other REITs or real estate companies that define NOI differently. 
 We believe that in order to understand our operating results, NOI should be examined in conjunction with net income attributable to BXP, Inc. and net income attributable to Boston Properties Limited Partnership as presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements. NOI should not be considered as a substitute for net income attributable to BXP, Inc. or net income attributable to Boston Properties Limited Partnership (determined in accordance with GAAP) or any other GAAP financial measures and should only be considered together with and as a supplement to our financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. 
 Depreciation expense may differ between BXP and BPLP as a result of previously applied acquisition accounting by BXP for the issuance of common stock in connection with non-sponsor redemptions of common units of limited partnership interest of BPLP OP Units ). This accounting resulted in a step-up of the real estate assets at BXP that was allocated to certain properties. The difference between the real estate assets of BXP as compared to BPLP for certain properties having an allocation of the real estate step-up will result in a corresponding difference in depreciation expense when those properties are sold. For additional information see the Explanatory Note that immediately follows the cover page of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Comparison of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 
 The table below shows selected operating information for the Same Property Portfolio and the Total Property Portfolio. The Same Property Portfolio consists of 127 properties totaling approximately 40.3 million net rentable square feet, excluding unconsolidated joint ventures. The Same Property Portfolio includes properties acquired or placed in-service on or prior to January 1, 2023 and owned and in service through September 30, 2024. The Total Property Portfolio includes the effects of the other properties either acquired, placed in-service, in or held for development or redevelopment after January 1, 2023 or disposed of on or prior to September 30, 2024. This table includes a reconciliation from the Same Property Portfolio to the Total Property Portfolio by also providing information for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 with respect to the properties that were acquired, placed in-service, in or held for development or redevelopment or sold.

 Lease Revenue (Excluding Termination Income) 
 Lease revenue (excluding termination income) from the Same Property Portfolio decreased by approximately 24.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023.

 (4) Lexington Office Park, 1050 and 1100 Winter Street, 17 Hartwell Avenue, Kingstowne One and a portion of Shady Grove Innovation District are no longer considered in-service because each property s occupied percentage is less than 50 and we are no longer actively leasing the properties in anticipation of a future development/redevelopment. The properties will be considered held for development or redevelopment until the last client has vacated the property and the property is no longer revenue producing. This portion of Shady Grove Innovation District is comprised of three buildings, 2092 and 2098 Gaither Road and 15825 Shady Grove Road that were taken out of service between January 1, 2023 and September 30, 2024. 
 (5) 1100 Winter Street was taken out of service as of September 30, 2024. Rental revenue at 1100 Winter Street for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 includes approximately 6.4 million of termination income. 
 Residential Net Operating Income 
 Net operating income for our residential same properties increased by approximately 0.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023.

 (1) Average Monthly Rental Rate is calculated as the average of the quotients obtained by dividing (A) rental revenue as determined in accordance with GAAP, by (B) the number of occupied units for each month within the applicable fiscal period. 
 (2) Average Physical Occupancy is defined as (1) the average number of occupied units divided by (2) the total number of units, expressed as a percentage. 
 (3) Average Economic Occupancy is defined as (1) total possible revenue less vacancy loss divided by (2) total possible revenue, expressed as a percentage. Total possible revenue is determined by valuing average occupied units at contract rates and average vacant units at Market Rents. Vacancy loss is determined by valuing vacant units at current Market Rents. By measuring vacant units at their Market Rents, Average Economic Occupancy takes into account the fact that units of different sizes and locations within a residential property have different economic impacts on a residential property s total possible gross revenue. Market Rents used by us in calculating Economic Occupancy are based on the current market rates set by the managers of our residential properties based on their experience in renting their residential property s units and publicly available market data. Actual market rents and trends in such rents for a region as reported by others may vary materially from Market Rents used by us. Market Rents for a period are based on the average Market Rents during that period and do not reflect any impact for cash concessions.

 Other Operating Revenue and Expense Items 
 Development and Management Services Revenue 
 Development and management services revenue decreased by approximately 8.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023. Development services revenue and management services revenue decreased by approximately 4.6 million and 4.2 million, respectively. The decrease in development services revenue is primarily related to decreases in fees associated with tenant improvement projects in Boston and New York City and decreases in development income earned from unconsolidated joint ventures in the San Francisco region. The decrease in management services revenue primarily related to the elimination of property and asset management fees earned from an unconsolidated joint venture in the Los Angeles region in which we acquired the joint venture partner s interest in December 2023. 
 General and Administrative Expense 
 General and administrative expense decreased by approximately 3.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to decreases in compensation expense and other general and administrative expenses of approximately 3.2 million and 0.7 million, respectively. The decrease in compensation expense related to an approximately 5.7 million decrease in other compensation expenses, partially offset by an approximately 2.5 million increase in the value of our deferred compensation plan. 
 Wages directly related to the development of rental properties are capitalized and included in real estate assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and amortized over the useful lives of the applicable asset or lease term. Capitalized wages for each of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were approximately 13.2 million and 13.5 million, respectively. These costs are not included in the general and administrative expenses discussed above. 
 Transaction Costs 
 Transaction costs decreased by approximately 1.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023. In general, transaction costs relating to the formation of new joint ventures and the pursuit of other transactions are expensed as incurred. 
 Depreciation and Amortization Expense 
 Depreciation expense may differ between BXP and BPLP as a result of previously applied acquisition accounting by BXP for the issuance of common stock in connection with non-sponsor OP Unit redemptions by BPLP. This accounting resulted in a step-up of the real estate assets at BXP that was allocated to certain properties. The difference between the real estate assets of BXP as compared to BPLP for certain properties having an allocation of the real estate step-up will result in a corresponding difference in depreciation expense. For additional information see the Explanatory Note that immediately follows the cover page of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

 laboratory/life sciences project in Cambridge, Massachusetts. As a result, during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded approximately 0.8 million of accelerated depreciation expense for the demolition of the garage, of which approximately 0.2 million related to the step-up of real estate assets. 
 BPLP 
 Depreciation and amortization expense increased by approximately 42.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023, as detailed below.

 (1) During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Kendall Center Blue Parking Garage was taken out of service and demolished to support the development of 290 Binney Street, an approximately 573,000 net rentable square foot laboratory/life sciences project in Cambridge, Massachusetts. As a result, during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, BPLP recorded approximately 0.6 million of accelerated depreciation expense for the demolition of the garage. 
 Direct Reimbursements of Payroll and Related Costs From Management Services Contracts and Payroll and Related Costs From Management Service Contracts 
 We have determined that amounts reimbursed for payroll and related costs received from third parties in connection with management services contracts should be reflected on a gross basis instead of on a net basis as we have determined that we are the principal under these arrangements. We anticipate that these two financial statement line items will generally offset each other. 
 Other Income and Expense Items 
 Income (Loss) from Unconsolidated Joint Ventures 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023, income (loss) from unconsolidated joint ventures increased by approximately 268.2 million primarily due to the recognition of non-cash impairment charges related to our investments in 360 Park Avenue South, 200 Fifth Avenue, Platform 16, and Safeco Plaza aggregating approximately 272.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, partially offset by an approximately 35.8 million gain on investment related to our Metropolitan Square joint venture interest. Neither of these items recurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Gains on Sales of Real Estate 
 The 0.5 million gains on sale of real estate for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were related to the sale of real estate occurring in prior periods. 
 Gains on sales of real estate may differ between BXP and BPLP as a result of previously applied acquisition accounting by BXP for the issuance of common stock in connection with non-sponsor OP Unit redemptions by BPLP. This accounting resulted in a step-up of the real estate assets at BXP that was allocated to certain properties. The difference between the real estate assets of BXP as compared to BPLP for certain properties having an allocation of the real estate step-up will result in a corresponding difference in the gains on sales of real estate when those properties are sold. For additional information, see the Explanatory Note that immediately follows the cover page of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Interest and Other Income (Loss) 
 Interest and other income (loss) decreased by approximately 9.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023, due primarily to a decrease in our outstanding cash balances.

 Gains from Investments in Securities 
 Gains from investments in securities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 related to investments that we have made to reduce our market risk relating to deferred compensation plans that we maintain for BXP s officers and former non-employee directors. Under the deferred compensation plans, each officer or non-employee director who is eligible to participate is permitted to defer a portion of the officer s current income or the non-employee director s compensation on a pre-tax basis and receive a tax-deferred return on these deferrals based on the performance of specific investments selected by the officer or non-employee director. In order to reduce our market risk relating to these plans, we typically acquire, in a separate account that is not restricted as to its use, similar or identical investments as those selected by each officer or non-employee director. This enables us to generally match our liabilities to BXP s officers or former non-employee directors under our deferred compensation plans with equivalent assets and thereby limit our market risk. The performance of these investments is recorded as gains from investments in securities. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized gains of approximately 4.8 million and 2.3 million, respectively, on these investments. By comparison, our general and administrative expense decreased by approximately 4.8 million and 2.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, as a result of decreases in our liability under our deferred compensation plans that was associated with the performance of the specific investments selected by officers and former non-employee directors of BXP participating in the plans. 
 Unrealized Gain on Non-Real Estate Investment 
 We invest in non-real estate investments, which are primarily environmentally-focused investment funds. As a result, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized an unrealized gain of approximately 0.5 million and 0.3 million, respectively, due to the observable changes in the fair value of the investments. 
 Impairment Loss 
 At March 31, 2024, we evaluated the expected hold period for a portion of our Shady Grove property, located in Rockville, Maryland, consisting of 2 Choke Cherry Road, 2094 Gaither Road and a land parcel. Based on a shorter-than-expected hold period, we reduced the carrying value of a portion of the property that we anticipate selling to a third-party developer to its estimated fair value at March 31, 2024. As a result, each of BXP and BPLP recognized an impairment loss of approximately 13.6 million. Our estimated fair value was based on Level 3 inputs as defined in Accounting Standards Codification ASC 820 Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures and on a pending offer from a third party (See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).

 (2) On April 17, 2024, BPLP established an unsecured commercial paper program (See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). 
 Interest expense directly related to the development of rental properties is capitalized and included in real estate assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and amortized over the useful lives of the real estate or lease term. As portions of properties are placed in-service, we cease capitalizing interest on that portion and interest is then expensed. Interest capitalized for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was approximately 31.3 million and 30.8 million, respectively. These costs are not included in the interest expense referenced above. The decrease in capitalized interest is primarily attributable to a development project that had a finance lease and is now placed in service. 
 At September 30, 2024, our variable rate debt consisted of (1) BPLP s 2.0 billion 2021 Credit Facility, (2) BPLP s 700.0 million 2023 Unsecured Term Loan and (3) BPLP s 500.0 million unsecured commercial paper notes. As of September 30, 2024, the 2021 Credit Facility did not have a balance outstanding. In addition, we have the 100.0 million 2024 Unsecured Term Loan and 800.0 million of mortgage notes collateralized by Santa Monica Business Park and our 325 Main Street, 355 Main Street, 90 Broadway and Cambridge East Garage (also known as Kendall Center Green Garage) properties that bore interest at variable rates, which have all been hedged with interest rates swaps to fix SOFR for all or a portion of, the applicable debt term.

 Noncontrolling Interest Common Units of the Operating Partnership 
 For BXP, noncontrolling interest common units of the Operating Partnership increased by approximately 20.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023 due primarily to an increase in allocable income, which was primarily the result of recognizing a non-cash impairment charge related to our investment in unconsolidated joint ventures during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 that did not recur during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Due to our ownership structure, there is no corresponding line item on BPLP s financial statements.

 At September 30, 2024 and 2023, we owned or had joint venture interests in a portfolio of 184 and 190 commercial real estate properties, respectively (in each case, the Total Property Portfolio ). As a result of changes within our Total Property Portfolio, the financial data presented below shows significant changes in revenue and expenses from period-to-period. Accordingly, we do not believe that our period-to-period financial data with respect to the Total Property Portfolio provides a complete understanding of our operating results. Therefore, the comparison of operating results for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 show separately the changes attributable to the properties that were owned by us and in-service throughout each period compared (the Same Property Portfolio and the changes attributable to the properties included in the Acquired, Placed In-Service, In or Held for Development or Redevelopment or Sold Portfolios. 
 In our analysis of operating results, particularly to make comparisons of net operating income between periods more meaningful, it is important to provide information for properties that were in-service and owned by us throughout each period presented. We refer to properties acquired or placed in-service prior to the beginning of the earliest period presented and owned by us and in-service through the end of the latest period presented as our Same Property Portfolio. The Same Property Portfolio therefore excludes properties acquired, placed in-service or in or held for development or redevelopment after the beginning of the earliest period presented or disposed of prior to the end of the latest period presented.

 NOI is a non-GAAP financial measure equal to net income (loss) attributable to BXP, Inc. and net income (loss) attributable to Boston Properties Limited Partnership, as applicable, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, plus (1) net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests, interest expense, loss from unconsolidated joint ventures, depreciation and amortization expense, transaction costs, payroll and related costs from management services contracts and corporate general and administrative expense less (2) unrealized gain (loss) on non-real estate investment, gains (losses) from investments in securities, interest and other income (loss), gains on sales of real estate, direct reimbursements of payroll and related costs from management services contracts and development and management services revenue. We use NOI internally as a performance measure and believe it provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations and financial condition because, when compared across periods, it reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs and acquisition and development activity on an unleveraged basis, providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income (loss) attributable to BXP, Inc. and net income (loss) attributable to Boston Properties Limited Partnership. For example, interest expense is not necessarily linked to the operating performance of a real estate asset and is often incurred at the corporate level as opposed to the property level. Similarly, interest expense may be incurred at the property level even though the financing proceeds may be used at the corporate level (e.g., used for other investment activity). In addition, depreciation and amortization expense, because of historical cost accounting and useful life estimates, may distort operating performance measures at the property level. NOI presented by us may not be comparable to NOI reported by other REITs or real estate companies that define NOI differently. 
 We believe that in order to understand our operating results, NOI should be examined in conjunction with net income (loss) attributable to BXP, Inc. and net income (loss) attributable to Boston Properties Limited Partnership as presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements. NOI should not be considered as a substitute for net income (loss) attributable to BXP, Inc. or net income (loss) attributable to Boston Properties Limited Partnership (determined in accordance with GAAP) or any other GAAP financial measures and should only be considered together with and as a supplement to our financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. 
 Depreciation expense may differ between BXP and BPLP as a result of previously applied acquisition accounting by BXP for the issuance of common stock in connection with non-sponsor redemptions of common units of limited partnership interest of BPLP OP Units ). This accounting resulted in a step-up of the real estate assets at BXP that was allocated to certain properties. The difference between the real estate assets of BXP as compared to BPLP for certain properties having an allocation of the real estate step-up will result in a corresponding difference in depreciation expense when those properties are sold. For additional information see the Explanatory Note that follows the cover page of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Comparison of the three months ended September 30, 2024 to the three months ended September 30, 2023 
 The table below shows selected operating information for the Same Property Portfolio and the Total Property Portfolio. The Same Property Portfolio consists of 128 properties totaling approximately 40.8 million net rentable square feet, excluding unconsolidated joint ventures. The Same Property Portfolio includes properties acquired or placed in-service on or prior to July 1, 2023 and owned and in-service through September 30, 2024. The Total Property Portfolio includes the effects of the other properties either acquired, placed in-service, in or held for development or redevelopment after July 1, 2023 or disposed of on or prior to September 30, 2024. This table includes a reconciliation from the Same Property Portfolio to the Total Property Portfolio by also providing information for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 with respect to the properties that were acquired, placed in-service, in or held for development or redevelopment or sold. We did not sell any properties during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

 (1) Rental Revenue is equal to Revenue less Development and Management Services Revenue and Direct Reimbursements of Payroll and Related Costs from Management Services Revenue per the Consolidated Statements of Operations, excluding the residential and hotel revenue that is noted below. We use Rental Revenue internally as a performance measure and in calculating other non-GAAP financial measures (e.g., NOI), which provides investors with information regarding our performance that is not immediately apparent from the comparable non-GAAP measures and allows investors to compare operating performance between periods. 
 (2) For a detailed discussion of NOI, including the reasons management believes NOI is useful to investors, see page 73. Residential Net Operating Income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is comprised of Residential Revenue of 12,117 and 11,789 less Residential Expenses of 5,988 and 5,738, respectively. Hotel Net Operating Income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is comprised of Hotel Revenue of 15,082 and 13,484 less Hotel Expenses of 9,833 and 9,020, respectively, per the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

 Same Property Portfolio 
 Lease Revenue (Excluding Termination Income) 
 Lease revenue (excluding termination income) from the Same Property Portfolio decreased by approximately 7.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023. The decrease was a result of our average occupancy decreasing from 90.6 to 88.2 , resulting in a decrease of approximately 20.0 million, partially offset by our average revenue per square foot increasing by approximately 1.54, contributing approximately 12.4 million. 
 Termination Income 
 Termination income increased by approximately 3.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023. 
 Termination income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 related to eight clients across the Same Property Portfolio and totaled approximately 5.7 million, which was primarily related to a retail client that terminated its lease early in Boston. 
 Termination income for the three months ended September 30, 2023 related to 10 clients across the Same Property Portfolio and totaled approximately 2.6 million, which was primarily related to clients that terminated leases early in Seattle and Washington, DC. 
 Parking and Other Revenue 
 Parking and other revenue increased by approximately 1.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023. Parking and other revenue increased by approximately 0.1 million and 1.7 million, respectively. The increase in other revenue was primarily associated with the View Boston observatory. 
 Real Estate Operating Expenses 
 Real estate operating expenses from the Same Property Portfolio increased by approximately 15.3 million, or 5.3 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023, due primarily to increases in (1)utilities of approximately 4.3 million, or 13.9 , (2) repairs and maintenance of approximately 4.3 million, or 9.2 , and (3) other real estate operating expenses of approximately 4.1 million, or 1.9 . The increase in utilities related primarily to properties in our New York City region. The increase in repairs and maintenance related primarily to properties in our Boston region. In addition, there was an approximately 2.6 million increase related to the marketing and operating expenses associated with the View Boston observatory.

 (1) On November 30, 2023, we elected to suspend redevelopment. Although no longer in redevelopment, this property is not considered in-service as we are not actively leasing this property in anticipation of restarting redevelopment in the future. 
 (2) Lexington Office Park, 1050 and 1100 Winter Street, 17 Hartwell Avenue, Kingstowne One and a portion of Shady Grove Innovation District are no longer considered in-service because each property s occupied percentage is less than 50 and we are no longer actively leasing the property in anticipation of a future development/redevelopment. The properties will be considered held for development or redevelopment until the last client has vacated the property and the property is no longer revenue producing. This portion of Shady Grove Innovation District is comprised of three buildings, 2092 and 2098 Gaither Road and 15825 Shady Grove Road. 
 (3) 1100 Winter Street was taken out of service as of September 30, 2024. Rental revenue at 1100 Winter Street for the three months ended September 30, 2024 includes approximately 6.4 million of termination income. 
 Residential Net Operating Income 
 Net operating income for our residential same properties increased by approximately 78,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023. 
 The following reflects our occupancy and rate information for our residential same properties for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

 (1) Average Monthly Rental Rate is calculated as the average of the quotients obtained by dividing (A) rental revenue as determined in accordance with GAAP, by (B) the number of occupied units for each month within the applicable fiscal period. 
 (2) Average Physical Occupancy is defined as (1) the average number of occupied units divided by (2) the total number of units, expressed as a percentage. 
 (3) Average Economic Occupancy is defined as (1) total possible revenue less vacancy loss divided by (2) total possible revenue, expressed as a percentage. Total possible revenue is determined by valuing average occupied units at contract rates and average vacant units at Market Rents. Vacancy loss is determined by valuing vacant units at current Market Rents. By measuring vacant units at their Market Rents, Average Economic Occupancy takes into account the fact that units of different sizes and locations within a residential property have different economic impacts on a residential property s total possible gross revenue. Market Rents used by us in calculating Average Economic Occupancy are based on the current market rates set by the managers of our residential properties based on their experience in renting their residential property s units and publicly available market data. Actual market rents and trends in such rents for a region as reported by others may vary materially from Market Rents used by us. Market Rents for a period are based on the average Market Rents during that period and do not reflect any impact for cash concessions. 
 Hotel Net Operating Income 
 The Boston Marriott Cambridge hotel had net operating income of approximately 5.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, representing an increase of approximately 0.8 million compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023.

 Other Operating Revenue and Expense Items 
 Development and Management Services Revenue 
 Development and management services revenue decreased by approximately 2.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023. Development services revenue and management services revenue decreased by approximately 1.5 million and 1.0 million, respectively. The decrease in development services revenue was primarily related to a decrease in development income earned from unconsolidated joint ventures in the San Francisco and Washington D.C. regions. The decrease in management services revenue was primarily related to the elimination of property and asset management fees earned from an unconsolidated joint venture in the Los Angeles region which we acquired the joint venture partner s interest in December 2023. 
 General and Administrative Expense 
 General and administrative expense increased by approximately 1.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to an increase in compensation expense of approximately 2.6 million, partially offset by an approximately 0.7 million decrease in other general and administrative expenses. The increase in compensation expense related to an approximately 3.1 million increase in the value of our deferred compensation plan partially offset by an approximately 0.5 million decrease in other compensation expenses.

Table of Contents 

 Wages directly related to the development of rental properties are capitalized and included in real estate assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and amortized over the useful lives of the applicable asset or lease term. Capitalized wages for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were approximately 4.2 million and 4.4 million, respectively. These costs are not included in the general and administrative expenses discussed above. 
 Transaction Costs 
 Transaction costs decreased by approximately 0.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023. In general, transaction costs relating to the formation of new joint ventures and the pursuit of other transactions are expensed as incurred. 
 Depreciation and Amortization Expense 
 Depreciation expense may differ between BXP and BPLP as a result of previously applied acquisition accounting by BXP for the issuance of common stock in connection with non-sponsor OP Unit redemptions by BPLP. This accounting resulted in a step-up of the real estate assets at BXP that was allocated to certain properties. The difference between the real estate assets of BXP as compared to BPLP for certain properties having an allocation of the real estate step-up will result in a corresponding difference in depreciation expense. For additional information see the Explanatory Note that immediately follows the cover page of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

 Direct Reimbursements of Payroll and Related Costs From Management Services Contracts and Payroll and Related Costs From Management Service Contracts 
 We have determined that amounts reimbursed for payroll and related costs received from third parties in connection with management services contracts should be reflected on a gross basis instead of on a net basis as we have determined that we are the principal under these arrangements. We anticipate that these two financial statement line items will generally offset each other. 
 Other Income and Expense Items 
 Loss from Unconsolidated Joint Ventures 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023, loss from unconsolidated joint ventures decreased by approximately 240.5 million primarily due to the recognition of non-cash impairment charges related to our investments in 360 Park Avenue South, 200 Fifth Avenue, Platform 16, and Safeco Plaza aggregating approximately 272.6 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023, partially offset by an approximately 35.8 million gain on investment related to our Metropolitan Square joint venture interest. Neither of these items recurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Gains on Sales of Real Estate 
 The 0.5 million gains on sale of real estate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were related to the sale of real estate occurring in prior periods. 
 Gains on sales of real estate may differ between BXP and BPLP as a result of previously applied acquisition accounting by BXP for the issuance of common stock in connection with non-sponsor OP Unit redemptions by BPLP. This accounting resulted in a step-up of the real estate assets at BXP that was allocated to certain properties. The difference between the real estate assets of BXP as compared to BPLP for certain properties having an allocation of the real estate step-up will result in a corresponding difference in the gains on sales of real estate when those properties are sold. For additional information, see the Explanatory Note that immediately follows the cover page of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Interest and Other Income (Loss) 
 Interest and other income (loss) decreased by approximately 6.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023, due primarily to a decrease in our outstanding cash balances. 
 Gains (Losses) from Investments in Securities 
 Gain (losses) from investments in securities for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 related to investments that we have made to reduce our market risk relating to deferred compensation plans that we maintain for BXP s officers and former non-employee directors. Under the deferred compensation plans, each officer or non-employee director who is eligible to participate is permitted to defer a portion of the officer s current income or the non-employee director s compensation on a pre-tax basis and receive a tax-deferred return on these deferrals based on the performance of specific investments selected by the officer or non-employee director. In order to reduce our market risk relating to these plans, we typically acquire, in a separate account that is not restricted as to its use, similar or identical investments as those selected by each officer or non-employee director. This enables us to generally match our liabilities to BXP s officers or former non-employee directors under our deferred compensation plans with equivalent assets and thereby limit our market risk. The performance of these investments is recorded as gains (losses) from investments in securities. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized gains (losses) of approximately 2.2 million and (0.9) million, respectively, on these investments. By comparison, our general and administrative expense increased (decreased) by approximately 2.2 million and (0.9) million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, as a result of increases (decreases) in our liability under our deferred compensation plans that was associated with the performance of the specific investments selected by officers and former non-employee directors of BXP participating in the plans. 
 Unrealized Gain (Loss) on Non-Real Estate Investment 
 We invest in non-real estate investments, which are primarily environmentally-focused investment funds. As a result, during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized an unrealized gain (loss) of approximately 0.1 million and (0.1) million, respectively, due to the observable changes in the fair value of the investments.

 (2) On April 17, 2024, BPLP established an unsecured commercial paper program (See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). 
 Interest expense directly related to the development of rental properties is capitalized and included in real estate assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and amortized over the useful lives of the real estate or lease term. As portions of properties are placed in-service, we cease capitalizing interest on that portion and interest is then expensed. Interest capitalized for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was approximately 11.6 million and 9.7 million, respectively. These costs are not included in the interest expense referenced above. 
 At September 30, 2024, our variable rate debt consisted of (1) BPLP s 2.0 billion 2021 Credit Facility, (2) BPLP s 700.0 million 2023 Unsecured Term Loan and (3) BPLP s 500.0 million unsecured commercial paper notes. As of September 30, 2024, the 2021 Credit Facility did not have a balance outstanding. In addition, we have the 100.0 million 2024 Unsecured Term Loan and 800.0 million of mortgage notes collateralized by Santa Monica Business Park and our 325 Main Street, 355 Main Street, 90 Broadway and Cambridge East Garage (also known as Kendall Center Green Garage) properties that bore interest at variable rates, which have all been hedged with interest rates swaps to fix SOFR for all or a portion of, the applicable debt term.

 Noncontrolling Interest Common Units of the Operating Partnership 
 For BXP, noncontrolling interest common units of the Operating Partnership increased by approximately 22.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023 due primarily to an increase in allocable income, which was primarily the result of recognizing a non-cash impairment charge related our investment in unconsolidated joint ventures during the three months ended September 30, 2023 that did not recur during the three months ended September 30, 2024. Due to our ownership structure, there is no corresponding line item on BPLP s financial statements. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 General 
 Our principal liquidity needs for the next twelve months and beyond are to: 
 fund normal recurring expenses; 
 meet debt service and principal repayment obligations and balloon payments on maturing debt, including: 
 850.0 million of 3.200 unsecured senior notes due January 15, 2025, 
 700.0 million of principal outstanding on the 2023 Unsecured Term Loan due May 16, 2025, 
 100.0 million of principal outstanding on the 2024 Unsecured Term Loan due September 26, 2025, for which we have three, one-year extension options, subject to customary conditions, 
 203.6 million of mortgage debt secured by our 901 New York Avenue property due January 5, 2025, for which we have the right to extend the maturity date for a period of five years, subject to certain customary conditions, and 
 amounts that become due under BPLP s unsecured commercial paper program; 
 fund capital calls from our unconsolidated joint venture investments to fund capital improvements, leasing costs and debt principal; 
 fund development and redevelopment costs; 
 fund capital expenditures, including major renovations, tenant improvements and leasing costs; 
 81 

Table of Contents 

 fund possible acquisitions of properties, either directly or indirectly through the acquisition of equity interests; and 
 make the minimum distribution required to enable BXP to maintain its REIT qualification under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. 
 We expect to satisfy these needs using one or more of the following: 
 cash flow from operations; 
 distribution of cash flows from joint ventures; 
 cash and cash equivalent balances; 
 borrowings under BPLP s 2021 Credit Facility, unsecured term loans, short-term bridge facilities and construction loans; 
 long-term secured and unsecured indebtedness (including unsecured exchangeable indebtedness); 
 sales of real estate and interests in joint ventures owning real estate; 
 private equity sources, including institutional investors; and 
 issuances of BXP equity securities and/or preferred or common units of partnership interests in BPLP. 
 We draw on multiple financing sources to fund our long-term capital needs. We expect to fund our current development/redevelopment projects primarily with our available cash balances, funding from institutional private equity partners, construction loans, unsecured term loans, and proceeds from possible asset sales, BPLP s 2021 Credit Facility and BPLP's commercial paper program. We use BPLP s 2021 Credit Facility primarily as a bridge facility to fund acquisition opportunities, refinance outstanding indebtedness, fund short-term development costs and for working capital. We also use BPLP s 2021 Credit Facility to backstop BPLP s commercial paper program. Although we may seek to fund our development projects with construction loans, which may require guarantees by BPLP, the source of financing for each particular project ultimately depends on several factors, including, among others, the project s size and duration, whether the project is owned by a joint venture, the extent of pre-leasing, our available cash and access to cost effective capital at the given time.

 (11) On March 21, 2024, we completed the sale of a 45 interest in 290 Binney Street (See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The project budget reflects our 55 share of joint venture costs related to 290 Binney Street. We have the sole obligation to construct an underground electrical vault for an estimated gross cost of 183.9 million. We have entered into a contract to sell the electrical vault to a third party for a fixed price of 84.1 million upon completion. The net investment of 99.8 million will be included in our outside basis in 290 Binney Street. We have invested 58.9 million for the vault as of September 30, 2024.

 We seek to maximize income from our existing properties by maintaining quality standards for our properties that promote high occupancy rates and permit increases in rental rates while reducing client turnover and controlling operating expenses. Our sources of revenue also include third-party fees generated by our property management, leasing, development and construction businesses, interest earned on cash deposits and, from time to time, the sale of assets. We believe these sources of capital will continue to provide the funds necessary for our short-term liquidity needs. Material adverse changes in one or more sources of capital may adversely affect our net cash flows. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had nine properties under development or redevelopment. BXP s Share of the estimated total investment for these projects is approximately 2.2 billion, of which approximately 1.1 billion remains to be funded through 2029. 
 Since the second quarter of 2024, we further strengthened our balance sheet by sourcing additional liquidity. Notable transactions include: 
 On August 26, 2024, BPLP completed a public offering of 850.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 5.750 unsecured senior notes due 2035. The notes were priced at 99.961 of the principal amount to yield an effective rate (including financing fees) of approximately 5.842 per annum to maturity. The notes will mature on January 15, 2035, unless earlier redeemed. The aggregate net proceeds from the offering were approximately 841.9 million after deducting underwriting discounts and transaction expenses. We intend to use the net proceeds to repay the 850.0 million of 3.200 unsecured senior notes due January 15, 2025. 
 On September 27, 2024, BPLP entered into the 2024 Unsecured Term Loan that provides for a 100.0 million unsecured term loan facility with the Lender under the SMBP Loan. The 2024 Unsecured Term Loan bears interest at a variable rate, matures on September 26, 2025 and has three, one-year extension options, subject to customary conditions. The interest rate is subject to an existing interest rate swap to fix Daily Simple SOFR at a fixed interest rate of approximately 2.688 per annum for a period that ends on April 1, 2025 (See Notes 6 and 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Upon entry into the credit agreement, BPLP exercised its option to draw 100.0 million under the 2024 Unsecured Term Loan. The proceeds were used to repay the portion of the SMBP Loan held by the Lender. After the repayment, the SMBP Loan had a remaining principal balance of 200.0 million. 
 On October 8, 2024, we modified the SMBP Loan. The SMBP Loan had an outstanding principal balance of 200.0 million, bore interest at a variable rate equal to Daily Simple SOFR + 1.38 per annum and was scheduled to mature on July 19, 2025. The modified loan is scheduled to mature on October 8, 2028 and continues to bear interest at a variable rate equal to Daily Simple SOFR + 1.38 per annum until July 19, 2025. Beginning July 19, 2025, the mortgage loan will bear interest at Daily Simple SOFR + 1.60 per annum through the maturity date. The entire principal is subject to interest rate swap contracts to fix Daily Simple SOFR at a weighted-average fixed interest rate of approximately 2.675 per annum through April 1, 2025 (See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). 
 As of September 30, 2024, our share of unconsolidated joint venture debt maturing through November 2025 was approximately 588.7 million. The foregoing debt matures at different times through November 2025 and, to the extent not refinanced, we expect to fund the repayment of this debt using available cash balances, proceeds from asset sales, draws on BPLP s 2021 Credit Facility, proceeds from BPLP s unsecured commercial paper program, secured debt or unsecured debt, or both. We expect our interest expense will be flat or slightly less in 2025 compared to 2024 primarily due to expiring below market debt related to acquisitions in late 2023 and early 2024, lower average outstanding debt balances and the impact of anticipated lower short-term rates. 
 As of October 31, 2024, we had available cash of approximately 1.2 billion (of which approximately 121.2 million was attributable to our consolidated joint venture partners). Our liquidity and capital resources depend on a wide range of factors, and we believe that our access to capital and our strong liquidity, including the approximately 2.0 billion available under BPLP s 2021 Credit Facility, of which 500.0 million is being used to backstop the unsecured commercial paper program, and our available cash, as of October 31, 2024, are sufficient to fund our remaining capital needs on existing development and redevelopment projects, fund acquisitions, repay our maturing indebtedness when due (if not refinanced or extended), satisfy our REIT distribution requirements and still allow us to act opportunistically on attractive investment opportunities. We are currently in active negotiations for the disposition of three land positions which, if successful, would generate approximately 70.0 million of proceeds in 
 85 

Table of Contents 

 2025. However, there can be no assurance that we will complete any of these transactions on the terms currently contemplated or at all. 
 We may seek to enhance our liquidity to fund our current and future development activity, pursue additional attractive investment opportunities and refinance or repay indebtedness. Depending on then-current interest rates, the overall conditions in the public and private debt and equity markets, and our existing and expected leverage at the time, we may decide to access one or more of these capital sources. Doing so may result in greater cash and cash equivalents pending our use of the proceeds, and depending on the sources of liquidity, higher interest expense or share count. 
 We have not sold any shares under BXP s 600.0 million at the market equity offering program. 
 REIT Tax Distribution Considerations 
 Dividend 
 As a REIT, BXP is subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that BXP currently distribute at least 90 of its annual taxable income (excluding capital gains and with certain other adjustments). Our policy is for BXP to distribute at least 100 of its taxable income, including capital gains, to avoid paying federal tax. Common and LTIP unitholders (other than unearned MYLTIP units) of limited partnership interest in BPLP receive the same distribution per unit that is paid per share of BXP common stock. 
 BXP s Board of Directors will continue to evaluate BXP s dividend rate in light of our actual and projected taxable income (including gains on sales), liquidity requirements and other circumstances, and there can be no assurance that the future dividends declared by BXP s Board of Directors will not differ materially from the current quarterly dividend amount. 
 Sales 
 To the extent that we sell assets at a gain and cannot efficiently use the proceeds in a tax deferred manner for either our development activities or attractive acquisitions, BXP would, at the appropriate time, decide whether it is better to declare a special dividend, adopt a stock repurchase program, reduce indebtedness or retain the cash for future investment opportunities. Such a decision will depend on many factors including, among others, the timing, availability and terms of development and acquisition opportunities, our then-current and anticipated leverage, the cost and availability of capital from other sources, the price of BXP s common stock and REIT distribution requirements. At a minimum, we expect that BXP would distribute at least that amount of proceeds necessary for BXP to avoid paying corporate level tax on the applicable gains realized from any asset sales. 
 From time to time in select cases, whether due to a change in use, structuring issues to comply with applicable REIT regulations or other reasons, we may sell an asset that is held by a taxable REIT subsidiary TRS ). Such a sale by a TRS would be subject to federal and local taxes. 
 Cash Flow Summary 
 The following summary discussion of our cash flows is based on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and is not meant to be an all-inclusive discussion of the changes in our cash flows for the periods presented below. 
 Cash and cash equivalents and cash held in escrows aggregated approximately 1.5 billion and 0.9 billion at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, representing an increase of approximately 0.5 billion. The following table sets forth changes in cash flows: 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change (in thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities 850,755 914,372 (63,617) Net cash used in investing activities (850,787) (875,578) 24,791 Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities (141,051) 154,782 (295,833) 
 Our principal source of cash flow is related to the operation of our properties. The weighted-average term of our in-place leases, including leases signed by our unconsolidated joint ventures, excluding residential units, was approximately 7.6 years as of September 30, 2024, with occupancy rates historically in the range of 87 to 92 . 
 86 

Table of Contents 

 Generally, our properties generate a relatively consistent stream of cash flow that provides us with resources to pay operating expenses, debt service and fund regular quarterly dividend and distribution payment requirements. In addition, over the past several years, we have raised capital through the sale of some of our properties and through secured and unsecured borrowings. 
 Cash is used in investing activities to fund acquisitions, development, net investments in unconsolidated joint ventures and maintenance and repositioning capital expenditures. We selectively invest in new projects that enable us to take advantage of our development, leasing, financing and property management skills and invest in existing buildings to enhance or maintain our market position. Cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 is detailed below: 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 (in thousands) Construction in progress (1) (469,948) (361,625) Building and other capital improvements (118,411) (117,393) Tenant improvements (178,835) (244,841) Proceeds from sales of real estate 517 517 Acquisition of real estate (net of cash received upon consolidation) (2) 6,086 Capital contributions to unconsolidated joint ventures (3) (87,498) (148,875) Capital distributions from unconsolidated joint ventures (4) 7,350 Investment in non-real estate investments (1,500) (1,990) Issuance of note receivables (including related party) (5) (2,223) (10,500) Investments in securities, net 1,025 1,779 Net cash used in investing activities (850,787) (875,578) 
 Cash used in investing activities changed primarily due to the following: 
 (1) Construction in progress for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included ongoing expenditures associated with 760 Boylston Street and 180 CityPoint, which were fully placed in-service during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 103 CityPoint that was partially placed in-service during 2023 (See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). In addition, we incurred costs associated with our continued development/redevelopment of Reston Next Office Phase II that was partially placed in-service, 290 Binney Street, 300 Binney Street and 121 Broadway. 
 Construction in progress for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 included ongoing expenditures associated with 2100 Pennsylvania Avenue, 140 Kendrick Street Building A and the View Boston observatory at The Prudential Center, which were fully placed in-service during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 180 CityPoint that was partially placed in-service during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. In addition, we incurred costs associated with our continued development/redevelopment of 103 CityPoint, Reston Next Office Phase II, 760 Boylston Street, 105 Carnegie Center, 290 Binney Street and 300 Binney Street. 
 (2) On January 8, 2024, we completed the acquisition of our joint venture partner s 50 economic ownership interest in the joint venture that owns 901 New York Avenue, located in Washington, DC, for a gross purchase price of 10.0 million and we acquired net working capital, including cash and cash equivalents of approximately 16.1 million. 
 (3) Capital contributions to unconsolidated joint ventures for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted primarily of cash contributions of approximately 27.5 million, 25.2 million, 11.8 million and 11.5 million to our 360 Park Avenue South, Gateway Commons, Platform 16 and Dock 72 joint ventures, respectively. 
 Capital contributions to unconsolidated joint ventures for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 consisted primarily of cash contributions of approximately 46.8 million, 32.8 million, 17.5 million, 14.4 million and 9.5 million to our Gateway Commons, Platform 16, Worldgate Drive, Dock 72 and 751 Gateway joint ventures, respectively. On January 31, 2023, we entered into a new joint venture for 13100 and 13150 Worldgate Drive located in Herndon, Virginia. 
 87 

Table of Contents 

 (4) Capital distributions from unconsolidated joint ventures for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 consisted primarily of a cash distribution totaling approximately 7.4 million from our 360 Park Avenue South joint venture. 
 (5) On June 5, 2023, a joint venture in which we own a 30 interest repaid the existing construction loan collateralized by its 500 North Capitol Street, NW property and obtained new mortgage loans with related parties. At the time of the payoff, the outstanding balance of the loan totaled approximately 105.0 million and was scheduled to mature on June 6, 2023. The new mortgage loans have an aggregate principal balance of 105.0 million, bear interest at a weighted average fixed rate of 6.83 per annum and mature on June 5, 2026. Our portion of the mortgage loans, 10.5 million, has been reflected as a Related Party Note Receivable on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. 500 North Capitol Street, NW is an approximately 231,000 square foot premier workplace in Washington, DC. 
 Cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled approximately 141.1 million. This amount consisted primarily of the repayment of BPLP s 700 million in aggregate principal amount of its 3.800 unsecured senior notes due February 1, 2024 and payment of our regular dividends and distributions to our shareholders and unitholders and distributions to noncontrolling interests in property partnerships, partially offset by the issuance of BPLP s 850 million in aggregate principal amount of its 5.750 unsecured senior notes due 2035 and contributions from noncontrolling interests in property partnerships including approximately 97.2 million from the sale of a 45 interest in 290 Binney Street in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Future debt payments are discussed below under the heading Debt Financing .

 Consolidated Debt to Consolidated Market Capitalization Ratio is a measure of leverage commonly used by analysts in the REIT sector. We present this measure as a percentage and it is calculated by dividing (A) our consolidated debt by (B) our consolidated market capitalization, which is the market value of our outstanding equity securities plus our consolidated debt. Consolidated market capitalization is the sum of: 
 (1) our consolidated debt; plus 
 (2) the product of (x) the closing price per share of BXP common stock on September 30, 2024, as reported by the New York Stock Exchange, multiplied by (y) the sum of: 
 (i) the number of outstanding shares of common stock of BXP, 
 (ii) the number of outstanding OP Units in BPLP (excluding OP Units held by BXP), 
 (iii) the number of OP Units issuable upon conversion of all outstanding LTIP Units, assuming all conditions have been met for the conversion of the LTIP Units, and 
 (iv) the number of OP Units issuable upon conversion of 2012 OPP Units, and 2013 - 2021 MYLTIP Units that were issued in the form of LTIP Units. 
 The calculation of consolidated market capitalization does not include LTIP Units issued in the form of MYLTIP Awards unless and until certain performance thresholds are achieved and they are earned. Because their three-year performance periods have not yet ended, 2022 - 2024 MYLTIP Units are not included in this calculation as of September 30, 2024. 
 We also present BXP s Share of Market Capitalization and BXP s Share of Debt/BXP s Share of Market Capitalization, which are calculated in the same manner, except that BXP s Share of Debt is utilized instead of our consolidated debt in both the numerator and the denominator. BXP s Share of Debt is defined as our consolidated debt plus our share of debt from our unconsolidated joint ventures (calculated based upon our ownership percentage), minus our partners share of debt from our consolidated joint ventures (calculated based upon the partners percentage ownership interests adjusted for basis differentials). Management believes that BXP s Share of Debt provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition because it includes our share of debt from unconsolidated joint ventures and excludes our partners share of debt from consolidated joint ventures, in each case presented on the same basis. We have several significant joint ventures and presenting various measures of financial condition in this manner can help investors better understand our financial condition and/or results of operations after taking into account our economic interest in these joint ventures. We caution investors that the ownership percentages used in calculating BXP s Share of Debt may not completely and accurately depict all of the legal and economic implications of holding an interest in a consolidated or unconsolidated joint venture. For example, in addition to partners interests in profits and capital, venture agreements vary in the allocation of rights regarding decision making (both for routine and major decisions), distributions, transferability of interests, financing and guarantees, liquidations and other matters. Moreover, in some cases we exercise significant influence over, but do not control, the joint venture in which case GAAP requires that we account for the joint venture entity using the equity method of accounting and we do not consolidate it for financial reporting purposes. In other cases, GAAP requires that we consolidate the venture even though our partner(s) own(s) a significant percentage interest. As a result, management believes that the presentation of BXP s Share of a financial measure should not be considered a substitute for, and should only be considered with and as a supplement to our financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. 
 We present these supplemental ratios because our degree of leverage could affect our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, development or other general corporate purposes and because different investors and lenders consider one or both of these ratios. Investors should understand that these ratios are, in part, a function of the market price of the common stock of BXP and as such will fluctuate with changes in such price, and they do not necessarily reflect our capacity to incur additional debt to finance our activities or our ability to manage our existing debt obligations. However, for a company like BXP, whose assets are primarily income-producing real estate, these ratios may provide investors with an alternate indication of leverage, so long as they are evaluated along with the ratio of indebtedness to other measures of asset value used by financial analysts and other financial ratios, as well as the various components of our outstanding indebtedness.

 Unsecured Credit Facility 
 The 2021 Credit Facility provides for borrowings of up to 2.0 billion, as described below, through BPLP s revolving facility, subject to customary conditions. The 2021 Credit Facility matures on June 15, 2026 and includes a sustainability-linked pricing component. Under the 2021 Credit Facility, BPLP had the option to increase the original total commitment of 1.5 billion by up to an additional 500.0 million by increasing the amount of the revolving facility and/or by incurring one or more term loans, in each case, subject to syndication of the increase and other conditions (the Accordion Option ). On September 28, 2023, BPLP exercised a portion of the Accordion Option, which increased the then maximum borrowing amount under the 2021 Credit Facility from 1.5 billion to 1.815 billion. On April 29, 2024, BPLP exercised the remainder of the Accordion Option and further increased the maximum borrowing amount under the 2021 Credit Facility to 2.0 billion. All other terms of the 2021 Credit Facility remain unchanged. 
 At BPLP s option, loans under the 2021 Credit Facility will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to (1) (a) in the case of loans denominated in Dollars, Term SOFR and SOFR, (b) in the case of loans denominated in Euro, EURIBOR, (c) in the case of loans denominated in Canadian Dollars, Term CORRA, and (d) in the case of loans denominated in Sterling, SONIA, in each case, plus a margin ranging from 70.0 to 140.0 basis points based on BPLP s credit rating or (2) an alternate base rate equal to the greatest of (a) the Federal Funds rate plus 0.5 , (b) the administrative agent s prime rate, (c) Term SOFR plus 1.00 , and (d) 1.00 , in each case, plus a margin ranging from 0 to 40 basis points based on BPLP s credit rating. In addition, there is a SOFR credit spread adjustment of 0.10 . 
 Based on BPLP s September 30, 2024 credit rating, (1) the applicable Daily SOFR, Term SOFR, alternative currency daily rate, and alternative currency term rate margins are 0.850 , (2) the alternate base rate margin is zero basis points and (3) the facility fee is 0.20 per annum. 
 The 2021 Credit Facility is used as a backstop for BPLP s 500.0 million unsecured commercial paper program (See Unsecured Commercial Paper below). As such, BPLP intends to maintain, at a minimum, availability under the 2021 Credit Facility in an amount equal to the amount of unsecured commercial paper notes outstanding. 
 At September 30, 2024 and October 31, 2024, BPLP had no borrowings under its 2021 Credit Facility, outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately 6.1 million, and 500.0 million is being used as a backstop for the commercial paper program. Therefore, at September 30, 2024 and October 31, 2024, BPLP has the ability to borrow approximately 1.5 billion. 
 Unsecured Term Loans 
 The 2023 Unsecured Term Loan provided for a single borrowing of up to 1.2 billion. Upon entry into the credit agreement in January 2023, BPLP exercised its option to draw 1.2 billion under the 2023 Unsecured Term Loan. Under the credit agreement governing the 2023 Unsecured Term Loan, BPLP may, at any time prior to the maturity date, increase total commitments by up to an additional 300.0 million in aggregate principal amount by increasing the existing 2023 Unsecured Term Loan or incurring one or more additional term loans, in each case, subject to syndication of the increase and other conditions. On April 29, 2024, BPLP repaid 500.0 million of the outstanding balance under the 2023 Unsecured Term Loan from the proceeds of its unsecured commercial paper program (See Unsecured Commercial Paper below). The 2023 Unsecured Term Loan had an initial maturity date of May 16, 2024, with one 12-month extension option, subject to customary conditions. On May 16, 2024, BPLP exercised its option to extend the maturity date of the 2023 Unsecured Term Loan to May 16, 2025. All other terms of the 2023 Unsecured Term Loan remain unchanged. 
 At BPLP s option, loans under the 2023 Unsecured Term Loan will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to (1) a base rate equal to the greatest of (a) the Federal Funds rate plus 0.5 , (b) the administrative agent s prime rate, (c) Term SOFR for a one-month period plus 1.00 , and (d) 1.00 , in each case, plus a margin ranging from 0 to 60 basis points based on BPLP s credit rating; or (2) a rate equal to adjusted Term SOFR with a one-month period plus a margin ranging from 75 to 160 basis points based on BPLP s credit rating. 
 On September 27, 2024, BPLP entered into the 2024 Unsecured Term Loan with the Lender under the SMBP Loan. Upon entry into the credit agreement, BPLP exercised its option to draw 100.0 million under the 2024 Unsecured Term Loan. The proceeds were used to repay the portion of the SMBP Loan held by the Lender. After the repayment, the SMBP Loan had a remaining principal balance of 200.0 million (See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The 2024 Unsecured Term Loan matures on September 26, 2025 with three,

 one-year extension options, subject to customary conditions. 
 At BPLP s option, loans under the 2024 Unsecured Term Loan will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to (1) a base rate equal to the highest of (a) zero, (b) Prime Rate, (c) the Federal Funds effective rate plus 0.50 , and (d) Term SOFR for a one-month period plus 1.10 , in each case, plus a margin ranging from 0 to 60 basis points based on BPLP s credit rating; or (2) a rate equal to adjusted Term SOFR or Daily Simple SOFR with a one-month period plus a margin ranging from 75 to 160 basis points based on BPLP s credit rating. 
 Based on BPLP s September 30, 2024 credit rating, (1) the 2023 Unsecured Term Loan bears interest at a rate equal to Term SOFR plus 1.05 per annum and (2) the 2024 Unsecured Term Loan bears interest at a rate equal to Daily Simple SOFR plus1.05 per annum. The 2024 Unsecured Term Loan is subject to an existing interest rate swap to fix Daily Simple SOFR at a fixed rate of approximately 2.688 per annum for a period that ends on April 1, 2025 (See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). At September 30, 2024 and October 31, 2024, BPLP had 700.0 million and 100.0 million of principal outstanding under the 2023 Unsecured Term Loan and 2024 Unsecured Term Loan, respectively. 
 Unsecured Senior Notes 
 For a description of BPLP s outstanding unsecured senior notes as of September 30, 2024, See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 On February 1, 2024, BPLP repaid 700.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 3.800 senior notes due February 1, 2024. The repayment was completed with available cash and the 600.0 million proceeds from the mortgage loan entered into on October 26, 2023. The repayment price was approximately 713.3 million, which was equal to the stated principal plus approximately 13.3 million of accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the repayment date. Excluding the accrued and unpaid interest, the repayment price was equal to the principal amount being repaid. 
 On August 26, 2024, BPLP completed a public offering of 850.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 5.750 unsecured senior notes due 2035. The notes were priced at 99.961 of the principal amount to yield an effective rate (including financing fees) of approximately 5.842 per annum to maturity. The notes will mature on January 15, 2035, unless earlier redeemed. The aggregate net proceeds from the offering were approximately 841.9 million after deducting underwriting discounts and transaction expenses. 
 Unsecured Commercial Paper 
 On April 17, 2024, BPLP established an unsecured commercial paper program. Under the terms of the program, BPLP may issue, from time to time, unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any one time of 500.0 million with varying maturities of up to one year. Amounts available under the unsecured commercial paper program may be borrowed, repaid, and re-borrowed from time to time. The notes are sold in private placements and rank pari passu with all of BPLP s other unsecured senior indebtedness, including its outstanding senior notes. The unsecured commercial paper program is backstopped by available capacity under the 2021 Credit Facility. At September 30, 2024, BPLP had an aggregate of 500.0 million of unsecured commercial paper notes outstanding that bore interest at a weighted-average rate of approximately 5.22 per annum and had a weighted-average maturity of 34 days, from the issuance date. At October 31, 2024, BPLP had an aggregate of 500.0 million of commercial paper notes outstanding that bore interest at a weighted-average rate of approximately 5.03 per annum and had a weighted-average maturity of 29 days, from the issuance date. Proceeds from the unsecured commercial paper program were used to reduce BPLP s 2023 Unsecured Term Loan to 700.0 million. 
 Mortgage Notes Payable 
 On January 8, 2024, we acquired our joint venture partner s 50 economic ownership interest in the joint venture that owns 901 New York Avenue located in Washington, DC (See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The property is subject to existing mortgage indebtedness. At acquisition, the mortgage loan had an outstanding principal balance of approximately 207.1 million, bore interest at 3.61 per annum and was scheduled to mature on January 5, 2025. The mortgage loan was recorded at a fair value of approximately 198.7 million. On January 11, 2024, we modified the mortgage loan to provide for two extension options totaling five years of additional term, each subject to certain conditions. The first loan extension option provides for an additional term of four years at a fixed interest rate of 5.0 per annum.

 (1) The GAAP interest rate differs from the stated interest rate due to the inclusion of the amortization of financing charges, the effects of hedging transactions (if any) and adjustments required under Accounting Standards Codification 805 Business Combinations to reflect loans and swaps at their fair values (if any). 
 (2) Carrying amount includes an approximately 2.2 million fair value interest adjustment. The loan includes two extension options, subject to certain conditions. The first loan extension option provides for an additional term of four years at a fixed interest rate of 5.0 per annum. 
 (3) The mortgage loan requires interest only payments with a balloon payment due at maturity. 
 (4) The mortgage loan bears interest at a variable rate of Daily Simple SOFR plus 1.38 per annum (See Notes 6 and 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The borrower under the loan entered into interest rate swap contracts to fix Daily Simple SOFR at a weighted-average fixed interest rate of 2.675 for the period commencing on February 1, 2023 and ending on April 1, 2025. Stated interest rate reflects the weighted average fixed interest rate based on the interest rate swap contracts plus 1.38 per annum. Carrying amount includes an approximately 1.5 million fair value interest adjustment and excludes the adjustment required to reflect the interest rate swap at fair value upon acquisition of approximately 1.9 million. 
 (5) The mortgage loan bears interest at a variable rate of Daily Compounded SOFR plus 2.25 per annum. On December 7, 2023, BPLP entered into three interest rate swap contracts with notional amounts aggregating 600.0 million to fix Daily Compounded SOFR at a weighted-average fixed interest rate of 3.7925 for the period commencing on December 15, 2023 and ending on October 26, 2028. The stated interest rate reflects the weighted average fixed interest rate based on the interest rate swap contracts plus 2.25 per annum. 
 (6) This property is owned by a consolidated entity in which we have a 60 interest. The partners share of the carrying amount has been adjusted for basis differentials. 
 (7) In connection with the refinancing of the loan, we guaranteed the consolidated entity s obligation to fund various reserves for tenant improvement costs and allowances, leasing commissions and free rent obligations in lieu of cash deposits. As of September 30, 2024, the maximum funding obligation under the guarantee was approximately 6.4 million. We earn a fee from the joint venture for providing the guarantee and have an agreement with our partners to reimburse the joint venture for their share of any payments made under the guarantee (See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). 
 (8) This property is owned by a consolidated entity in which we have a 55 interest. 
 Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 900.0 million of interest rate swaps outstanding, where hedge accounting was elected, with a fair value of approximately (10.2) million. For a description of these interest rate swaps, see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

 Investment in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures - Secured Debt 
 We have investments in unconsolidated joint ventures with our effective ownership interests ranging from 20 to approximately 71 . Fourteen of these ventures have mortgage indebtedness. We exercise significant influence over, but do not control, these entities. As a result, we account for them using the equity method of accounting. See also Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. At September 30, 2024, the aggregate carrying amount of debt, including both our and our partners share, incurred by these ventures was approximately 3.2 billion (of which our proportionate share is approximately 1.4 billion). The table below summarizes the outstanding debt of these joint venture properties at September 30, 2024. In addition to other guarantees specifically noted in the table, we have agreed to customary environmental indemnifications and nonrecourse carve-outs (e.g., guarantees against fraud, misrepresentation and bankruptcy) as well as the completion of development projects on certain of the loans.

 State and Local Tax Matters 
 Because BXP is organized and qualifies as a REIT, it is generally not subject to federal income taxes, but is subject to certain state and local taxes. In the normal course of business, certain entities through which we own real estate either have undergone, or are currently undergoing, tax audits or other inquiries. Although we believe that we have substantial arguments in favor of our position in the ongoing audits, in some instances there is no controlling precedent or interpretive guidance on the specific point at issue. Collectively, tax deficiency notices received to date from the jurisdictions conducting the ongoing audits have not been material. However, there can be no assurance that future audits will not occur with increased frequency or that the ultimate result of such audits will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

 Funds from Operations 
 Pursuant to the revised definition of Funds from Operations adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts Nareit ), we calculate Funds from Operations, or FFO, for each of BXP and BPLP by adjusting net income (loss) attributable to BXP, Inc. and net income (loss) attributable to Boston Properties Limited Partnership (computed in accordance with GAAP), respectively, for gains (or losses) from sales of properties, including a change in control, impairment losses on depreciable real estate consolidated on our balance sheet, impairment losses on our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures driven by a measurable decrease in the fair value of depreciable real estate held by the unconsolidated joint ventures and our share of real estate-related depreciation and amortization. FFO is a non-GAAP financial measure. We believe the presentation of FFO, combined with the presentation of required GAAP financial measures, improves the understanding of operating results of REITs among the investing public and helps make comparisons of REIT operating results more meaningful. Management generally considers FFO to be a useful measure for understanding and comparing our operating results because, by excluding gains and losses related to sales or a change in control of previously depreciated operating real estate assets, impairment losses and real estate asset depreciation and amortization (which can differ across owners of similar assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates), FFO can help investors compare the operating performance of a company s real estate across reporting periods and to the operating performance of other companies. 
 Our computation of FFO may not be comparable to FFO reported by other REITs or real estate companies that do not define the term in accordance with the current Nareit definition or that interpret the current Nareit definition differently. We believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our operating results, FFO should be examined in conjunction with net income (loss) attributable to BXP, Inc. and net income (loss) attributable to Boston Properties Limited Partnership as presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements. FFO should not be considered as a substitute for net income (loss) attributable to BXP, Inc. or net income (loss) attributable to Boston Properties Limited Partnership (determined in accordance with GAAP) or any other GAAP financial measures and should only be considered together with and as a supplement to our financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.

 Material Cash Commitments 
 We have various service contracts with vendors related to our property management. In addition, we have certain other contracts we enter into in the ordinary course of business that may extend beyond one year. These contracts include terms that provide for cancellation with insignificant or no cancellation penalties. Contract terms are generally between three and five years. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we paid approximately 80.2 million to fund tenant-related obligations, including tenant improvements and leasing commissions. 
 In addition, during the three months ended September 30, 2024, we and our unconsolidated joint venture partners incurred approximately 120.8 million of new tenant-related obligations associated with approximately 1.1 million square feet of second generation leases, or approximately 111 per square foot. We signed approximately 15,400 square feet of first generation leases. The tenant-related obligations for the development properties are included within the projects Estimated Total Investment referred to in Item 2 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources. In aggregate during the third quarter of 2024, we signed leases for approximately 1.1 million square feet of space and incurred aggregate tenant-related obligations of approximately 121.9 million, or approximately 110 per square foot.

 ITEM 3 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. 
 We are exposed to certain market risks, one of the most predominant of which is a change in interest rates. Unless we have entered into interest rate swaps or other derivatives to fix the interest rate, increases in interest rates can result in increased interest expense under our 2021 Credit Facility, unsecured term loans, unsecured commercial paper, certain mortgage loans and other debt that bears interest at variable rates. Increases in interest rates can also result in increased interest expense when our fixed rate debt matures and needs to be refinanced. 
 As of September 30, 2024, approximately 14.1 billion of our indebtedness bore interest at fixed rates and therefore the fair value of these instruments is not affected by changes in the market interest rates. The remaining approximately 2.1 billion of outstanding indebtedness bore interest at variable rates, including approximately 800.0 million of unsecured term loans, 500.0 million of unsecured commercial paper borrowings and approximately 800.0 million of secured debt. However, we entered into interest rate swaps with notional amounts aggregating 800.0 million for our secured debt and 100.0 million for BPLP s 2024 Unsecured Term Loan, thus fixing the interest rates for all, or a portion of the applicable debt term (See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information pertaining to interest rate swap contracts in place as of September 30, 2024 and their respective fair values). Therefore, as of September 30, 2024, we have 1.2 billion of variable rate debt outstanding. 
 The following table presents our aggregate debt obligations carrying value, estimated fair value and where applicable, the corresponding weighted-average GAAP interest rates sorted by maturity date as of September 30, 2024. 
 The table below does not include our unconsolidated joint venture debt. For a discussion concerning our unconsolidated joint venture debt, including interest rate swaps, see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Item 2 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Investment in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures - Secured Debt.

 At September 30, 2024, the weighted-average stated interest rates on the fixed rate debt stated above was 3.80 per annum. At September 30, 2024, our outstanding variable rate debt totaled 2.1 billion, of which 900.0 million was subject to interest rate swaps. At September 30, 2024, the weighted-average stated interest rate on our variable rate debt, including the effect of the interest rate swaps, was 4.38 per annum. If market interest rates on our variable rate debt had been 100 basis points greater, total interest expense would have increased approximately 5.3 million and 15.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Our use of derivative instruments also involves certain additional risks such as counterparty credit risk, the enforceability of hedging contracts and the risk that unanticipated and significant changes in interest rates will cause a significant loss of basis in the contract. We believe that there is a low likelihood that these counterparties will fail to meet their obligations and we minimize our exposure by limiting counterparties to major banks who meet established credit and capital guidelines. There can be no assurance that we will adequately protect against the foregoing risks.

 The fair value amounts were determined solely by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our financial instruments. Due to the uncertainty of specific actions, we may undertake to minimize possible effects of market interest rate increases, this analysis assumes no changes in our financial structure.

 ITEM 1 Legal Proceedings. 
 We are subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. These matters are generally covered by insurance. Management believes that the final outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity. 
 
 ITEM 1A Risk Factors. 
 Except to the extent updated below or to the extent factual information disclosed elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q relates to such risk factors (including, without limitation, the matters discussed in Part I, Item 2 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ), there were no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 The use of technology based on artificial intelligence and machine learning presents risks and challenges that may adversely affect our business and results of operations. 
 We use artificial intelligence and machine learning technology (collectively, AI capabilities with the goal to enhance efficiencies in conducting our business. Our deployment and application of AI remains ongoing. While these AI tools hold promise in optimizing our work processes and driving efficiencies, they also present risks, challenges and unintended consequences that could adversely affect our business and results of operations or those of our clients. These include, but are not limited to: 
 the release, leak or disclosure of proprietary, confidential, sensitive or otherwise valuable information as a result of or in connection with our use of AI tools, 
 the incorporation of AI by our clients, vendors, contractors and other third-parties into their products or services, with or without our knowledge, in a manner that could give rise to issues pertaining to data privacy, information security and intellectual property considerations, and 
 the evolving legal regulations relating to AI, which may require significant resources to modify and maintain business practices to comply with applicable law or otherwise result in legal or regulatory action or create additional liabilities, the nature of which cannot be determined at this time. 
 While we aim to use AI responsibly and securely and attempt to mitigate ethical and legal issues presented by its use, we may ultimately be unsuccessful in identifying or resolving issues before they arise. There can be no assurance that we will properly implement AI, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.

If, in relation to the currency of any such member state, the basis of accrual of interest expressed in this Agreement in respect of that currency shall be inconsistent with any convention or practice in the interbank market for the basis of accrual of interest in respect of the Euro, such expressed basis shall be replaced by such convention or practice with effect from the date on which such member state adopts the Euro as its lawful currency provided that if any Loan in the currency of such member state is outstanding immediately prior to such date, such replacement shall take effect, with respect to such Loan, at the end of the then current Interest Period. 
 (b) Each provision of this Agreement shall be subject to such reasonable changes of construction as the Agent may from time to time specify to be appropriate to reflect the adoption of the Euro by any member state of the European Union and any relevant market conventions or practices relating to the Euro.

 52 

up to a maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding (after giving effect to all amounts requested) at any one time equal to such Bank s Revolving Credit Commitment provided that, after giving effect to any such borrowing, (i) the Outstanding Amount of all Revolving Credit Loans and Letter of Credit Obligations shall not at any time exceed the Total Revolving Credit Commitment and (ii) the Revolving Credit Exposure of any Bank shall not at any time exceed such Bank s Revolving Credit Commitment, and provided , further , that at the time the Borrower requests a Revolving Credit Loan and after giving effect to the making thereof (i) in the case of any borrowing, all of the conditions in 13 (and in the case of any initial borrowing or other extension of credit on the Closing Date, also the conditions in 12) have been met at the time of such request, and (ii) there has not occurred and is not continuing (or will not occur by reason thereof) any Default or Event of Default it being acknowledged and agreed that the Borrower shall be permitted to request and borrow Loans if a Non-Material Breach (rather than a Default or Event of Default) exists.

 53 

obligation of the Borrower hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to the Obligations.

 54 

(f) The Borrower agrees to pay to the Agent, for the accounts of the Revolving Credit Banks in accordance with their respective Commitment Percentages in respect of their Revolving Credit Commitments, a facility fee in Dollars (the Facility Fee calculated at the rate, expressed in basis points on the Total Revolving Credit Commitment, which shall vary from time to time in relationship to variances in the Debt Ratings as set forth in the following table

In the event the Debt Ratings from the Rating Agencies are not equivalent, the Facility Fee (bps) will be determined (i) based on the higher of the two Debt Ratings if the lower Debt Rating is no more than one level lower than the higher Debt Rating, and (ii) based on the level that is one rating level higher than the lower Debt Rating if the lower Debt Rating is more than one level lower than the higher Debt Rating. Adjustments in the Facility Fee (bps) based upon a change in a Debt Rating level shall be effective on the first day following the change in such Debt Rating.

Following receipt of such Conversion Request from the Borrower, the Agent shall promptly notify each Revolving Credit Bank or each Term Bank, as applicable, of such request by the Borrower. All or any part of the outstanding Revolving Credit Loans and Incremental Term Loans of any Type may be converted as provided herein, provided that each Conversion Request relating to the conversion of a Base Rate Loan or a Daily SOFR Loan to a Term SOFR Loan shall be for an amount equal to 2,000,000 or an integral multiple of 100,000 in excess thereof and shall be irrevocable by the Borrower. 
 (b) Any Term Rate Committed Loan may be continued as such upon the expiration of the Interest Period with respect thereto, subject to the proviso at the end of this 2.5(b) and 2.5(d), automatically as set forth in 2.5(c), or by compliance by the Borrower with the notice provisions contained in 2.5(a)(i) provided that no Term Rate Committed Loan denominated in Dollars may be continued as such when any Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing but shall be automatically converted to a Base Rate Loan on the last day of the first Interest Period relating thereto ending during the continuance of any Default or Event of Default and provided , further , that no Term Rate Committed Loan denominated in any Alternative Currency may be continued as such when any Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing without the consent of the Required Banks, and the Required Banks may demand that any or all of the then outstanding Term Rate Committed Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency be prepaid, or redenominated into Dollars and converted into Base Rate Loans in the amount of the Dollar Equivalent thereof, on the last day of the first Interest Period relating thereto ending during the continuance of any Default or Event of Default.

 (c) Subject to the provisions of 2.5(a), 2.5(b) and 2.5(d), in the event that the Borrower does not notify the Agent of its election hereunder with respect to any Term Rate Committed Loan, such Loan shall be automatically converted to (or continued as) a Term Rate Committed Loan in its original currency having a 1-month Interest Period, at the end of the applicable Interest Period. Subject to 5.1.1 and 5.4, no Committed Loan may be converted into or continued as a Committed Loan denominated in a different currency, but instead must be prepaid in the original currency of such Loan and reborrowed in the other currency.

Any Completed Loan Request (including any Conversion Request) for a Term Rate Committed Loan that would create greater than ten (10) Term Rate Committed Loans outstanding shall be deemed to be a Completed Loan Request or Conversion Request for a Daily SOFR Loan in Dollars in the Dollar Equivalent of the amount of such Loan. By way of explanation of the foregoing, in the event that the Borrower wishes to convert or continue two or more Loans into one Term Rate Committed Loan on the same day and for identical Interest Periods (or borrow an additional Revolving Credit Loan simultaneously with converting or continuing a Revolving Credit Loan for identical Interest Periods), such Term Rate Committed Loan shall constitute one single Term Rate Committed Loan for purposes of this clause (d). 
 (e) With respect to any of SOFR, Daily Simple SOFR, Term SOFR, any Alternative Currency Daily Rate, any Alternative Currency Term Rate, any Relevant Rate, the Canadian Benchmark, any Canadian Benchmark Replacement or any other Successor Rate, the Administrative Agent will have the right to make Conforming Changes or Canadian Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes, as applicable, from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any amendments implementing such Conforming Changes or Canadian Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes, as applicable, will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement or any other Loan Document provided that, with respect to any such amendment effected, the Administrative Agent shall post each such amendment implementing such Conforming Changes or Canadian Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes, as applicable, to the Borrower and the Banks reasonably promptly after such amendment becomes effective.

Immediately upon the issuance of each Letter of Credit, each Revolving Credit Bank shall be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from such Fronting Bank a risk participation in such Letter of Credit in an amount equal to the product of such Revolving Credit Bank s Commitment Percentage times the amount of such Letter of Credit. 
 70 

(c) Promptly after its delivery of any Letter of Credit or any amendment to a Letter of Credit to an advising bank with respect thereto or to the beneficiary thereof, such Fronting Bank will also deliver to the Borrower and the Agent a true and complete copy of such Letter of Credit or amendment. 
 3.1.3 Terms of Letters of Credit Limitation of Liability. Each Letter of Credit issued, extended or renewed hereunder shall, among other things, (i) provide for the payment of sight drafts for honor thereunder when presented in accordance with the terms thereof and when accompanied by the documents described therein, and (ii) have an expiry date no later than the earlier of (x) the date that is twelve months after the date of the issuance of such Letter of Credit (or, in the case of any extension of the expiration date thereof, whether automatic or by amendment, twelve months after the then current expiration date of such Letter of Credit) and (y) the Letter of Credit Expiration Date, subject in each case to the requirements of 5.11.1. Unless otherwise expressly agreed by a Fronting Bank and the Borrower when a Letter of Credit is issued (including any such agreement applicable to an Existing Letter of Credit), the rules of the ISP shall apply to each Letter of Credit (or the UCP if required, subject to the applicable Fronting Bank s approval). Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Fronting Bank shall be responsible to the Borrower for, and no Fronting Bank s rights and remedies against the Borrower shall be impaired by, any action or inaction of such Fronting Bank required or permitted under any law, order, or practice that is required or permitted to be applied to any Letter of Credit or this Agreement, including the Law or any order of a jurisdiction where such Fronting Bank or the beneficiary is located, the practice stated in the ISP or UCP, as applicable. or in the decisions, opinions, practice statements, or official commentary of the ICC Banking Commission, the Bankers Association for Finance and Trade - International Financial Services Association (BAFT-IFSA), or the Institute of International Banking Law & Practice, whether or not any Letter of Credit chooses such law or practice. As between the Borrower and any Fronting Bank, in the event of any conflict between the terms of this Agreement and the terms of any Issuer Document, the terms of this Agreement shall control. 
 3.1.4 Obligations of Revolving Credit Banks with respect to Letters of Credit. Each Revolving Credit Bank severally agrees that it shall be absolutely liable, without regard to (A) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Bank may have against any Fronting Bank, the Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever, (B) the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default, or (C) any other occurrence, event or condition, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, to the extent of such Revolving Credit Bank s Commitment Percentage, to reimburse each Fronting Bank on demand pursuant to 3.3 for the amount of each draft paid by such Fronting Bank under each Letter of Credit issued by such Fronting Bank to the extent that such amount is not reimbursed by the Borrower pursuant to 3.2. No such reimbursement shall relieve or otherwise impair the obligation of the Borrower to reimburse any Fronting Bank for the amount of any payment made by such Fronting Bank under any Letter of Credit, together with interest as provided herein, subject to the terms of 3.2 and 3.3. 
 3.1.5 Fronting Banks . 
 (a) Notwithstanding the definition of Fronting Bank but subject to the provisos to the first sentence of 3.1.2(a), in the event that the Borrower reasonably determines that it would be beneficial to have a Letter of Credit issued by a Revolving Credit Bank with a higher 
 71 

rating than each of the then existing Fronting Banks has at any applicable time of reference (as determined by Moody s or S&P), or if any Fronting Bank is not able or willing to issue a Letter of Credit in an Alternative Currency, or for any other reason acceptable to the Agent, the Borrower shall have the right to elect any Revolving Credit Bank having a higher rating than each of the then existing Fronting Banks, or able and willing to issue a Letter of Credit in such Alternative Currency, or such other applicable Revolving Credit Bank, as the Fronting Bank for that particular Letter of Credit, provided that no Bank other than BOA and JPChase shall be required to be a Fronting Bank 
 (b) intentionally deleted and 
 (c) In the event that any Bank other than BOA or JPChase issues any Letter of Credit pursuant to this 3.1.5, such Bank shall be entitled to the various benefits of a Fronting Bank under this Agreement as issuer of such Letter of Credit, and each other Bank shall have the obligations set forth herein to such issuing Bank with respect to such Letter of Credit. 
 3.2 Reimbursement Obligation of the Borrower. In order to induce the Fronting Banks to issue, extend, increase and renew Letters of Credit and the Revolving Credit Banks to participate therein, the Borrower hereby agrees, except as contemplated in 3.3, to reimburse or pay to the Agent, for the account of the applicable Fronting Bank or (as the case may be) the Revolving Credit Banks, with respect to each Letter of Credit issued, extended or renewed by such Fronting Bank hereunder, 
 (a) except as otherwise expressly provided in 3.2(b) and (c) or 3.3, promptly upon notification by a Fronting Bank or the Agent that any draft presented under such Letter of Credit is honored by such Fronting Bank, or such Fronting Bank otherwise makes a payment with respect thereto, (i) the amount paid by such Fronting Bank under or with respect to such Letter of Credit, and (ii) any amounts payable pursuant to 5.6 under, or with respect to, such Letter of Credit, 
 (b) upon the reduction (but not termination) of the Total Revolving Credit Commitment to an amount less than the then Outstanding Amount of all Letter of Credit Obligations, an amount equal to such difference, which amount shall be held by the Agent in an interest-bearing account (with interest to be added to such account) as Cash Collateral for the benefit of the Revolving Credit Banks and the Agent for all Reimbursement Obligations, and 
 (c) upon the termination of the Total Revolving Credit Commitment, or the acceleration of the Reimbursement Obligations with respect to all Letters of Credit in accordance with 14, an amount equal to the then Outstanding Amount of all Letter of Credit Obligations, which amount shall be held by the Agent in an interest-bearing account (with interest to be added to such account) as Cash Collateral for the benefit of the Revolving Credit Banks and the Agent for all Reimbursement Obligations. 
 Each such payment shall be made to the Agent for the benefit of the Revolving Credit Banks at the Agent s Funding Office for the applicable currency in Same Day Funds. In the case of a Letter of Credit denominated in an Alternative Currency, the Borrower shall reimburse the applicable Fronting Bank in such Alternative Currency, unless (A) such Fronting Bank (at its 
 72 

option) shall have specified in such notice that it will require reimbursement in Dollars, or (B) in the absence of any such requirement for reimbursement in Dollars, the Borrower shall have notified such Fronting Bank promptly following receipt of the notice of drawing that the Borrower will reimburse such Fronting Bank in Dollars. In the case of any such reimbursement in Dollars of a drawing under a Letter of Credit denominated in an Alternative Currency, the applicable Fronting Bank shall notify the Borrower of the Dollar Equivalent of the amount of the drawing promptly following the determination thereof. In the event that (A) a drawing denominated in an Alternative Currency is to be reimbursed in Dollars pursuant to the second sentence in this 3.2 and (B) the Dollar amount paid by the Borrower shall not be adequate on the date of that payment to purchase in accordance with normal banking procedures a sum denominated in the Alternative Currency equal to the drawing, the Borrower agrees, as a separate and independent obligation, to indemnify such Fronting Bank for the loss resulting from its inability on that date to purchase the Alternative Currency in the full amount of the drawing. Interest on any and all amounts not converted to a Revolving Credit Loan pursuant to 3.3 and remaining unpaid by the Borrower under this 3.2 at any time from the date such amounts become due and payable (whether as stated in this 3.2, by acceleration or otherwise) until payment in full (whether before or after judgment) shall be payable to the Agent for the benefit of the Revolving Credit Banks on demand at the rate specified in 5.10 for overdue principal on the Loans. 
 3.3 Letter of Credit Payments Funding of a Loan. 
 (a) If any draft shall be presented or other demand for payment shall be made under any Letter of Credit, the applicable Fronting Bank will use its best efforts to notify the Borrower and the Agent (who will use its best efforts to promptly notify each of the Revolving Credit Banks), on or before the date such Fronting Bank intends to honor such drawing, of the date and amount of the draft presented or demand for payment and of the date and time when it expects to pay such draft or honor such demand for payment and, except to the extent the amount of such draft becomes a Revolving Credit Loan as set forth in this 3.3, the Borrower shall reimburse the Agent, as set forth in 3.2. Notwithstanding anything contained in 3.2 or this 3.3 to the contrary, however, unless the Borrower shall have notified the Agent and the applicable Fronting Bank prior to 11 00 a.m. on the Business Day immediately prior to the date of such drawing that the Borrower intends to reimburse such Fronting Bank for the amount of such drawing with funds other than the proceeds of Revolving Credit Loans, subject to satisfaction of the conditions set forth in 2.4 and 13 (other than delivery to the Agent of a Completed Loan Request), the Borrower shall be deemed to have timely given a Completed Loan Request pursuant to 2.4 to the Agent, requesting a Base Rate Loan on the date on which such drawing is honored and in an amount equal to the amount of such drawing (or in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent of such drawing in the case of a Letter of Credit denominated in an Alternative Currency), without regard to the minimum and multiples specified in 2.4(i) for the principal amount of Revolving Credit Loans. The Borrower may thereafter convert any such Base Rate Loan to a Revolving Credit Loan of another Type in accordance with 2.5. Each Fronting Bank is irrevocably authorized by the Borrower and each of the Revolving Credit Banks to honor draws on each Letter of Credit issued by it by the beneficiary thereof in accordance with the terms of such Letter of Credit. Each Revolving Credit Bank, the Agent and the Borrower agree that, in paying any drawing under a Letter of Credit, no Fronting Bank shall have any responsibility to obtain any document (other than any sight draft, certificates and documents expressly required by the Letter of Credit) or to ascertain or inquire as to the validity or accuracy of any such document 
 73 

or the authority of the Person executing or delivering any such document. In furtherance of the foregoing and the provisions of 3.4, and without limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to documents presented which appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, the applicable Fronting Bank may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit. 
 (b) With respect to any payment under any Letter of Credit that is not fully refinanced by a Base Rate Loan because the conditions set forth in 13 cannot be satisfied or for any other reason, the Borrower shall be deemed to have incurred from the Fronting Bank that issued such Letter of Credit a Reimbursement Obligation in the amount that is not so refinanced, which Reimbursement Obligation shall be due and payable on demand (together with interest) and shall bear interest at the Default Rate from and after the date that is five (5) Business Days after the date of such demand. In such event, each Revolving Credit Bank s payment to the Agent for the account of the applicable Fronting Bank pursuant to 3.3(c) shall be deemed payment in respect of its participation in such Reimbursement Obligation and shall constitute an advance from such Bank in satisfaction of its participation obligation pursuant to 3.1.4 (a Letter of Credit Participation provided , however , that, in all cases subject to 5.12.1(d), in respect of any payment under a Letter of Credit, the maximum amount that any Revolving Credit Bank shall be required to fund, whether as a Base Rate Loan pursuant to 3.3(a) or as a participation in a Reimbursement Obligation pursuant to this 3.3(b), shall not exceed such Revolving Credit Bank s Commitment Percentage of such payment. 
 (c) If the Borrower is deemed to have requested a Revolving Credit Loan pursuant to 3.3(a) or has incurred a Reimbursement Obligation pursuant to 3.3(b), the Agent shall promptly notify each Revolving Credit Bank of the amount of the unreimbursed drawing (expressed in Dollars in the amount of the Dollar Equivalent thereof in the case of a Letter of Credit denominated in an Alternative Currency) and the amount of such Revolving Credit Bank s Commitment Percentage thereof. Each Revolving Credit Bank shall, upon receipt of any such notice and in accordance with 2.6, make available on the Business Day specified in such notice by the Agent, in Dollars, such Revolving Credit Bank s Commitment Percentage of such unreimbursed drawing at the Agent s Funding Office for Dollar denominated payments (and the Agent may apply Cash Collateral provided for this purpose), the proceeds of which shall be applied directly by the Agent to reimburse the applicable Fronting Bank in Dollars for such amount. Until each Revolving Credit Bank funds its Commitment Percentage pursuant to this 3.3(c) to reimburse such Fronting Bank for any amount drawn under any Letter of Credit, interest in respect of such Revolving Credit Bank s Commitment Percentage of such amount shall be solely for the account of such Fronting Bank. 
 (d) If any Revolving Credit Bank fails to make available to the Agent for the account of a Fronting Bank any amount required to be paid by such Bank pursuant to 3.3(c), then, without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement, such Fronting Bank shall be entitled to recover from such Bank (acting through the Agent), on demand, such amount with interest thereon for the period from the date such payment is required to the date on which such payment is immediately available to such Fronting Bank at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Overnight Rate from time to time in effect, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees 
 74 

customarily charged by such Fronting Bank in connection with the foregoing. If such Revolving Credit Bank pays such amount (with interest and fees as aforesaid), the amount so paid shall constitute such Revolving Credit Bank s Commitment Percentage included in the relevant Revolving Credit Loan or Reimbursement Obligation, as the case may be. A certificate of such Fronting Bank submitted to any Revolving Credit Bank (through the Agent) with respect to any amounts owing under this clause (d) shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 
 (e) At any time after a Fronting Bank has made a payment under any Letter of Credit and has received from any Revolving Credit Bank such Bank s Commitment Percentage of any Reimbursement Obligation in respect of such payment in accordance with 3.3(c), if the Agent receives for the account of such Fronting Bank any payment in respect of the related Reimbursement Obligation or interest thereon (whether directly from the Borrower or otherwise, including proceeds of Cash Collateral applied thereto by the Agent), the Agent will distribute to such Revolving Credit Bank its Commitment Percentage thereof in Dollars and in the same funds as those received by the Agent. If any payment received by the Agent for the account of a Fronting Bank pursuant to this 3.3(e) is required to be returned under any of the circumstances described in 18 (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by such Fronting Bank in its discretion), each Revolving Credit Bank shall pay to the Agent for the account of such Fronting Bank its Commitment Percentage thereof on demand of the Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such amount is returned by such Revolving Credit Bank, at a rate per annum equal to the applicable Overnight Rate from time to time in effect. The obligations of the Revolving Credit Banks under this clause shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of this Agreement. 
 3.4 Obligations Absolute. The Borrower s obligations under this 3 shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable under any and all circumstances and irrespective of the account party in whose name a Letter of Credit is issued pursuant to a Letter of Credit Application executed by the Borrower, the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default or any condition precedent whatsoever, any setoff, counterclaim or defense to payment or other right which the Borrower may have or have had against the Agent, any Revolving Credit Bank or any beneficiary or any transferee of a Letter of Credit (or any Person for whom any such beneficiary or any such transferee may be acting) or any other Person, the waiver by any Fronting Bank of any requirement that exists for such Fronting Bank s protection and not the protection of the Borrower or any waiver by any Fronting Bank which does not in fact materially prejudice the Borrower, honor of a demand for payment presented electronically even if such Letter of Credit required that demand be in the form of a draft, or any adverse change in the relevant exchange rates or in the availability of the relevant Alternative Currency to the Borrower or in the relevant currency markets generally. The Borrower further agrees with the Agent, the Fronting Banks and the Revolving Credit Banks that the Agent, the Fronting Banks and the Revolving Credit Banks shall not be liable or responsible for, and the Borrower s Reimbursement Obligations under 3.2 shall not be affected by, among other things, the validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit, this Agreement, or any other Loan Document, or any term or provision herein or therein, the validity or genuineness of any draft, demand, certificate or other document or of any endorsements thereon presented under any Letter of Credit (so long as such draft, demand, certificate or other document delivered under such Letter of Credit in connection with such presentment shall be in the form required by, and in substantial compliance with, such Letter of Credit), even if such draft, demand, 
 75 

certificate or other document (or any statement therein) should in fact prove to be in any or all respects invalid, fraudulent, forged, insufficient, untrue or inaccurate, any dispute between or among the Borrower, the beneficiary of any Letter of Credit or any financing institution or other party to whom any Letter of Credit may be transferred, or any claims or defenses whatsoever of the Borrower against the beneficiary of any Letter of Credit or any such transferee (or any Person for whom any such beneficiary or any such transferee may be acting), any payment made by any Fronting Bank in respect of an otherwise complying item presented after the date specified as the expiration date of, or the date by which documents must be received under, a Letter of Credit if presentation after such date is authorized by the UCC, the ISP or the UCP, as applicable. 
 The Borrower shall promptly examine a copy of each Letter of Credit and each amendment thereto that is delivered to it and, in the event of any claim of noncompliance with the Borrower s instructions or other irregularity, the Borrower will immediately notify the applicable Fronting Bank. The Borrower shall be conclusively deemed to have waived any such claim against each Fronting Bank and its correspondents unless such notice is given as aforesaid. 
 The Agent, the Fronting Banks, the Banks and their Related Parties shall not be liable or responsible for any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission, dispatch or delivery of any message, advice or document, however transmitted, in connection with any Letter of Credit or required to make a drawing under any Letter of Credit, any error in interpretation of technical terms, any error in translation or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the applicable Fronting Bank, any payment by a Fronting Bank under a Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft, certificate or other document that does not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit, or any payment made by a Fronting Bank under a Letter of Credit to any Person purporting to be a trustee in bankruptcy, debtor-in-possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors, liquidator, receiver or other representative of or successor to any beneficiary or any transferee of such Letter of Credit, including any arising in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Laws, or any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, including any other circumstance that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, or provide a right of setoff against, the Borrower or any Subsidiary. 
 The Borrower agrees that any action taken or omitted by the Agent, any Fronting Bank or any Bank under or in connection with each Letter of Credit and the related drafts, demands, certificates or other documents, absent gross negligence or willful misconduct (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment), shall be binding upon the Borrower, shall not result in any liability on the part of the Agent, any Fronting Bank or any Bank to the Borrower, and that 
 (i) a Fronting Bank may replace a purportedly lost, stolen, or destroyed original Letter of Credit or missing amendment thereto with a certified true copy marked as such or waive a requirement for its presentation 
 (ii) a Fronting Bank may accept documents that appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, and may make payment upon presentation of documents that appear 
 76 

on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit and without regard to any non-documentary condition in such Letter of Credit 
 (iii) a Fronting Bank shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to decline to accept such documents and to make such payment if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit and 
 (iv) this sentence shall establish the standard of care to be exercised by a Fronting Bank when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof (and the parties hereto hereby waive, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, any standard of care inconsistent with the foregoing). 
 Without limiting the foregoing, none of the Agent, the Banks, any Fronting Bank, or any of their Related Parties shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of (i) any presentation that includes forged or fraudulent documents or that is otherwise affected by the fraudulent, bad faith, or illegal conduct of the beneficiary or other Person, (ii) a Fronting Bank declining to take-up documents and make payment (A) against documents that are fraudulent, forged, or for other reasons by which that it is entitled not to honor or (B) following the Borrower s waiver of discrepancies with respect to such documents or request for honor of such documents or (iii) a Fronting Bank retaining proceeds of a Letter of Credit based on an apparently applicable attachment order, blocking regulation, or third-party claim notified to such Fronting Bank. 
 3.5 Reliance by Issuer. Each Fronting Bank shall act on behalf of the Revolving Credit Banks with respect to any Letters of Credit issued by it and the documents associated therewith, and each Fronting Bank shall have all of the benefits and immunities (A) provided to the Agent in 16 with respect to any acts taken or omissions suffered by such Fronting Bank in connection with Letters of Credit issued by it or proposed to be issued by it and Issuer Documents pertaining to such Letters of Credit as fully as if the term Agent as used in 16 included the Fronting Banks with respect to such acts or omissions, and (B) as additionally provided herein with respect to each Fronting Bank. To the extent not inconsistent with 3.4, the Agent and any Fronting Bank shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying upon, any Letter of Credit, draft, writing, resolution, notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, cablegram, telegram, telecopy, telex or teletype message, statement, order or other document believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person or Persons and upon advice and statements of legal counsel, independent accountants and other experts selected by the Agent. The Agent and any Fronting Bank shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this 3 (other than the issuance of a Letter of Credit pursuant to a Letter of Credit Application and otherwise in accordance with the terms of this Agreement) unless it shall first have received such advice or concurrence of the Required Revolving Credit Banks (or such other number or percentage of the Banks as may be required by this Agreement) as it reasonably deems appropriate or it shall first be indemnified to its reasonable satisfaction by the Revolving Credit Banks against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. The Agent and any Fronting Bank shall in all cases be fully protected by the Revolving Credit Banks in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this 3 in accordance with a request of the Required Revolving Credit Banks (or such other number or percentage of the Banks as may be required by this Agreement), and such request and any action 
 77 

taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding upon the Banks and all future holders of the Notes or of a participation in any Letter of Credit Obligations.

The Agent will promptly distribute to each Bank its applicable Commitment Percentage (or other applicable share as provided herein) of such payment in like funds as received by wire transfer to such Bank s Lending Office. All payments received by the Agent (i) after 2 00 p.m., in the case of payments in Dollars, or (ii) after the Applicable Time specified by the Agent in the case of payments in an Alternative Currency, shall in each case be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue. If any payment to be made by the Borrower shall come due on a day other than a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next following Business Day, and such extension of time shall be reflected in computing interest or fees, as the case may be. 
 (b) All payments by the Borrower hereunder and under any of the other Loan Documents shall be made without setoff or counterclaim and free and clear of and without deduction for any taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions, withholdings, compulsory liens, restrictions or conditions of any nature except as set forth in 5.2. 
 5.1.2 Funding by Banks Presumption by Agent. Unless the Agent shall have received notice from a Bank prior to the proposed Drawdown Date of any Committed Loan that such Bank will not make available to the Agent the amount of such Bank s applicable Commitment Percentage of the Committed Loan to be made on such Drawdown Date, the Agent may assume that such Bank has made such share available on such date in accordance with 2.6 
 80 

and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Bank has not in fact made its share of the applicable Committed Loan available to the Agent, then the applicable Bank and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount in Same Day Funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Agent, at (A) in the case of a payment to be made by such Bank, the Overnight Rate, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Agent in connection with the foregoing, and (B) in the case of a payment to be made by the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to Base Rate Loans. If the Borrower and such Bank shall pay such interest to the Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Agent shall promptly remit to the Borrower the amount of such interest paid by the Borrower for such period. If such Bank pays its share of the applicable Committed Loan to the Agent (with interest and fees as aforesaid), then the amount so paid shall constitute such Bank s Committed Loan included in such borrowing. Any payment by the Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrower may have against a Bank that shall have failed to make such payment to the Agent. 
 5.1.3 Payments by Borrower Presumptions by Agent. Unless the Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Agent for the account of the Banks or any Fronting Bank hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the applicable Banks or the applicable Fronting Bank, as the case may be, the amount due. 
 With respect to any payment that the Agent makes for the account of the applicable Banks or any Fronting Bank hereunder as to which the Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that any of the following applies (such payment referred to as the Rescindable Amount (1) the Borrower has not in fact made such payment (2) the Agent has made a payment in excess of the amount so paid by the Borrower (whether or not then owed) or (3) the Agent has for any reason otherwise erroneously made such payment then each of the applicable Banks or the applicable Fronting Bank(s), as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Agent forthwith on demand the Rescindable Amount so distributed to such Bank or such Fronting Bank, in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation. 
 A notice of the Agent to any Bank, Fronting Bank or the Borrower with respect to any amount owing under this 5.1.3 shall be conclusive, absent manifest error. 
 5.1.4 Failure to Satisfy Conditions Precedent. If any Bank makes available to the Agent funds for any Loan to be made by such Bank as provided in 2 and 3 above, and such funds are not made available to the Borrower by the Agent because the conditions applicable to advance of funds for such Loan set forth in 12 and 13 are not satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof, the Agent shall return such funds (in like funds as received from such Bank) to such Bank, without interest. 
 81 

5.1.5 Obligations of Banks Several. The obligations of the Banks hereunder to make Revolving Credit Loans, Incremental Term Loans, to fund participations in Letters of Credit and to make payments pursuant to 17(c) are several and not joint. The failure of any Bank to make any Loan, to fund any such participation or to make any payment under 17(c) on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Bank of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Bank shall be responsible for the failure of any other Bank to so make its Loan, to purchase its participation or to make its payment under 17(c). 
 5.1.6 Funding Source. Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Bank to obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner or to constitute a representation by any Bank that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner. 
 5.1.7 Sharing of Payments by Banks. If any Bank shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of the Loans made by it, or the participations in Letters of Credit held by it resulting in such Bank s receiving payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of such Loans or participations and accrued interest thereon greater than its pro rata share thereof as provided herein, then the Bank receiving such greater proportion shall (a) notify the Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans and subparticipations in the Letter of Credit Obligations of the other Banks, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Banks ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans and other amounts owing them, provided that 
 (a) if any such participations or subparticipations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations or subparticipations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest and 
 (b) the provisions of this Section shall not be construed to apply to (x) any payment made by or on behalf of the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement (including the application of funds arising from the existence of a Delinquent Bank), (y) the application of Cash Collateral provided for in 5.11.3, or (z) any payment obtained by a Bank as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or subparticipations in Letter of Credit Obligations to any assignee or participant, other than an assignment to the Borrower or any Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this Section shall apply). 
 The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Bank acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Bank were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation. 
 5.2 Taxes. For purposes of this 5.2, the term applicable Law includes FATCA.

(a) Payments Free of Taxes Obligation to Withhold Payments on Account of Taxes. 
 (i) Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower under any Loan Document shall be made without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by applicable Laws. If any applicable Laws (as determined in the good faith discretion of the Agent or the Borrower) require the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment by the Agent or the Borrower, then the Agent or the Borrower shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding, upon the basis of the information and documentation to be delivered pursuant to subsection (e) of this 5.2 below. 
 (ii) If the Borrower or the Agent shall be required by the Code to withhold or deduct any Taxes, including both United States Federal backup withholding and withholding taxes, from any payment, then (A) the Agent shall withhold or make such deductions as are determined by the Agent to be required based upon the information and documentation it has received pursuant to subsection (e) of this 5.2 below, (B) the Agent shall timely pay the full amount withheld or deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with the Code, and (C) to the extent that the withholding or deduction is made on account of Indemnified Taxes, the sum payable by the Borrower shall be increased as necessary so that after any required withholding or the making of all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this 5.2) the applicable Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such withholding or deduction been made. 
 (iii) If the Borrower or the Agent shall be required by any applicable Laws other than the Code to withhold or deduct any Taxes from any payment, then (A) the Borrower or the Agent, as required by such Laws, shall withhold or make such deductions as are determined by it to be required based upon the information and documentation it has received pursuant to subsection (e) of this 5.2 below, (B) the Borrower or the Agent, to the extent required by such laws, shall, if applicable, timely pay the full amount withheld or deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with such Laws, and (C) to the extent that the withholding or deduction is made on account of Indemnified Taxes, the sum payable by the Borrower shall be increased as necessary so that after any required withholding or the making of all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this 5.2) the applicable Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it 
 83 

would have received had no such withholding or deduction been made. 
 (iv) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (i) through (iii) above, (x) the Borrower shall not be required to increase any such amounts payable to any Recipient with respect to any Indemnified Taxes (1) that are attributable to such Person s failure to comply with the requirements of 5, or (2) that are United States withholding taxes imposed on amounts payable to such Person that are Excluded Taxes and (y) the Borrower shall not be required to compensate any Recipient pursuant to this Section for any additional sums payable under this Section, including Indemnified Taxes, incurred more than 180 days prior to the date that such Recipient notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law or other event giving rise to such additional sums and of such Recipient s or the intention to claim compensation therefor. 
 (b) Payment of Other Taxes by the Borrower . Without limiting the provisions of subsection (a) above (but without duplication of amounts payable pursuant to subsection (a) above), the Borrower shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable laws, or at the option of the Agent timely reimburse it for the payment of, any Other Taxes. 
 (c) Tax Indemnifications .

A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Bank or a Fronting Bank (with a copy to the Agent), or by the Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Bank or a Fronting Bank, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall, and does hereby, indemnify the Agent, and shall make payment in respect thereof within 10 days after demand therefor, for any amount which a Bank or a Fronting Bank for any reason fails to pay indefeasibly to the Agent as required pursuant to 5.2(c)(ii).

 84 

pocket expenses incurred by such Recipient and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such amounts). If the Borrower determines in its good faith judgment that a reasonable basis exists for contesting any Indemnified Taxes, the applicable Recipient shall reasonably cooperate with the Borrower in challenging such Indemnified Taxes, and such Recipient shall assign its right to any claim for a refund of such Indemnified Taxes to the Borrower so long as it has determined in its discretion that such assignment would not be adverse to it provided that such Recipient shall not be required to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person and provided further that nothing in this sentence shall require the Agent or such Recipient not to withhold and pay over to the applicable Governmental Authority any Taxes subject to such challenge. 
 (ii) Each Bank and each Fronting Bank shall, and does hereby, severally indemnify, and shall make payment in respect thereof within 10 days after demand therefor, (x) the Agent against any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Bank or such Fronting Bank (but only to the extent that the Borrower has not already indemnified the Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so), (y) the Agent and the Borrower, as applicable, against any Taxes attributable to such Bank s failure to comply with the provisions of 20.5(b) relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (z) the Agent and the Borrower, as applicable, against any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Bank or such Fronting Bank, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Agent or the Borrower in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Bank by the Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Bank and each Fronting Bank hereby authorizes the Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Bank or such Fronting Bank, as the case may be, under this Agreement or any other Loan Document against any amount due to the Agent under this clause (ii).

 85 

(e) Status of Banks Tax Documentation 
 (i) Each Bank that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower and the Agent, at the time or times prescribed by applicable Law or when reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable Law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Bank, if reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable Law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Agent to determine whether or not such Bank is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation either (x) set forth in 5.2(e)(ii)(A), (ii)(B) and (ii)(D) or (y) required by applicable Law other than the Code or the taxing authorities of the jurisdiction pursuant to such applicable Law to comply with the requirements for exemption or reduction of withholding tax in that jurisdiction) shall not be required if in any Bank s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Bank to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Bank.

 (A) any Bank that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the Agent on or prior to the date on which such Bank becomes a Bank under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Agent), executed copies of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Bank is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax

 (D) if a payment made to a Bank under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Bank were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Bank shall deliver to the Borrower and the Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Bank has complied with such Bank s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this clause (D), FATCA shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement. 
 (iii) Each Bank agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered pursuant to this 5.2 expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so. 
 (iv) The Borrower shall not be required to pay any amount pursuant to this 5.2 to any Recipient that is a Foreign Lender and that fails to comply with the requirements of this subsection (e). If any such Recipient fails to deliver the above forms or other documentation to the extent required hereunder, then the Borrower may withhold from such payment to such Recipient such amounts as are required by the Code. In the event of any such failure, if any Governmental Authority asserts that the Borrower did not properly withhold or backup withhold, as the case may be, any tax or other amount from payments made to or for the account of such Recipient, such 
 88 

Recipient shall indemnify the Borrower therefor, including all penalties and interest, any taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on the amounts payable by or to the Borrower under this 5.2, and costs and expenses (including all fees and disbursements of any law firm or other external counsel and the allocated cost of internal legal services and all disbursements of internal counsel) of the Borrower.

 (f) Treatment of Certain Refunds . Unless required by applicable Laws, at no time shall the Agent have any obligation to file for or otherwise pursue on behalf of a Bank or a Fronting Bank, or have any obligation to pay to any Bank or any Fronting Bank, any refund of Taxes withheld or deducted from funds paid for the account of such Bank or such Fronting Bank, as the case may be. If any Recipient has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrower or with respect to which the Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this 5.2, it shall pay to the Borrower an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Borrower under this 5.2 with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such Recipient, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund), provided that the Borrower, upon the request of the Recipient, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Borrower in the event the Recipient is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this subsection, in no event will the applicable Recipient be required to pay any amount to the Borrower pursuant to this subsection the payment of which would place the Recipient in a less favorable net after-Tax position than such Recipient would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This subsection shall not be construed to require any Recipient to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person. 
 (g) Banks Confirmation . The Banks, each severally as to itself, hereby certify that on and as of the Effective Date, no payment, or withholding or deduction of amounts, by the Borrower (or the Agent, as applicable) is required pursuant to the terms of this 5.2.

All other computations of fees and interest, including those with respect to Daily SOFR Loans, Term SOFR Loans and Alternative Currency Loans determined by reference to EURIBOR, shall be made on the basis of a 360-day year and actual days elapsed (which results in more fees or interest, as applicable, being paid than if computed on the basis of a 365 - day year). Interest shall accrue on each Loan for the day on which the Loan is made, and shall not accrue on a Loan, or any portion thereof, for the day on which the Loan or such portion is paid, provided that any Loan that is repaid on the same day on which it is made shall, subject to 5.1.1, bear interest for one day. Each determination by the Administrative Agent of an interest rate or fee hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error. Except as otherwise provided in the definition of the term Interest Period with respect to Term Rate Loans, and except with respect to payments due on the Maturity Date, whenever a payment hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents becomes due on a day that is not a Business Day, the due date for such payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and interest shall accrue during such extension, but without double counting with respect to any other Interest Period.

If in connection with any request for a SOFR Loan or an Alternative Currency Loan, a conversion of Base Rate Loans or Term SOFR Loans to Daily SOFR Loans, a conversion of Base Rate Loans or Daily SOFR Loans to Term SOFR Loans or a continuation of any of such Loans, as applicable, (i) the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that (A) no Successor Rate for the Relevant Rate for the applicable Agreed Currency has been determined in accordance with 5.4(b), 5.4(c) or 5.4(d) and the circumstances under clause (i) of 5.4(b), or of 5.4(d) or the SOFR Scheduled Unavailability Date , the CDOR Cessation Date or the Scheduled Unavailability Date, or a Canadian Transition Event, as applicable, has occurred with respect to such Relevant Rate (as applicable), or (B) adequate and reasonable means do not otherwise exist for determining the Relevant Rate for the applicable Agreed Currency for any determination date(s) or requested Interest Period, as applicable, with respect to a proposed SOFR Loan or an Alternative Currency Loan or in connection with an existing or proposed Base Rate Loan, or (ii) the Administrative Agent or the Required Banks determine for any reason that the Relevant Rate with respect to a proposed Loan denominated in an Agreed Currency for any requested Interest Period or 
 90 

determination date(s) does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Banks of funding such Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each Bank . 
 Thereafter, (x) the obligation of the Banks to make or maintain Loans in the affected currency(ies), as applicable, or to convert Base Rate Loans or Term SOFR Loans to Daily SOFR Loans or to convert Base Rate Loans or Daily SOFR Loans to Term SOFR Loans, shall be suspended in each case to the extent of the affected Alternative Currency Loans or Interest Period or determination date(s), as applicable, and (y) in the event of a determination described in the preceding sentence with respect to the Term SOFR component of the Base Rate, the utilization of the Term SOFR component in determining the Base Rate shall be suspended, in each case until the Administrative Agent (or, in the case of a determination by the Required Banks described in clause (ii) of this 5.4(a) , until the Administrative Agent upon instruction of the Required Banks) revokes such notice. 
 Upon receipt of such notice, (i) the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a borrowing of, or conversion to Daily SOFR Loans, or borrowing of, conversion to, or continuation of Term SOFR Loans, or borrowing of, or continuation of Alternative Currency Loans to the extent of the affected Alternative Currency Loans or Interest Periods or determination date(s), as applicable or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a borrowing of Base Rate Loans denominated in Dollars in the Dollar Equivalent of the amount specified therein and (ii) (A) any outstanding SOFR Loans shall be deemed to have been converted to Base Rate Loans immediately, in the case of a Daily SOFR Loan, or at the end of the applicable Interest Period, in the case of a Term SOFR Loan, and (B) any outstanding affected Alternative Currency Loans, at the Borrower s election, shall either (1) be converted into a borrowing of Base Rate Loans denominated in Dollars in the Dollar Equivalent of the amount of such outstanding Alternative Currency Loan immediately, in the case of an Alternative Currency Daily Rate Loan or at the end of the applicable Interest Period, in the case of an Alternative Currency Term Rate Loan or (2) be prepaid in full immediately, in the case of an Alternative Currency Daily Rate Loan, or at the end of the applicable Interest Period, in the case of an Alternative Currency Term Rate Loan provided that if no election is made by the Borrower (x) in the case of an Alternative Currency Daily Rate Loan, by the date that is three (3) Business Days after receipt by the Borrower of such notice or (y) in the case of an Alternative Currency Term Rate Loan, by the last day of the current Interest Period for the applicable Alternative Currency Term Rate Loan, the Borrower shall be deemed to have elected clause (1) above. 
 (b) Replacement of SOFR or SOFR Successor Rate .

 (i) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining SOFR and one month, three month and six month Interest Periods of Term SOFR, including, without limitation, because SOFR or the Term SOFR Screen Rate, as applicable, is not available or published on a current basis and such circumstances are unlikely to be temporary or 
 91 

(ii) the Applicable Authority has made a public statement identifying a specific date after which SOFR and one month, three month and six month Interest Periods for Term SOFR or the Term SOFR Screen Rate, as applicable, shall or will no longer be made available, or permitted to be used for determining the interest rate of syndicated loans denominated in Dollars, or shall or will otherwise cease, provided that, in each case, at the time of such statement, there are no successor administrators that are satisfactory to the Administrative Agent that will continue to provide SOFR or such Interest Periods for Term SOFR, as applicable, after such specific date (the latest date on which SOFR or one month, three month and six month Interest Periods of Term SOFR or the Term SOFR Screen Rate are no longer available permanently or indefinitely, the SOFR Scheduled Unavailability Date 
 or if the events or circumstances of the type described in 5.4(b)(i) or (ii) have occurred with respect to the SOFR Successor Rate then in effect, then in each case, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower may amend this Agreement solely for the purpose of replacing SOFR and or Term SOFR for Dollars or any then current SOFR Successor Rate for Dollars in accordance with this 5.4 with an alternative benchmark rate giving due consideration to any evolving or then existing convention for similar credit facilities syndicated and agented in the United States and denominated in Dollars for such alternative benchmarks, and, in each case, including, without duplication, any mathematical or other adjustments to such benchmark giving due consideration to any evolving or then existing convention for similar credit facilities syndicated and agented in the United States and denominated in Dollars for such benchmarks (any such proposed rate, including for the avoidance of doubt, any adjustment thereto, a SOFR Successor Rate ), and any such amendment shall become effective at 5 00 p.m. on the fifth Business Day after the Administrative Agent shall have posted such proposed amendment to all Banks and the Borrower unless, prior to such time, Banks comprising the Required Banks have delivered to the Administrative Agent written notice that such Required Banks object to such amendment.

(ii) Replacing Future Canadian Benchmarks. Upon the occurrence of a Canadian Benchmark Transition Event, the Canadian Benchmark Replacement will replace the then-current Canadian Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any Loan Document in respect of any Canadian Benchmark setting at or after 5 00 p.m. on the fifth (5th) Business Day after the date notice of such Canadian Benchmark Replacement is provided to the Banks without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document so long as the Administrative Agent has not received, by such time, written notice of objection to such Canadian Benchmark Replacement from Banks comprising the Required Banks. At any time that the administrator of the then-current Canadian Benchmark has permanently or indefinitely ceased to provide such Canadian Benchmark or such Canadian Benchmark has been announced by the administrator or the regulatory supervisor for the administrator of such Canadian Benchmark pursuant to public statement or publication of information to be no longer representative of the underlying market and economic reality that such Canadian Benchmark is intended to measure and that representativeness will not be restored, the Borrower may revoke any request for a borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Loans denominated in Canadian Dollars to be made, converted or continued that would bear interest by reference to such Canadian Benchmark until the Borrower s receipt of notice from the Administrative Agent that a Canadian Benchmark Replacement has replaced such Canadian Benchmark, and, failing that, the Borrower will be deemed to have converted any such request into a request for a borrowing of or conversion to Base Rate Loans in the Dollar Equivalent of the amount of such Loans.

 (v) Unavailability of Tenor of Canadian Benchmark. At any time (including in connection with the implementation of a Canadian Benchmark Replacement), if the then-current Canadian Benchmark is a term rate (including Term 
 93 

CORRA or CDOR ), then (x) the Administrative Agent may remove any tenor of such Canadian Benchmark that is unavailable or non-representative for Canadian Benchmark (including Canadian Benchmark Replacement) settings and (y) the Administrative Agent may reinstate any such previously removed tenor for Canadian Benchmark (including Canadian Benchmark Replacement) settings. 
 (vi) Secondary Term CORRA Conversion. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any Loan Document and subject to the proviso below in this clause, if a Term CORRA Transition Event and its related Term CORRA Transition Date have occurred, then on and after such Term CORRA Transition Date (x) the Canadian Benchmark Replacement described in clause (a)(i) of such definition will replace the then-current Canadian Benchmark for all purposes hereunder or under any Loan Document in respect of any setting of such Canadian Benchmark on such day and all subsequent settings, without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document and (y) each Loan outstanding on the Term CORRA Transition Date bearing interest based on the then-current Canadian Benchmark shall convert, at the last day of the then current interest payment period, into a Loan bearing interest at the Canadian Benchmark Replacement described in clause (a)(i) of such definition for the respective Available Tenor as selected by the Borrower as is available for the then-current Canadian Benchmark provided that, this clause (vi) shall not be effective unless the Administrative Agent has delivered to the Banks and the Borrower a Term CORRA Notice, and so long as the Administrative Agent has not received, by 5 00 p.m. on the fifth (5th) Business Day after the date of the Term CORRA Notice, written notice of objection to such conversion to Term CORRA from Banks comprising the Required Banks or the Borrower Intentionally Omitted . 
 (d) Replacement of Relevant Rate or Successor Rate . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any other Loan Documents, if the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error), or the Borrower or Required Banks notify(ies) the Administrative Agent (with, in the case of the Required Banks, a copy to the Borrower) that the Borrower or Required Banks (as applicable) have determined, that 
 (i) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Relevant Rate (other than SOFR, Term SOFR, CDOR or the Canadian Benchmark) for an Agreed Currency (other than Dollars or Canadian Dollars) because none of the tenors of such Relevant Rate (other than SOFR, Term SOFR , CDOR or the Canadian Benchmark) under this Agreement is available or published on a current basis, and such circumstances are unlikely to be temporary or 
 (ii) the Applicable Authority has made a public statement identifying a specific date after which all tenors of the Relevant Rate (other than SOFR, Term SOFR, CDOR or the Canadian Benchmark) for an Agreed Currency (other than Dollars or Canadian Dollars) under this Agreement shall or will no longer be representative or made available, or permitted to be used for determining the interest rate of syndicated loans denominated in such Agreed Currency (other than 
 94 

Dollars or Canadian Dollars), or shall or will otherwise cease, provided that, in each case, at the time of such statement, there is no successor administrator that is satisfactory to the Administrative Agent that will continue to provide such representative tenor(s) of the Relevant Rate (other than SOFR, Term SOFR, CDOR or the Canadian Benchmark) for such Agreed Currency (other than Dollars or Canadian Dollars) (the latest date on which all tenors of the Relevant Rate for such Agreed Currency (other than Dollars or Canadian Dollars) under this Agreement are no longer representative or available permanently or indefinitely, the Scheduled Unavailability Date 
 or if the events or circumstances of the type described in 5.4(d)(i) or (ii) have occurred with respect to the Successor Rate then in effect, then, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower may amend this Agreement solely for the purpose of replacing the Relevant Rate for an Agreed Currency or any then current Successor Rate for an Agreed Currency in accordance with this 5.4 with an alternative benchmark rate giving due consideration to any evolving or then existing convention for similar credit facilities syndicated and agented in the United States and denominated in such Agreed Currency for such alternative benchmarks, and, in each case, including any mathematical or other adjustments to such benchmark giving due consideration to any evolving or then existing convention for similar credit facilities syndicated and agented in the United States and denominated in such Agreed Currency for such benchmarks (any such proposed rate, including for the avoidance of doubt, any adjustment thereto, a Non-SOFR Successor Rate , and collectively with the SOFR Successor Rate and the Canadian Benchmark Replacement, each a Successor Rate ), and any such amendment shall become effective at 5 00 p.m. on the fifth Business Day after the Administrative Agent shall have posted such proposed amendment to all Banks and the Borrower unless, prior to such time, Banks comprising the Required Banks have delivered to the Administrative Agent written notice that such Required Banks object to such amendment. 
 (e) Successor Rates . The Administrative Agent will promptly (in one or more notices) notify the Borrower and each Bank of the implementation of any Successor Rate. 
 Any Successor Rate shall be applied in a manner consistent with market practice provided that to the extent such market practice is not administratively feasible for the Administrative Agent, such Successor Rate shall be applied in a manner as otherwise reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent. 
 Notwithstanding anything else herein, if at any time any Successor Rate as so determined would otherwise be less than zero, the Successor Rate will be deemed to be zero for the purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. 
 In connection with the implementation of a Successor Rate the Administrative Agent will have the right to make Conforming Changes or Canadian Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes, as applicable, from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any amendments implementing such Conforming Changes or Canadian Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes, as applicable, will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement provided that, with 
 95 

respect to any such amendment effected, the Administrative Agent shall post each such amendment implementing such Conforming Changes or Canadian Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes, as applicable, to the Borrower and the Banks reasonably promptly after such amendment becomes effective. 
 (f) Exclusion of Certain Banks . For purposes of this 5.4 , those Banks that either have not made, or do not have an obligation under this Agreement to make, the relevant Loans in the relevant Alternative Currency shall be excluded from any determination of Required Banks. 
 5.5 Illegality. Notwithstanding any other provisions herein, if any Bank determines in good faith that any present or future Law shall make it unlawful, or any applicable Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Bank or its applicable Lending Office to perform its obligations hereunder or make, maintain or fund Loans or charge interest with respect to any Loan or Letter of Credit or to determine or charge interest rates based upon a Relevant Rate, or to purchase or sell, or to take deposits of, any Alternative Currency in the applicable interbank market, such Bank shall forthwith give notice of such circumstances to the Borrower through the Agent, and thereupon (a) any obligation of such Bank to make or maintain Alternative Currency Loans in the affected currency or currencies or, in the case of Loans denominated in Dollars, to make or maintain Daily SOFR Loans, to make or continue Term SOFR Loans or to convert Base Rate Loans or Daily SOFR Loans to Term SOFR Loans or Base Rate Loans or Term SOFR Loans to Daily SOFR Loans shall be, in each case, suspended, and (b) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Bank making or maintaining Base Rate Loans, the interest rate on which is determined by reference to the Term SOFR component of the Base Rate, the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Bank shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Agent without reference to the Term SOFR component of the Base Rate, in each case until such Bank notifies the Agent and the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice, (x) the Borrower shall, upon demand from such Bank (with a copy to the Agent), prepay all SOFR Loans or Alternative Currency Loans, as applicable, in the affected currency or currencies or, if applicable and such Loans are denominated in Dollars, convert all SOFR Loans of such Bank to Base Rate Loans (the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Bank shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Agent without reference to the Term SOFR component of the Base Rate), in each case, immediately, or, in the case of Term SOFR Loans and Alternative Currency Term Rate Loans, on the last day of the Interest Period therefor if such Bank may lawfully continue to maintain such Term SOFR Loans or Alternative Currency Term Rate Loans, as applicable, to such day and (y) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Bank determining or charging interest rates based upon Term SOFR, the Agent shall during the period of such suspension compute the Base Rate applicable to such Bank without reference to the Term SOFR component thereof until the Agent is advised in writing by such Bank that it is no longer illegal for such Bank to determine or charge interest rates based upon Term SOFR. Upon any such conversion or prepayment, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so converted or prepaid. Subject to the limitations set forth in 5.8, the Borrower hereby agrees promptly to pay the Agent for the account of such Bank, upon demand, any additional amounts necessary to compensate such Bank for any costs incurred by such Bank in making any conversion or receiving any prepayment required by this 5.5 prior to the last day of an Interest Period with respect to a Term Rate Loan, including any interest or fees payable by such Bank to lenders of funds obtained by it in order to make or maintain its Term Rate Loans hereunder.

 (c) impose, increase or render applicable (other than to the extent specifically provided for elsewhere in this Agreement) any special deposit, reserve, assessment, liquidity, capital adequacy or other similar requirements (whether or not having the force of law) against assets held by, or deposits in or for the account of, or loans by or participated in, or letters of credit issued by or participated in, or commitments of an office of any Bank or any Fronting Bank, or 
 (d) impose on any Bank, any Fronting Bank or the Agent or any applicable interbank market any other conditions or requirements with respect to this Agreement, the other Loan Documents, any Letters of Credit, the Loans, such Bank s Commitment, or any class of loans, letters of credit or commitments of which any of the Loans or such Bank s Commitment forms a part 
 and the result of any of the foregoing is 
 (i) to increase the cost to any Bank or any Fronting Bank of making, funding, issuing, renewing, extending, participating in, converting, continuing or maintaining any of the Loans or such Bank s Commitment or any Letter of Credit, or 
 (ii) to reduce the amount of principal, interest, Reimbursement Obligation or other amount payable to such Bank, such Fronting Bank or the Agent hereunder on account of such Bank s Commitment, any Letter of Credit or any of the Loans, or 
 (iii) to require such Bank, such Fronting Bank or the Agent to make any payment or to forego any interest or Reimbursement Obligation or other sum payable hereunder, the amount of which payment or foregone interest or Reimbursement Obligation or other sum is calculated by reference to the gross amount of any sum receivable or deemed received by such Bank, such Fronting Bank or the Agent from the Borrower hereunder, 
 then, and in each such case, the Borrower will, within thirty (30) days after notice by the Agent, such Fronting Bank or such Bank (such notice to be given promptly by the Agent, such Fronting Bank or such Bank upon the making of any such determination), at any time and from time to time and as often as the occasion therefor may arise, but subject to the limitations set forth in 5.8, pay to such Bank, such Fronting Bank or the Agent such additional amounts as such Bank, such 
 97 

Fronting Bank or the Agent shall determine in good faith to be sufficient to compensate such Bank, such Fronting Bank or the Agent for such additional cost, reduction, payment or foregone interest or other sum, provided that such Bank, such Fronting Bank or the Agent is imposing such charges on the Borrower in a non-discriminatory manner, as determined in good faith by the Agent without any obligation to disclose the identity of any other borrower or credit facility. 
 5.7 Capital Adequacy. If any Bank or any Fronting Bank determines in good faith that any Change in Law (a) affects the amount of capital or liquidity required or expected to be maintained by banks or bank holding companies and any Bank, any Fronting Bank or the Agent determines that the amount of capital or liquidity required to be maintained by it or its holding company is increased or (b) has the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Bank s or such Fronting Bank s capital or on the capital of such Bank s or such Fronting Bank s holding company to a level below that which such Bank or such Fronting Bank or such Bank s or Fronting Bank s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Bank s or such Fronting Bank s policies and the policies of such Bank s or such Fronting Bank s holding company with respect to capital adequacy and liquidity), in each case, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Bank or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Bank, or the Letters of Credit issued by such Fronting Bank, then such Bank, such Fronting Bank or the Agent may notify the Borrower of such fact, and the Borrower shall pay to such Bank, such Fronting Bank or the Agent from time to time, within thirty (30) days after notice by the Agent, such Fronting Bank or such Bank (such notice to be given promptly by the Agent, such Fronting Bank or such Bank upon the making of any such determination), as an additional fee payable hereunder, but subject to the limitations set forth in 5.8, such amount as such Bank, such Fronting Bank or the Agent shall determine reasonably and in good faith and certify in a notice to the Borrower to be an amount that will adequately compensate such Bank or such Fronting Bank in light of these circumstances for its (or its holding company s) increased costs of maintaining such capital or liquidity or any reduction suffered. Each Bank, each Fronting Bank and the Agent shall allocate such cost increases and reductions among its customers in good faith and on an equitable basis, and will not charge the Borrower unless it is imposing such charges on the Borrower in a non-discriminatory manner, as determined in good faith by the Agent without any obligation to disclose the identity of any other borrower or credit facility. In no event shall the Borrower be obligated to pay any amount pursuant to this 5.7 to or in respect of a Delinquent Bank. 
 5.8 Certificate Limitations. A certificate setting forth any additional amounts payable pursuant to 5.2, 5.5, 5.6 or 5.7 and a brief explanation of such amounts which are due, including reasonably detailed information regarding the method and calculation of such amount, submitted by any Bank, any Fronting Bank or the Agent to the Borrower, shall be prima facie evidence that such amounts are due and owing.

 98 

is more than one hundred eighty (180) days prior to the date of delivery of the certificate set forth in the first sentence of this 5.8 (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such request for compensation is retroactive, then, provided that such certificate is delivered to the Borrower within forty-five (45) days after the effective date of such Change in Law, such one hundred eighty (180) day period shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof). If (a) a Bank requests compensation pursuant to 5.2, 5.5, 5.6 or 5.7 and the Required Banks are not also doing the same, (b) the obligation of any Bank to make, convert and or continue SOFR Loans or Alternative Currency Loans shall be suspended pursuant to 5.5 but the obligation of the Required Banks shall not have been suspended under such Section, or (c) if any Bank is a Delinquent Bank, then, so long as there does not then exist any Event of Default, the Borrower, at any time with respect to a Delinquent Bank, or, with respect to a request for compensation pursuant to 5.2, 5.6 or 5.7 or a suspension pursuant to 5.5, within thirty (30) days after such request for compensation or suspension, as applicable, may either (x) demand that such Bank (the Affected Bank assign its Commitment to an Eligible Assignee designated by the Borrower (or designated by the Agent and approved by the Borrower), and upon such demand the Affected Bank shall promptly assign its Commitment to such Eligible Assignee, subject to and in accordance with the provisions of 20.1 (and in the event such Affected Bank fails to timely assign its Commitment hereunder, the waivers and limitations set forth in 17(d) and 27 shall not apply to such Affected Bank and shall be of no force and effect with respect to such Affected Bank but shall continue to apply and be of full force and effect with respect to the Agent and each Fronting Bank (so long as they are not the Affected Bank) and each other Bank), for a purchase price equal to the aggregate principal balance of the Loans then owing to the Affected Bank and its outstanding Letter of Credit Participations, plus any accrued but unpaid interest thereon and accrued but unpaid fees owing to the Affected Bank, and upon such assignment the Borrower shall pay the fee specified in 20.3, (y) pay to the Affected Bank the amounts required under 5.2, 5.5, 5.6 or 5.7, if applicable, or (z) pay to the Affected Bank the aggregate principal balance of the Loans then owing to the Affected Bank and its outstanding Letter of Credit Participations, plus any accrued but unpaid interest thereon and accrued but unpaid fees owing to the Affected Bank (but without duplication of the amounts payable pursuant to 5.2, 5.5, 5.6 or 5.7, if applicable).

The Banks shall notify the Borrower of any successor to the Agent by a writing signed by Required Banks, which successor shall be reasonably acceptable 
 139 

to the Borrower so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing. It is understood and agreed that the use of the term agent herein or in any other Loan Documents (or any other similar term) with reference to the Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable Law. Instead such term is used as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between contracting parties. 
 16.2 Rights as a Bank. The Person serving as the Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Bank as any other Bank and may exercise the same as though it were not the Agent and the term Bank or Banks shall, unless otherwise expressly indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, include the Person serving as the Agent hereunder in its individual capacity. Such Person and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, own securities of, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for and generally engage in any kind of business with the Borrower or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if such Person were not the Agent hereunder and without any duty to account therefor to the Banks. 
 16.3 No Liability. The Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, and its duties hereunder shall be administrative in nature. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Agent 
 (a) shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing 
 (b) shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents that the Agent is required to exercise as directed in writing by the Required Banks (or such other number or percentage of the Banks as shall be expressly provided for herein or in the other Loan Documents), provided that the Agent shall not be required to take any action that, in its opinion or the opinion of its counsel, may expose the Agent to liability or that is contrary to any Loan Document or applicable law, including for the avoidance of doubt any action that may be in violation of the automatic stay under any Debtor Relief Laws or that may effect a forfeiture, modification or termination of property of a Delinquent Bank in violation of any Debtor Relief Laws

 (d) shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it (i) with the consent or at the request of the Required Banks (or such other number or percentage of the Banks as shall be necessary, or as the Agent shall believe in good faith shall be necessary, under the circumstances as provided in 14 and 28) or (ii) in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable 
 140 

judgment. The Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default or Event of Default unless and until notice describing such Default or Event of Default is given in writing to the Agent by the Borrower, a Bank or a Fronting Bank and 
 (e) shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or therein or the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in 12 or 13 or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Agent. 
 16.4 Reliance by Agent. The Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person. The Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan, or the issuance, extension, renewal or increase of a Letter of Credit, that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Bank or a Fronting Bank, the Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Bank or such Fronting Bank unless the Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Bank or such Fronting Bank prior to the making of such Loan or the issuance of such Letter of Credit. The Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts, absent gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Agent in choosing such counsel, accountants or experts.

The exculpatory provisions of this 16 shall apply to any such sub agent and to the Related Parties of the Agent and any such sub agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as the Agent. The Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any sub-agents except to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final and nonappealable judgment that the Agent acted with gross negligence or willful misconduct in the selection of such sub-agents. 
 16.6 Resignation of Agent . 
 (a) The Agent may at any time give notice of its resignation to the Banks, the Fronting Banks and the Borrower. Upon receipt of any such notice of resignation, the Required 
 141 

Banks shall have the right, with the approval of the Borrower (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, and such approval not to be required if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing), to appoint a successor, which shall be a bank with an office in the United States, or an Affiliate of any such bank with an office in the United States. If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Banks and shall have accepted such appointment within thirty (30) days after the retiring Agent gives notice of its resignation (or such earlier day as shall be agreed by the Required Banks) (the Resignation Effective Date ), then the retiring Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) on behalf of the Banks and the Fronting Banks, appoint a successor Agent meeting the qualifications set forth above. Whether or not a successor has been appointed, such resignation shall become effective in accordance with such notice on the Resignation Effective Date. 
 (b) If the Person serving as the Agent is a Delinquent Bank pursuant to clause (d) of the definition thereof, the Required Banks may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, by notice in writing to the Borrower and such Person remove such Person as the Agent and, with the approval of the Borrower (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, and such approval not to be required if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing), appoint a successor. If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Banks and shall have accepted such appointment within thirty (30) days (or such earlier day as shall be agreed by the Required Banks) (the Removal Effective Date ), then such removal shall nonetheless become effective in accordance with such notice on the Removal Effective Date. In addition, the Borrower may remove the Agent in the event that (x) the Person serving as the Agent is a Delinquent Bank pursuant to clause (a)(i) , (b) or (d) of the definition thereof or (y) the Person serving as the Agent holds (without participation) less than the Minimum Commitment, provided that the Borrower shall not have such removal right if an Event of Default exists or if the Person serving as the Agent holds less than the Minimum Commitment at any time as a result of the merger or consolidation of any of the other Banks or as a result of events other than the sale by the Agent of any portion of its Commitments (which for this purpose includes Loans outstanding thereunder). 
 (c) With effect from the Resignation Effective Date or the Removal Effective Date (as applicable), (1) the retiring or removed Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents provided that such discharge of duties and obligations shall not be deemed to be a waiver or discharge of any claim against the retiring or removed Agent to the extent such claim accrued or relates to the period prior to such discharge of duties and obligations) and (2) except for any indemnity payments or other amounts then owed to the retiring or removed Agent, all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the Agent shall instead be made by or to each Bank and each Fronting Bank directly, until such time, if any, as the Required Banks appoint a successor Agent as provided for above. Upon the acceptance of a successor s appointment as the Agent hereunder, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring (or removed) Agent (other than as provided in 5.2(d) and other than any rights to indemnity payments or other amounts owed to the retiring or removed Agent as of the Resignation Effective Date or the Removal Effective Date, as applicable), and the retiring or removed Agent shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, if not already discharged therefrom as provided above in this 16.6 provided that such discharge of duties and obligations shall not be deemed to be a waiver or discharge of any claim against the retiring or removed Agent to the extent such claim accrued 
 142 

or relates to the period prior to such discharge of duties and obligations). The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Borrower and such successor. After the retiring or removed Agent s resignation or removal hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the provisions of this Article and 17 shall continue in effect with respect to and, as applicable, for the benefit of such retiring or removed Agent, its sub agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them (i) while the retiring or removed Agent was acting as the Agent and (ii) after such resignation or removal for as long as any of them continues to act in any capacity hereunder or under the other Loan Documents, including (a) acting as collateral agent or otherwise holding any collateral security on behalf of any of the Banks and (b) in respect of any actions taken in connection with transferring the agency to any successor Agent. 
 (d) Any resignation by, or removal of, BOA as the Agent pursuant to this 16.6 shall also constitute its resignation or removal as a Fronting Bank. Upon such resignation by, or removal of, BOA as a Fronting Bank, BOA shall retain all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of a Fronting Bank hereunder with respect to all Letters of Credit issued by it and outstanding as of the effective date of its resignation or removal as Fronting Bank and all Letter of Credit Obligations with respect thereto, including the right to require the Banks to make available their respective Commitment Percentages of any Revolving Credit Loan made pursuant to 3.3(a) or Reimbursement Obligation incurred pursuant to 3.3(b)).

 16.7 Non-Reliance on Agent and Other Banks. Each Bank and each Fronting Bank acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Agent or any other Bank or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Bank and each Fronting Bank also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Agent or any other Bank or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.
