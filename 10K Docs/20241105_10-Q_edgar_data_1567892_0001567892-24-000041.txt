million. The base purchase price is subject to customary adjustments, which will be paid in cash. Subject to satisfaction or waiver of the closing conditions, the Company expects the transaction to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2024. The Company is required to use net proceeds from the transaction to prepay or redeem the term loans and notes, which are further described in Note 11. Such mandatory prepayment or redemption requires the Company to pay a makewhole premium with the prepaid or redeemed debt, the amount of which will be based on the final net proceeds from the transaction. 
 Since management is authorized to sell and believes it is probable that the sale will occur within a year, the Company determined that the Therakos business met the criteria to be classified as held for sale as of August 3, 2024. However, the Therakos business, the results of which are reported under the Specialty Brands segment, did not qualify as discontinued operations as it did not represent a strategic shift that will have a major effect on the Company s operations and financial results. As a result, the related assets and liabilities were included in the separate held for sale line items of the asset and liability sections of the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 27, 2024 (Successor). The Company determined that the fair value of Therakos, using a market based approach, was greater than its carrying value and, accordingly, determined that the carrying value was appropriately recorded at cost and no write down was required.

 million and million on losses from continuing operations before income taxes of million and million for the three and nine months ended September 29, 2023 (Predecessor), respectively. This resulted in an effective tax rate of negative and negative , respectively. For the three months ended September 29, 2023 (Predecessor), the effective tax rate is lower than the Irish statutory tax rate of 12.5 primarily due to the impact of the mix of pretax earnings in various jurisdictions. For the nine months ended September 29, 2023 (Predecessor), the effective tax rate is lower than the Irish statutory tax rate of 12.5 primarily due to the impact of valuation allowances recorded on the beginning of the year deferred tax assets as a result of the Company s substantial doubt about the ability to continue as a going concern and the mix of pretax earnings in various jurisdictions. 
 During the nine months ended September 27, 2024 (Successor), net cash payments for income taxes were million related to operational activity.

 On December 20, 2021, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development OECD released the Global Anti-Base Erosion GloBE Model Rules Pillar Two providing a legislative framework for the Income Inclusion Rule and the Under-Taxed Payment Rule UTPR ). Pillar Two is designed to ensure that large multinational enterprise groups pay a minimum level of tax on the income arising in each of the jurisdictions where they operate, principally creating a 15 minimum global effective tax rate. On December 15, 2022, the E.U. member states, as well as many other countries, adopted a directive implementing the Pillar Two global minimum tax rules. On December 20, 2022, the OECD released three guidance documents related to Pillar Two. These documents included guidance on safe harbors and penalty relief and consultation papers on the GloBE Information Return and Tax Certainty for the GloBE rules. A number of jurisdictions have transposed the directive into national legislation with the rules to be applicable for fiscal years beginning on or after December 31, 2023, with the exception of the UTPR which is to be applicable for fiscal years beginning on or after December 31, 2024. As the Company's fiscal year end was December 29, 2023, Pillar Two is not effective until the Company s fiscal year ending December 25, 2025. The Company is closely monitoring developments and is evaluating the impacts these new rules will have on its tax rate, including the eligibility to qualify for the safe harbor rules.

In March 2016, the EPA issued the Record of Decision ROD(s) for the lower 8 miles of the River with a slight modification on its preferred approach and a revised estimated cost of billion. In October 2016, the EPA announced that Occidental Chemicals Corporation had entered into an agreement to develop the remedial design. 
 In August 2018, the EPA finalized a buyout offer of million with the Company, limited to its former Lodi facility, for the lower 8 miles of the River. In September 2021, the EPA issued the ROD for the upper 9 miles of the River selecting source control as the remedy for the upper 9 miles with an estimated cost of million. In September 2022, the Company entered into a conditional million Early Cash-Out Consent Decree CD with the EPA as a buyout for its portion of the upper part of the River related to its former Lodi facility; finalization of the CD is subject to the EPA approval following the public comment period. The comment period resulted in a modification to the CD by the EPA which includes a cost reopener of billion to the covenant not to sue. The United States filed the modified CD with the U. S. District Court for the District of New Jersey on January 17, 2024, and a motion for entry and response to comments was filed on January 31, 2024. At least one party in the litigation has filed a brief in opposition to the motion to enter the modified CD. The court has not yet ruled on the motion. 
 The portion of the liability related to the Belleville facility was discharged against the Company as a result of the 2020 Bankruptcy Proceedings. Any reserves associated with this contingency were included in liabilities subject to compromise as of June 16, 2022 (Predecessor), and any related liabilities were discharged under the Bankruptcy Code. The portion of the liability related to the Lodi facility remains a part of the reserve until the CD is lodged. 
 As of September 27, 2024 (Successor), the Company estimated that its remaining liability related to the River was million, which was included within environmental liabilities on the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 27, 2024 (Successor). Despite the issuance of the revised FFS and the RODs for both the lower and upper River by the EPA, the RI/FS by the CPG, and the conditional CD by the EPA, there are many uncertainties associated with the final agreed-upon remediation, potential future liabilities and the Company's allocable share of the remediation. Given those uncertainties, the amounts accrued may not be indicative of the amounts for which the Company may be ultimately responsible and will be refined as the remediation progresses. 
 
 Bankruptcy Litigation and Appeals 
 Sanofi. On October 13, 2021, in the 2020 Bankruptcy Proceedings, sanofi-aventis U.S. LLC Sanofi filed a motion asking the Bankruptcy Court for an order determining that, under the Bankruptcy Code, the Company could not discharge certain alleged royalty obligations owed to Sanofi under an asset purchase agreement through which the Company acquired certain intellectual property from Sanofi's predecessor Sanofi Motion ). On November 4, 2021, the Bankruptcy Court denied the Sanofi Motion and ordered that any royalty obligations allegedly owed to Sanofi constitute prepetition unsecured claims that may be discharged under the Bankruptcy Code. On November 19, 2021, Sanofi appealed the Bankruptcy Court's ruling of the Sanofi Motion to the District Court. Briefing was completed on March 10, 2022 and the District Court affirmed on December 21, 2022, for which Sanofi filed a notice of appeal to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals on January 17, 2023. On April 25, 2024, the Third Circuit ruled in favor of the Company in all respects, stating that royalty obligations owed to Sanofi were discharged in bankruptcy.

 million. 
 Equity securities. Equity securities consist of shares in Silence Therapeutics plc and Panbela Therapeutics, Inc. for which quoted prices are available in an active market; therefore, these investments are classified as level 1 and are valued based on quoted market prices reported on internationally recognized securities exchanges. The three and nine months ended September 27, 2024 (Successor) included million unrealized losses and million of unrealized gains, respectively, on equity securities related to our investments in Silence Therapeutics plc and Panbela Therapeutics, Inc, while the three and nine months ended September 29, 2023 (Predecessor) included million of unrealized gain and million of unrealized loss, respectively. These amounts were recorded within other (expense) income, net in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
 Interest rate cap. The Company is exposed to interest rate risk on its variable-rate debt. During the three months ended March 31, 2023, the Company entered into an interest rate cap agreement, which serves to reduce the volatility on future interest expense cash outflows. The interest rate cap agreement has a total notional value of million with an upfront premium of million and provides the Company with interest rate protection, through March 26, 2026, to the extent that the one-month secured overnight funding rate SOFR exceeds . For purposes of the interest rate cap, SOFR is measured on a predetermined business day of every month, which may not coincide with either the Company s fiscal period end or the date that SOFR is determined for purposes of the First and Second-Out Takeback Term Loans. The impact of the interest rate cap on the Company s applicable interest rates as disclosed in Note 11 reflects the SOFR rate in effect on September 27, 2024 (Successor). 
 The interest rate cap agreement is not accounted for as a cash flow hedge and the changes in fair value of the interest rate cap were recorded within other expense, net in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. The fair value of the interest rate cap is included in other assets on the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 27, 2024 (Successor). 
 The Company elected to use the income approach to value the interest rate cap derivative using observable level 2 market expectations at the measurement date and standard valuation techniques to convert future amounts to a single present amount (discounted) reflecting current market expectations about those future amounts. Level 2 inputs for derivative valuations are limited to quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets (specifically futures contracts) and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable such as SOFR rate curves, futures and volatilities. Mid-market pricing is used as a practical expedient in the fair value measurements. During the three and nine months ended September 27, 2024 (Successor), the Company recognized a million and a million unrealized loss, respectively, in other (expense) income, net, while during the three and nine months ended September 29, 2023 (Predecessor), the Company recognized a million and a million unrealized gain, respectively. These amounts were related to the changes in fair value of the interest rate cap. 
 Debt derivative liabilities. The debt derivative liabilities related to the Company's First and Second-Out Takeback Term Loans and Takeback Notes are measured using a 'with and without' valuation model to compare the fair values of each debt instrument including the identified embedded derivative feature. The with value corresponds to the fair value of each instrument assuming mandatory prepayment upon an asset sale. The without value corresponds to the fair value of each instrument assuming no mandatory prepayment upon an asset sale. These derivative liabilities are classified as level 3 and the fair value of the debt instruments including the embedded derivative features were determined using the Black-Derman-Toy model based on the potential scenario included in the tables below, which includes significant unobservable inputs. The estimated settlement value of each scenario, which would include any required applicable premium, is then discounted to present value using a discount rate that is a and credit spread for the First and Second-Out Takeback Term Loans, respectively, plus the U.S. treasury yield commensurate with the cash flow payment date. The applicable premium estimates were calculated at each mandatory prepayment event date in accordance with the contractual definition and were based, in part, on subjective assumptions. These subjective assumptions relate to scenario-related proceeds from an asset sale, inclusive of estimated transaction fees and related taxes. The debt derivative liability is recorded at fair value, with the changes in fair value reported within earnings. The debt derivative liability was million and million as of September 27, 2024 (Successor) and December 29, 2023 (Successor), respectively, and was recorded within accrued and other current liabilities within the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets as of September 27, 2024 (Successor) and December 29, 2023 (Successor). The million and million decreases in debt derivative liability during the three and nine months ended September 27, 2024 (Successor), respectively, were recognized in other (expense) income, net, within the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations.

 Deferred compensation liabilities. The Company maintains a non-qualified deferred compensation plan in the U.S., which permits eligible employees of the Company to defer a portion of their compensation. A recordkeeping account is set up for each participant and the participant chooses from a variety of funds for the deemed investment of their accounts. The recordkeeping accounts generally correspond to the funds offered in the Company's U.S. tax-qualified defined contribution retirement plan and the account balance fluctuates with the investment returns on those funds. 
 Contingent consideration liability. In accordance with the 2020 Plan and the Scheme of Arrangement related to the 2020 Irish examinership proceedings, the Company will provide consideration for the Terlivaz contingent value right agreement CVR primarily in the form of the achievement of a cumulative net sales milestone. The determination of fair value is dependent upon a number of factors, which include projections of future net sales, a weighted average cost of capital, and certain other market place data. The Company assesses the likelihood and timing of making such payments at each balance sheet date. The fair value of the contingent payment was measured based on the net present value of a probability-weighted assessment. The Company determined the fair value of the Terlivaz CVR as of September 27, 2024 (Successor) and December 29, 2023 (Successor) to be million and million, respectively. The contingent consideration liability was classified within other liabilities in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets as of September 27, 2024 (Successor) and December 29, 2023 (Successor). For the three and nine months ended September 27, 2024 (Successor), the Company recorded expense of million and million, respectively, within SG A. Comparatively, for the three and nine months ended September 29, 2023 (Predecessor), the Company recorded income of million and million, respectively, within SG A. 
 
 Financial Instruments Not Measured at Fair Value 
 The following methods and assumptions were used by the Company in estimating fair values for financial instruments not measured at fair value as of September 27, 2024 (Successor) and December 29, 2023 (Successor): 
 The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and the majority of other current assets and liabilities approximate fair value because of their short-term nature. The Company classifies cash on hand and deposits in banks, including commercial paper, money market accounts and other highly liquid investments it may hold from time to time, with an original maturity of three months or less, as cash and cash equivalents (level 1). The fair value of restricted cash was equivalent to its carrying value of million and million as of September 27, 2024 (Successor) and December 29, 2023 (Successor) (level 1), respectively. Included within the balance as of the 2023 Effective Date was million related to the funding of a professional fee escrow account upon emergence from the 2023 Bankruptcy Proceedings. As of September 27, 2024 (Successor), the professional fee escrow balance was . 
 The Company's life insurance contracts are carried at cash surrender value, which is based on the present value of future cash flows under the terms of the contracts (level 3). Significant assumptions used in determining the cash surrender value include the amount and timing of future cash flows, interest rates and mortality charges. The fair value of these contracts approximates the carrying value of million and million as of September 27, 2024 (Successor) and December 29, 2023 (Successor), respectively. These contracts are included in other assets on the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets.

 Concentration of Credit and Other Risks 
 Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk primarily consist of accounts receivable. The Company generally does not require collateral from customers. A portion of the Company's accounts receivable outside the U.S. includes sales to government-owned or supported healthcare systems in several countries, which are subject to payment delays. Payment is dependent upon the financial stability and creditworthiness of those countries' national economies.

 Management measures and evaluates the Company's operating segments based on segment net sales and operating income. Management excludes corporate expenses from segment operating income. In addition, certain amounts that management considers to be non-recurring or non-operational are excluded from segment operating income because management and the chief operating decision maker evaluate the operating results of the segments excluding such items. These items may include, but are not limited to, depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation, net restructuring charges, non-restructuring impairment charges and liabilities management and separation costs. Although these amounts are excluded from segment operating income, as applicable, they are included in reported consolidated operating loss and are reflected in the reconciliations presented below.

 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
 
 Item 2. 
 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 
 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes forward-looking statements that are based on management's beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to management. See Forward-Looking Statements at the end of this Item 2 for important additional information and related considerations. 
 
 Overview 
 We are a global business consisting of multiple wholly owned subsidiaries that develop, manufacture, market and distribute specialty pharmaceutical products and therapies. Areas of focus include autoimmune and rare diseases in specialty areas like neurology, rheumatology, hepatology, nephrology, pulmonology, ophthalmology and oncology; immunotherapy and neonatal respiratory critical care therapies; analgesics and gastrointestinal products. 
 We operate our business in two reportable segments, which are further described below: 
 Specialty Brands includes innovative specialty pharmaceutical brands; and 
 Specialty Generics includes niche specialty generic drugs and active pharmaceutical ingredients API(s) ). 
 For further information on our business and products, refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K ), filed with the United States U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC on March 26, 2024. 
 
 Therakos Divestiture 
 On August 3, 2024, we entered into a definitive agreement with affiliates of CVC Capital Partners IX Purchasers under which Purchasers will acquire the Therakos business for a base purchase price of 925.0 million, subject to customary adjustments. The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2024, subject to customary closing conditions. There can be no assurance that all of the conditions will be satisfied or waived; see Forward-Looking Statements at the end of this Item 2 for important additional information and related considerations. 
 Additional information regarding this transaction and related agreements is included in Note 3 of the notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and our Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 5, 2024. As described in more detail in Liquidity and Capital Resources, we are required to use net proceeds from the transaction to reduce our debt. 
 
 Transaction Incentive Program 
 On February 2, 2024, our Board of Directors Board adopted a Transaction Incentive Plan, which is intended to compensate designated Mallinckrodt executive officers and directors with bonus payments to be made upon the consummation of qualifying asset sale transactions (each, a Qualifying Transaction ). On August 4, 2024, the Board amended and restated the Transaction Incentive Plan A R TrIP ). Each bonus payment earned under the A R TrIP will be generally delivered 50 in connection with closing of the applicable Qualifying Transaction and 50 on the earlier of (a) December 31, 2026 and (b) a Significant Asset Transaction, as defined in the A R TrIP Final Payment Date provided, however that in the event that a Qualifying Transaction closes following a Significant Asset Transaction, 100 of the applicable bonus payment earned with respect to such Qualifying Transaction generally will be paid in connection with closing of the such Qualifying Transaction. In accordance with the A R TrIP and subject to the finalization of the initial purchase price, we currently expect to make payments to participants of approximately 13.6 million within 30 days upon closing of the Therakos divestiture. Similarly, we expect to make additional payments to participants of approximately 16.5 million by the Final Payment Date. 
 
 2023 Emergence from Bankruptcy 
 On August 28, 2023 2023 Petition Date ), we voluntarily initiated Chapter 11 proceedings 2023 Chapter 11 Cases under chapter 11 of title 11 Chapter 11 of the United States Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware Bankruptcy Court ). On September 20, 2023, our directors initiated examinership proceedings with respect to Mallinckrodt plc by presenting a

 petition to the High Court of Ireland pursuant to Section 510(1)(b) of the Companies Act 2014 seeking the appointment of an examiner to Mallinckrodt plc. On October 10, 2023, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order confirming a plan of reorganization 2023 Plan ). Subsequent to the Bankruptcy Court s order confirming the 2023 Plan, the High Court of Ireland made an order confirming a scheme of arrangement on November 10, 2023, which is based on and consistent in all respects with the 2023 Plan 2023 Scheme of Arrangement ). The 2023 Plan and the 2023 Scheme of Arrangement became effective on November 14, 2023, 2023 Effective Date ), and we emerged from the 2023 Chapter 11 Cases and the Irish examinership proceedings (together, the 2023 Bankruptcy Proceedings on that date. 
 Upon emergence from the 2023 Bankruptcy Proceedings on November 14, 2023, we adopted fresh-start accounting in accordance with the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 852 - Reorganizations ASC 852 ), and became a new entity for financial reporting purposes as of the 2023 Effective Date. References to Successor relate to the financial position of the reorganized Company as of December 29, 2023 and September 27, 2024 and results of operations of the reorganized Company subsequent to November 14, 2023, while references to Predecessor relate to the financial position of the Company as of December 30, 2022 and results of operations of the Company for the period from December 31, 2022 through November 14, 2023. All emergence-related transactions related to the 2023 Effective Date were recorded as of November 14, 2023. Accordingly, the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the Successor periods are not comparable to the Predecessor period. 
 As of December 30, 2023, professional fees directly related to the 2023 Bankruptcy Proceedings that were previously reflected as reorganization items, net, are classified within selling, general and administrative SG A expenses. Further, we have experienced a significant reduction in professional fees directly related to the implementation of the 2023 Plan during 2024. 
 As of the 2023 Petition Date, professional fees directly related to the 2023 Chapter 11 Cases that were previously reflected as liabilities management and separation costs are being classified on a go-forward basis as reorganization items, net. 
 As a result of our emergence from the 2023 Bankruptcy Proceedings, we had significant changes to our Board of Directors, with the majority of our non-employee directors being newly appointed to the Board of Directors in February 2024. As a result, our Board of Directors may determine, from time to time, to implement changes in our business strategy. At the direction of our Board of Directors, we are exploring a variety of potential divestiture, financing and other transactional opportunities, with a goal of maximizing shareholder value and potentially further reducing our debt. As part of this initiative, we are engaged in a process of evaluating the assets across our portfolio, in both our Specialty Brands and Specialty Generics segments. We have engaged Lazard to assist with this process. Refer to Therakos Divestiture above for further details. 
 For a discussion of certain risks related to our evaluation and execution of divestiture, financing and other transactional opportunities, see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Business Factors Influencing the Results of Operations 
 We cannot adequately benchmark certain operating results of the three and nine months ended September 27, 2024 (Successor) against the three and nine months ended September 29, 2023 (Predecessor) as the comparison of Successor and Predecessor periods would not be in accordance with U.S generally accepted accounting principles GAAP ). We do not believe that reviewing the results of the Successor period in isolation would be useful in identifying trends in or reaching conclusions regarding our overall operating performance. Management believes that our key performance metrics such as net sales and segment results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 27, 2024 (Successor) provide a meaningful comparison and are useful in identifying current business trends when compared to the three and nine months ended September 29, 2023 (Predecessor). Accordingly, in addition to presenting our results of operations as reported in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP, the discussion in Results of Operations and Segment Results below utilizes a comparison of the three and nine months ended September 27, 2024 (Successor) against the three and nine months ended September 29, 2023 (Predecessor). 

Specialty Brands 
 Net sales of INOmax for the three months ended September 27, 2024 (Successor) decreased 8.9 million, or 12.2 , to million driven primarily by continued competition in the U.S. from alternative nitric oxide products, which could continue to adversely affect our ability to successfully maximize the value of INOmax and have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We intend to vigorously enforce our intellectual property rights relating to our nitric oxide products against any additional parties that may seek to market an alternative version of our INOmax product and/or our next generation delivery systems. Following the successful introduction of the INOmax EVOLVE DS device pilot program earlier this year, late in the third quarter 2024, we have expanded the commercial rollout of EVOLVE to U.S. hospitals nationwide. At quarter end, there were 100 devices in nearly a dozen hospitals across the U.S. We are focused on expanding the rollout of EVOLVE to help meet the needs of neonatal intensive care patients and healthcare professionals by offering improved automation, which enhances safety features, and a streamlined design that elevates the user experience.

 Net sales of Acthar Gel for the three months ended September 27, 2024 (Successor) increased 4.3 million, or 3.5 , to million driven primarily by increasing prescriber referrals and patient demand. Additionally, we successfully launched SelfJect on August 5, 2024 with enthusiastic physician and patient feedback, providing patients with an important new option to manage challenging chronic and acute inflammatory and autoimmune conditions, underscoring Mallinckrodt s investment to modernize the brand for patients. 
 Net sales of Terlivaz for the three months ended September 27, 2024 (Successor) increased 2.9 million, or 65.9 , to million. We continued to expand adoption in the third quarter through outreach to healthcare providers emphasizing the importance of early patient identification and treatment initiation. We remain focused on establishing Terlivaz as the preferred first-line treatment for hepatorenal syndrome patients with rapid reduction of kidney function. 

Specialty Generics 
 Net sales from the Specialty Generics segment for the three months ended September 27, 2024 (Successor) increased 8.7 million, or 4.1 , to million driven primarily by an increase in finished-dosage generics net sales of 20.3 million coupled with increased demand for controlled substance APIs, partially offset by a decrease in APAP net sales of 17.4 million driven primarily by softness in the business stemming from excess supply in the broader market. The increase year over year also reflects the launch of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate capsules (generic form of Vyvanse during the three months ended September 29, 2023 (Predecessor). 
 
 The FDA has announced plans to require manufacturers of opioid analgesics dispensed in outpatient settings to make prepaid mail-back envelopes available to dispensing pharmacies as a new drug disposal option for patients. This measure, if and when implemented as announced, would result in increased costs to us, which could negatively impact our results of operations if we are unable to pass such costs to our customers. At this time, we are unable to estimate the potential impact of this measure.

This increase was primarily driven by an increase in finished-dosage generics and increased demand for controlled substance APIs net sales within our Specialty Generics segment, partially offset by decreases in net sales in our APAP business within our Specialty Generics segments, as previously mentioned. For further information on changes in our net sales, refer to Segment Results within this Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Gross profit margin was 43.7 for the three months ended September 27, 2024 (Successor), compared with 30.3 for the three months ended September 29, 2023 (Predecessor). These increases were driven by lower intangible asset amortization expense of 18.0 million for the three months ended September 27, 2024 (Successor), compared with 125.6 million for the three months ended September 29, 2023 (Predecessor), as a result of the decreased intangible assets fair value from the 2023 fresh-start accounting and the classification of Therakos assets as held for sale. The increase in gross profit was also driven by the increase in net sales, as discussed above, as well as a change in product mix. These increases were partially offset by inventory step-up amortization of 83.8 million for the three months ended September 27, 2024 (Successor), compared with 43.6 million for the three months ended September 29, 2023 (Predecessor).

 Selling, general and administrative expenses. SG A expenses for the three months ended September 27, 2024 (Successor) increased 12.0 million, or 9.3 , to 141.2 million, compared with 129.2 million for the three months ended September 29, 2023 (Predecessor). As a percentage of net sales, SG A expenses were 27.9 and 26.0 for the three months ended September 27, 2024 (Successor) and September 29, 2023 (Predecessor), respectively. These increases were primarily driven by incremental compensation costs, inclusive of approximately 7.3 million of A R TrIP expense as described above in more detail under the caption Transaction Incentive Plan , coupled with a 1.1 million increase in the fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities during the three months ended September 27, 2024 (Successor), compared to a 0.2 million decrease during the three months ended September 29, 2023 (Predecessor). 
 Non-restructuring impairment charges. Non-restructuring impairment charges were 135.9 million for the three months ended September 29, 2023 (Predecessor) resulting from the full impairment of our StrataGraft intangible asset of 50.1 million and certain of our Specialty Generics IPR D assets of 85.8 million. 
 Liabilities management and separation costs. Liabilities management and separation costs were 15.2 million and 142.1 million during the three months ended September 27, 2024 (Successor) and September 29, 2023 (Predecessor), respectively. During the three months ended September 27, 2024 (Successor), these costs primarily related to the professional fees and costs incurred as we explored potential sales of non-core assets to enable further deleveraging post-emergence from the 2023 Bankruptcy Proceedings and the Chapter 11 cases in 2022. During the three months ended September 29, 2023 (Predecessor), these costs primarily related to professional fees associated with our evaluation of our financial situation and related discussions with our stakeholders prior to the commencement of the 2023 Chapter 11 Cases. A portion of these costs also related to costs incurred by third parties for which we have agreed to be responsible, including pursuant to the forbearance agreements related to certain of our former debt obligations. 
 
 Non-Operating Items 
 Interest expense and interest income. During the three months ended September 27, 2024 (Successor) and September 29, 2023 (Predecessor), net interest expense was 51.6 million and 129.7 million, respectively. During the three months ended September 27, 2024 (Successor), interest expense included 4.6 million of accretion expense associated with our settlement obligations compared to 22.4 million during the three months ended September 29, 2023 (Predecessor). The decrease in accretion expense associated with our settlement obligations was driven by our elimination of the opioid-related litigation settlement liability during the 2023 Bankruptcy Proceedings. Further reducing our interest expense, net, was 6.1 million of amortization of debt compared to 15.7 million of accretion expense associated with debt during the three months ended September 27, 2024 (Successor) and September 29, 2023 (Predecessor), respectively. The decrease in interest expense was also impacted by a lower average outstanding debt balance during the three months ended September 27, 2024 (Successor) that yielded a decrease in interest expense as compared to the three months ended September 29, 2023 (Predecessor). The increase in our interest income of 4.0 million was primarily driven by interest income of 3.2 million from our interest rate cap agreement. 
 Other (expense) income, net. During the three months ended September 27, 2024 (Successor) and September 29, 2023 (Predecessor), we incurred other expense of 3.8 million and other income of 9.1 million, respectively. The three months ended September 27, 2024 (Successor) included 1.3 million of unrealized losses on equity securities related to our investments in Silence Therapeutics plc and Panbela Therapeutics, Inc, compared to 7.2 million of unrealized gains during the three months ended September 29, 2023 (Predecessor). During the three months ended September 27, 2024 (Successor), we recorded a 1.9 million unrealized net loss related to the changes in the fair value of our derivative assets and liabilities. 
 Reorganization items, net . During the three months ended September 29, 2023 (Predecessor), we recorded 1,311.5 million in reorganization items, net, which included 743.4 million and 377.6 million of non-cash adjustments associated with our settlement obligations and debt, respectively, in order to reflect the estimated allowed claim amount of these liabilities as a result of our 2023 Chapter 11 Cases. Also included was 123.8 million related to a makewhole settlement, 30.0 million related to a backstop premium and 18.5 million of deferred financing fee write-offs, all associated with our former debt obligations in order to reflect the carrying value of the debt instruments at their estimated allowed claim amount. The remaining expense represented professional fees. 
 Income tax expense. We recognized an income tax expense of 7.2 million on a loss from continuing operations before income taxes of 19.0 million for the three months ended September 27, 2024 (Successor). This resulted in an effective tax rate of negative 37.9 . The effective tax rate is lower than the Irish statutory tax rate of 12.5 primarily due to the impact of valuation allowances recorded for current year interest limitations, the mix of pretax earnings in various jurisdictions, and remaining effects of adoption of fresh-start accounting as a result of emergence from the 2023 Bankruptcy Proceedings. 
 We recognized an income tax expense of 10.8 million on a loss from continuing operations before income taxes of 1,714.1 million for the three months ended September 29, 2023 (Predecessor). This resulted in an effective tax rate of negative 0.6 . The effective tax rate is lower than the Irish statutory tax rate of 12.5 primarily due to the impact of the mix of pretax earnings in various jurisdictions.

Gross profit margin was 39.0 for the nine months ended September 27, 2024 (Successor), compared with 21.9 for the nine months ended September 29, 2023 (Predecessor). These increases were driven by lower intangible asset amortization expense of 66.1 million for the nine months ended September 27, 2024 (Successor), compared with 388.1 million for the nine months ended September 29, 2023 (Predecessor), as a result of the decreased intangible assets fair value from the 2023 fresh-start accounting and the classification of Therakos assets as held for sale. The increase in gross profit was also driven by the increase in net sales, as discussed above, as well as a change in product mix. These increases were partially offset by inventory step-up amortization of 296.2 million for the nine months ended September 27, 2024 (Successor), compared with 169.2 million for the nine months ended September 29, 2023 (Predecessor). 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses.

As a percentage of net sales, SG A expenses were 27.3 and 26.5 for the nine months ended September 27, 2024 (Successor) and September 29, 2023 (Predecessor), respectively. These increases were primarily driven by a 3.2 million increase in the fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities during nine months ended September 27, 2024 (Successor), compared to a 7.3 million decrease during the nine months ended September 29, 2023 (Predecessor) coupled with 4.5 million of professional fees incurred subsequent to our emergence from the 2023 Bankruptcy Proceedings during the nine months ended September 27, 2024 (Successor) and incremental compensation costs inclusive of approximately 7.3 million of expense related to the A R TrIP. The increases were partially offset by a recovery of bad debt expense of 6.4 million related to a customer s emergence from bankruptcy. 
 Restructuring charges, net. During the nine months ended September 27, 2024 (Successor), we incurred 10.5 million related to one-time termination benefits and contract termination costs related to the ceased commercialization and clinical development and wind down of production of StrataGraft . During the nine months ended September 29, 2023 (Predecessor), we incurred 0.9 million primarily related to employee severance and related benefits. 
 Non-restructuring impairment charges. Non-restructuring impairment charges were 135.9 million for the nine months ended September 29, 2023 (Predecessor) resulting from the full impairment of our StrataGraft intangible asset of 50.1 million and certain of our Specialty Generics IPR D assets of 85.8 million. 
 Liabilities management and separation costs.

 Interest expense and interest income. During the nine months ended September 27, 2024 (Successor) and September 29, 2023 (Predecessor), net interest expense was 157.3 million and 444.9 million, respectively. During the nine months ended September 27, 2024 (Successor), interest expense included 14.6 million of accretion expense associated with our settlement obligations compared to 112.7 million during the nine months ended September 29, 2023 (Predecessor). The decrease in interest expense was impacted by a lower average outstanding debt balance during the nine months ended September 27, 2024 (Successor) that yielded a decrease in interest expense as compared to the nine months ended September 29, 2023 (Predecessor). The decrease in accretion expense associated with our settlement obligations was driven by our elimination of the opioid-related litigation settlement liability during the 2023 Bankruptcy Proceedings. Further reducing our interest expense, net, was 18.2 million of amortization of debt compared to 64.0 million of accretion expense associated with debt during the nine months ended September 27, 2024 (Successor) and September 29, 2023 (Predecessor), respectively. The increase in our interest income of 7.4 million was primarily driven by interest income of 9.7 million from our interest rate cap agreement. 
 Other expense, net. During the nine months ended September 27, 2024 (Successor) and September 29, 2023 (Predecessor), we incurred other expense of 3.6 million and 6.7 million, respectively. The nine months ended September 27, 2024 (Successor) included 1.4 million of unrealized gains on equity securities related to our investments in Silence Therapeutics plc and Panbela Therapeutics, Inc, compared to 9.1 million of unrealized losses during the nine months ended September 29, 2023 (Predecessor). During the nine months ended September 27, 2024 (Successor), we recorded a 5.9 million unrealized net loss related to the changes in the fair value of our derivative assets and liabilities. 
 Reorganization items, net . During the nine months ended September 29, 2023 (Predecessor), we recorded 1,321.1 million in reorganization items, net, which included 743.4 million and 377.6 million of non-cash adjustments associated with our settlement obligations and debt, respectively, in order to reflect the estimated allowed claim amount of these liabilities as a result of our 2023 Chapter 11 Cases.

The remaining expense represented professional fees. As of December 30, 2023, professional fees directly related to the 2023 Bankruptcy Proceedings that were previously reflected as reorganization items, net, are classified within SG A expenses. 
 Income tax expense. We recognized an income tax expense of 20.4 million on a loss from continuing operations before income taxes of 114.8 million for the nine months ended September 27, 2024 (Successor). This resulted in an effective tax rate of negative 17.8 . The effective tax rate is lower than the Irish statutory tax rate of 12.5 primarily due to the impact of valuation allowances recorded for current year interest limitations, the mix of pretax earnings in various jurisdictions, and remaining effects of adoption of fresh-start accounting as a result of emergence from the 2023 Bankruptcy Proceedings. 
 We recognized an income tax expense of 508.1 million on a loss from continuing operations before income taxes of 2,213.9 million for the nine months ended September 29, 2023 (Predecessor). This resulted in an effective tax rate of negative 23.0 . The effective tax rate is lower than the Irish statutory tax rate of 12.5 primarily due to the impact of valuation allowances recorded on the beginning of the year deferred tax assets as a result of the substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern and the mix of pretax earnings in various jurisdictions. 

Segment Results 
 Management measures and evaluates our operating segments based on segment net sales and operating income. Management excludes corporate expenses from segment operating income. In addition, certain amounts that management considers to be non-recurring or non-operational are excluded from segment operating income because management and the chief operating decision maker evaluate the operating results of the segments excluding such items. These items may include, but are not limited to, depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation, net restructuring charges, non-restructuring impairment charges and liabilities management and separation costs. Although these amounts are excluded from segment operating income, as applicable, they are included in reported consolidated operating loss and are reflected in the reconciliations presented below. Selected information by business segment is as follows:

 (1) The nine months ended September 27, 2024 (Successor) and September 29, 2023 (Predecessor) included inventory fair-value step-up expense of 211.2 million and 147.2 million, respectively. 
 (2) The nine months ended September 27, 2024 (Successor) and September 29, 2023 (Predecessor) included inventory fair-value step-up expense of 85.0 million and 22.0 million, respectively. Additionally, the nine months ended September 27, 2024 (Successor) included 2.5 million of fresh-start inventory-related expense. 
 (3) Includes administration expenses and certain compensation, legal, environmental and other costs not charged to our reportable segments. 
 (4) Represents costs included in SG A, primarily related to professional fees and costs incurred as we explored potential sales of non-core assets to enable further deleveraging post-emergence from the 2023 and 2020 Bankruptcy Proceedings, professional fees incurred by us (including where we are responsible for the fees of third parties, including pursuant to the forbearance agreements related to certain of our former debt obligations) and costs incurred in connection with our evaluation of our financial situation and related discussions with our stakeholders prior to the commencement of the 2023 Chapter 11 Cases. As of the 2023 Petition Date, professional fees directly related to the 2023 Chapter 11 Cases that were previously reflected as liabilities management and separation costs are classified as reorganization items, net. 
 Specialty Brands. Operating income for the nine months ended September 27, 2024 (Successor) decreased 84.4 million, to 97.2 million, compared with 181.6 million for the nine months ended September 29, 2023 (Predecessor). Operating margin decreased to 11.9 for the nine months ended September 27, 2024 (Successor), compared with 22.2 for the nine months ended September 29, 2023 (Predecessor). These decreases in operating income and margin were primarily driven by a 64.0 million increase of inventory step-up expense to 211.2 million for the nine months ended September 27, 2024 (Successor), compared with 147.2 million for the nine months ended September 29, 2023 (Predecessor), resulting in a net decrease in gross profit of 71.1 million. The decrease in operating income also included a 10.5 million increase in SG A expense, primarily driven by compensation costs, and a 2.7 million increase in R D expense. 
 Specialty Generics. Operating income for the nine months ended September 27, 2024 (Successor) increased 20.7 million, to 152.6 million, compared with an operating income of 131.9 million for the nine months ended September 29, 2023 (Predecessor). Operating margin remained consistent at 22.8 for both the nine months ended September 27, 2024 (Successor) and September 29, 2023 (Predecessor). The increases in operating income were primarily driven by a 91.5 million increase in net sales as described above, partially offset by a 63.0 million increase of inventory step-up expense to 85.0 million for the nine months ended September 27, 2024 (Successor), compared with 22.0 million for the nine months ended September 29, 2023 (Predecessor), resulting in a 19.7 million increase to gross profit.

 Corporate and unallocated expenses. Corporate and unallocated expenses for the nine months ended September 27, 2024 (Successor) increased 40.4 million, to 70.1 million, compared with 29.7 million for the nine months ended September 29, 2023 (Predecessor). The increase in corporate and unallocated expense was primarily driven by a 3.2 million increase in the fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities during nine months ended September 27, 2024 (Successor), compared to a 7.3 million decrease during the nine months ended September 29, 2023 (Predecessor) coupled with 4.5 million of professional fees incurred subsequent to our emergence from the 2023 Bankruptcy Proceedings during the nine months ended September 27, 2024 (Successor) and incremental compensation costs inclusive of approximately 7.3 million of expense related to the A R TrIP. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources. 
 Significant factors driving our liquidity position include cash flows generated from operating activities, financing transactions (inclusive of interest on our variable-rate debt instruments), capital expenditures, cash paid in connection with settlement obligations, acquisitions and licensing agreements and cash received as a result of our divestitures. We have historically generated and expect to continue to generate positive cash flows from operations, and we believe that our sources of liquidity are adequate to fund our operations for the next twelve months and the foreseeable future. Our ability to fund our capital needs, including to repay our outstanding indebtedness and meet our settlement obligation, particularly over the long-term, is impacted by our ongoing ability to generate cash from operations and access to capital markets. See the discussion of risks related to our outstanding indebtedness contained in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K under the heading Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and Settlement Obligation. In addition, as further described above, we are exploring a variety of potential divestiture, financing and other transactional opportunities. At the request of some of our holders, we expect to continue to consider whether and when it would be advisable to suspend our reporting obligations under the Exchange Act. 
 As described above, on August 3, 2024, we entered into a definitive agreement with Purchasers under which they will acquire our Therakos business for a base purchase price of 925.0 million, subject to customary adjustments. The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2024, subject to customary closing conditions. We are required to use net proceeds from the transaction to prepay or redeem our first-out takeback term loans, second-out takeback term loans and second-out takeback notes. Such mandatory prepayment or redemption will require us to pay a makewhole premium with the prepaid or redeemed debt, the amount of which will be based on the final net proceeds. As of the filing date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q the debt prepayment, including the makewhole premium, is estimated to be approximately 840.0 million, subject to our finalization of the initial purchase price. Refer to Notes 3 and 11 of the notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information on this agreement and premium, respectively. Also refer to Therakos Divestiture above for further details. 
 Additionally, in accordance with the A R TrIP and subject to the finalization of the purchase price, we currently expect to make payments to participants of approximately 13.6 million within 30 days upon closing of the Therakos divestiture. Similarly, we expect to make additional payments to participants of approximately 16.5 million by the Final Payment Date. Refer to the section Transaction Incentive Plan above for additional information on these bonuses. 
 If the agreement is terminated in connection with the purchasers breach of the agreement or failure to consummate the transaction under certain circumstances, the Purchasers will be required to pay a termination fee of approximately 50.9 million in cash. 
 Pursuant to the plan of reorganization from our Chapter 11 cases from 2022, during the nine months ended September 27, 2024 (Successor), we made a payment of 21.4 million inclusive of interest, related to our Acthar Gel-related settlement, upon the two-year anniversary of the effective date of our emergence from the Chapter 11 cases on June 16, 2022 and will make a payment of 21.3 million, inclusive of interest, upon the three-year anniversary in 2025. 
 We are exposed to interest rate risk on our variable-rate debt. In March 2023, we entered into an interest rate cap agreement. Subsequent to the 2023 Bankruptcy Proceedings, the agreement converts substantially all of our variable-rate debt to a fixed rate through the expiration date of the interest rate cap, which serves to reduce the volatility on future interest expense cash outflows. The interest rate cap agreement has a total notional value of 860.0 million with an upfront premium of 20.0 million and provides us with interest rate protection, through March 26, 2026, to the extent that one-month secured overnight funding rate SOFR exceeds 3.84 . Refer to Note 14 of the notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information.

 A summary of our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities is provided in the following table (dollars in millions) : 
 Successor Predecessor Nine Months Ended September 27, 2024 Nine Months Ended September 29, 2023 Net cash from: 
 Operating activities 
 185.7 (297.7) Investing activities 
 (44.7) (40.8) Financing activities 
 (4.8) 325.5 Effect of currency exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 
 (0.6) (1.7) Net increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 
 135.6 (14.7) 

Operating Activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities of 185.7 million for the nine months ended September 27, 2024 (Successor) was attributable to a net loss of 134.9 million, adjusted for non-cash items of 135.5 million primarily driven by depreciation and amortization of 93.5 million, partially offset with 185.1 million of cash inflow from net changes in working capital. The change in working capital was primarily driven by a 222.1 million inflow related to inventory, of which 296.2 million relates to the fresh-start inventory step-up expense as a result of the fresh-start accounting in 2023, offset by a 21.4 million outflow related to a payment, including interest, to the Department of Justice DOJ and other parties pursuant to the terms of the Acthar Gel-Related Settlement, a 16.5 million increase in accounts receivable, a 5.6 million decrease in accounts payable and a 7.1 million outflow in income taxes primarily driven by an increase in prepaid income taxes. 
 Net cash used in operating activities of 297.7 million for the nine months ended September 29, 2023 (Predecessor) was attributable to a net loss of 2,721.9 million, adjusted for non-cash items of 2,524.7 million, driven by non-cash reorganization items of 1,294.1 million, the valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets of 475.5 million, depreciation and amortization of 423.2 million and accretion on our settlement obligations and debt of 176.7 million, partially offset with 100.5 million of cash outflow from net changes in working capital. The change in working capital was primarily driven by a 250.0 million decrease in the opioid-related litigation settlement, a 63.3 million net cash outflow related to other assets and liabilities, a 31.2 million decrease in accounts payable, and a 23.8 million increase in accounts receivable, partially offset by a 168.7 million inflow in income taxes predominately related to CARES Act income tax refunds of 141.6 million received and a 99.1 million increase in inventory. 

Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities of 44.7 million for the nine months ended September 27, 2024 (Successor) was primarily driven by 71.5 million of capital expenditures, partially offset by cash inflow of 22.6 million from proceeds from debt and equity securities held in rabbi trust. Comparatively, net cash used in investing activities was 40.8 million for the nine months ended September 29, 2023 (Predecessor) and was primarily driven by 41.9 million of capital expenditures. 
 Under our term loan credit agreement and our notes, the proceeds from the sale of assets and businesses must be either reinvested into capital expenditures or business development activities within one year of the respective transaction or we are required to make repayments on our term loans and offer to repurchase certain of our notes. Refer to Therakos Divestiture for further details of the Therakos sale agreement. Additional information regarding this transaction and related agreements is included in Note 3 of the notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and our Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 5, 2024. 

Financing Activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 4.8 million for the nine months ended September 27, 2024 (Successor) and was primarily attributable to debt repayments. Comparatively, net cash provided by financing activities was 325.5 million for the nine months ended September 29, 2023 (Predecessor) and was primarily attributable to proceeds from the issuance of debt of 380.0 million driven by the issuance of 250.0 million from the debtor-in-possession financing coupled with the draw on our receivables financing facility of 130.0 million. This was partially offset by 52.0 million in debt repayments driven by a 30.0 million repayment on our receivables financing facility and 22.0 million repayment on our variable-rate term loans. We also incurred 2.4 million of debt issuance costs associated with our receivables financing facility.

 Guarantees 
 In disposing of assets or businesses, we have from time to time provided representations, warranties and indemnities to cover various risks and liabilities, including unknown damage to the assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities related to periods prior to disposition. We assess the probability of potential liabilities related to such representations, warranties and indemnities and adjust potential liabilities as a result of changes in facts and circumstances. We believe, given the information currently available, that the ultimate resolutions will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The preparation of our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. 
 We believe that our critical accounting estimates are based on, among other things, judgments and assumptions made by management that include inherent risks and uncertainties. During the three and nine months ended September 27, 2024 (Successor), there were no significant changes to these policies or in the underlying accounting assumptions and estimates used in the above critical accounting policies from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, except for those related to share-based compensation and assets and liabilities held for sale described in Note 1 of the notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, in Part I, Item 1, of this report.

Item 3. 
 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 
 Our operations include activities in the U.S. and countries outside of the U.S. These operations expose us to a variety of market risks, including the effects of changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates. We monitor and manage these financial exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program. We do not utilize derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to our variable-rate debt instruments, which bear interest based on SOFR plus margin. As of September 27, 2024 (Successor), our outstanding variable rate debt included 864.9 million on our senior secured term loans. Assuming a one percent increase in the applicable interest rates, in excess of applicable minimum floors, annual interest expense for fiscal 2024 would increase by approximately 8.6 million. However, we mitigate this exposure with our interest rate cap agreement. For additional information on the interest rate cap agreement, refer to Note 14, of the notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 The remaining outstanding debt as of September 27, 2024 (Successor) is fixed-rate debt. Changes in market interest rates generally affect the fair value of fixed-rate debt, but do not impact earnings or cash flows. 
 
 Currency Risk 
 Certain net sales and costs of our international operations are denominated in the local currency of the respective countries. As such, profits from these subsidiaries may be impacted by fluctuations in the value of these local currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. We also have significant intercompany financing arrangements that may result in gains and losses in our results of operations. In an effort to mitigate the impact of currency exchange rate effects we may hedge certain operational and intercompany transactions; however, our hedging strategies may not fully offset gains and losses recognized in our results of operations. 
 The unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations is exposed to currency risk from intercompany financing arrangements, which primarily consist of intercompany debt and intercompany cash pooling, where the denominated currency of the transaction differs from the functional currency of one or more of our subsidiaries. The aggregate potential unfavorable impact from a hypothetical 10.0 adverse change in foreign exchange rates was 3.0 million as of September 27, 2024 (Successor), with all other variables held constant. This hypothetical loss does not reflect any hypothetical benefits that would be derived from hedging activities, including cash holdings in similar foreign currencies, that we have historically utilized to mitigate our exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates.

 Controls and Procedures. 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended the Exchange Act ), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the specified time periods, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO ), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Our management, with the participation of our CEO and CFO, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on that evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that, as of that date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
