 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 Overview 
 Cass Information Systems, Inc. ("Cass" or the "Company") provides payment and information processing services to large manufacturing, distribution, and retail enterprises across the United States. The Company s services include freight invoice rating, payment processing, auditing, and the generation of accounting and transportation information. Cass also processes and pays facility-related invoices, which include electricity and gas as well as waste and telecommunications expenses, and is a provider of telecom expense management solutions. Cass solutions include integrated payments, a B2B payment platform for clients that require an agile fintech partner. Additionally, the Company offers a church management software solution and an on-line platform to provide generosity services for faith-based and non-profit organizations. The Company s bank subsidiary, Cass Commercial Bank (the Bank ), supports the Company s payment operations. The Bank also provides banking services to its target markets, which include privately held businesses in the St. Louis metropolitan area and restaurant franchises and faith-based ministries within the United States. 
 In general, Cass is compensated for its information processing services through service fees, transactional level payment services, and investment of account balances generated during the payment process. Both the number of transactions processed and the dollar volume processed are therefore key metrics followed by management. The Bank earns most of its revenue from net interest income. 
 Various factors will influence the Company s revenue and profitability, such as changes in the general level of interest rates, which has a significant effect on net interest income; industry-wide factors, such as the willingness of large corporations to outsource key business functions, the general level of transportation costs, deregulation of energy costs, and consolidation of telecommunication providers; and economic factors that include the general level of economic activity, the ability to hire and retain qualified staff, and the growth and quality of the Bank s loan portfolio. For a more detailed discussion of the Company s revenue drivers and factors that impact the Company s results of operation and financial condition generally, see Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the Company s 2023 Form 10-K. 
 Recent Industry Developments 
 The transportation industry continues to experience a decline in overall freight rates caused by an ongoing freight recession. The freight recession adversely affects the number of freight transactions and dollar amount of invoices processed. Partially as a result, the Company's transportation invoice and dollar volumes declined 1.5 and 7.3 , respectively during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. Transportation dollar volumes are key to the Company s revenue as higher volumes generally lead to an increase in payment float, which generates interest income, as well as an increase in payments in advance of funding, which generates financial fees. 
 2024 Items of Note 
 Average interest-earning assets for the third quarter of 2024 declined 58.1 million, or 2.8 , as compared to the third quarter of 2023. The Company had fewer funds to invest due to the loss of approximately 100.0 million of balances in February 2024 as a result of a cyber attack experienced by large client. CassPay offers solutions such as integrated payments, a B2B payment platform for clients. The loss of CassPay balances was partially offset by an increase in facility dollar volumes of 13.4 , leading to higher average accounts and drafts payable. 
 Despite the decline in average interest-earning assets during the quarter, the Company s liquidity position and balance sheet remains strong. The Company maintained average short-term investments of 338.5 million during the third quarter of 2024. In addition, all of the Company's investment securities are classified as available-for-sale and there were no outstanding borrowings at September 30, 2024. 
 The Company recorded bad debt expense of 6.6 million and 7.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively on a funding receivable related to a facility client. See Note 7, "Commitments and Contingencies" for further information. 
 
 Also, on July 16, 2024, the Company approved an Amendment providing for the termination of its noncontributory defined-benefit pension plan. The Company expects to record one-time termination expenses of approximately 4.0 million to 6.0 million through operating expense related to the plan termination during the fourth quarter of 2024 as the plan

 liabilities are settled. The successful termination of the plan is expected to reduce run rate operating expense by approximately 1.0 million on an annual basis.

 Fee Revenue and Other Income 
 The Company s fee revenue is derived mainly from transportation and facility processing and financial fees. As the Company provides its processing and payment services, it is compensated by service fees which are typically calculated on a per-item basis, discounts received for services provided to carriers and by the accounts and drafts payable balances generated in the payment process which can be used to generate interest income. Processing volumes, average payments in advance of funding, and fee revenue were as follows:

 Net Interest Income 
 Net interest income is the difference between interest earned on loans, investments, and other earning assets and interest expense on deposits and other interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income is a significant source of the Company s revenues. The following table summarizes the changes in tax-equivalent net interest income and related factors: 
 (In thousands) Third Quarter of Nine Months Ended September 30, 
 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change Average earning assets 2,001,741 2,059,801 (2.8) 2,007,780 2,077,392 (3.4) Average interest-bearing liabilities 630,215 591,567 6.5 633,384 566,987 11.7 Net interest income 17,856 16,805 6.3 50,744 50,300 0.9 Net interest margin 3.55 3.24 3.38 3.24 Yield on earning assets 4.57 4.13 4.42 3.98 Cost of interest-bearing liabilities 3.25 3.11 3.30 2.73 
 Presented on a tax-equivalent basis assuming a tax rate of 21 for both 2024 and 2023. 
 Third quarter of 2024 compared to third quarter of 2023: 
 The increase in net interest income is primarily due to the increase in the net interest margin to 3.55 , as compared to 3.24 in the same quarter last year, partially offset by the decrease in average earning assets of 58.1 million, or 2.8 . The yield on interest-earning assets increased 44 basis points from 4.13 to 4.57 while the cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased 14 basis points from 3.11 to 3.25 . 
 Average loans increased 26.9 million, or 2.6 , to 1.07 billion. The increase in average loans was primarily due to growth in the Company's franchise restaurant and faith-based portfolios. The average yield on loans increased 52 basis points to 5.40 . 
 Average investment securities decreased 112.6 million, or 16.0 , to 590.5 million. The average yield on taxable investment securities increased 26 basis points to 2.88 and the average yield on tax-exempt investment securities increased 18 basis points to 2.81 driven by purchases of investment securities at current market interest rates and maturities and sales of securities at below market interest rates. 
 Average short-term investments, consisting of interest-bearing deposits in other financial institutions and federal funds sold, increased 27.7 million, or 8.9 , to 338.5 million. The increase is primarily a result of the decline in average investment securities, partially offset by a decrease in average funding sources. The average yield on short-term investments decreased 8 basis points to 4.94 , primarily due to the recent decline in the Federal Funds rate of 50 basis points. The majority of these short-term investments are held at the Federal Reserve Bank. 
 The average balance of interest-bearing deposits increased 38.6 million, or 6.5 , to 630.2 million. Average non-interest-bearing demand deposits decreased 76.1 million, or 15.8 , to 404.4 million. The Company has experienced a migration of client funds from non-interest bearing to interest-bearing driven by the higher interest rate environment prior to the recent 50 basis point decline in the Federal Funds rate. The average rate paid on interest-bearing deposits increased 14 basis points to 3.25 . 
 Average accounts and drafts payable decreased 37.0 million, or 3.5 , to 1.03 billion. The decrease in average accounts and drafts payable was primarily reflective of a cyber event at a client during the first quarter of 2024, which decreased average balances by approximately 100.0 million as well as the decrease in transportation dollar volumes of 1.8 , partially offset by an increase in facility dollar volume of 13.4 . 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to nine months ended September 30, 2023: 
 The increase in net interest income is primarily due to the increase in the net interest margin to 3.38 , as compared to 3.24 in the prior year, partially offset by the decrease in average earning assets of 69.6 million, or 3.4 . The yield on 
 -25- 

Table of Contents 

 interest-earning assets increased 44 basis points from 3.98 to 4.42 while the cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased 57 basis points from 2.73 to 3.30 . 
 Average loans decreased 23.0 million, or 2.2 , to 1.04 billion. The decrease in average loans was primarily due to the Company opting to be more selective in booking new loans as a result of a decline in average deposits. The average yield on loans increased 47 basis points to 5.24 . 
 Average investment securities decreased 101.6 million, or 13.6 , to 646.1 million. The average yield on taxable investment securities increased 22 basis points to 2.82 and the average yield on tax-exempt investment securities increased 3 basis points to 2.75 . The increase in the average yield on taxable investment securities was driven by purchases of investment securities at current market interest rates and maturities and sales of securities at below market interest rates. 
 Average short-term investments, consisting of interest-bearing deposits in other financial institutions and federal funds sold, increased 54.9 million, or 20.8 , to 318.7 million. The increase is primarily a result of the decline in average investment securities and loans, partially offset by a decrease in average funding sources. The average yield on short-term investments increased 35 basis points to 4.99 , primarily due to higher average short-term interest rates when comparing the periods. The majority of these short-term investments are held at the Federal Reserve Bank. 
 The average balance of interest-bearing deposits increased 69.4 million, or 12.3 , to 633.4 million. Average non-interest-bearing demand deposits decreased 109.0 million, or 20.6 , to 419.7 million. The Company has experienced a migration of client funds from non-interest bearing to interest-bearing driven by the higher interest rate environment prior to the recent 50 basis point decline in the Federal Funds rate. The average rate paid on interest-bearing deposits increased 58 basis points to 3.30 due to higher average short-term interest rates when comparing the periods. 
 Average accounts and drafts payable decreased 49.4 million, or 4.6 , to 1.02 billion. The decrease in average accounts and drafts payable was primarily reflective of a cyber event experienced by a client during the first quarter of 2024, which decreased average balances approximately 100.0 million as well as the decrease in transportation dollar volumes of 7.3 , partially offset by an increase in facility dollar volumes of 7.7 .

 Provision and Allowance for Credit Losses and Allowance for Unfunded Commitments 
 The Company recorded a release of credit losses and off-balance sheet credit exposures of 140,000 for the third quarter of 2024 and a provision for credit losses of 125,000 in third quarter of 2023. The Company recorded a provision for credit losses and off-balance sheet credit exposures of 355,000 for the nine months ended of September 30, 2024 and a release of credit losses of 335,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The amount of the (release of) provision for credit losses is derived from the Company s quarterly Current Expected Credit Loss CECL model. The amount of the (release of) provision for credit losses will fluctuate as determined by these quarterly analyses. The provision for credit losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was driven by an increase in total loans of 64.1 million, or 6.3 , as compared to December 31, 2023. 
 The Company experienced no loan charge-offs in the third quarters of 2024 and 2023. The ACL was 13.4 million at September 30, 2024 and 13.1 million at December 31, 2023. The ACL represented 1.25 of outstanding loans at September 30, 2024 and 1.29 of outstanding loans at December 31, 2023. The allowance for unfunded commitments was 129,000 at September 30, 2024 and 132,000 at December 31, 2023. There were no nonperforming loans outstanding at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 The ACL has been established and is maintained to estimate the lifetime expected credit losses in the loan portfolio. An ongoing assessment is performed to determine if the balance is adequate. Charges or credits are made to expense based on changes in the economic forecast, qualitative risk factors, loan volume, and individual loans. For loans that are individually evaluated, the Company uses two impairment measurement methods: 1) the present value of expected future cash flows and 2) collateral value. 
 The Company also utilizes ratio analyses to evaluate the overall reasonableness of the ACL compared to its peers and required levels of regulatory capital. Federal and state regulatory agencies review the Company s methodology for maintaining the ACL. These agencies may require the Company to adjust the ACL based on their judgments and interpretations about information available to them at the time of their examinations.

 Third quarter of 2024 compared to third quarter of 2023: 
 Personnel expense increased 231,000, or 0.8 . Salaries and commissions increased 459,000, or 2.0 , primarily as a result of merit increases and 280,000 severance recorded during the third quarter of 2024, partially offset by a decrease in employee profit sharing due to the decline in net income. Share-based compensation decreased 40,000, reflecting the Company's financial performance and the impact on performance-based restricted stock between the periods. 
 Equipment expense increased 318,000, or 17.8 , primarily due to an increase in depreciation expense related to technology initiatives throughout the Company's lines of business. 
 The Company recorded bad debt expense of 6.6 million on a funding receivable related to a facility client. While the Company is in the process of litigation to collect the receivable, a full write-off to bad debt expense was recorded as a result of a credit analysis. 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to nine months ended September 30, 2023: 
 Personnel expense increased 1.2 million, or 1.4 . Salaries and commissions increased 2.5 million, or 3.6 , primarily as a result of merit increases. Share-based compensation decreased 1.2 million, reflecting the Company's financial performance and the impact on performance-based restricted stock between the periods. 
 Equipment expense increased 788,000, or 15.2 , primarily due to an increase in depreciation expense related to technology initiatives throughout the Company's lines of business. 
 The Company recorded bad debt expense of 7.8 million on a funding receivable related to a facility client. While the Company is in the process of litigation to collect the receivable, a full write-off to bad debt expense was recorded as a result of a credit analysis. 
 
 Financial Condition 
 Total assets at September 30, 2024 were 2.26 billion, a decrease of 217.9 million, or 8.8 , from December 31, 2023. 
 The Company experienced a decrease in cash and cash equivalents of 141.9 million, or 38.1 , during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The change in cash and cash equivalents reflects the Company s daily liquidity position and is primarily affected by changes in funding sources, mainly accounts and drafts payable and deposits, cash flows in and out of loans, investments securities and payments in advance of funding. 
 The investment securities portfolio decreased 76.4 million, or 12.2 , during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease is due to sales of 25.0 million and maturities of 130.5 million, partially offset by purchases of 71.1 million. 
 Loans increased 64.1 million, or 6.3 , from December 31, 2023. The Company experienced growth in its franchise restaurant, faith-based and commercial and industrial loan portfolios during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

Table of Contents 

 Payments in advance of funding increased 8.3 million, or 4.2 . from December 31, 2023 due to timing of funding. 
 Accounts and drafts receivable from customers decreased 79.8 million, or 72.1 , from December 31, 2023. The decrease is solely due to timing of customer funding. 
 Total deposits at September 30, 2024 were 1.05 billion, a decrease of 93.5 million, or 8.2 , from December 31, 2023. The decrease is primarily due to timing as well as a migration of non-interest bearing deposits into interest-bearing deposits within the Bank and other alternatives outside the banking system. 
 Accounts and drafts payable at September 30, 2024 were 936.5 million, a decrease of 134.9 million, or 12.6 , from December 31, 2023. The decrease in accounts and drafts payable was primarily reflective of a cyber event at a client during the first quarter of 2024 which decreased average balances approximately 100.0 million. Accounts and drafts payable will fluctuate from period-end to period-end due to the payment processing cycle, which results in lower balances on days when payments clear and higher balances on days when payments are issued. For this reason, average balances are generally a more meaningful measure of accounts and drafts payable. 
 Total liabilities at September 30, 2024 were 2.02 billion, a decrease of 225.7 million, or 10.0 , from December 31, 2023, reflective of the decrease in deposits and accounts and drafts payable. 
 Total shareholders equity at September 30, 2024 was 237.6 million, a 7.8 million increase from December 31, 2023. The increase in shareholders equity is a result of net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 14.6 million, and a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss of 8.4 million primarily related to the fair value of available-for-sale investment securities, partially offset by dividends paid of 12.3 million and the repurchase of Company stock of 3.7 million. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 The discipline of liquidity management as practiced by the Company seeks to ensure that funds are available to fulfill all payment obligations relating to invoices processed as they become due and meet depositor withdrawal requests and borrower credit demands while at the same time maximizing profitability. This is accomplished by balancing changes in demand for funds with changes in supply of funds. Primary liquidity to meet demand is provided by short-term liquid assets that can be converted to cash, maturing securities and the ability to obtain funds from external sources. The Company's Asset/Liability Committee has direct oversight responsibility for the Company's liquidity position and profile. Management considers both on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet items in its evaluation of liquidity. 
 The balance of liquid assets consists of cash and cash equivalents, which include cash and due from banks, interest-bearing deposits in other financial institutions, federal funds sold and money market funds. Cash and cash equivalents totaled 230.6 million at September 30, 2024, a decrease of 141.9 million, or 38.1 , from December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024, these assets represented 10.2 of total assets and are the Company s and its subsidiaries primary source of liquidity to meet future expected and unexpected loan demand, depositor withdrawals or reductions in accounts and drafts payable. 
 Secondary sources of liquidity include the investment portfolio and borrowing lines. Total investment securities were 550.8 million at September 30, 2024, a decrease of 76.4 million from December 31, 2023. These assets represented 24.4 of total assets at September 30, 2024. Of the total portfolio, 6.5 mature in one year, 22.5 mature in one to five years, and 71.0 mature in five or more years . 
 The Bank has unsecured lines of credit at six correspondent banks to purchase federal funds up to a maximum of 83.0 million in aggregate. As of September 30, 2024, the Bank also has secured lines of credit with the Federal Home Loan Bank of 191.0 million collateralized by mortgage loans. The Company also has secured lines of credit from three banks up to a maximum of 250.0 million in aggregate collateralized by investment securities. There were no amounts outstanding under any line of credit as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. 
 The deposits of the Company's banking subsidiary have historically been stable, consisting of a sizable volume of core deposits related to customers that utilize other commercial products of the Bank, including CassPay and faith-based customers. The accounts and drafts payable generated by the Company has also historically been a stable source of funds. The Company is part of the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service CDARS and Insured Cash Sweep ICS deposit placement programs. Time deposits include 52.8 million of CDARS deposits and interest-bearing demand deposits include 150.5 million of ICS deposits. These programs offer the Bank s customers the ability to maximize Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC insurance coverage. The Company uses these programs to retain or attract deposits from existing customers.

 Net cash flows provided by operating activities were 20.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 29.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an decrease of 9.0 million. Net cash flows from investing and financing activities fluctuate greatly as the Company actively manages its investment and loan portfolios and customer activity influences changes in deposit and accounts and drafts payable balances. Other causes for the changes in these account balances are discussed earlier in this report. Due to the daily fluctuations in these account balances, the analysis of changes in average balances, also discussed earlier in this report, can be more indicative of underlying activity than the period-end balances used in the statements of cash flows. Management anticipates that cash and cash equivalents, maturing investments and cash from operations will continue to be sufficient to fund the Company s operations and capital expenditures in 2024, which are estimated to range from 10 million to 12 million. 
 Net income plus amortization of intangible assets, net amortization of premium/discount on investment securities and depreciation of premises and equipment was 21.7 million and 28.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, a decrease of 7.0 million. The nine months ended September 30, 2024 reflected lower net income of 7.1 million and a decrease in net amortization of premium/discount on investment securities of 462,000, partially offset by higher depreciation of 585,000. The net amortization of premium/discount on investment securities is dependent on the type of securities purchased and changes in the prevailing market interest rate environment. Depreciation expense has increased as a result of capital expenditures related to technology initiatives. 
 Other factors impacting the 9.0 million decrease in net cash provided by operating activities include: 
 An increase in accounts receivable of 4.0 million; and 
 A decrease in stock compensation expense of 1.2 million 
 
 These factors were partially offset by a decrease in income tax liability 1.6 million. 
 The Company faces market risk to the extent that its net interest income and fair market value of equity are affected by changes in market interest rates. For information regarding the market risk of the Company s financial instruments, see Item 3, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. 
 There are several trends and uncertainties that may impact the Company s ability to generate revenues and income at the levels that it has in the past. Those that could significantly impact the Company include the general levels of interest rates, business activity, inflation, and energy costs as well as new business opportunities available to the Company. For more detailed information on these trends and uncertainties and how they can generally affect the Company s available liquidity, see Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity in the Company s 2023 Form 10-K. 
 As a bank holding company, the Company and the Bank are subject to capital requirements administered by state and federal banking agencies. Capital adequacy guidelines, and, for banks, prompt correct action regulations, involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items calculated under regulatory accounting practices. Capital amounts and classifications are subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components, risk weighting, and other factors. In addition, the calculation of all types of regulatory capital is subject to deductions and adjustments specified in the regulations. For example, as allowed under the Basel III Capital Rules, the Company has elected to opt-out of the requirement to include most components of accumulated other comprehensive income in common equity Tier 1 capital. For more information on these regulatory requirements, including the Basel III Capital Rules and capital classifications, see Item 1, "Business-Supervision and Regulation" and Item 8, Note 2, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of the Company's 2023 Form 10-K.

Impact of New and Not Yet Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 
 In October 2023, the FASB issued 2023-06, Disclosure Improvements - Codification Amendments in Response to the SEC's Disclosure Update and Simplification Initiative ("ASU 2023-06"). This ASU amends the ASC to incorporate certain disclosure requirements from SEC Release No. 33-10532 - Disclosure Update and Simplification that was issued in 2018. 
 
 The effective date for each amendment will be the date on which the SEC's removal of that related disclosure from Regulation S-X or Regulation S-K becomes effective, with early adoption prohibited. ASU 2023-06 is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company's financial statements. 
 
 In November 2023, the FASB issued 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 820): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures ("ASU 2023-07"). This ASU expands segment disclosure requirements for public entities to require disclosure of significant segment expenses and other segment items on an annual and interim basis and to provide in interim periods all disclosures about a reportable segment's profit or loss and assets that are currently required annually. ASU 2023-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after

 In December 2023, the FASB issued 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures ("ASU 2023-09"). This ASU requires public business entities to disclose in their rate reconciliation table additional categories of information about federal, state, and foreign income taxes and to provide more details about the reconciling items in some categories if items meet a quantitative threshold. It also requires all entities to disclose income taxes paid, net of refunds, disaggregated by federal, state, and foreign taxes for annual periods and to disaggregate the information by jurisdiction based on a quantitative threshold, among other things. ASU 2023-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, though early adoption is permitted. ASU 2023-09 is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company's financial statements. 

Critical Accounting Policies 
 The Company has prepared the consolidated financial statements in this report in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates have been generally accurate in the past, have been consistent and have not required any material changes. There can be no assurances that actual results will not differ from those estimates. The accounting policy that requires significant management estimates and is deemed critical to the Company s results of operations or financial position has been discussed with the Audit and Risk Committee of the Board of Directors and is described below. 
 Allowance for Credit Losses. The Company performs periodic and systematic detailed reviews of its loan portfolio to determine management s estimate of the lifetime expected credit losses. Although these estimates are based on established methodologies for determining allowance requirements, actual results can differ significantly from estimated results. These policies affect both segments of the Company. The impact and associated risks related to these policies on the Company s business operations are discussed in the Provision and Allowance for Credit Losses and Allowance for Unfunded Commitments section of this report. 
 
 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 As described in the Company s 2023 Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company manages its interest rate risk through measurement techniques that include gap analysis and a simulation model. As part of the risk management process, asset/liability management policies are established and monitored by management. 
 The following table summarizes simulated changes in net interest income versus unchanged rates over the next 12 months as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 change in projected net interest income September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 +200 basis points 8.8 14.7 +100 basis points 4.1 6.5 Flat rates -100 basis points 0.4 (3.2) -200 basis points (0.2) (6.0) 
 The Company is generally asset sensitive as average interest-earning assets of 2.00 billion for the third quarter of 2024 greatly exceeded average interest-bearing liabilities of 630.2 million. The table above on the projected impact of interest rate shocks results from a static balance sheet at September 30, 2024. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 The Company s management, under the supervision and with the participation of the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of the end of the period covered by this report and concluded that, as of such date, these controls and procedures were effective.
