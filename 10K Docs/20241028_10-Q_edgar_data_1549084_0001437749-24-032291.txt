. Largely as a result of significant research and development activities related to the development of the Company s advanced technology and commercialization of such technology into its medical device business, the Company has incurred significant operating losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , the Company used of cash in its operations. Cash on hand as of September 30, 2024 was . 
 
 As described in Note 9. Notes Payable, net , borrowings under the Company s secured term loan agreement with Banc of California have a liquidity covenant requiring minimum cash on hand equivalent to the current outstanding principal balance. As of September 30, 2024 , of cash must remain as restricted. After considering cash restrictions, effective unrestricted cash as of September 30, 2024 was approximately . 
 
 Our expectation to generate operating losses and negative operating cash flows in the future and the need for additional funding to support our planned operations raise substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year after the date that the condensed consolidated financial statements are issued. Management intends to raise funds through one or more financings. However, due to several factors, including those outside management s control, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to complete such financings on acceptable terms or in amounts sufficient to continue operating the business under the operating plan. If we are unable to complete sufficient additional financings, management s plans include delaying or abandoning certain product development projects, cost reduction efforts for our products, and refocused sales efforts to accelerate revenue growth above historical results. We have concluded the likelihood that our plan to successfully reduce expenses to align with our available cash, while reasonably possible, is less than probable. Accordingly, we have concluded that substantial doubt exists about our ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from the date of issuance of these condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 
 The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the ordinary course of business. The condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from the outcome of the uncertainties described above.

(the "BoC Term Loan") that bore interest on the outstanding daily balance at a rate equal to the greater of: (a) above the variable rate of interest announced by the Lender as its prime rate then in effect; or (b) . The BoC Loan Agreement created a first priority security interest with respect to substantially all assets of the Company, including proceeds of intellectual property, but expressly excluding intellectual property itself. 
 
 The Company was required to pay accrued interest on the current loan on the 13th day of each month through and including August 13, 2023, at which time the unpaid principal and accrued and unpaid interest was due and payable in full. On August 17, 2023, the Company entered into an amendment to the BoC Loan Agreement, extending the maturity date to August 13, 2026 with interest only payments until such date, having daily borrowings bearing interest at a variable annual rate equal to the greater of the Lender's "prime rate" then in effect and , and caused the Company to maintain all of its depository, operating, and investment accounts with the Lender. The Company determined this amendment constituted a loan modification under ASC 470, and used the updated imputed interest rate to recalculate debt discounts, debt issuance costs and final payment to be amortized over the new term. 
 
 The BoC Loan Agreement contains a liquidity covenant, which requires that the Company maintain cash in accounts of the Lender or subject to control agreements in favor of the Lender in an amount equal to at least the outstanding balance of the BoC Term Loan, which was as of September 30, 2024 . It also contains a primary depository covenant, which restricts the Company from having more than held in subsidiary bank accounts outside of the United States. As of September 30, 2024 , the Company was compliant with all covenants. 
 
 The interest rate of the BoC Term Loan is subject to increase in the event of late payment and after occurrence of and during the continuation of an event of default. The Company may elect to prepay the BoC Term Loan at any time, in whole or in part, without penalty or premium. 
 
 The debt issuance costs and debt discounts combined with the stated interest resulted in an effective interest ra te of and fo r the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Parker Hannifin Promissory Note 
 
 In connection with the HMC Acquisition, on December 5, 2022, the Company delivered a unsecured, subordinated promissory note (the "Promissory Note") to Parker. The Promissory Note, subordinate to the BoC Term Loan, bears interest with principal payable in sixteen equal installments due on the last day of each quarter, which commenced on December 31, 2023 and matures on September 30, 2027. 
 
 The Promissory Note, upon the occurrence of an event of default, allows for the levying of interest equal to the lesser of (a) per annum and (b) the maximum interest rate permitted under applicable law on the then entire outstanding principal balance, and also for the acceleration of all outstanding liabilities and obligations, making them immediately payable. Under the terms of the Promissory Note, the following occurrences constitute a default, and could, upon written notice or declaration by Parker, allow for the levying of interest and or the acceleration of principal outstanding: (i) failure to pay any amount of the principal when due and payable, (ii) the dissolution of the Company (including the declaration of bankruptcy), and (iii) the acquisition of the Company by another entity or the sale of substantially all of its assets to another entity. 
 
 The Company recorded the Promissory Note of in its condensed consolidated balance sheets under the captions Notes Payable, Current and Notes Payable, Net, estimating an implicit discount rate of via reference to the interest charged on the Company's BoC Term Loan and other relevant economic factors present at the execution date of the Promissory Note.

Our marketing to these customers involves the education of clinical and executive stakeholders on the economic and clinical value of our products and services. In tandem, we continue to leverage our EksoNR and Ekso Indego customer base to educate and mentor strategic target centers that specialize in stroke, ABI and SCI rehabilitation in specific geographies. We believe that our Enterprise Health business line will be a source of stable sales growth. 
 
 Our Personal Health business line is focused on marketing and sales of our Ekso Indego Personal product to individual users. These individual users are currently served by the Veterans Administration, which provides our products to qualified veterans for individual use, individuals who are covered under worker s compensation insurance, and private individuals who pay out of pocket. In April 2024, CMS approved a final payment level of 91,031.93 for Medicare reimbursement of the Ekso Indego Personal, which took effect on April 1, 2024. We intend to seek insurance coverage beyond CMS and to seek additional indications of use for our products. We believe that our Personal Health business line has the potential for a higher growth rate than our Enterprise Health business line.

EksoWorks 
 
 Sales of products to able-bodied individuals for use in industrial or work-related use are represented by our EksoWorks segment. Our only active product within our EksoWorks segment is EVO. Our primary end market for our EksoWorks segment is comprised of commercial enterprises that are focused on solving ergonomic challenges for their workers. These challenges include injury prevention, fatigue reduction, and/or improved worker productivity. While EVO is a general-purpose product, we currently target specific vertical markets including aerospace, automotive, general manufacturing, and certain construction trades. 
 
 Economic and Industry Trends 
 Our revenue is highly dependent on market demand for our exoskeleton products. This market demand is influenced by many factors including the level of awareness of robotic exoskeleton rehabilitation among the rehabilitation clinics with significant stroke, ABI, and SCI populations, the imperatives among construction and manufacturing companies to drive adoption of improved safety and health practices, the levels of reimbursements our customers will be able to receive, as well as conditions relating to overall economic growth and general business activity. Difficult and challenging economic conditions, including an increasingly inflationary environment, could lead to increased price-based competition. In particular, the effects of such increasing price-based competition may have an especially significant impact on certain products that we offer, including the EksoNR and Ekso Indego, which have a lengthy sale and purchase order cycle because they are major capital expenditure items and generally require the approval of senior management at purchasing institutions. Furthermore, we do business in the Americas, EMEA and APAC, which results in our business being impacted by demand changes in each of those regions, as well as changes in the strength of the local currencies relative to the U.S. Dollar. With the recent approval of CMS lump sum reimbursement for Indego Personal, we believe we will see increased demand for this device as we are able to more economically serve the larger U.S. patient population suffering from SCI. Specifically, according to the National Spinal Cord Injury Statistical Center, an estimated 305,000 individuals are currently living with SCI and another 18,000 suffer from new SCI injuries each year. Approximately 57 of individuals with SCI are enrolled in Medicare or Medicaid within 5 years post-injury. With Medicare reimbursement recently approved, we have begun selling products to individuals in this market through Durable Medical Equipment suppliers (DMEs). DMEs typically resell products from DME manufacturers to individual users. DMEs are responsible for the Medicare reimbursement process, which requires a physician s prescription and evidence of medical necessity to be submitted to and approved by Medicare before reimbursement is provided. See Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors, specifically the risk titled Coverage policies and reimbursement levels of third-party payers, including Medicare or Medicaid, may impact sales of our products in our Annual Report for more information. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Our estimates form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Our most critical accounting estimates include: 

the standalone selling prices used to allocate the contract consideration to the individual performance obligations in our device sales arrangements, which impacts revenue recognition; 

the unobservable inputs and assumptions used by management in estimating the fair value of our warrant liabilities, which impacts net income or loss; 

the valuation of inventory, which impacts gross profit margins; 

the estimates made regarding the recoverability of our net deferred tax asset, which impacts our financial condition; 

the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in our business combination; 

future warranty costs; 

accounting for leases; and 

useful lives assigned to long-lived assets.

Table of Contents 

Standalone Selling Prices 
 
 Our device sales arrangements contain multiple products and services, most often including the device(s) and service, both of which we have identified as distinct performance obligations. Revenue is allocated to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. Standalone selling prices are based on observable prices at which we separately sell the products or services. If a standalone selling price is not directly observable, then we estimate the standalone selling prices considering market conditions and entity-specific factors including, but not limited to, features and functionality of the products and services, geographies, type of customer, and gross margin targets. Changes in the relative standalone selling price between devices and service can have an impact on how transaction prices are allocated between revenue and deferred revenue. 
 
 Warrant Liabilities 
 
 We use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to value our warrant liabilities at each reporting period, which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, most notably the estimated volatility of our common stock over the expected term. We use our historical common stock volatility to estimate expected volatility over the warrant terms. Changes in these assumptions could have potential material impacts on the estimated fair value of warrant liabilities. 
 
 Inventory Valuation 
 
 Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is computed using the standard cost method which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. The cost basis of our inventory is reduced for any products that are considered excessive or obsolete based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional inventory write-downs may be required, which could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations. 
 
 Deferred Tax Asset 
 
 We estimate a valuation allowance in consideration of the realizability of our net deferred tax assets, primarily based on our assessment of the timing, likelihood and amounts of potential future income during which such items become deductible. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as we must determine the probability of various possible outcomes and estimate future amounts. Management does not believe it is more likely than not that we will generate future income in a timeframe and amount sufficient to realize our net deferred tax assets. Changes in management's estimate of future income in the timeframe during which the temporary differences and carryforwards comprising our deferred tax assets become deductible could result in a material impact to our financial position including the recognition of a net deferred tax asset. 
 
 Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed in Business Combinations 
 
 We allocate the fair value of the purchase price of an acquisition to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. Such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, the amount and timing of projected future cash flows based on expected future growth rates and margins, discount rate used to determine the present value of these cash flows, future changes in technology and royalty for similar brand licenses, and asset lives. Management's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable, and as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. Allocation of purchase consideration to identifiable assets and liabilities affects our amortization expense, as acquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over the useful life, whereas any indefinite-lived intangible assets, including goodwill, are not amortized. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are included in the consolidated statement of operations. 
 
 Future Warranty Costs 
 
 Sales of devices generally include an initial warranty for parts and services for one year in the Americas, two years in EMEA, and one to three years in the APAC region. A liability for the estimated cost of product warranty is established at the time revenue is recognized based on the historical experience of known product failure rates and expected material and labor costs to provide warranty services. Specific additional warranty accruals may be made if unforeseen technical problems arise. Alternatively, if estimates are determined to be greater than the actual amounts necessary, a portion of the liability may be reversed in future periods. At the end of each reporting period, we estimate our future warranty costs related to products sold during the period. This liability represents our best estimate of the costs we will incur to fulfill warranty obligations for products sold during the period. At least annually, we review and update our estimates based on actual warranty claims experience. 
 
 Accounting for Leases 
 
 In accordance with ASC 842, Leases, at the inception of an arrangement, we determine whether the arrangement is or contains a lease based on the unique facts and circumstances present, generally based on whether we have the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of an identified asset and whether we have the right to direct the use of an identified asset in exchange for consideration, which relates to an asset which we do not own. Operating lease liabilities and their corresponding right-of-use assets are recorded based on the present value of lease payments over the expected lease term. The interest rate implicit in lease contracts is typically not readily determinable. As such, we utilize our incremental borrowing rate to determine the present value of the future lease payments, which is a hypothetical rate based on our understanding of what our credit rating would be to borrow and resulting interest we would pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment. Certain adjustments to the right-of-use asset may be required for items, such as initial direct costs paid or incentives received. Lease payments may be fixed or variable; however, only fixed payments are included in our lease liability. Variable lease payments may include costs such as common area maintenance, utilities, or other costs. Variable lease payments are recognized in operating expenses in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred. 
 
 Useful Lives Assigned to Long-Lived Assets 
 
 The useful life of an asset represents the period during which the asset is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to future cash flows. We estimate the useful lives of the Company s long-lived assets based on various factors, including the expected period of economic benefit of the asset in use, our intended use of the asset, economic factors such asset obsolescence and technological advances, any limitations imposed by legal, regulatory, or contractual requirements, and industry norms. These assumptions affect the timing and amount of depreciation expense, which could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations. 
 
 Accounting Policies 

An accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used, or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur, could materially impact the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our critical accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. Refer to Note 2.

Revenue 
 
 Revenue decreased 0.5 million, or 10 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period of 2023. This decrease was comprised of a 0. 3 million de crease in EksoHealth revenue and a 0. 2 million de crease in EksoWorks revenue. 
 
 T he decrease in EksoHealth revenue was primarily driven by a de crease in the volume of Enterprise Health device shipments and lower volume of EksoNR subscriptions, partially offset by an increase in the volume of Personal Health device shipments . The decrease in EksoWorks revenue was primarily driven by a decrease in the volume of EVO shipments. 
 
 Gross Profit and Gross Margin 
 
 Gross profit decreased 0.2 million for th e three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period of 2023, driven by adecrease in sales in the EksoHealth and EksoWorks segments, partially offset by cost savings in supply chain and a reduction in service costs. 
 
 Gross margi n increased to 53.5 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a gross margin of 53.3 for the same period of 2023, primarily driven by cost savings in supply chain and a reduction in service costs, partially offset by lower margin sales related to increased volume through distribution.

Operating Expenses 
 
 Sales and marketing expense s decreased 0. 3 million, or 14 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period of 2023. The decrease was primarily due to lower headcount , discretionary payroll and travel expenses. 
 
 Research and development expenses decreased 0. 4 million, or 33 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period of 2023, prim arily due to a decrease in the Company's use of product development consultants. 
 
 General and administrative expense s in creased 0. 1 million, or 6 , f or the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period of 2023, primarily d ue to higher consultant costs. 
 
 Total Other Income (Expense), Net 
 
 Interest expense, n et increased 23 fo r the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023 . This increase is primarily related to lower interest income from cash deposits , partially offset by lower interest expense related to the Promissory Note principal payments. 
 
 Gain o n revaluation of warrant liabilities wa s de minimis for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared t o a gain on revaluation of warrant liabilities of 0. 1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, and was associated with the revaluation of warrants issued in 2019, 2020 and 2021. Gains and losses on revaluation of warrants are primarily driven by changes in our stock price, stock price volatility, time to maturity and the risk-free interest rate. 
 
 Unrealized gain on foreign exchange for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 0.6 m illion compared to an unrealized loss o n foreign exchange of 0.4 million for the same period of 2023. These unrealized gains and losses are primarily the result of foreign currency revaluations of our inter-company monetary assets and liabilities.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, 8.3 milli on of cash was held domestically and by our foreign subsidiaries. Cash consisted of bank deposits with third-party financial institutions. As described in Note 9 in the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report under the caption Notes Payable, net, borrowings under our secured term loan agreement with Banc of California have a requirement of minimum cash on hand equivalent to the current outstanding principal balance, which is due in full August 2026. As of September 30, 2024, 2.0 million of cash must remain as restricted. After considering cash restrictions, effective unrestricted cash as of September 30, 2024 was approximately 6.3 m illion. 
 
 On September 30, 2024, we had working capital o f 1 3.6 million, compared to working capital of 12.1 million as of December 31, 2023. The increase in working capital was primarily due to a higher accounts receivable balance and a lower accrued liability balance. 
 
 We have funded our operations primarily through the issuance and sale of equity securities and bank debt. 
 
 On September 3, 2024, we sold 3,100,000 shares of common stock, a Pre-Funded Warrant to purchase 2,900,000 shares of common stock, Series A Warrants to purchase an aggregate of 6,000,000 shares of common stock, and Series B Warrants to purchase an aggregate of 6,000,000 shares of common stock in an underwritten public offering (the "September 2024 Offering"), which generated net proceeds of approximately 5.0 million after deducting the underwriting discount and commissions and offering expenses paid by the Company. We are using the net proceeds from the September 2024 Offering for general corporate purposes , which may include growth and expansion of our EksoHealth segment as we work to increase our revenue following the establishment of Medicare CMS reimbursement of the Ekso Indego Personal device, research and development activities, selling, general and administrative costs, and pursuing strategic initiatives, which initiatives may include potential synergistic and accretive acquisitions, as well as meeting our other working capital needs. 
 
 On January 16, 2024, we sold an aggregate of 3.0 million shares of common stock in a registered direct offering (the "January 2024 Offering") at a price of 1.55 per share, which generated net proceeds of approximately 3.9 million after deducting placement agent fees and our estimated offering expenses. 
 
 In October 2020, we entered into an At The Market Offering Agreement (the "ATM Agreement") with H.C. Wainwright Co., LLC (the "Agent"), under which we may issue and sell shares of our common stock, from time to time, to or through the Agent. Offers and sales of shares of common stock by us through the Agent may be made by any method deemed to be an at the market offering as defined under SEC Rule 415 or in privately negotiated transactions, subject to certain conditions. Such shares may be offered pursuant to the registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-272607) (the Registration Statement ), which was declared effective by the SEC on June 20, 2023, and a related prospectus supplement filed with the SEC on July 28, 2023 (the ATM Prospectus ). Pursuant to the Registration Statement and the ATM Prospectus, shares having an aggregate offering price of up to 5.0 million may be offered and sold, subject to certain SEC rules limiting the amount of shares of the Company s common stock that we may sell under the Registration Statement. In June 2023, we entered into an amendment to the ATM Agreement that removed the requirement that shares of our common stock may not be sold for a price lower than 6.75 per share. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we did not sell any shares of common stock under the ATM Agreement. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we sold 105,049 shares of common stock under the ATM Agreement at an average price of 1.43, for aggregate proceeds of 85,073, net of commission and issuance costs. As of September 30, 2024, we had 4.1 million available for future offerings under the prospectus filed with respect to the ATM Agreement.

Net Cash Used in Investing Activities 
 
 Net cash used in investing activities decreased by 0.1 million, or 86 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period of 202 3, primarily due to the reduction in manufacturing equipment purchases. 
 
 Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities 
 
 Net cash provided by financing activities of 8.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was related to net proceeds of 5.0 million from the September 2024 Offering after deducting the underwriting discount and commissions and offering expenses paid by us, net proceeds of 3.9 million from the January 2024 Offering after deducting placement agent fees and offering expenses, proceeds of 0.1 million from shares of common stock sold under the ATM Agreement, partially offset by 0. 9 million of principal payments towards the Promissory Note. 
 
 Material Cash Requirements and Going Concern 
 
 Our material cash requirements include the following items, some of which are represented in the table of Contractual Obligations and Commitments: (1) employee wages, benefits and incentives, (2) the procurement of raw materials and components to support the manufacturing and sale of our products, (3) expenditures for the ongoing improvement and development of existing and new technologies, (4) debt repayments (for additional information see Note 9 in the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q), (5) operating lease payments (for additional information see Note 10 in the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q), and (6) pursuing strategic initiatives. 
 
 We expect that our operating cash requirements in the near term will continue to exceed cash provided by operations with the significant research and development activities related to the development of the Company's advanced technology and commercialization of such technology into its medical device business and with the service of our Promissory Note with Parker Hannifin. As described in Note 1. Organization: Liquidity and Going Concern of the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements, management believes that substantial doubt exists about our ability to meet cash requirements twelve months from the issuance of such financial statements, and such substantial doubt is not alleviated by our plans. 
 
 The Company does not expect, nor do our historical operating results suggest, that cash flows generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our material cash requirements in the long term. Management expects that the Company's historical reliance on external financing, from both equity and debt financings, will continue to provide the capital necessary to meet its material cash requirements in the long term. Management has not yet determined the form such additional financing may take, but management expects that the most likely forms include one or more of the following: (i) underwritten offerings of shares of our common stock or other offerings of equity and/or equity-linked securities, (ii) sales of shares of our common stock under an "at the market" offering program, (iii) incurring indebtedness with one or more financial institutions, (iv) sale of product line or technology, and (v) the factoring of trade receivables.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk 
 
 There have been no material changes in our market risk during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the disclosures in Part II, Item 7A of our Annual Report. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures. 
 
 Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended Exchange Act )) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Based upon that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed by us under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the required time periods and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 It should be noted that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment and makes assumptions about the likelihood of future events. There can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote. Management believes that the financial statements included in this Quarterly Report fairly present in all material respects our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 
 From time to time we are subject to legal proceedings and claims arising in the ordinary course of business. Based on our current knowledge, we believe that the amount or range of reasonably possible losses will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. 
 
 The results of any litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, and an unfavorable resolution in any legal proceedings could materially affect our future business, results of operations, or financial condition. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources, and other factors. For additional information, please refer to Note 14. Commitments and Contingencies and Note 17. Related Party Transactions in the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 We have not identified any material changes to the risk factors previously disclosed in Part I - Item 1A - Risk Factors in our Annual Report other than as set forth below: 
 
 The markets in which our products are sold are highly competitive and continue to develop, and important assumptions about the potential market for our current and future products may be inaccurate. 
 
 We face competition within the medical devices and industrial robotics markets on the basis of product features, clinical outcomes, price, services and other factors. Our competitive position will depend on multiple, complex factors, including our ability to achieve market acceptance for our products, develop new products, implement production and marketing plans, secure regulatory approvals for products under development and protect our intellectual property. Competitors may offer, or may attempt to develop, more efficacious, safer, cheaper, or more convenient alternatives to our products, including alternatives that could make the need for robotic exoskeletons obsolete. The entry into the market of manufacturers located in low-cost manufacturing locations may also create pricing pressure, particularly in developing markets. Our future success depends, among other things, upon our ability to compete effectively against current technology, as well as to respond effectively to technological advances, and upon our ability to successfully implement our marketing strategies and execute our research and development plan. If customers do not perceive our product offerings to be of value or to be easy and comfortable to use, we may not be able to attract and retain customers. If we are unable to successfully retain existing customers and attract new customers and achieve volume sales of our products, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results will be materially and adversely affected. 

Our business strategy is based, in part, on our estimates of the number of individuals with physical limitations and disability and considers the occurrence of strokes, ABIs, SCIs and multiple sclerosis in our target markets, and the percentage of those groups that would be able to use our current and future products. Limited sources exist to obtain reliable market data with respect to the number of mobility-impaired individuals and the incurrence of ABIs, SCIs and strokes in our target markets. In addition, there are no third-party reports or studies regarding what percentage of those with limited mobility and/or SCIs would be able to use exoskeletons, in general, or our current or planned future products, in particular. Our assumptions may be inaccurate and may change. If our estimates of our current or future addressable market are incorrect, our business may not develop as we expect, and the price of our common stock may suffer. 

Furthermore, the markets for medical and industrial robotic exoskeletons are continuing to develop. We cannot be certain that the markets for robotic exoskeletons will continue to develop as we expect, or that robotic exoskeletons for medical or industrial use will achieve widespread market acceptance. Additionally, the development of new or improved products, processes or technologies by other companies may render our products or proposed products less competitive or obsolete. The use of robotic devices is not universally accepted in the rehabilitation community and may never be. Current or future clinical trials and studies may not provide sufficient data that the rehabilitation community interprets to support the use of exoskeletons in rehabilitation. Any of these outcomes could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results and prospects. 
 
 Coverage policies and reimbursement levels of third-party payers, including Medicare or Medicaid, may impact sales of our products. 
 To the extent that the adoption of our products by our customers is dependent in the future on their ability to obtain adequate reimbursement for the products or treatments provided using our product from third-party payers, including government payors such as Medicare and Medicaid, managed care organizations and commercial payors, the coverage policies and reimbursement levels of these third-party payers may impact the decisions of healthcare providers, facilities, or end users to purchase our products or the prices they would be willing to pay for those products. Reimbursement rates could also affect the acceptance rates of new technologies. We have no control over these factors. 
 
 In the United States, the principal decisions about reimbursement for new medical products are typically made by CMS. CMS decides whether and to what extent a new product will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare and private payors tend to follow CMS to a substantial degree. Because there is no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement in the United States, each payor generally determines for its own enrollees or insured patients whether to cover or otherwise establish a policy to reimburse our diagnostic tests, and seeking payor approvals is a time-consuming and costly process. Our business plan within our Personal Health business line depends in a large part on sales of our Ekso Indego Therapy product by individuals with SCI who are covered by Medicare or Medicaid. 
 
 If CMS delays or cancels reimbursement decisions, or materially changes the reimbursement level it has set, our ability to sell into this market may be diminished. In addition, the policies affecting the implementation of individual reimbursement decisions are made by regional DME MACs. Certain policies are not yet known to us and may affect the number of individual purchases that are approved to receive reimbursement in the future. In addition, we may not be able to obtain insurance coverage beyond CMS. We cannot be certain that coverage for our current and our planned future products will be provided in the future by additional payors or that existing agreements, policy decisions or reimbursement levels will remain in place, remain adequate, or be fulfilled under existing terms and provisions. If we cannot obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement from private and governmental payors such as Medicare and Medicaid for our current products or new products that we may develop in the future, demand for such products may decline or may not grow as we expect, which could limit our ability to generate revenue and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. 
 
 The coverage and reimbursement market may be additionally impacted by future legislative changes. There are increasing efforts by governmental and third-party payors in the United States and abroad to cap or reduce healthcare costs which may cause such organizations to limit both coverage and the level of reimbursement for newly approved products and, as a result, they may not cover or provide adequate payment for our products. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. presidential executive orders, Congressional inquiries, and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug and medical device pricing, reduce the cost under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies. We expect to experience pricing pressures in connection with the sale of any of our products due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations, cost containment initiatives and additional legislative changes. 
 
 If we fail to manage the complex and lengthy reimbursement process, our business and operating results could be adversely affected. The sale of products in our Personal Health business line primarily depends on reimbursements provided by third party payors. We distribute these products to end users through the VA hospitals. Our products are also distributed through DME suppliers, who will then pursue reimbursement from Medicare, Medicaid, or private insurance providers. Our financial condition and results of operations may be affected by coverage and reimbursement policies of these payors, which are also subject to change over time. The reimbursement process is complex and can involve lengthy delays between the time that a product is delivered to the consumer and the time that the reimbursement amounts are settled. Depending on the payor, we or our customers may be required to obtain certain payor-specific documentation from physicians and other healthcare providers before submitting claims for reimbursement. Certain payors have filing deadlines and they will not pay claims submitted after such time. We are also subject to extensive pre-payment and post-payment audits by governmental and private payors that could result in material delays, refunds of monies received or denials of claims submitted for payment under such third-party payor programs and contracts. We cannot ensure that we will be able to continue to effectively manage the process which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

We must obtain certain regulatory approvals in the EU, which could be costly and time-consuming and subject us to unanticipated delays or prevent us from marketing certain devices. 

In the EU, we are required to comply with the EU MDR and obtain CE Certificates of Conformity in order to affix the CE Mark and market medical devices. As of September 30, 202
 4, none of our products had yet been approved under the EU MDR. W e are currently in the process of obtaining CE Certificates of Conformity in order to affix the CE Mark to the products we acquired in the HMC Acquisition, including Ekso Indego Therapy and Ekso Indego Personal. Until we complete this process, we will not be able to import these products in the EU. While our application for the CE mark for these products is under regulatory review, we have not received confirmation of a specific date by which this review will be completed. In addition, changes in regulatory policy for the approval or CE marking of a medical device during the period of product development and regulatory agency review or notified body review of each submitted new application may cause delays or rejections. In March 2023, the European Commission extended the original compliance dates for the EU MDR. As a result, the MDR transitional period deadline for our products was set to December 31, 2028. Failure to comply with the EU MDR requirements by the MDR transitional period deadline would prevent us from generating revenue from sales of our products in the EU, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

You may be diluted from future issuances of our equity securities, including in future financings or strategic transactions, from compensatory equity awards and exercises of outstanding warrants, and such issuances, or perception that such issuances may occur, could depress the market price of our common stock. 

Future operating or business decisions may cause dilution to our existing stockholders. For example, we may sell equity securities or issue securities exercisable or convertible into shares of our common stock in connection with strategic transactions or for financing purposes, including under the ATM Agreement or otherwise through registered or unregistered offerings. As of September 30, 2024, we had 4.1 million available for future offerings under the prospectus filed with respect to the ATM Agreement. Furthermore, a substantial majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock are, and all of the shares sold in this offering will be, freely tradable without restriction or further registration under the Securities Act, unless these shares are owned or purchased by affiliates as that term is defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act. We may also make equity grants under one or more employee equity incentive plan or our employee stock purchase plan or issue common stock as matching contributions to our employees under our 401(k) Plan. You may also be subject to dilution from the exercise or settlement of outstanding options or restricted stock units under the Restated 2014 Plan, and from the exercise of our warrants, including the exercise of any pre-funded warrants. In addition, sales or issuances of a substantial number of shares of our common stock, or other equity-related securities in the public markets, or the perception that such sales or issuances could occur, could depress the market price of our common stock.

We may not achieve profitability in the near term or at all, and historically we have not been profitable. Management has historically financed the Company s operations through external financings, from both equity and debt financings, like issuances under our ATM Agreement, the January 2024 Offering, and the September 2024 Offering, for example. To the extent our cash on hand and the proceeds from the September 2024 Offering do not provide sufficient capital for us to achieve profitability, or we are unable to maintain profitability once initially achieved, we expect we will need to raise additional capital through future financings. To the extent we decide to conduct a financing in the future, the form of such financing may include one or more of the following: (i) underwritten offerings of shares of our common stock, (ii) sales of shares of our common stock under an "at the market" offering program, (iii) incurring indebtedness with one or more financial institutions, (iv) sale of product line or technology, and (v) the factoring of trade receivables. Additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all, or we may be required to seek other more costly or time-consuming methods. Any failure to raise capital as and when needed could have a negative impact on our financial condition and on our ability to pursue our business plans and strategies.
