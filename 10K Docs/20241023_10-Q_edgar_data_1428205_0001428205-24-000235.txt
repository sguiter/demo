equity interest in BUCKLER Securities LLC ("BUCKLER"). BUCKLER is a Delaware limited liability company and a FINRA-regulated broker-dealer, controlled by ACM. Refer to the Glossary of Terms for definitions of capitalized terms and abbreviations used in this report. U.S. dollar amounts are presented in thousands, except per share amounts or as otherwise noted. 
 ARMOUR is an externally managed Maryland corporation incorporated in 2008. The Company is managed by ACM, an investment advisor registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), (see Note 9 - Commitments and Contingencies and Note 15 - Related Party Transactions). We have elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust ("REIT") under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). Our qualification as a REIT depends on our ability to meet, on a continuing basis, various complex requirements under the Code relating to, among other things, the sources of our gross income, the composition and values of our assets, our distribution levels and the concentration of ownership of our capital stock. We believe that we are organized in conformity with the requirements for qualification as a REIT under the Code and our manner of operations enables us to meet the requirements for taxation as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. As a REIT, we will generally not be subject to federal income tax on the REIT taxable income that we currently distribute to our stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year and do not qualify for certain statutory relief provisions, we will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates. Even if we qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we may still be subject to some federal, state and local taxes on our income. 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we invested in mortgage backed securities ("MBS"), issued or guaranteed by a United States ("U.S.") Government-sponsored entity ("GSE"), such as the Federal National Mortgage Association ("Fannie Mae"), the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ("Freddie Mac"), or a government agency such as Government National Mortgage Administration ("Ginnie Mae") (collectively, "Agency Securities"). Our Agency Securities consist primarily of fixed rate loans. The remaining are either backed by hybrid adjustable rate or adjustable rate loans. From time to time we have also invested in U.S. Treasury Securities and money market instruments.

dealers who make markets in similar securities. Management reviews pricing used to ensure that current market conditions are properly reflected. This review includes, but is not limited to, comparisons of similar market transactions or alternative third-party pricing services, dealer pricing indications and comparisons to a third-party pricing model. Fair values obtained from the third-party pricing services for similar instruments are classified as Level 2 securities if the inputs to the pricing models used are consistent with the Level 2 definition. If quoted prices for a security are not reasonably available from the third-party pricing service, but dealer pricing indications are, the security will be classified as a Level 2 security. If neither is available, management will determine the fair value based on characteristics of the security that we receive from the issuer and based on available market information and classify it as a Level 3 security. U.S. Treasury Securities are classified as Level 1, as quoted unadjusted prices are available in active markets for identical assets. 
 Derivatives 
 The fair values of our interest rate swap contracts, interest rate swaptions and basis swap contracts are valued using information provided by third-party pricing services that incorporate common market pricing methods that may include current interest rate curves, forward interest rate curves and market spreads to interest rate curves and are classified as Level 2. We estimate the fair value of TBA Agency Securities based on similar methods used to value our Agency Securities and they are classified as Level 2. Management compares the pricing information received to dealer quotes to ensure that the current market conditions are properly reflected. Futures contracts are traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange ("CME") which requires the use of daily mark-to-market collateral and they are classified as Level 1.

The weighted average lives of our investments in securities at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 in the tables above are based upon market factors, assumptions, models and estimates from the third-party model and also incorporate management s judgment and experience.

 (1) The fair value of securities pledged against our repurchase agreements was and at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Our repurchase agreements require that we maintain adequate pledged collateral. A decline in the value of the MBS pledged as collateral for borrowings under repurchase agreements could result in the counterparties demanding additional collateral pledges or liquidation of some of the existing collateral to reduce borrowing levels. We manage this risk by maintaining an adequate balance of available cash and unpledged securities. An event of default or termination event under the standard MRA would give our counterparty the option to terminate all repurchase transactions existing with us and require any amount due to be payable immediately. In addition, certain of our MRAs contain a restriction that prohibits our leverage from exceeding times our stockholders equity as well as termination events in the case of significant reductions in equity capital. We also may receive cash or securities as collateral from our derivative counterparties which we may use as additional collateral for repurchase agreements. Certain interest rate swap contracts provide for cross collateralization and cross default with repurchase agreements and other contracts with the same counterparty.

Amounts paid to stockholders to repurchase stock, before deduction of brokerage commissions and costs, reduces gross equity raised. Dividends specifically designated by the Board as liquidation dividends will reduce the amount of gross equity raised. To date, the Board has not so designated any of the dividends paid by the Company. Realized and unrealized gains and losses do not affect the amount of gross equity raised.

ACM is currently waiving per month of its contractual management fee until ACM provides further notice to ARMOUR. The monthly management fees are not calculated based on the performance of our assets. Accordingly, the payment of our monthly management fees may not decline in the event of a decline in our earnings and may cause us to incur losses. We are also responsible for any costs and expenses that ACM incurs solely on our behalf other than the various overhead expenses specified in the terms of the management agreement. 
 ACM may terminate this waiver by providing notice to ARMOUR on or before the 25th day of the preceding month. This waiver does not constitute a waiver of any other amounts due to ACM from ARMOUR under the management agreement or otherwise, including but not limited to any expense reimbursements, any amounts calculated by reference to the contractual Base Management Fee, or any awards under the 2009 Stock Incentive Plan as amended (the Plan ).

The sole Florida lawsuit was never served on the defendants, and that case was voluntarily dismissed and closed on January 20, 2017. On April 25, 2016, the Maryland court issued an order consolidating the Maryland cases into action, captioned In re JAVELIN Mortgage Investment Corp. Shareholder Litigation (Case No. 24-C-16-001542), and designated counsel for one of the Maryland cases as interim lead co-counsel.

 BUCKLER 
 At September 30, 2024, we held an ownership interest in BUCKLER of , which is included in prepaid and other assets in our consolidated balance sheet and is accounted for using the equity method as BUCKLER maintains specific ownership accounts. Based on our evaluation of certain protective rights and the nature of the on demand subordinated loan agreement, we have determined that we do not have the power to direct the day-to-day activities that most significantly impact BUCKLER's economic performance and additionally do not have the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could be significant to BUCKLER. As a result, we do not have a controlling financial interest, and thus, are not BUCKLER's primary beneficiary and do not consolidate BUCKLER. The value of the investment was at September 30, 2024 and at December 31, 2023, reflecting our total investment plus our share of BUCKLER s operating results, in accordance with the terms of the operating agreement of BUCKLER that our independent directors negotiated. The primary purpose of our investment in BUCKLER is to facilitate our access to repurchase financing on potentially attractive terms (considering rate, term, size, haircut, relationship and funding commitment) compared to other suitable repurchase financing counterparties. 
 Our operating agreement with BUCKLER contains certain provisions to benefit and protect the Company, including (1) sharing in any (a) defined profits realized by BUCKLER from the anticipated financing spreads resulting from repurchase financing facilitated by BUCKLER, and (b) distributions from BUCKLER to its members of net cash receipts, and (2) the realization of anticipated savings from reduced clearing, brokerage, trading and administrative fees. In addition, the independent directors of the Company must approve, in their sole discretion, any third-party business engaged by BUCKLER and may, under certain circumstances, cause BUCKLER to wind up and dissolve and promptly return certain subordinated loans we provide to BUCKLER as regulatory capital (as described more fully below). For each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, we earned from BUCKLER as an allocated share of Financing Gross Profit for a reduction of interest on repurchase agreements charged to the Company. Financing Gross Profit is defined in the operating agreement. 
 Effective March 20, 2023, the Company committed to provide on demand a subordinated loan agreement to BUCKLER in an amount up to . The commitment extends through March 20, 2026, and is collateralized by mortgage backed and/or U.S. Treasury Securities owned by the Company and pledged to BUCKLER. The commitment is treated by BUCKLER currently as capital for regulatory purposes and BUCKLER may pledge the securities to secure its own borrowings. 
 This arrangement replaced the prior subordinated loan, which was to mature on May 1, 2025. In March 2023, BUCKLER, at its option after obtaining regulatory approval, repaid all of the principal amount of the loan. The loan had a stated interest rate of , plus additional interest payable to the Company in an amount equal to the amount of interest earned by BUCKLER on the investment of the loan proceeds, generally in government securities funds. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company earned and of interest on this loan. 
 On February 22, 2021, the Company entered into an uncommitted revolving credit facility and security agreement with BUCKLER. Under the terms of the facility, the Company may, in its sole and absolute discretion, provide drawings to BUCKLER of up to . Interest on drawings is payable monthly at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York SOFR plus per annum. To date, BUCKLER has not yet used the facility and therefore no interest expense was payable for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.

We also repurchased common shares under the current repurchase authorization which cost ), including commissions of approximately , to BUCKLER during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

 ARMOUR Residential REIT, Inc.

ARMOUR owns a 10.8 equity interest in BUCKLER Securities LLC ("BUCKLER"), a Delaware limited liability company and a FINRA-regulated broker-dealer, controlled by ACM and certain executive officers of ARMOUR. Refer to the Glossary of Terms for definitions of capitalized terms and abbreviations used in this report. 
 The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report. All per share amounts, common shares outstanding and stock-based compensation amounts for all periods reflect the effect of our Reverse Stock Split. U.S. dollar amounts are presented in thousands, except per share amounts or as otherwise noted. 
 Overview 
 We are a Maryland corporation managed by ACM, an investment advisor registered with the SEC (see Note 9 and Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements). We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Code. We believe that we are organized in conformity with the requirements for qualification as a REIT under the Code and our manner of operations enables us to meet the requirements for taxation as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. 
 ARMOUR brings private capital into the mortgage markets to support home ownership for a broad and diverse spectrum of Americans. We seek to create stockholder value through thoughtful investment and risk management of a leveraged and diversified portfolio of MBS. We rely on the decades of experience of our management team for (i) MBS securities portfolio analysis and selection, (ii) access to equity capital and repurchase financing on potentially attractive rates and terms, and (iii) hedging and liquidity strategies to moderate interest rate and MBS price risk. We prioritize maintaining common share dividends appropriate for the intermediate term rather than focusing on short-term market fluctuations. 
 
 We are deeply committed to implementing sustainable environmental, responsible social, and prudent governance practices that improve our work and our world. We strive to contribute to a healthy, sustainable environment by utilizing resources efficiently. As an organization, we create a relatively small environmental footprint. Still, we are focused on minimizing the environmental impact of our business where possible. 
 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we invested in MBS, issued or guaranteed by a U.S. GSE, such as Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, or a government agency such as Ginnie Mae (collectively, Agency Securities). Our Agency Securities consist of fixed rate loans. From time to time we have also invested in U.S. Treasury Securities and money market instruments. 
 We earn returns on the spread between the yield on our assets and our costs, including the interest cost of the funds we borrow, after giving effect to our hedges. We identify and acquire MBS, finance our acquisitions with borrowings under a series of short-term repurchase agreements and then hedge certain risks based on our entire portfolio of assets and liabilities and our management s view of the market. 
 Factors that Affect our Results of Operations and Financial Condition 
 Our results of operations and financial condition are affected by various factors, many of which are beyond our control, including, among other things, our net interest income, the market value of our assets and the supply of and demand for such assets. Recent events, such as those discussed below, can affect our business in ways that are difficult to predict and may produce results outside of typical operating variances. Our net interest income varies primarily as a result of changes in interest rates, borrowing costs and prepayment speeds, the behavior of which involves various risks and uncertainties. We currently invest primarily in Agency Securities, for which the principal and interest payments are guaranteed by a GSE or other government agency. From time to time, we also invest in U.S. Treasury Securities and money market instruments subject to certain income tests we must satisfy for our qualification as a REIT. We expect our investments to be subject to risks arising from prepayments resulting from existing home sales, financings, delinquencies and foreclosures. We are exposed to changing mortgage spreads, which could result in declines in the fair value of our 

31 
 ARMOUR Residential REIT, Inc. 
 Management s Discussion and Analysis (continued) 

investments. Our asset selection, financing and hedging strategies are designed to work together to generate current net interest income while moderating our exposure to market volatility. 
 Interest Rates 
 Changes in interest rates, particularly short-term interest rates, may significantly influence our net interest income. With the maturities of our assets, generally of a longer term than those of our liabilities, interest rate increases will tend to decrease our net interest income and the market value of our assets (and therefore our book value). Such rate increases could possibly result in operating losses or adversely affect our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. Our operating results depend, in large part, upon our ability to manage interest rate risks effectively while maintaining our status as a REIT. 
 While we use strategies to economically hedge some of our interest rate risk, we do not hedge all of our exposure to changes in interest rates and prepayment rates, as there are practical limitations on our ability to insulate our securities portfolio from all potential negative consequences associated with changes in short-term interest rates in a manner that will allow us to seek attractive net spreads on our securities portfolio. For GAAP purposes, all changes in the fair value of our derivatives currently flow through earnings. Changes in the fair value of our legacy Agency MBS portfolio, that was designated as available for sale historically, were recognized in other comprehensive income. Therefore, historical earnings reported in accordance with GAAP have fluctuated even in situations where our derivatives were operating as intended. Currently, all of our Agency MBS portfolio is designated as trading securities and changes in the fair values of our derivatives and Agency MBS flow through earnings together. Accordingly, our results of operations will not be subject to the additional fluctuations caused by the previous differences in mark-to-market accounting treatments. Comparisons with companies that use hedge accounting for all or part of their derivative activities may not be meaningful. 
 Prepayment Rates 
 Prepayments on MBS and the underlying mortgage loans may be influenced by changes in market interest rates and a variety of economic and geographic factors, policy decisions by regulators, as well as other factors beyond our control. To the extent we hold MBS acquired at a premium or discount to par, or face value, changes in prepayment rates may impact our anticipated yield. In periods of declining interest rates, prepayments on our MBS will likely increase. If we are unable to reinvest the proceeds of such prepayments at comparable yields, our net interest income may decline. Our operating results depend, in large part, upon our ability to manage prepayment risks effectively while maintaining our status as a REIT. 
 In addition to the use of derivatives to hedge interest rate risk, a variety of other factors relating to our business may also impact our financial condition and operating performance; these factors include: 
 our degree of leverage; 
 our access to funding and borrowing capacity; 
 the REIT requirements under the Code; and 
 the requirements to qualify for an exclusion under the 1940 Act and other regulatory and accounting policies related to our business.

 Market and Interest Rate Trends and the Effect on our Securities Portfolio 
 Federal Reserve Actions 
 On September 18, 2024, the Fed lowered the target range for the Federal Funds Rate by 0.5 to 4.75 to 5.00 , which it had kept unchanged in its previous Federal Open Market Committee meeting on July 31, 2024. The Fed said it had 

32 
 ARMOUR Residential REIT, Inc. 
 Management s Discussion and Analysis (continued) 

gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 and judged that the risks to achieving its employment and inflation goals are roughly in balance. The Fed further stated that in considering additional adjustments to the target range for the Federal Funds Rate, it will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. 
 The Fed said it will continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage backed securities, according to its previously announced plans. The Fed will roll over at auction the amount of principal payments from its holdings of Treasury securities maturing in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of 25 billion per month. The Fed will also reinvest the amount of principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage backed securities received in each calendar month that exceeds a cap of 35 billion per month into Treasury securities. 
 Financial markets will likely be highly sensitive to the Fed s interest rate decisions, its bond purchasing and balance sheet holding decisions, as well as its communication. We intend to continue to mitigate risk and maximize liquidity within the scope of our business plan. The agency mortgage backed securities market remains highly dependent on the future course and timing of the Fed's actions on interest rates as well as its purchases and holdings of our target assets. 
 Developments at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac 
 The payments we receive on the Agency Securities in which we invest depend upon a steady stream of payments by borrowers on the underlying mortgages and the fulfillment of guarantees by GSEs. There can be no assurance that the U.S. Government's intervention in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will continue to be adequate or assured for the longer-term viability of these GSEs. These uncertainties may lead to concerns about the availability of and market for Agency Securities in the long term. Accordingly, if the GSEs defaulted on their guaranteed obligations, suffered losses or ceased to exist, the value of our Agency Securities and our business, operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. 
 Short-term Interest Rates and Funding Costs 
 Changes in Fed policy affect our financial results, since our cost of funds is largely dependent on short-term rates. An increase in our cost of funds without a corresponding increase in interest income earned on our MBS would cause our net income to decline. 
 Below is the Fed's target range for the Fed Funds Rate at each Fed meeting where a change was made since the beginning of 2023. 
 Meeting Date Lower Bound Higher Bound September 18, 2024 4.75 5.00 July 26, 2023 5.25 5.50 May 3, 2023 5.00 5.25 March 22, 2023 4.75 5.00 February 1, 2023 4.50 4.75 
 Our borrowings in the repurchase market have closely tracked the Federal Funds Rate, and SOFR. Traditionally, a lower Federal Funds Rate has indicated a time of increased net interest spread and higher asset values. Volatility in these rates and divergence from the historical relationship among these rates could negatively impact our ability to manage our securities portfolio. If rates were to increase as a result, our net interest spread and the value of our securities portfolio might suffer as a result. Our derivatives are either Federal Funds Rate or SOFR-based interest rate swap contracts (see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements). 

33 
 ARMOUR Residential REIT, Inc. 
 Management s Discussion and Analysis (continued) 

The following graph shows the effective Fed Funds Rate as compared to SOFR on a monthly basis from September 30, 2022 to September 30, 2024. 
 
 Long-term Interest Rates and Mortgage Spreads 
 Our securities are valued at an interest rate spread versus long-term interest rates (mortgage spread). This mortgage spread varies over time and can be above or below long-term averages, depending upon market participants' current desire to own MBS over other investment alternatives. When the mortgage spread gets smaller (or negative) versus long-term interest rates, our book value will be positively affected. When this spread gets larger (or positive), our book value will be negatively affected. 
 Mortgage spreads can vary due to movements in securities valuations, movements in long-term interest rates or a combination of both. We mainly use interest rate swap contracts, interest rate swaptions, basis swap contracts and futures contracts to economically hedge against changes in the valuation of our securities. We do not use such hedging contracts for speculative purposes. 
 We may reduce our mortgage spread exposure by entering in to certain TBA Agency Securities short positions. The TBA short positions may represent different securities and maturities than our MBS and TBA Agency Security long positions, and accordingly, may perform somewhat differently. While we expect our TBA Agency Securities short positions to perform well compared to our related mortgage securities, there can be no assurance as to their relative performance.

 Net income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 reflected gains on our trading securities offset by losses on derivatives. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, total expenses included costs associated with the previously disclosed Special Committee internal investigation. Information about this investigation and the findings are disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, under the heading, Item 9B. Other Information". 
 Net interest income is a function of the size of and yield earned from our investment portfolio and the size of and cost of our repurchase and other financing costs.

The yield on our assets is most significantly affected by the rate of repayments on our Agency Securities. The following graph shows the annualized CPR on a monthly basis for the quarterly periods ended on the dates shown below. 
 
 Other Income (Loss) 
 For the Three Months Ended September 30, For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Other Income (Loss): Realized loss on sale of available for sale Agency Securities (reclassified from Comprehensive Income (Loss)) (7,471) Gain (Loss) on Agency Securities, trading 306,141 (468,280) 55,522 (505,573) Gain (Loss) on U.S. Treasury Securities (21,695) 5,438 8,376 5,517 Gain (Loss) on derivatives, net (209,959) 291,142 (3,829) 350,932 Total Other Income (Loss) 74,487 (171,700) 60,069 (156,595)

 During the first quarter of 2023, we sold the remaining balance of our Available for Sale Securities which resulted in a realized loss of (7,471). 
 Gain (Loss) on Agency Securities, trading, includes mark to market changes in the fair value of our securities as well as the gain (loss) on sales. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the change in fair value of the securities was 306,043 and 155,931 compared to (447,039) and (200,921) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.

 Management s Discussion and Analysis (continued) 

Sales of our Agency Securities, trading resulted in realized gains (losses) of 98 and (100,409) and (21,241) and (304,652) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we sold 484,464 and 4,022,334 of Agency Securities, trading. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 we sold Agency Securities, trading of 244,323 (including 96,490 of receivable for unsettled sales) and 4,157,682, respectively. 
 Gain (Loss) on U.S. Treasury Securities resulted from the change in fair value of the securities as well as the gain (loss) on sales. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the change in fair value of the securities was (21,695) and 5,914 and 2,391 and 7,859, respectively. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we sold short 869,257 of U.S. Treasury Securities resulting in realized gain of 2,462. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we sold short 491,750 and sold (613,852) of U.S. Treasury Securities resulting in a gain (loss) of 3,047 and (2,342), respectively. 
 Gain (Loss) on Derivatives resulted from a combination of the following: 
 Changes in fair value due to interest rate movements. 
 Interest rate swap contracts' net change in notional balance decreased from 6,786,000 at December 31, 2023 to 6,686,000 at September 30, 2024. 
 
 Expenses 
 For the Three Months Ended September 30, For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Expenses: Management fees 9,920 9,719 29,530 28,355 Compensation 1,137 1,262 3,709 3,682 Other operating 1,039 1,732 13,873 5,228 Total Expenses 12,096 12,713 47,112 37,265 Less management fees waived (1,650) (1,650) (4,950) (4,950) Total Expenses after fees waived 10,446 11,063 42,162 32,315 
 The Company is managed by ACM, pursuant to a management agreement. The management fees are determined based on gross equity raised. Therefore, management fees increase when we raise capital and decline when we repurchase previously issued stock and distribute liquidation distributions as approved and so designated by a majority of the Board. However, because the management fee rate decreases to 0.75 per annum for gross equity raised in excess of 1.0 billion pursuant to the management agreement, the effective management fee rate declines as equity is raised. The cost of repurchased stock and any dividends specifically designated by the Board as liquidation distributions will reduce the amount of gross equity raised used to calculate the monthly management fee. Realized and unrealized gains and losses do not affect the amount of gross equity raised. At September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the effective management fee, prior to management fees waived, was 0.92 and 0.93 based on gross equity raised of 4,361,496 and 4,235,238, respectively. During each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 ACM voluntarily waived management fees of 1,650 and 4,950, respectively (see Note 15 - Related Party Transactions). 
 Compensation includes non-executive director compensation as well as the restricted stock units awarded to our Board and executive officers directly or through ACM. The fluctuation from year to year is due to the number of awards vesting.

Other Operating expenses include: 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, other expenses included 9,010 of expenses related to the Special Committee internal investigation in the first quarter of 2024. With the dismissal this quarter of the JAVELIN class action lawsuits, other expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 reflect the reversal of 1,000 of certain costs accrued in prior years. 
 Fees for market and pricing data, analytics and risk management systems and portfolio related data processing costs as well as stock exchange listing fees and similar stockholder related expenses, net of other miscellaneous income. 
 Professional fees for securities clearing, legal, audit and consulting costs that are generally driven by the size and complexity of our securities portfolio, the volume of transactions we execute and the extent of research and due diligence activities we undertake on potential transactions. 
 Insurance premiums for both general business and directors and officers liability coverage fluctuate from year to year due to changes in premiums. 
 Taxable Income 
 As a REIT that regularly distributes all of its taxable income, we are generally not required to pay federal income tax (see Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements). 
 Realized gains and losses on interest rate contracts and treasury futures terminated before their maturity are deferred and amortized over the remainder of the original term of the contract for REIT taxable income. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had approximately (225,758) and (247,349), respectively, of net deductible expense relating to previously terminated interest rate swap and treasury futures/shorts contracts amortizing through the year 2034. At September 30, 2024, we had 257,341 of net operating loss carryforwards available for use indefinitely. For 2024, we forecast that estimated ordinary REIT taxable income will be positive. This would likely result in Series C Preferred Stock dividends for 2024 being treated as fully taxable ordinary income. Common stock dividends for 2024 are expected to partially be treated as taxable ordinary income. 
 Comprehensive Income (Loss) 
 Comprehensive Income (loss) is comprised of net income (loss) and all changes to the statements of stockholders equity, except those due to investments by stockholders, changes in additional paid-in capital and distributions to stockholders (see Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements). 
 Financial Condition 
 Investment In Securities 
 Our securities portfolio consists of Agency Securities backed by fixed rate home loans. Our charter permits us to invest in MBS backed by fixed rate, hybrid adjustable rate and adjustable rate home loans as well as unsecured notes and bonds issued by GSEs, U.S. Treasuries and money market instruments, subject to certain income tests we must satisfy for our qualification as a REIT. Our TBA Agency Securities are reported at net carrying value and are reported in Derivatives, at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets (see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements). 
 Agency Securities: 
 Agency Security purchase and sale transactions, including purchases and sales for forward settlement, are recorded on the trade date to the extent it is probable that we will take or make timely physical delivery of the related securities. Gains or losses realized from the sale of securities are included in income and are determined using the specific identification method. We typically purchase Agency Securities at premium prices. The premium price paid over par value on those assets is expensed as the underlying mortgages experience repayment or prepayment. The lower the prepayment 

39 
 ARMOUR Residential REIT, Inc. 
 Management s Discussion and Analysis (continued) 

rate, the lower the amount of amortization expense for a particular period. Accordingly, the yield on an asset and earnings are higher. If prepayment rates increase, the amount of amortization expense for a particular period will go up. These increased prepayment rates would act to decrease the yield on an asset and would decrease earnings. 
 Our net interest income is primarily a function of the difference between the yield on our assets and the financing (borrowing and hedging) cost of owning those assets. Since we tend to purchase Agency Securities at a premium to par, the main item that can affect the yield on our Agency Securities after they are purchased is the rate at which the mortgage borrowers repay the loan. While the scheduled repayments, which are the principal portion of the homeowners regular monthly payments, are fairly predictable, the unscheduled repayments, which are generally refinancing of the mortgage but can also result from repurchases of delinquent, defaulted, or modified loans, are less so. Being able to accurately estimate and manage these repayment rates is a critical portion of the management of our securities portfolio, not only for estimating current yield but also for considering the rate of reinvestment of those proceeds into new securities, the yields on those new securities and the impact of the repayments on our hedging strategy. 
 TBA Agency Securities: 
 We account for TBA Agency Securities as derivative instruments if it is reasonably possible that we will not take or make physical delivery of the Agency Security upon settlement of the contract. TBA Agency Securities are forward contracts for the purchase long position or sale short position of Agency Securities at a predetermined price, face amount, issuer, coupon and stated maturity on an agreed-upon future date. The specific Agency Securities delivered pursuant to the contract upon the settlement date, published each month by the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, are not known at the time of the transaction. We estimate the fair value of TBA Agency Securities based on similar methods used to value our Agency Securities. TBA Agency Securities are included in the table below on a gross basis, as applicable, since they can be used to establish and finance portfolio positions in Agency Securities. 
 The tables below summarize certain characteristics of our investments in securities at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

 Repurchase Agreements, net 
 We have entered into repurchase agreements to finance the majority of our MBS. Our repurchase agreements are secured by our MBS and bear interest at rates that have moved in close relationship to the Fed Funds Rate and SOFR. We have established borrowing relationships with numerous investment banking firms and other lenders, 16 and 14 of which had open repurchase agreements with us at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. We had outstanding balances under our repurchase agreements, net at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 of 10,186,415 and 9,647,982, respectively, consistent with the increase in our MBS in our securities portfolio. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, BUCKLER accounted for 41.4 and 48.4 , respectively, of our aggregate borrowings and had an amount at risk of 7.3 and 8.1 , respectively, of our total stockholders' equity with a weighted average maturity of 10 days and 12 days, respectively, on repurchase agreements (see Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements). 
 Our repurchase agreements require excess collateral, known as a haircut. At September 30, 2024, the average haircut percentage was 2.95 compared to 2.74 at December 31, 2023. 
 Derivative Instruments 
 We use various contracts to manage our interest rate risk as we deem prudent in light of market conditions and the associated costs with counterparties that have a high quality credit rating and with futures exchanges. We generally pay a fixed rate and receive a floating rate with the objective of fixing a portion of our borrowing costs and hedging the change in our book value to some degree. The floating rate we receive is generally the Fed Funds Rate or SOFR. We had contractual commitments under derivatives at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had derivatives with a net fair value of 673,884 and 872,376, respectively (see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements). 
 At September 30, 2024, we had interest rate swap contracts with an aggregate notional balance of 6,686,000, a weighted average swap rate of 1.42 and a weighted average term of 72 months. At December 31, 2023, we had interest rate swap contracts with an aggregate notional balance of 6,786,000, a weighted average swap rate of 1.37 and a weighted average term of 68 months. We also had TBA Agency Securities with an aggregate notional balance of 300,000 at December 31, 2023. We did not have TBA Agency Securities at September 30, 2024 (see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements).

 Management s Discussion and Analysis (continued) 

The following table details the changes in the fair value of our interest rate swap contracts for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Interest Swap Contracts For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 For the Year Ended December 31, 2023 Net Balance, beginning of period 870,560 983,659 Net interest rate swap contract payments received (163,567) (133,863) Interest rate swap income accrued 312,474 397,468 Interest rate swap expense accrued (131,716) (180,585) Unrealized losses (222,525) (158,584) Loss (gain) on early terminations 7,952 (37,535) Net Balance, end of period 673,178 870,560 
 Our policies do not contain specific requirements as to the percentages or amount of interest rate risk that we are required to hedge. No assurance can be given that our derivatives will have the desired beneficial impact on our results of operations or financial condition. We have not elected cash flow hedge accounting treatment as allowed by GAAP. Since we do not designate our derivative activities as cash flow hedges, realized as well as unrealized gains/losses from these transactions will impact our GAAP earnings. 
 Use of derivative instruments may fail to protect or could adversely affect us because, among other things: 
 available derivatives may not correspond directly with the interest rate risk for which protection is sought (e.g., the difference in interest rate movements for long-term U.S. Treasury Securities compared to Agency Securities); 
 the duration of the derivatives may not match the duration of the related liability; 
 the counterparty to a derivative agreement with us may default on its obligation to pay or not perform under the terms of the agreement and the collateral posted may not be sufficient to protect against any consequent loss; 
 we may lose collateral we have pledged to secure our obligations under a derivative agreement if the associated counterparty becomes insolvent or files for bankruptcy; 
 we may experience a termination event under one or more of our derivative agreements related to our REIT status, equity levels and performance, which could result in a payout to the associated counterparty and a taxable loss to us; 
 the credit-quality of the party owing money on the derivatives may be downgraded to such an extent that it impairs our ability to sell or assign our side of the hedging transaction; and 
 the value of derivatives may be adjusted from time to time in accordance with GAAP to reflect changes in fair value; downward adjustments, or mark-to-market losses, would reduce our net income or increase any net loss. 
 Although we attempt to structure our derivatives to offset the changes in asset prices, the complexity of the actual and expected prepayment characteristics of the underlying mortgages as well as the volatility in mortgage interest rates relative to U.S. Treasury and interest rate swap contract rates makes achieving high levels of offset difficult. We recognized net (losses) gains related to our derivatives of (209,959) and (3,829) and 291,142 and 350,932, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission has adopted rules requiring certain interest rate swap contracts to be cleared through a derivatives clearing organization. We are required to clear certain new interest rate swap contracts. Centrally-cleared interest rate swaps may have higher margin requirements than bilateral interest rate swaps. We have established an account with a futures commission merchant for this purpose. At

September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had 1,325,000 and 1,275,000, respectively, of notional amount of centrally-cleared interest rate swap contracts. 
 We are required to account for our TBA Agency Securities as derivatives when it is reasonably possible that we will not take or make timely physical delivery of the related securities. However, from time to time, we use TBA Agency Securities primarily to effectively establish portfolio positions. See the section, "TBA Agency Securities" above. 
 The following graphs present the notional and weighted average interest rate of our interest rate swap contracts by year of maturity.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 At September 30, 2024, our liquidity totaled 667,427, consisting of 63,855 of cash and cash equivalents plus 603,572 of unencumbered Agency Securities and U.S. government securities (including securities received as reverse margin collateral). Our primary sources of funds are borrowings under repurchase arrangements, monthly principal and interest payments on our MBS and cash generated from our operating results. 
 We generally maintain liquidity to pay down borrowings under repurchase arrangements to reduce borrowing costs and otherwise efficiently manage our long-term investment capital. Because the level of our borrowings can be adjusted on a daily basis, the level of cash and cash equivalents carried on our consolidated balance sheet is significantly less important than our potential liquidity available under our borrowing arrangements. We continue to pursue additional lending counterparties in order to help increase our financial flexibility and ability to withstand periods of contracting liquidity in the credit markets. 
 In addition to the repurchase agreement financing discussed above, from time to time we have entered into reverse repurchase agreements with certain of our repurchase agreement counterparties. Under a typical reverse repurchase agreement, we purchase U.S. Treasury Securities from a borrower in exchange for cash and agree to sell the same securities back in the future. We then sell such U.S. Treasury Securities to third parties and recognize a liability to return the securities to the original borrower. Reverse repurchase agreement receivables and repurchase agreement liabilities are presented net when they meet certain criteria, including being with the same counterparty, being governed by the same MRA, settlement through the same brokerage or clearing account and maturing on the same day. The practical effect of these transactions is to replace a portion of our repurchase agreement financing of our MBS in our securities portfolio with short positions in U.S. Treasury Securities. We believe that this helps to reduce interest rate risk, and therefore counterparty credit and liquidity risk. Both parties to the repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions have the right to make daily margin calls based on changes in the value of the collateral obtained and/or pledged. At September 30, 2024, we had 522,938 469,188 of which were with BUCKLER) and at December 31, 2023 we had 353,937 (all of which were with BUCKLER), in reverse repurchase agreements. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had obligations to return securities received as collateral associated with our reverse repurchase agreements of 522,660 and 350,273, respectively.

 Management s Discussion and Analysis (continued) 

Our primary uses of cash are to purchase MBS, pay interest and principal on our borrowings, fund our operations and pay dividends. From time to time, we purchase or sell assets for forward settlement up to 90 days in the future to lock in purchase prices or sales proceeds. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we financed our securities portfolio with 10,186,415 and 9,647,982 of borrowings under repurchase agreements. We generally seek to borrow (on a recourse basis) between six and ten times the amount of our total stockholders equity. Our debt to equity ratios at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, were 7.74:1 and 7.59:1, respectively, as we substituted Agency MBS for TBA Agency Securities. Our leverage ratios, including notional on our TBA Agency Securities, were 7.74:1 and 7.83:1 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Implied leverage, including TBA Securities and forward settling sales and unsettled purchases was 8.18:1 and 7.96:1 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

Other Contractual Obligations 
 The Company is managed by ACM, pursuant to a management agreement (see Note 9 and Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements). The management agreement runs through December 31, 2029 and is thereafter automatically renewed for an additional five-year term unless terminated under certain circumstances. 
 The following table reconciles the fees incurred in accordance with the management agreement for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 (see Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements). 
 For the Three Months Ended September 30, For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 ARMOUR management fees 9,919 9,704 29,532 28,309 Less management fees waived (1,650) (1,650) (4,950) (4,950) Total management fee expense 8,269 8,054 24,582 23,359 
 We adopted the 2009 Stock Incentive Plan (as amended, the Plan to attract, retain and reward directors and other persons who provide services to us in the course of operations. The Plan authorizes the Board to grant awards including common stock, restricted shares of common stock RSUs ), stock options, performance shares, performance units, stock appreciation rights and other equity and cash-based awards (collectively, Awards ), subject to terms as provided in the Plan. At September 30, 2024, there were 228 shares available for future issuance under the Plan. 
 At September 30, 2024, there was approximately 7,009 of unvested stock based compensation related to the Awards (based on a weighted grant date price of 37.68 per share), which we expect to recognize as an expense as follows: for the remainder of 2024 an expense of 835, in 2025 an expense of 1,986, and thereafter an expense of 4,188. Our policy is to account for forfeitures as they occur. We also pay each of our non-executive Board members quarterly fees, which are payable in cash, common stock, RSUs or a combination of common stock, RSUs and cash at the option of the director. Compensation to be paid to our non-executive Board in the form of cash and common equity is 1,219 annually (see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements). 
 We currently believe that we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources available for the acquisition of additional investments, repayments on repurchase borrowings, reacquisition of securities to be returned to borrowers and the payment of cash dividends as required for continued qualification as a REIT. 
 Repurchase Agreements, net 
 Declines in the value of our Agency Securities portfolio can trigger margin calls by our lenders under our repurchase agreements. An event of default or termination event under the standard MRA would give our counterparty the option to terminate all repurchase transactions existing with us and require any amount due to be payable immediately. 
 Changing capital or other financial market regulatory requirements may cause our lenders to exit the repurchase market, increase financing rates, tighten lending standards or increase the amount of required equity capital or haircut we post, any of which could make it more difficult or costly for us to obtain financing. 
 The following graph represents the outstanding balances of our repurchase agreements (before the effect of netting reverse repurchase agreements), which finance most of our MBS. Our repurchase agreements balance will fluctuate based on our change in capital, leverage targets and the market prices of our assets (including the effects of principal paydowns) and the level and timing of investment and reinvestment activity (see Note 7 and Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements).

 Management s Discussion and Analysis (continued) 

Effects of Margin Requirements, Leverage and Credit Spreads 
 Our MBS have values that fluctuate according to market conditions and, as discussed above, the market value of our MBS will decrease as prevailing interest rates or credit spreads increase. When the value of the securities pledged to secure a repurchase agreement decreases to the point where the positive difference between the collateral value and the loan amount is less than the haircut, our lenders may issue a margin call, which requires us to pay the difference in cash or pledge additional collateral to meet the obligations under our repurchase agreements. Under our repurchase facilities, our lenders have full discretion to determine the value of the MBS we pledge to them. Most of our lenders will value securities based on recent trades in the market. Lenders also issue margin calls as the published current principal balance factors change on the pool of mortgages underlying the securities pledged as collateral when scheduled and unscheduled principal repayments are announced monthly. 
 Forward-Looking Statements Regarding Liquidity 
 Based on our current portfolio, leverage rate and available borrowing arrangements, we believe that our cash flow from operations and our ability to make timely portfolio adjustments will be sufficient to enable us to meet anticipated short-term (one year or less) liquidity requirements such as to fund our investment activities, meet our financing obligations, pay fees under the management agreement and fund our distributions to stockholders and pay general corporate expenses. 
 We may increase our capital resources by obtaining long-term credit facilities or making public or private offerings of equity or debt securities, including classes of preferred stock, common stock and senior or subordinated notes to meet our liquidity requirements. As of the date hereof, we have "at-the-market" offering programs with 3,153 shares of 7.00 Series C Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock available under the Preferred C ATM Sales Agreement and 29,690 shares of common stock remain available under the 2023 Common stock ATM Sales Agreement. In accordance with the terms of these agreements, we may offer and sell shares of stock over a period of time and from time to time, with BUCKLER and other agents as sales agents (see Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements). These liquidity requirements include maturing repurchase agreements, settling TBA Agency Security positions and potentially making net payments on our interest rate swap contracts, and in each case, continuing to meet ongoing margin requirements. Such financing will depend

on market conditions for capital raises and for the investment of any proceeds and there can be no assurances that we will successfully obtain any such financing. 
 Stockholders Equity 
 See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements. 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 Valuation 
 Fair value is based on valuations obtained from third-party pricing services and/or dealer quotes. The third-party pricing services use common market pricing methods that include valuation models which incorporate such factors as coupons, collateral type, bond structure, historical and projected future prepayment speeds, priority of payments, historical and projected future delinquency rates and default severities, spread to the Treasury curve and interest rate swap curves, duration, periodic and life caps and credit enhancement. If the fair value of the MBS is not available from the third-party pricing services or such data appears unreliable, we obtain pricing indications from up to three dealers who make markets in similar MBS. Management reviews pricing used to ensure that current market conditions are properly reflected. This review includes, but is not limited to, comparisons of similar market transactions or alternative third-party pricing services, dealer pricing indications and comparisons to a third-party pricing model. 
 Valuation modeling is required because each individual MBS pool is a separately identified security with individual combinations of characteristics that influence market pricing. While the Agency Security market is generally very active and liquid within the context of broader classes of MBS, any particular security will likely trade infrequently. Our interest rate contracts are bilateral contracts with individual dealers and counterparties and are not cleared through recognized clearing organizations. Valuation models for these positions rely on information from the active and liquid general interest rate swap market to infer the value of these unique positions. 
 From time to time, we challenge the information and valuations we receive from third-party pricing services. Occasionally, the third-party pricing services revise their information or valuations as a result of such challenges. While we have concluded that the fair values reflected in the financial statements are appropriate, there is no way to verify that the particular fair value estimated for any individual position represents the price at which it may actually be bought or sold at any given date. 
 Fair value for our U.S. Treasury Securities is based on obtaining a valuation for each U.S. Treasury Security from third-party pricing services and/or dealer quotes. 
 We update our fair value estimates at the end of each business day to reflect current market dynamics. During times of high market volatility, it can be difficult to obtain accurate market information timely, and accordingly, the confidence interval around our valuation estimates will increase, potentially significantly. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the largest inter-day movement was the overall estimated values of our investment and hedge positions translated to a change in estimated book value of (0.52) per common share. Similarly, 95 of inter-day movements in estimated value translated to changes in estimated book value per share of 0.86 or less. 
 Inflation 
 Virtually all of our assets and liabilities are interest rate-sensitive in nature. As a result, interest rates and other factors influence our performance far more than inflation. Changes in interest rates do not necessarily correlate with inflation rates or changes in inflation rates. Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP and any distributions we may make will be determined by our Board based in part on our REIT taxable income as calculated according to the requirements of the Code; in each case, our activities and balance sheet are measured with reference to fair value without considering inflation.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 ARMOUR Residential REIT, Inc. 

We seek to create stockholder value through thoughtful investment and risk management of a leveraged and diversified portfolio of MBS. While we do not seek to avoid risk completely, we believe the risk can be quantified from historical experience and seek to actively manage that risk, to earn sufficient compensation to justify taking those risks and to maintain capital levels consistent with the risks we undertake. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Our primary market risk is interest rate risk. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary and tax policies, domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond our control. Changes in the general level of interest rates can affect net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income earned on our assets and the interest expense incurred in connection with our liabilities, by affecting the spread between the interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Changes in the level of interest rates also can affect the value of MBS and our ability to realize gains from the sale of these assets. A decline in the value of the MBS pledged as collateral for borrowings under repurchase agreements could result in the counterparties demanding additional collateral pledges or liquidation of some of the existing collateral to reduce borrowing levels. 
 Our borrowings are not subject to similar restrictions and are generally repurchase agreements of limited duration that track the Federal Funds Rate and SOFR and are periodically refinanced at current market rates. Therefore, on average, our cost of funds may rise or fall more quickly than our earnings rate on our assets. Hence, in a period of increasing interest rates, interest rates on our borrowings could increase without limitation, while the changes in the interest rates on our mortgage related assets could be limited. These factors could lower our net interest income or cause a net loss during periods of rising interest rates, which would negatively impact our liquidity, net income and our ability to make distributions to stockholders. 
 We anticipate that in most cases the interest rates, interest rate indices and repricing terms of our mortgage assets and our funding sources will not be identical, thereby creating an interest rate mismatch between assets and liabilities. These indices generally move in the same direction, but there can be no assurance that this will continue to occur. Furthermore, our net income may vary somewhat as the spread between one-month interest rates, the typical term for our repurchase agreements, and the interest rates on our mortgage assets varies. During periods of changing interest rates, such interest rate mismatches could negatively impact our net interest income, dividend yield and the market price of our stock. 
 Another component of interest rate risk is the effect changes in interest rates will have on the market value of our MBS. We face the risk that the market value of our MBS will increase or decrease at different rates than that of our liabilities, including our derivative instruments and obligations to return securities received as collateral. 
 We primarily assess our interest rate risk by estimating the effective duration of our assets and the effective duration of our liabilities and by estimating the time difference between the interest rate adjustment of our assets and the interest rate adjustment of our liabilities. Effective duration essentially measures the market price volatility of financial instruments as interest rates change. We generally estimate effective duration using various financial models and empirical data. Different models and methodologies can produce different effective duration estimates for the same securities. 
 The sensitivity analysis tables presented below reflect the estimated impact of an instantaneous parallel shift in the yield curve, up and down 50 and 100 basis points, on the market value of our interest rate-sensitive investments and net interest income, at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. It assumes that the mortgage spread on our MBS remains constant. Actual interest rate movements over time will likely be different, and such differences may be material. When evaluating the impact of changes in interest rates, prepayment assumptions and principal reinvestment rates are adjusted based on ACM s expectations. Interest rates for interest rate swaps and repurchase agreements are assumed to remain positive. The analysis presented utilized assumptions, models and estimates of ACM based on ACM's judgment and experience.

It is important to note that the impact of changing interest rates on market value and net interest income can change significantly when interest rates change beyond 100 basis points from current levels. Therefore, the volatility in the market value of our assets could increase significantly when interest rates change beyond amounts shown in the tables above. In addition, other factors impact the market value of and net interest income from our interest rate-sensitive investments and derivative instruments, such as the shape of the yield curve, market expectations as to future interest rate changes and other market conditions. Accordingly, interest income would likely differ from that shown above and such difference might be material and adverse to our stockholders. 
 Mortgage Spread Risk 
 Weakness in the mortgage market may adversely affect the performance and market value of our investments. This could negatively impact our book value. Furthermore, if our lenders are unwilling or unable to provide additional financing, we could be forced to sell our MBS at an inopportune time when prices are depressed. 
 The table below quantifies the estimated changes in the fair value of our securities portfolio and in our stockholders' equity as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The estimated impact of changes in spreads is in addition to our interest rate sensitivity presented above. Our securities portfolio's sensitivity to mortgage spread changes will vary with changes in interest rates and in the size and composition of our securities portfolio. Therefore, actual results could differ materially from our estimates.

 Market Risk Disclosures (continued) 

Prepayment Risk 
 As we receive payments of principal on our MBS, premiums paid on such securities are amortized against interest income and discounts are accreted to interest income as realized. Premiums arise when we acquire MBS at prices in excess of the principal balance of the mortgage loans underlying such MBS. Conversely, discounts arise when we acquire MBS at prices below the principal balance, adjusted for expected impairment losses, of the mortgage loans underlying such MBS. Volatility in actual prepayment speeds will create volatility in the amount of premium amortization we recognize. Higher speeds will reduce our interest income and lower speeds will increase our interest income. 
 Credit Risk 
 We have limited our exposure to impairment losses on our securities portfolio of Agency Securities. The payment of principal and interest on the Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae Agency Securities are guaranteed by those respective agencies and the payment of principal and interest on the Agency Securities guaranteed by Ginnie Mae are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac remain in conservatorship of the U.S. Government. There can be no assurances as to how or when the U.S. Government will end these conservatorships or how the future profitability of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and any future credit rating actions may impact the credit risk associated with Agency Securities and, therefore, the value of the Agency Securities. All of our Agency Securities are issued and guaranteed by GSEs or Ginnie Mae. The GSEs have a long term credit rating of AA+. 
 Liquidity Risk 
 Our primary liquidity risk arises from financing long-maturity MBS with short-term debt. The interest rates on our borrowings adjust frequently while the interest rates on our MBS are fixed. Accordingly, in a period of rising interest rates, our borrowing costs will usually increase faster than our interest earnings from MBS. Our repurchase agreements require that we maintain adequate pledged collateral. A decline in the value of the MBS pledged as collateral for borrowings under repurchase agreements could result in the counterparties demanding additional collateral pledges or liquidation of some of the existing collateral to reduce borrowing levels. 
 Operational Risk 
 We rely on our financial, accounting and other data processing systems. Computer malware, viruses, computer hacking and phishing attacks have become more prevalent in our industry and may occur on our systems. Although we have not detected a material cybersecurity breach to date, other financial services institutions have reported material breaches of their systems, some of which have been significant. Even with all reasonable security efforts, not every breach can be prevented or even detected. It is possible that we have experienced an undetected breach. There is no assurance that we, or the third parties that facilitate our business activities, have not or will not experience a breach. It is difficult to determine what, if any, negative impact may directly result from any specific interruption or cyber-attacks or security breaches of our networks or systems (or the networks or systems of third parties that facilitate our business activities) or any failure to maintain performance. 
 ACM has established an Information Technology Steering Committee (the "ITSC") to help mitigate technology risks including cybersecurity. One of the roles of the ITSC is to oversee cyber risk assessments, monitor applicable key risk indicators, review cybersecurity training procedures, oversee the Company s Cybersecurity Policies, including an incident response plan. and engage third parties to conduct periodic penetration testing. Our cybersecurity risk assessment includes an evaluation of cyber risk related to sensitive data held by third parties on their systems. There is no assurance that these efforts will effectively mitigate cybersecurity risk and mitigation efforts are not an assurance that no cybersecurity incidents will occur. 
 In addition, our Audit Committee periodically monitors and oversees our information and cybersecurity risks including reviewing and approving any information and cybersecurity policies, procedures and resources, and reviewing our information and cybersecurity risk assessment, detection, protection, and mitigation systems.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or furnished under the Exchange Act, is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Our CEO and CFO participated in an evaluation by our management of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of our third quarter that ended on September 30, 2024. Based on their participation in that evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024 due to the material weaknesses identified below. 
 Based on this evaluation and an evaluation of the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, we have concluded that we have material weaknesses in each of the following areas: 
 Control Environment 
 We did not maintain an effective control environment based on the criteria established in the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO framework which resulted in deficiencies in principles associated with the control environment. Specifically, these control deficiencies constitute material weaknesses, either individually or in the aggregate, relating to: (i) our commitment to integrity and ethical values; (ii) our Board demonstrating independence from management and exercising oversight of the development and performance of internal control; (iii) establishment, with Board oversight, of structures, reporting lines, and appropriate authorities and responsibilities in the pursuit of objectives; and (iv) demonstration of a commitment to attract, develop, and retain competent individuals in alignment with objectives. 
 Risk Assessment 
 We did not maintain effective risk assessment based on the criteria established in the COSO framework which resulted in deficiencies in principles associated with risk assessment. Specifically, this control deficiency constitutes a material weakness, relating to: considering the potential for fraud in assessing risks to the achievement of objectives. 
 Information and Communication 
 We did not generate and provide quality information and communication based on the criteria established in the COSO framework, which resulted in deficiencies in the principles associated with the information and communication component. Specifically, these control deficiencies constitute material weaknesses, either individually or in the aggregate, relating to: (i) internal communication of information, including objectives and responsibilities for internal control, necessary to support the functioning of internal control and (ii) communicating with external parties regarding matters affecting the functioning of internal control. 
 The following was a contributing factor to the material weaknesses in the control environment, risk assessment and information and communication: 
 Certain members of senior management and the Board did not maintain an appropriate tone at the top. Specifically, certain members of senior management and the Board engaged in inappropriate conduct during the course of the Special Committee internal investigation of issues raised internally at the Company in late January 2024 that did not comport with the Company s culture of compliance and Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, Whistleblower Policy and the 

57 
 ARMOUR Residential REIT, Inc. 
 Market Risk Disclosures (continued) 

Board s Corporate Governance Guidelines. The tone set by these individuals was insufficient to create the proper environment for effective internal control over financial reporting, to ensure compliance with the Company s policies, and to further the Company s commitment to integrity and ethical values. Information about the Special Committee internal investigation and the findings are disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, under the heading, Item 9B. Other Information. 
 After giving full consideration to these material weaknesses, and the additional analyses and other procedures that we performed to ensure that our consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q were prepared in accordance with GAAP, our management has concluded that our consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods disclosed in conformity with GAAP. However, these control deficiencies could have resulted in material misstatements to the quarterly consolidated financial statements that would not have been prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
 Remediation Plan and Status 
 With oversight and input from the Board, management has been continuing to design and implement changes in processes and controls to remediate the material weaknesses and to enhance our internal control over financial reporting as noted below. Management and the Board, including the independent members of the Board, are continuing to work to remediate the material weaknesses identified herein. The Company has completed or made progress on certain remedial actions and expects to take other remedial actions, as described in more detail below. As previously disclosed, the Company has streamlined the Company s senior management structure such that the Company now has a single CEO and Vice Chair - Scott Ulm - following the retirement of Jeffrey Zimmer. Also, as previously disclosed, the Company has entered into an advisory agreement with Mr. Zimmer, which documents Mr. Zimmer s ongoing service to the Company as an ex-officio, non-voting special advisor to the Board, since immediately following his retirement. 
 In addition, the Company has completed or continues to implement the following actions to enhance its internal control over financial reporting and its corporate culture: 
 a. Caused ACM to provide a written reminder to all ACM employees of ACM s and the Company s policies and procedures that address workplace conduct, professionalism and integrity, including procedures for the submission of complaints without retaliation, and the investigatory process. Such notice also reiterated to employees of the need to conduct themselves ethically and professionally and to comply with the Company s policies and laws and regulations, or face disciplinary action; 
 b. Revised the Company s Whistleblower Policy and Code of Business Conduct and Ethics to provide for an independent third-party whistleblower hotline, where complaints can be raised anonymously, without attribution; 
 c. The Company has added a regular review and assessment of tone-at-the-top . The assessment is examined and tested by the internal audit function and includes certifications from senior management to confirm that each senior manager is aware of tone-at-the-top and that such individual has not witnessed any incidents of concern, or, if such an incident has occurred, that it has been dealt with appropriately; 
 d. Engaged an independent, third-party consultant to provide regular (at least annual) training to all management level personnel regarding tone-at-the-top, and best practices to ensure a positive tone-at-the-top, with Board members invited and encouraged to join such sessions. Management and all of the Board members completed this training during the third quarter of 2024; 
 e. Hosted an initial town hall meeting in May 2024, with plans to conduct additional town hall meetings on a regular basis, where all Company and ACM personnel will be provided an opportunity to participate in an open discussion with management and have a forum to raise any issues or concerns.

 Market Risk Disclosures (continued) 

Management believes the foregoing efforts will effectively remediate the material weaknesses described above. However, as the Company continues to evaluate and work to improve its internal control over financial reporting, management may determine to take additional measures to improve controls or determine to modify the remediation plan. The Company is working to remediate the material weaknesses identified above as efficiently and effectively as possible. At this time, the Company cannot provide an estimate of the timing or costs expected to be incurred to remediate such material weaknesses. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 Except for the changes described above, there has been no change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the third quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect its internal control over financial reporting.
