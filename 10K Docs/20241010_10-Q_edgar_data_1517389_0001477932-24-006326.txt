F-7 Table of Contents ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains certain statements that are forward-looking within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Certain statements contained in the MD A are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but rather are based on current expectations, estimates, assumptions and projections about our industry, business and future financial results. Our actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those discussed in other sections of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Our Business Jubilant Flame International, Ltd., (the Company , the Registrant , we , us or our was formed on September 29, 2009 under the name Liberty Vision, Inc.

On July 24, 2013, the Company changed its business sector to the medical sector. On August 18, 2015 the Company changed its name to Jubilant Flame International, Ltd. From the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended February 28, 2018, the Company started to market and sell cosmetics products imported from Asia -Acropass Series products in the United States market. In the beginning of 2020, the Company ceased the marketing and selling of cosmetic products in the United States. From the third quarter of the year ended February 29, 2020, the Company began providing technical support services for development of new nutrition food products to sell to customers in USA. No significant revenue has been generated from this new business line. Results of Operations Revenue We recognized no sales revenue in the three and six months ended August 31, 2024 compared to nil sales revenue in the three and six months ended August 31, 2023. Operating Expenses For the three months ended August 31, 2024 compared to the three months ended August 31, 2023 The major components of our operating expenses for the three months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023 are outlined in the table below: Three Months Ended Three Months Ended Aug 31 Aug 31 2024 2023 Professional fee 6,289 9,388 OTC service expense and others 3,780 3,555 Total operating expenses 10,069 12,943 The 2,874 decrease in our operating costs for the three months ended August 31, 2024 compared to three months ended August 31, 2023, was mainly due to a decrease of 3,099 in professional fee. For the six months ended August 31, 2024 compared to the six months ended August 31, 2023 The major components of our operating expenses for the six months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023 are outlined in the table below: Six Months Ended Six Months Ended Aug 31 Aug 31 2024 2023 Professional fee 24,680 29,677 OTC Filing fees 7,560 7,110 Total operating expenses 32,240 36,787 The 4,547 decrease in our operating costs for the six months ended August 31, 2024 compared to six months ended August 31, 2023, was mainly due to the decrease in professional fee of 4,997. 3 Table of Contents Other Expenses No other expenses incurred during the three months and six months periods ended August 31, 2024 and 2023. Net loss For the three months ended August 31, 2024, we recognized a net loss of 10,069 compared to the net loss of 12,943 for the corresponding period in 2023. For the six months ended August 31, 2024, we recognized a net loss of 32,240 compared to the net loss of 36,787 for the corresponding period in 2023. Liquidity and Capital Resources Working Capital August 31, February 29, 2024 2024 Current Assets 5,035 12,595 Current Liabilities 1,334,188 1,309,508 Working Capital Deficit (1,329,153 (1,296,913 As of August 31, 2024, the Company had current assets of 5,035, primarily comprising of cash of 1,285, prepaid expenses of 3,750 and current liabilities of 1,334,188, resulting in a working capital deficit of 1,329,153. The Company had limited profitable operation activities and has an accumulated deficit of 3,818,184 as of August 31, 2024. This raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis which assumes the Company will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. Based on the Company s current operating plan, the Company does not have sufficient cash and cash equivalents to fund its operations for at least the next twelve months. The Company will need to obtain additional financing to operate our business. The Company may raise additional capital through the sale of its equity securities, through an offering of debt securities, or through borrowings from financial institutions or related parties. By doing so, the Company hopes to generate sufficient capital to execute its business plan in the nutrition product technology support sector on an ongoing basis. Management believes that actions presently being taken to obtain additional funding provide the opportunity for the Company to continue as a going concern. There is no guarantee the Company will be successful in achieving these objectives. 4 Table of Contents Cash Flows from Operating Activities Our net cash used in operating activities decreased by 13,432 in the six months ended August 31, 2024 of 27,855 compared to the net cash used in operating activities in the six months ended August 31, 2023 of 41,287. The decrease in net cash used in operating activities was primarily the result of 8,495 decrease in accrued professional fee. Cash Flows from Investing Activities We did not generate or use any cash from investing activities during the six months ended August 31, 2024 or 2023. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Our cash provided by financing activities decreased from 40,207 for the six months ended August 31, 2023 compared to 27,795 for the six months ended August 31, 2024. In both periods, cash was provided by the way of loans from related parties. Future Financing We anticipate that additional funding will be required in the form of equity financing from the sale of our common stock, through an offering of debt securities, or through borrowings from financial institutions or related parties. However, we cannot provide investors with any assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient funding from the sale of our common stock or through a loan from our directors to meet our obligations over the next twelve months. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements As of August 31, 2024, we did not have any off-balance-sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K. ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required under this item. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.
