Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting
Firm 

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Sidus
Space, Inc. 

Opinion on the Financial Statements 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance
sheets of Sidus Space, Inc. the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes
(collectively referred to as the financial statements). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects,
the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of
the years in the two-year period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America. 

Going Concern 

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared
assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company has continued
significant net losses and negative cash flows from operations. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 2. The financial
statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Basis for Opinion 

These financial statements are the responsibility
of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s financial statements based on our
audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required
to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations
of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards
of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform,
an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audit, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company s internal
control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audit included performing procedures to assess
the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond
to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

Critical Audit Matters 

The critical audit matters communicated below are
matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the
audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially
challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the
financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions
on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. 

Revenue Recognition Refer
to Note 2 to the financial statements 

Description of the Critical Audit Matter 

The Company recognizes revenue upon transfer
of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in
exchange for those products or services. The Company offers various mission critical hardware manufacturing and engineering services,
along with satellite production and other orbital support programs. 

Significant judgment is exercised by the
Company in determining revenue recognition for these customer agreements, and includes the following: 

Determination of whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together. 

The pattern of delivery (i.e., timing of when revenue is recognized) for each distinct performance obligation. 

Identification and treatment of contract terms that may impact the timing and amount of revenue recognized. 

Given these factors, the related audit effort
in evaluating management s judgments in determining revenue recognition for these customer agreements required a high degree of
auditor judgment. 

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed
in the Audit 

Our principal audit procedures related to
the Company s revenue recognition for these customer agreements included the following, among others: 

We evaluated management s significant accounting policies related to these customer agreements for reasonableness. 

We selected a sample of customer agreements and performed the following procedures: 

Obtained and read contract source documents for each selection, including master agreements, and other documents that were part of the agreement. 

Tested management s identification and treatment of contract terms. 

Assessed the terms in the customer agreement and evaluated the appropriateness of management s application of their accounting policies, along with their use of estimates, in the determination of revenue recognition conclusions. 

We tested the mathematical accuracy of management s calculations of revenue and the associated timing of revenue recognized in the financial statements. 

PCAOB ID #05525 

 We have served as the Company s auditor since 2024.

 NOTES
TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 DECEMBER
31, 2023 AND 2022 

of the Company s issued and outstanding shares
of Common Stock (the Reverse Stock Split ). On December 19, 2023, the Company filed with the Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware a certificate of amendment to its certificate of incorporation (the Certificate of Amendment to effect the
Reverse Stock Split. All share and per share information in these financial statements retroactively reflect this reverse stock split. 

million. For the year ended December 31,
2022, the Company had negative cash flow from operating activities of million. The Company plans to fund its cash flow needs
through current cash on hand and future debt and/or equity financing which it may obtain through one or more public or private equity
offerings, debt financings, government or other third-party funding, strategic alliances or collaboration agreements. If the Company is
unable to obtain funding, the Company could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate its projects and services which could adversely affect
its future business prospects and its ability to continue as a going concern. While there are indicators of substantial doubt, the
Company believes that its current available cash on hand plus additional sources of funding, including current customer contracts as well
as the Company s ability to raise additional capital through the Company s issuance of Class A common stock as evidenced by
its public offerings in 2024 and we believe the Company will be sufficiently funded to meet its planned expenditures and to meet the Company s
obligations for at least the one-year period following its consolidated financial statement issuance date. 

For
entities determined to be VIEs, an evaluation is required to determine whether the Company is the primary beneficiary. The Company evaluates
its economic interests in the entity specifically determining if the Company has both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that
most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance the power and the obligation to absorb losses or the right
to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE the benefits ). When making the determination on whether
the benefits received from an entity are significant, the Company considers the total economics of the entity, and analyzes whether the
Company s share of the economics is significant. The Company utilizes qualitative factors, and, where applicable, quantitative
factors, while performing the analysis. 

cash equivalents at December 31, 2023 and 2022. 

Periodically,
the Company may carry cash balances at financial institutions more than the federally insured limit of per institution. The
amount in excess of the FDIC insurance as of December 31, 2023, was . The Company has not experienced losses on these accounts
and management believes, based upon the quality of the financial institutions, that the credit risk with regard to these deposits is
not significant. 

and of the total respectively in FY23 and Bechtel, Teledyne and Mission
Helios make up approx. , , and in FY22. 

The
company will utilize the allowance method based on accounts receivable aging in order to accrue bad debt expense and the contra balance
sheet account, allowance for doubtful accounts. The accounts receivable aging will be reviewed quarterly and necessary adjustments made
to the allowance for doubtful accounts account balance. The Company will review their policy annually to determine if adjustments should
be made based on more recent accounts receivable trends. 

During
the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded bad debt of 
and ,
respectively. The Company s allowance for doubtful accounts balance at December 31, 2023 was and at December
31,2022. 

using the straight-line method. Major additions and improvements are capitalized as additions
to the property and equipment accounts, while replacements, maintenance and repairs that do not improve or extend the life of the respective
assets, are expensed as incurred. Estimated useful lives are periodically reviewed and, when appropriate, changes are made prospectively.
When certain events or changes in operating conditions occur, asset lives may be adjusted and an impairment assessment may be performed
on the recoverability of the carrying amounts. 

Revenue
from the Company is recognized under Topic 606 in a manner that reasonably reflects the delivery of its services and products to customers
in return for expected consideration and includes the following elements: 

executed
 contracts with the Company s customers that it believes are legally enforceable; 

identification
 of performance obligations in the respective contract; 

determination
 of the transaction price for each performance obligation in the respective contract; 

Allocation
 of the transaction price to each performance obligation; and 

recognition
 of revenue only when the Company satisfies each performance obligation. 

These
five elements, as applied to each of the Company s revenue category, is summarized below: 

Revenues
from fixed price contracts that are still in progress at month end are recognized on the percentage-of-completion method, measured by
the percentage of total costs incurred to date to the estimated total costs for each contract. This method is used because management
considers total costs to be the best available measure of progress on these contracts. Revenue from fixed price contracts and time-and-materials
contracts that are completed in the month the work was started are recognized when the work is shipped. To achieve this core principle,
we apply the following five steps: identify the contract with the client, identify the performance obligations in the contract, determine
the transaction price, allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract and recognize revenues when or as the
Company satisfies a performance obligation. 

Revenues
from fixed price service contracts that contain provisions for milestone payments are recognized at the time of the milestone being met
and payment received. This method is used because management considers that the payments are nonrefundable unless the entity fails to
perform as promised. If the customer terminates the contract, the Company is entitled only to retain any progress payments received from
the customer and the Company has no further rights to compensation from the customer. Even though the payments made by the customer are
nonrefundable, the cumulative amount of those payments is not expected, at all times throughout the contract, to at least correspond
to the amount that would be necessary to compensate the Company for performance completed to date. Accordingly, the Company accounts
for the progress under the contract as a performance obligation satisfied at a point in time. To achieve this core principle, we apply
the following five steps: identify the contract with the client, identify the performance obligations in the contract, determine the
transaction price, allocate the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract and recognize revenues when or as the Company
satisfies a performance obligation.

of our revenue calculated as an amount equal to the product of (i) all revenue for the immediately preceding month multiplied by (ii)
the Applicable Revenue Percentage, defined as of revenue for payments due during any month. The Decathlon Note is secured by our assets
and is guaranteed by CTC and matures the earliest of: (i) , (ii) immediately prior to a change of control, or (iii) upon
