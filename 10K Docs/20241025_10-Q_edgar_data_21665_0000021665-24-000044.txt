See Note 9, Contingencies for additional information.

 countries and territories, the Company is routinely subject to a wide variety of legal proceedings. These include disputes relating to intellectual property, contracts, product liability, marketing, advertising, foreign exchange controls, antitrust and trade regulation, as well as labor and employment, pension, data privacy and security, environmental and tax matters and consumer class actions. In addition, management proactively reviews and monitors the Company s exposure to, and the impact of, environmental matters. The Company is party to various environmental matters and, as such, may be responsible for all or a portion of the cleanup, restoration and post-closure monitoring of several sites. 
 
 The Company establishes accruals for loss contingencies when it has determined that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss, or range of loss, can be reasonably estimated. Any such accruals are adjusted thereafter as appropriate to reflect changes in circumstances. 
 
 The Company also determines estimates of reasonably possible losses or ranges of reasonably possible losses in excess of related accrued liabilities, if any, when it has determined that a loss is reasonably possible and it is able to determine such estimates. For those matters disclosed below for which the amount of any potential losses can be reasonably estimated, the Company currently estimates that the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses in excess of any accrued liabilities is to approximately (based on current exchange rates). The estimates included in this amount are based on the Company s analysis of currently available information and, as new information is obtained, these estimates may change. Due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and the unpredictability of outcomes of legal proceedings, any amounts accrued or included in this aggregate range may not represent the ultimate loss to the Company. Thus, the Company s exposure and ultimate losses may be higher or lower, and possibly significantly so, than the amounts accrued or the range disclosed above. 
 
 Based on current knowledge, management does not believe that the ultimate resolution of loss contingencies arising from the matters discussed herein will have a material effect on the Company s consolidated financial position or its ongoing results of operations or cash flows. However, in light of the inherent uncertainties noted above, an adverse outcome in one or more matters could be material to the Company s results of operations or cash flows for any particular quarter or year. 
 
 Brazilian Matters 
 
 There are certain tax and civil proceedings outstanding, as described below, related to the Company s 1995 acquisition of the Kolynos oral care business from Wyeth (the Seller ). 
 
 The Brazilian internal revenue authority has disallowed interest deductions and foreign exchange losses taken by the Company s Brazilian subsidiary for certain years in connection with the financing of the Kolynos acquisition. The tax assessments with interest, penalties and any court-mandated fees, at the current exchange rate, are approximately . This amount includes additional assessments received from the Brazilian internal revenue authority in April 2016 relating to net operating loss carryforwards used by the Company s Brazilian subsidiary to offset taxable income that had also been deducted from the authority s original assessments. The Company has been disputing the disallowances by appealing the assessments since October 2001. 
 
 In each of September 2015, February 2017, September 2018, April 2019 and August 2020, the Company lost an administrative appeal and subsequently challenged these assessments in the Brazilian federal courts. Currently, there are lawsuits pending in the Lower Federal Court and cases have progressed to the Federal Court of Appeals. Although there can be no assurances, management believes, based on the opinion of its Brazilian legal counsel, that the disallowances are without merit and that the Company should ultimately prevail. The Company is challenging these disallowances vigorously. In November 2023, based upon changes in Brazilian tax law, the Company filed petitions in of the actions requesting that the penalty portion of the claim be removed. The Brazilian tax authority agreed with the Company's position and in August 2024 reduced its claim in of those actions and in October 2024 reduced its claim in the third. 
 
 In July 2002, the Brazilian Federal Public Attorney filed a civil action against the federal government of Brazil, Laboratorios Wyeth-Whitehall Ltda. (the Brazilian subsidiary of the Seller) and the Company, as represented by its Brazilian subsidiary, in the 6th. Lower Federal Court in the City of S o Paulo, seeking to annul an April 2000 decision by the Brazilian Board of Tax Appeals that found in favor of the Seller s Brazilian subsidiary on the issue of whether it had

 , at the current exchange rate, based on a claim that certain purchases of U.S. Treasury bills by the subsidiary and their subsequent disposition during the period 2000 to 2001 were subject to a tax on foreign exchange transactions. The Company had been disputing the assessment within the internal revenue authority s administrative appeals process. However, in November 2015, the Superior Chamber of Administrative Tax Appeals denied the Company s final administrative appeal, and the Company has filed a lawsuit in the Brazilian federal court. In the event the Company is unsuccessful in this lawsuit, further appeals are available within the Brazilian federal courts. Although there can be no assurances, management believes, based on the opinion of its Brazilian legal counsel, that the tax assessment is without merit and that the Company should ultimately prevail. The Company is challenging this assessment vigorously. In addition, in April 2024, based upon changes in Brazilian tax law, the Company filed a petition in this matter requesting that the penalty portion of the claim be removed. The Brazilian tax authority has not yet responded to that petition. 
 
 Competition Matter 
 
 Certain of the Company s subsidiaries were historically subject to actions and, in some cases, fines, by governmental authorities in a number of countries related to alleged competition law violations. Substantially all of these matters also involved other consumer goods companies and/or retail customers. The Company s policy is to comply with antitrust and competition laws and, if a violation of any such laws is found, to take appropriate remedial action and to cooperate fully with any related governmental inquiry. The status as of September 30, 2024 of such competition law matters pending against the Company during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is set forth below. 
 
 In July 2014, the Greek competition law authority issued a statement of objections alleging a restriction of parallel imports into Greece. The Company responded to this statement of objections. In July 2017, the Company received the decision from the Greek competition law authority in which the Company was fined . The Company appealed the decision to the Greek courts. In April 2019, the Greek courts affirmed the judgment against the Company s Greek subsidiary, but reduced the fine to and dismissed the case against Colgate-Palmolive Company. The Company s Greek subsidiary and the Greek competition authority appealed the decision to the Greek Supreme Court. 
 
 Talcum Powder Matters 
 
 The Company has been named as a defendant in civil actions alleging that certain of its talcum powder products were contaminated with asbestos and/or caused mesothelioma and other cancers. Many of these actions involve a number of co-defendants from a variety of different industries, including suppliers of asbestos and manufacturers of products that, unlike the Company s products, were designed to contain asbestos. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, there were individual cases pending against the Company in state and federal courts throughout the United States, as compared to cases as of June 30, 2024 and cases as of December 31, 2023. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, new cases were filed, cases were resolved by voluntary dismissal or settlement and case was removed from the case count when it was established that the claim does not relate to talcum powder. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, new cases were filed and cases were resolved by voluntary dismissal, settlement or dismissal by the court, and case was removed from the case count as described in the previous sentence. The value of the settlements in the periods presented was not material, either individually or in the aggregate, to such periods results of operations. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, case resulted in a jury verdict in favor of the Company after a trial. Subsequently, the trial court granted plaintiffs motion for a new trial in that case. However, during the three months ended September 30, 2024, an appellate court granted the Company s request to reinstate the jury s verdict in favor of the Company. Plaintiffs are challenging the ruling of the appellate court.

 in the quarter ended March 31, 2023, which is comprised of the recalculation of benefits and interest. Possible additional charges associated with this matter are expected to be immaterial and, where estimable, are reflected in the range of reasonably possible losses disclosed above. The decision resulted in an increase in the obligations of the Retirement Plan, which based on the current funded status of the Retirement Plan and depending on the asset performance, impact of interest rates for the remainder of the year and further developments in the litigation, may require a cash contribution by the Company in 2025. In June 2023, the Company filed a petition for certiorari to the United States Supreme Court requesting permission for an appeal to that court and that petition was denied in October 2023. Also, in June 2023, the plaintiffs filed a motion to enter a revised final judgment in the District Court to address certain unresolved calculation issues, which the Company opposed. In March 2024, the District Court granted the plaintiffs motion and found for the plaintiffs on those calculation issues. The Company is appealing that decision to the Second Circuit.

 product segments: Oral, Personal and Home Care; and Pet Nutrition. 
 
 The operations of the Oral, Personal and Home Care product segment are managed geographically in reportable operating segments: North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia Pacific and Africa/Eurasia. 
 
 In connection with management changes, the Company realigned the reporting structure of its skin health business effective July 1, 2024. Accordingly, commencing with the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the results of the skin health business previously reported within the Europe reportable operating segment are reported with the other skin health businesses in the North America reportable operating segment, with no impact on the Company's consolidated results of operations or financial position. The Company has recast its historical geographic segment information to conform to the new reporting structure. 
 
 As a result of this reporting structure realignment, the Company reallocated the goodwill of its skin health business (approximately from the Europe segment to the North America segment. In conjunction with this reporting structure realignment, the Company completed an assessment indicating no goodwill impairment existed as a result of this new segment reporting structure. 
 
 The Company evaluates segment performance based on several factors, including Operating profit. The Company uses Operating profit as a measure of operating segment performance because it excludes the impact of Corporate-driven decisions related to interest expense and income taxes. 
 
 The accounting policies of the operating segments are generally the same as those described in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

 for the third quarter of 2024 as compared to for the third quarter of 2023. The quarterly provision for income taxes is determined based on the Company s estimated full year effective income tax rate adjusted by the amount of tax attributable to infrequent or unusual items that are separately recognized on a discrete basis in the income tax provision in the quarter in which they occur. The Company s current estimate of its full year effective income tax rate before discrete period items is , flat with the comparable period of 2023. 
 
 In the third quarter of 2023, the Internal Revenue Service (the IRS issued a notice giving taxpayers temporary relief from the effects of certain U.S. tax regulations that were issued in December 2021, which place greater restrictions on foreign taxes that are creditable against U.S. taxes on foreign-source income. This notice allowed taxpayers to defer the application of these new regulations through the end of 2023. In December 2023, the IRS issued further guidance modifying this temporary relief period to the date that a notice or other guidance withdrawing or modifying the temporary relief is issued. The Company will recognize the impact, if any, in the period in which the temporary relief is withdrawn or modified. 
 
 The Company has ongoing federal, state and international income tax audits in various jurisdictions and evaluates uncertain tax positions that may be challenged by local tax authorities and not fully sustained. All U.S. federal income tax returns through December 31, 2013 have been audited by the IRS and there are limited matters which the Company plans to appeal for years 2010 through 2013. One such matter relates to the IRS assessment of taxes on the Company by imputing income on certain activities within one of our international operations, which is also under audit for the years 2014 through 2018. There were U.S. Tax Court rulings during 2023 in favor of the IRS against unrelated third parties on similar matters. Despite the U.S. Tax Court rulings, the Company continues to believe that the tax assessment against the Company is without merit. While there can be no assurances, the Company believes this matter will ultimately be decided in favor of the Company. The amount of tax plus interest for the years 2010 through 2018 is estimated to be approximately , which is not included in the Company s uncertain tax positions. In May 2024, the IRS initiated an audit for the years 2019 through 2021. 
 
 On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 IRA was enacted, which among other things, implements a 15 minimum tax on book income of certain large corporations effective for years beginning after December 31, 2022. Based on the Company s analysis, as well as guidance published by the IRS, the IRA, and in particular the 15 minimum tax, did not have an impact on the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements. Subsequent to the aforementioned guidance published by the IRS, on September 12, 2024, the U.S. Treasury Department and IRS released proposed regulations relating to this 15 minimum tax. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of these regulations and will evaluate any additional guidance and clarification that becomes available. 
 
 Additionally, on December 15, 2022, the 27 member states of the European Union EU reached an agreement on a minimum level of taxation for certain large corporations to pay a minimum corporate tax rate of 15 in every jurisdiction in which they operate. This agreement, which is known as the Minimum Tax Directive (part of the Pillar II Model Rules ), was supposed to be transposed into the laws of all EU member states by December 31, 2023. Most member states complied, while some were granted extensions of time. In addition, many other jurisdictions outside the EU have also committed to implement this Directive while others have implemented a similar minimum tax regime consistent with the policy of the Pillar II Model Rules. Details of these rules are still being developed and, in some cases, enactment and timing is still uncertain. Based on current legislation and available guidance, this Directive does not have a material impact

Executive Overview 
 
 Business Organization 
 
 Colgate-Palmolive Company (together with its subsidiaries, we, us, our, the Company or Colgate is a caring, innovative growth company reimagining a healthier future for all people, their pets and our planet. We seek to deliver sustainable, profitable growth and superior shareholder returns, as well as to provide Colgate people with an innovative and inclusive work environment. We do this by developing and selling science-led products globally that make people s and their pets lives healthier and more enjoyable and by embracing our sustainability and social impact and diversity, equity and inclusion DE I strategies across our organization. 
 
 We are tightly focused on two product segments: Oral, Personal and Home Care; and Pet Nutrition. Within these segments, we follow a closely defined business strategy to grow our key product categories and increase our overall market share. Within the categories in which we compete, we prioritize our efforts based on their capacity to maximize the use of the organization s core competencies and strong global equities and to deliver sustainable, profitable long-term growth. 
 
 Operationally, we are organized along geographic lines with management teams having responsibility for the business and financial results in each region. We compete in more than 200 countries and territories worldwide with established businesses in all regions contributing to our sales and profitability. Approximately two-thirds of our Net sales are generated from markets outside the U.S., with approximately 45 of our Net sales coming from emerging markets (which consist of Latin America, Asia (excluding Japan), Africa/Eurasia and Central Europe). This geographic diversity and balance help to reduce our exposure to business and other risks in any one country or part of the world. 
 
 The Oral, Personal and Home Care product segment is managed geographically in five reportable operating segments: North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia Pacific and Africa/Eurasia, all of which sell primarily to a variety of traditional and eCommerce retailers, wholesalers, distributors, dentists and, in some segments, skin health professionals. Through Hill s Pet Nutrition, we also compete on a worldwide basis in the pet nutrition market, selling products principally through authorized pet supply retailers, veterinarians and eCommerce retailers. We also sell certain of our products direct-to-consumer. We are engaged in manufacturing and sourcing of products and materials on a global scale and have major manufacturing facilities, warehousing facilities and distribution centers in every region around the world. 
 
 In connection with management changes, we realigned the reporting structure of our skin health business effective July 1, 2024. Accordingly, commencing with the quarter ending September 30, 2024, the results of the skin health business previously reported within the Europe reportable operating segment are now reported with our other skin health businesses in the North America reportable operating segment, with no impact on the Company's consolidated results of operations or financial position. 
 
 On an ongoing basis, management focuses on a variety of key indicators to monitor business health and performance. These indicators include net sales (including volume, pricing and foreign exchange components), organic sales growth (net sales growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestments), a non-GAAP financial measure, and gross profit margin, selling, general and administrative expenses, operating profit, net income and earnings per share, in each case, on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, as well as measures used to optimize the management of working capital, capital expenditures, cash flow and return on capital. In addition, we review market share, household penetration and other data to assess how our brands are performing within their categories on a global and regional basis. The monitoring of these indicators and our Code of Conduct and corporate governance practices help to maintain business health and strong internal controls. For additional information regarding non-GAAP financial measures and the Company s use of market share data and the limitations of such data, see Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Market Share Information below.

The War in Ukraine 
 
 The war in Ukraine, and the related geopolitical tensions, have had and continue to have a significant impact on our operations in Ukraine and Russia, though it has not been material to our Consolidated Financial Statements. While our ability to do business in Ukraine has been significantly impacted, we remain committed to providing access to our products to people in the region. In Russia, we are importing and selling a reduced portfolio of health and hygiene products for everyday use. We have no manufacturing facilities in Russia and have ceased all capital investments and media activities in the country. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our business in the Eurasia region constituted approximately 1 of our consolidated net sales and approximately 2 of our consolidated operating profit. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, risks related to the impact of the war in Ukraine, including increases in the costs and, in certain cases, limitations on the availability of certain raw and packaging materials and commodities (including oil and natural gas), supply chain and logistics challenges, import restrictions, foreign currency volatility and reputational concerns. We also have faced and continue to face challenges to our ability to repatriate cash from Russia and finding banking partners to support our Russian operations and we may face challenges to our ability to protect our assets in Russia. We also continue to monitor the impact of sanctions, export controls and import restrictions imposed in response to the war in Ukraine. 

The War in the Middle East 
 
 The war in the Middle East has not had a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Uncertainties and risks remain as to the duration of the war and its impact on geopolitical relations and stability in North Africa, the Middle East and nearby regions. The war has impacted and may continue to impact, among other things, supply chain and logistics, the availability and price of raw and packaging materials and commodities such as oil, consumer sentiment and consumption and category growth rates in the region. 
 
 For more information about factors that could impact our business, including due to geopolitical conflicts, such as the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, refer to Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Business Strategy 
 
 To achieve our business and financial objectives, we are focused on driving organic sales growth and consistent compounded earnings per share growth through science-led, core and premium innovation, pursuing higher-growth adjacent categories and segments, expanding in faster-growing channels and markets and delivering margin expansion through operating leverage and efficiency. We continue to prioritize our investments in high growth segments within our Oral Care, Personal Care and Pet Nutrition businesses. We are also seeking to lead in the development of human capital and to maximize the impact of our sustainability and social impact and DE I strategies. We are strengthening and leveraging our capabilities in areas such as innovation, digital, artificial intelligence, eCommerce and data and analytics, enabling us to be more responsive in today s rapidly changing world. We continue to invest behind our brands, including through advertising, and to develop initiatives to build strong relationships with consumers, dental, veterinary and skin health professionals and traditional and eCommerce retailers. We continue to believe that growth opportunities are greater in those areas of the world in which economic development and rising consumer incomes expand the size and number of markets for our products. 
 
 The investments needed to drive growth are supported through continuous, Company-wide initiatives to lower costs and increase effective asset utilization. Through these initiatives, which are referred to as our funding-the-growth initiatives, we seek to become even more effective and efficient throughout our businesses. These initiatives are designed to reduce costs associated with direct materials, indirect expenses, distribution and logistics and advertising and promotional materials, among other things, and encompass a wide range of projects, examples of which include raw material substitution, reduction of packaging materials, consolidating suppliers to leverage volumes and increasing manufacturing efficiency through SKU reductions and formulation simplification. 
 
 Significant Items Impacting Comparability 
 
 During the quarter ended June 30, 2023, we reassessed with our legal and tax advisers certain tax deductions taken in prior years by one of our subsidiaries and concluded that it was more likely than not that the deductions would not be sustained by the courts in that jurisdiction. The value of the tax deductions was not material to us in any year in which they were taken. The cumulative effect of the change in tax position of 148 was reflected as a discrete item in the quarter ended June 30, 2023 income tax expense, partially offset by the reversal of certain prior years withholding tax reserves of 22 that are no longer required (hereinafter referred to as the foreign tax matter ). The tax liability was paid in the quarter ended September 30, 2023. See Note 13, Income Taxes, to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
 
 During the quarter ended March 31, 2023, we recorded a charge of 267 as a result of a decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (the Second Circuit affirming a grant of summary judgment to the plaintiffs in a lawsuit under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act seeking the recalculation of benefits and other relief associated with a 2005 residual annuity amendment to the Colgate-Palmolive Company Employees Retirement Income Plan (the Retirement Plan ). The decision resulted in an increase in the obligations of the Retirement Plan, which based on the current funded status of the Retirement Plan and depending on the asset performance, impact of interest rates for the remainder of the year and further developments in the litigation, may require a cash contribution by the Company in 2025. In June 2023, we filed a petition for certiorari to the United States Supreme Court requesting permission for an appeal to that court and that petition was denied in October 2023. Also, in June 2023, the plaintiffs filed a motion to enter a revised final judgment in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (the District Court to address certain unresolved calculation issues, which we opposed. In March 2024, the District Court granted the plaintiffs motion and found for the plaintiffs on those calculation issues. We are appealing that decision to the Second Circuit. See Note 9, Contingencies to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 
 
 During the quarter ended March 31, 2023, we announced a voluntary recall of select Fabuloso multi-purpose cleaner products sold in the United States and Canada. The costs associated with the voluntary recall had a 25 impact on our Operating profit in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 On January 27, 2022, the Company s Board of Directors (the Board approved a targeted productivity program (the 2022 Global Productivity Initiative ). All initiatives under the program have been implemented as of the third quarter of 2024 and we expect to incur the remaining charges by the end of 2024. The 2022 Global Productivity Initiative resulted in the reallocation of resources towards our strategic priorities and faster growth businesses, efficiencies in our operations and

the streamlining of our supply chain to reduce structural costs. Total pretax charges from the implementation of the 2022 Global Productivity Initiative are expected to be approximately 225 180 aftertax), once all charges are recorded. Total annualized pretax savings from the 2022 Global Productivity Initiative are expected to be approximately 125 100 aftertax). For more information regarding the 2022 Global Productivity Initiative, see Restructuring and Related Implementation Charges below. 
 
 In the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we incurred pretax costs of 15 (aftertax costs of 13) and 2 (aftertax costs of 2), respectively, resulting from the 2022 Global Productivity Initiative. 
 
 In the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we incurred pretax costs of 77 (aftertax costs of 67) and 29 (aftertax costs of 23), respectively, resulting from the 2022 Global Productivity Initiative.

Outlook 
 
 Looking forward, we expect global macroeconomic, political and market conditions to remain challenging, including as a result of inflation, high interest rates and foreign currency volatility. We have taken and are taking additional pricing to try to offset the increases in raw and packaging material costs we have seen in recent years. This has negatively impacted consumer demand for our products. Additionally, inflation has impacted the broader economy with consumers around the world facing widespread rising prices as well as high interest rates resulting from measures to address inflation. Such inflation and high interest rates may negatively impact consumer consumption or discretionary spending and/or change their purchasing patterns by foregoing purchasing certain of our products or by switching to private label or to our lower-priced product offerings. Although we continue to devote significant resources to support our brands and market our products at multiple price points, these changes could reduce demand for and sales volumes of our products or result in a shift in our product mix from higher margin to lower margin product offerings. In light of this challenging environment, we expect continued volatility across all of our categories and it is therefore difficult to predict category growth rates in the near term. 
 
 Given that approximately two-thirds of our Net sales originate in markets outside the U.S., we have experienced and will likely continue to experience volatile foreign currency fluctuations, particularly in Argentina and T rkiye, which are considered hyper-inflationary economies. As discussed above, we have also experienced higher raw and packaging material costs. While we have taken, and will continue to take, measures to mitigate the effect of these conditions, such as the 2022 Global Productivity Initiative and our funding-the-growth and revenue growth management initiatives, in the current environment it may become increasingly difficult to implement certain of these mitigation strategies. Should these conditions persist, they could adversely affect our future results. 
 
 While the global marketplace in which we operate has always been highly competitive, we continue to experience heightened competitive activity in certain markets from strong local competitors, from other large multinational companies, some of which have greater resources than we do, and from new entrants into the market in many of our categories. Such activities have included more aggressive product claims and marketing challenges, as well as increased promotional spending and geographic expansion. 
 
 We have been negatively affected by changes in the policies and practices of our trade customers in key markets, such as inventory destocking, fulfillment requirements, limitations on access to shelf space, delisting of our products and certain sustainability, supply chain and packaging standards or initiatives. In addition, the retail landscape in many of our markets continues to evolve as a result of the continued growth of eCommerce, changing consumer preferences (as consumers increasingly shop online and via mobile and social applications) and the increased presence of alternative retail channels, such as subscription services and direct-to-consumer businesses. We plan to continue to invest behind our data strategy, digital and analytics (including artificial intelligence) capabilities and higher growth businesses. The substantial growth in eCommerce and the emergence of alternative retail channels have created and may continue to create pricing pressures and/or adversely affect our relationships with our key retailers. 
 
 We continue to closely monitor the impact of geopolitical events and tensions, such as the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East and tensions between China and Taiwan and the challenging market conditions discussed above, on our business and the related uncertainties and risks. While we have taken, and will continue to take, measures to mitigate the effects of these events and conditions, we cannot estimate with certainty the full extent of their impact on our business, results of operations, cash flows and/or financial condition. For more information about factors that could impact our business, see Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 We believe that we are well prepared to meet the challenges ahead due to our strong financial condition, experience operating in challenging environments, resilient global supply chain, dedicated and diverse global team and focused business strategy. Our strategy is based on driving organic sales growth and consistent compounded earnings per share growth through science-led, core and premium innovation, pursuing higher-growth adjacent categories and segments, expanding in faster-growing channels and markets and delivering margin expansion through operating leverage and efficiency. We are also seeking to lead in the development of human capital and to maximize our sustainability and social impact and DE I strategies. Our commitment to these priorities, the strength of our brands, the breadth of our global footprint and a commitment to profitability and driving efficiency in cash generation should position us well to manage through the challenges we face and increase shareholder value over time.

Income Taxes 
 
 The effective income tax rate was 21.3 for the third quarter of 2024 as compared to 21.9 for the third quarter of 2023. As reflected in the table below, the non-GAAP effective income tax rate was 21.2 for the third quarter of 2024 as compared to 21.8 for the third quarter of 2023. 
 
 The effective income tax rate was 23.4 for the first nine months of 2024 as compared to 29.5 for the first nine months of 2023. As reflected in the table below, the non-GAAP effective income tax rate was 23.1 for the first nine months of 2024 as compared to 23.8 for the first nine months of 2023. 
 
 The quarterly provision for income taxes is determined based on the Company s estimated full year effective income tax rate adjusted by the amount of tax attributable to infrequent or unusual items that are separately recognized on a discrete basis in the income tax provision in the quarter in which they occur. The Company s current estimate of its full year effective income tax rate before discrete period items is 23.7 , flat with 2023. 
 In the third quarter of 2023, the Internal Revenue Service (the IRS issued a notice giving taxpayers temporary relief from the effects of certain U.S. tax regulations that were issued in December 2021, which place greater restrictions on foreign taxes that are creditable against U.S. taxes on foreign-source income. This notice allowed taxpayers to defer the application of these new regulations through the end of 2023. In December 2023, the IRS issued further guidance modifying this temporary relief period to the date that a notice or other guidance withdrawing or modifying the temporary relief is issued. The Company will recognize the impact, if any, in the period in which the temporary relief is withdrawn or modified. 
 The Company has ongoing federal, state and international income tax audits in various jurisdictions and evaluates uncertain tax positions that may be challenged by local tax authorities and not fully sustained. All U.S. federal income tax returns through December 31, 2013 have been audited by the IRS and there are limited matters which the Company plans to appeal for years 2010 through 2013. One such matter relates to the IRS assessment of taxes on the Company by imputing income on certain activities within one of our international operations, which is also under audit for the years 2014 through 2018. There were U.S. Tax Court rulings during 2023 in favor of the IRS against unrelated third parties on similar matters. Despite the U.S. Tax Court rulings, the Company continues to believe that the tax assessment against the Company is without merit. While there can be no assurances, the Company believes this matter will ultimately be decided in favor of the Company. The amount of tax plus interest for the years 2010 through 2018 is estimated to be approximately 150,

which is not included in the Company s uncertain tax positions. In May 2024, the IRS initiated an audit for the years 2019 through 2021. 
 On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 IRA was enacted, which among other things, implements a 15 minimum tax on book income of certain large corporations effective for years beginning after December 31, 2022. Based on the Company s analysis, as well as guidance published by the IRS, the IRA, and in particular the 15 minimum tax, did not have an impact on the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements. Subsequent to the aforementioned guidance published by the IRS, on September 12, 2024, the U.S. Treasury Department and IRS released proposed regulations relating to this 15 minimum tax. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of these regulations and will evaluate any additional guidance and clarification that becomes available. 
 Additionally, on December 15, 2022, the 27 member states of the European Union EU reached an agreement on a minimum level of taxation for certain large corporations to pay a minimum corporate tax rate of 15 in every jurisdiction in which they operate. This agreement, which is known as the Minimum Tax Directive (part of the Pillar II Model Rules ), was supposed to be transposed into the laws of all EU member states by December 31, 2023. Most member states complied while some were granted extensions of time. In addition, many other jurisdictions outside the EU have also committed to implement this Directive while others have implemented a similar minimum tax regime consistent with the policy of the Pillar II Model Rules. Details of these rules are still being developed and, in some cases, enactment and timing is still uncertain. Based on current legislation and available guidance, this Directive does not have a material impact on the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements. However, as these rules and related regulations are revised and implemented, the Company will evaluate the impact, if any, on its Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 During the quarter ended June 30, 2023, we reassessed with our legal and tax advisers certain tax deductions taken in prior years by one of our subsidiaries and concluded that it was more likely than not that the deductions would not be sustained by the courts in that jurisdiction. The value of the tax deductions was not material to us in any year in which they were taken. The cumulative effect of the change in tax position of 148 was reflected as a discrete item in the quarter ended June 30, 2023 income tax expense, partially offset by the reversal of certain prior years withholding tax reserves of 22 that were no longer required. The tax liability was paid in the quarter ended September 30, 2023.

Restructuring and Related Implementation Charges 
 
 On January 27, 2022, the Board approved the 2022 Global Productivity Initiative. All initiatives under the program have been implemented as of the third quarter of 2024 and the Company expects to incur the remaining charges by the end of 2024. The 2022 Global Productivity Initiative resulted in the reallocation of resources towards the Company s strategic priorities and faster growth businesses, efficiencies in the Company s operations and the streamlining of its supply chain to reduce structural costs. 
 
 Total pretax charges from the implementation of the 2022 Global Productivity Initiative are expected to be approximately 225 180 aftertax), once all the charges are recorded, which is comprised of the following categories: employee-related costs, including severance, pension and other termination benefits (80 ); asset-related costs, primarily accelerated depreciation and asset write-downs (5 ); and other charges (15 ), which include contract termination costs, consisting primarily of implementation-related charges resulting directly from exit activities and the implementation of new strategies. It is expected that approximately 80 of the charges will result in cash expenditures. 
 
 Total annualized pretax savings from the 2022 Global Productivity Initiative are expected to be approximately 125 100 aftertax). Savings achieved since the implementation of the 2022 Global Productivity Initiative were approximately 115 pretax 91 aftertax). 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, charges resulting from the 2022 Global Productivity Initiative were 15 pretax 13 aftertax). For the three months ended September 30, 2023, charges resulting from the 2022 Global Productivity Initiative were 2 pretax 2 aftertax). 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, charges resulting from the 2022 Global Productivity Initiative are reflected in the income statement as follows: 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Gross Profit 19 1 Selling, general and administrative expenses 4 2 Other (income) expense, net 54 22 Non-service related postretirement costs 4 Total 2022 Global Productivity Initiative charges, pretax 77 29 Total 2022 Global Productivity Initiative charges, aftertax 67 23 
 
 Restructuring and related implementation charges are recorded in the Corporate segment as these initiatives are predominantly centrally directed and controlled and are not included in internal measures of segment operating performance.

Employee-Related Costs primarily include severance and other termination benefits and are calculated based on long-standing benefit practices, written severance policies, local statutory requirements and, in certain cases, voluntary termination arrangements. Employee-Related Costs also include pension enhancements, which are reflected as Charges against assets within Employee-Related Costs in the preceding table, as the corresponding balance sheet amounts are reflected as a reduction of pension assets or an increase in pension liabilities. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no pension enhancements included in Charges against assets within Employee-Related Costs. 
 
 Incremental Depreciation is recorded to reflect changes in useful lives and estimated residual values for long-lived assets that will be taken out of service prior to the end of their normal service period. Asset Impairments are recorded to write down inventories and assets held for sale or disposal to their fair value based on amounts expected to be realized. Charges against assets within Asset Impairments are net of cash proceeds pertaining to the sale of certain assets.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q discusses certain financial measures on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. The Company uses the non-GAAP financial measures described below internally in its budgeting process, to evaluate segment and overall operating performance and as a factor in determining compensation. The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating the Company s underlying business performance and trends; however, this information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as similar measures presented by other companies. 
 
 Net sales growth (GAAP) and organic sales growth (Net sales growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestments) (non-GAAP) are discussed in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Management believes the organic sales growth measure provides investors and analysts with useful supplemental information regarding the Company s underlying sales trends by presenting sales growth excluding the external factor of foreign exchange, as well as the impact of acquisitions and divestments, as applicable. A reconciliation of organic sales growth to Net sales growth for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 is provided below. 
 
 Gross Profit, Gross Profit margin, Selling, general and administrative expenses, Other (income) expense, net, Operating profit, Operating profit margin, Non-service related postretirement costs, Effective income tax rate, Net income attributable to Colgate-Palmolive Company and Earnings per share on a diluted basis are discussed in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q both on a GAAP basis and excluding, as applicable, charges resulting from the ERISA litigation matter, the foreign tax matter and the 2022 Global Productivity Initiative and product recall costs. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude items that, either by their nature or amount, management would not expect to occur as part of the Company s normal business on a regular basis, such as restructuring charges, charges for certain litigation and tax matters, acquisition-related costs, gains and losses from certain divestitures and certain other unusual, non-recurring items. Investors and analysts use these financial measures in assessing the Company s business performance, and management believes that presenting these financial measures on a non-GAAP basis provides them with useful supplemental information to enhance their understanding of the Company s underlying business performance and trends. These non-GAAP financial measures also enhance the ability to compare period-to-period financial results. A reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is presented within the applicable section of Results of Operations. 
 
 The following tables provide a quantitative reconciliation of Net sales growth to organic sales growth for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024:

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 The Company expects cash flow from operations and debt issuances will be sufficient to meet foreseeable business operating and recurring cash needs (including for debt service, dividends, capital expenditures, share repurchases and acquisitions). The Company believes its strong cash generation and financial position should continue to allow it broad access to global credit and capital markets. 
 
 Cash Flow 
 
 Net cash provided by operations increased 9 to 2,838 in the first nine months of 2024, compared to 2,609 in the first nine months of 2023, primarily due to higher net income, partially offset by changes in working capital. The Company s working capital was (3.6 as a percentage of Net sales as of September 30, 2024 as compared to (2.1 as of September 30, 2023. The Company defines working capital as the difference between current assets (excluding Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, the latter of which is reported in Other current assets) and current liabilities (excluding short-term debt). 
 
 Investing activities used 454 of cash in the first nine months of 2024, compared to 599 in the first nine months of 2023. 
 
 Capital expenditures were 377 in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 508 in the first nine months of 2023. Capital expenditures for 2024 are expected to be approximately 3.0 of Net sales. The Company continues to focus its capital spending on projects that are expected to yield high aftertax returns. 
 
 Financing activities used 2,110 of cash during the first nine months of 2024, compared to 1,801 used in the first nine months of 2023. The increase in cash used was primarily due to higher share repurchases, partially offset by higher proceeds from the exercise of stock options. 
 
 Long-term debt, including the current portion, decreased to 7,929 as of September 30, 2024, as compared to 8,239 as of December 31, 2023 and total debt was 8,436 as of September 30, 2024, as compared to 8,549 as of December 31, 2023. During the first quarter of 2024, the Company redeemed at maturity 500 of ten-year Medium-Term Notes with a fixed coupon of 3.25 . The redemption was financed with commercial paper borrowings. 
 
 Domestic and foreign commercial paper outstanding was 1,282 and 906 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The average daily balances outstanding for commercial paper in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023 were 1,754 and 1,886, respectively. The Company classifies commercial paper and certain current maturities of notes payable as long-term debt when it has the intent and ability to refinance such obligations on a long-term basis, including, if necessary, by utilizing its unused lines of credit or by issuing long-term debt pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement. 
 
 Certain of the agreements with respect to the Company s bank borrowings contain financial and other covenants as well as cross-default provisions. Noncompliance with these requirements could ultimately result in the acceleration of amounts owed. The Company is in full compliance with all such requirements and believes the likelihood of noncompliance is remote. Refer to Note 6, Long Term Debt and Credit Facilities to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for further information about the Company s long-term debt and credit facilities. 
 
 In the first quarter of 2024, the Company increased the quarterly common stock dividend to 0.50 per share from 0.48 per share previously, effective in the second quarter of 2024. 
 
 Cash and cash equivalents increased 268 during the first nine months of 2024 to 1,234 at September 30, 2024, compared to 966 at December 31, 2023, the majority of which 1,182 and 922, respectively) was held by the Company s foreign subsidiaries.

Intangible Assets 
 
 As of the date of the annual indefinite-lived impairment test, the fair value of one of the Company s indefinite-lived trademarks continues to approximate its carrying value. 
 
 Given the inherent uncertainties of estimating the future cash flows, the impact of interest rates and inflation on macroeconomic conditions, actual results may differ from management's current estimates which could potentially result in impairment charges in future periods.

Market Share Information 
 
 Management uses market share information as a key indicator to monitor business health and performance. References to market share in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are based on a combination of consumption and market share data provided by third-party vendors, primarily Nielsen, and internal estimates. All market share references represent the percentage of the dollar value of sales of our products, relative to all product sales in the category in the countries in which the Company competes and purchases data (excluding Venezuela from all periods). 
 
 Market share data is subject to limitations on the availability of up-to-date information. In particular, market share data is currently not generally available for certain retail channels, such as eCommerce or certain discounters. The Company measures year-to-date market shares from January 1 of the relevant year through the most recent period for which market share data is available, which typically reflects a lag time of one or two months. The Company believes that the third-party vendors we use to provide data are reliable, but we have not verified the accuracy or completeness of the data or any assumptions underlying the data. In addition, market share information calculated by the Company may be different from market share information calculated by other companies due to differences in category definitions, the use of data from different countries, internal estimates and other factors. 
 
 Cautionary Statement on Forward-Looking Statements 
 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may contain forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 or by the SEC in its rules, regulations and releases that set forth anticipated results based on management s current plans and assumptions.

These statements are made on the basis of the Company s views and assumptions as of this time and the Company undertakes no obligation to update these statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law or by the rules and regulations of the SEC. Moreover, the Company does not, nor does any other person, assume responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of those statements. The Company cautions investors that any such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and that actual events or results may differ materially from those statements. Actual events or results may differ materially because of factors that affect international businesses and global economic conditions, as well as matters specific to the Company and the markets it serves, including the uncertain macroeconomic and political environment in different countries, including as a result of inflation and higher interest rates, and its effect on consumer confidence and spending, foreign currency rate fluctuations, exchange controls, import restrictions, tariffs, sanctions, price or profit controls, labor relations, changes in foreign or domestic laws, or regulations or their interpretation, political and fiscal developments, including changes in trade, tax and immigration policies, increased competition and evolving competitive practices (including from the growth of eCommerce and the entry of new competitors and business models), the ability to operate and respond effectively during a pandemic, epidemic or widespread public health concern, the ability to manage disruptions in our global supply chain and/or key office facilities, the ability to manage the availability and cost of raw and packaging materials and logistics costs, the ability to maintain or increase selling prices as needed, changes in the policies of retail trade customers, the emergence of alternative retail channels, the growth of eCommerce and the rapidly changing retail landscape (as consumers increasingly shop online and through mobile applications), the ability to develop innovative new products, the ability to continue lowering costs and operate in an agile manner, the ability to maintain the security of our information and operational technology systems from a cybersecurity incident or data breach, the ability to address the effects of climate change and achieve our sustainability and social impact goals, the ability to complete acquisitions and divestitures as planned, the ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses, the ability to attract and retain key employees and integrate DE I initiatives across our organization, the uncertainty of the outcome of legal proceedings, whether or not the Company believes they have merit, and the ability to address uncertain or unfavorable global economic conditions, including inflation, disruptions in the credit markets and tax matters.

 A. Terms and Conditions Applicable to Nonqualified Options . 
 1. Grant . The Company grants to you, on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, the right and option to purchase the number of Shares indicated on the Notice of Grant at the exercise price per share indicated on the Notice of Grant (the Option Exercise Price ), which was the Fair Market Value of a Share on the Grant Date. The right to purchase each such Share is referred to in this Agreement as an Option . All Options granted hereunder will be Nonqualified Options as defined in the Plan. Your rights to the Options are subject to this Agreement (including the Notice of Grant) and the Plan (which is incorporated herein by reference with the same effect as if set forth herein in full) in addition to such other terms and conditions, if any, as may be imposed by law. 
 2. Vesting and Exercisability . The number of Options specified in the Notice of Grant will vest on each vesting date indicated on the Notice of Grant (the Vesting Date ). Except as provided in Section A.4 below, the Options will vest only if you remain continuously employed by the Company or an Affiliate through each Vesting Date. Only vested Options may be exercised. The specified number of Options will be exercisable from the applicable Vesting Date through the expiration date set forth in the Notice of Grant (the Expiration Date ), unless earlier terminated pursuant to the Plan or this Agreement. Once vested and exercisable, and until the Expiration Date or early termination, all or any portion of the Options may be exercised from time to time and at any time under procedures and policies that the Company establishes from time to time. 
 3. Exercise Procedure . The Options must be exercised by executing and delivering to the Company or the Company s appointed third-party Plan administrator, either directly or through an online internet transaction, a notice of exercise or by complying with such other procedures and policies as the Company or its appointed third-party Plan administrator may establish for notifying the Company. No Shares will be delivered pursuant to the exercise of the Options unless you have complied with your obligations under this Agreement and the Plan. Payment may be made by certified or bank check or wire transfer or, in the Company s discretion, (i) by exchanging Shares you own (which are not subject to any pledge or other security interest) (ii) to the extent permitted by applicable law and subject to rules as established by the Company and its appointed third-party Plan administrator, by using Shares subject to the Options (a broker-assisted cashless exercise) (iii) by having the Company or its appointed third-party Plan administrator withhold Shares from the Shares otherwise deliverable upon the exercise of the Options or (iv) by such other instrument or method as the Company may accept. The Options must be exercised by the close of the New York Stock Exchange on the last business day prior to the Expiration Date. If the Options have not been exercised by 4 00 pm (Eastern Time) on the last business day prior to the Expiration Date, the Company will have the right to exercise the Options on your behalf and to deliver the 

resulting Shares, net of the Option Exercise Price and any applicable withholding taxes, to your limited brokerage account at the Company s appointed third-party Plan administrator or, if you do not have such an account, to a shareholder account in your name with the Company s transfer agent. 
 
 4. Effect of Termination of Employment . The effect of a Termination of Employment on the Options is set forth in the Guidelines Regarding the Effect of Termination of Employment on Awards under the Plan adopted by the Committee on September 13, 2023, as such guidelines may be amended by the Committee from time to time. In addition, you are required to comply with the provisions regarding Prohibited Conduct set forth on Annex A to this Agreement. Annex A to this Agreement is part of this Agreement. 
 
 B. Prohibited Conduct . In consideration of the grant by the Company of the Options and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, you and the Company, intending to be legally bound, agree to the provisions regarding Prohibited Conduct set forth on Annex A to this Agreement. Annex A to this Agreement is part of this Agreement. 
 C. Additional Terms and Conditions . 
 1. Change in Control Adjustment for Change in Common Stock . The treatment of the Options in the event of a Change in Control, a Corporate Transaction or a Share Change will be governed by the Plan. 
 
 2. International Appendix . If you work or reside outside the United States, the Options will be subject to the general non-United States terms and conditions and the special terms and conditions of your country set forth in the attached International Appendix and, to the extent there is any conflict between this Agreement and the International Appendix, the International Appendix will control. Moreover, if you relocate from the United States to one of the countries included in the International Appendix or you move between countries included in the International Appendix, the general non-United States terms and conditions and the special terms and conditions for such country will apply to you, to the extent the Company determines that the application of such terms and conditions is necessary or advisable. The International Appendix is part of this Agreement. 
 
 3. Notices . Any notice to be given to the Company under this Agreement will be addressed to the Chief Legal Officer and Secretary at the Company s principal executive offices, and any notice to be given to you will be addressed to you at the address on file with the Company and or the Company s appointed third-party Plan administrator. Either the Company or you may designate a different address by written notice to the other. Written notice to said addresses will be effective to bind the Company and you and your representatives and beneficiaries. Any notice required or permitted hereunder will be (a) given in writing and will be deemed effectively given upon personal delivery, upon deposit for delivery by an internationally recognized express mail courier service or upon deposit in the United States mail by certified mail (if the parties are within the United States), with postage and fees prepaid, addressed to the other party at its address referenced herein, or (b) delivered electronically (including any notices delivered by a third-party) and will be deemed effectively given upon such delivery. 
 
 4. Binding Effect . This Agreement will inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their respective heirs, beneficiaries, executors, administrators, representatives, successors and assigns. 
 
 5. No Contract of Employment Agreement s Survival . Nothing contained in this Agreement will affect the right of the Company or an Affiliate to terminate your employment at any time, with or without 

Cause, or will be deemed to create any rights to employment on your part. The rights and obligations arising under this Agreement are not intended to and do not affect the employment relationship that otherwise exists between the Company or an Affiliate and you, whether such employment relationship is at will or defined by an employment contract. Moreover, this Agreement is not intended to and does not amend any existing employment contract between the Company and you. To the extent there is a conflict between this Agreement and such an employment contract as it relates to the Options awarded hereunder, the terms of this Agreement will govern and take priority. This Agreement will survive the termination of your employment for any reason. 
 
 6. Amendment Waiver . The terms and conditions of this Agreement may be amended unilaterally by the Company, provided, however, that (a) no such amendment will be adverse to you without your written consent (except (i) as provided in Section A.4 above or (ii) to the extent the Company reasonably determines that such amendment is necessary or appropriate to comply with applicable law, including the provisions of Code Section 409A, stock exchange rules or accounting rules) and (b) the amendment must be permitted under the Plan. The Company s failure to insist upon strict compliance with any provision of this Agreement or failure to exercise, or any delay in exercising, any right, power or remedy under this Agreement will not be deemed to be a waiver of such provision or any such right, power or remedy which the Board, the Committee or the Company has under this Agreement. 
 7. Severability or Reform by Court . If any provision of this Agreement is declared or found to be illegal, unenforceable or void, in whole or in part, then the parties will be relieved of their respective obligations arising under such provision only to the extent that it is illegal, unenforceable or void, it being the intent and agreement of the parties that this Agreement will be deemed amended by modifying such provision to the fullest extent necessary to make it legal and enforceable while preserving its intent or, if that is not possible, by substituting therefor another provision that is legal and enforceable and achieves the same objectives. If any provision of this Agreement is declared or found to be illegal, unenforceable or void to any extent, the validity or enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement will not be affected. 
 
 8. Compliance with Law . The Plan, the granting and vesting of the Options, and any obligations of the Company under the Plan, will be subject to all applicable federal, state and foreign country laws, rules and regulations, and to such approvals by any regulatory or governmental agency as may be required, and to any rules or regulations of any exchange on which the Shares are listed. The Company, in its discretion, may postpone the vesting or exercise of the Options, the issuance or delivery of Shares under this Award or any other action permitted under the Plan to enable the Company to complete any required action under any federal, state or foreign country law, rule or regulation. The Company may require that you make such representations and agreements and furnish such information as the Company deems appropriate to assure compliance with or exemption from the requirements of any securities exchange, any foreign, federal, state or local law, any governmental regulatory body, or any other applicable legal requirement, and Shares will not be issued unless and until you make such representations and agreements and furnish such information as the Company deems appropriate. The Company will not be obligated by virtue of any provision of the Plan to recognize the vesting or exercise of the Options or to otherwise sell or issue Shares in violation of any such laws, rules or regulations. Neither the Company nor its directors or officers will have any obligation or liability to you caused by any postponement of the vesting or exercise of the Options (or Shares issuable thereunder). 
 
 9. No Rights as Shareholder . Except as set forth in the Plan, neither you nor any person claiming under or through you will be, or will have any of the rights or privileges of, a holder of Shares with 

respect to the Options unless and until such Options are exercised and Shares are actually delivered to you. 
 
 10. Right of Set-Off . In addition to the rights of the Company set forth in Paragraph 6 of Annex A, you agree, if the Company in its reasonable judgment determines that you owe the Company and or any Affiliate any amount due to any loan, note, obligation or indebtedness, including but not limited to amounts owed to the Company pursuant to the Company s tax equalization program or the Company s policies with respect to travel and business expenses, and if you have not satisfied such obligation(s), then the Company may, to the extent permitted by applicable law (including without limitation Code Section 409A) instruct the Plan administrator to withhold and or sell Shares acquired by you upon exercise of your Options, or the Company may deduct funds equal to the amount of such obligation from other funds due to you from the Company or an Affiliate. 
 11. Electronic Delivery and Acceptance . The Company may, in its sole discretion, decide to deliver any documents related to current or future participation in the Plan, including this Agreement, by electronic means or request your consent to participate in the Plan by electronic means. You hereby consent to receive such documents by electronic delivery and agree to participate in the Plan through an on-line or electronic system established and maintained by the Company or its appointed third-party Plan administrator. The Agreement if delivered by electronic means with electronic signatures will be treated in all manner and respects as an original executed document and will be considered to have the same binding legal effect as if it were the original signed versions thereof delivered in person. 
 12. Data Privacy .

You understand that the Company or the Providers may be located in the United States or elsewhere, and that the laws of the country in which the Company and the Providers collect, use, transfer, hold, store or disclose the Data may have different legal protections for the Data than your country.

irreparable damage to the Company and its Affiliate(s), the exact amount of which would be difficult to ascertain, and that any remedies, including the repayment and forfeiture remedies set forth in Paragraph 6 of this Annex A and any remedies permissible under law, for any such breach or threatened breach would be inadequate. Accordingly, in the event the Company determines that you have breached or attempted or threatened to breach any of the Restrictive Covenants, in addition to any other remedies at law or in equity the Company may have available to it, it is agreed that the Company will be entitled to institute and prosecute proceedings in any court, tribunal or arbitrator of competent jurisdiction for specific performance, a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction (without the necessity of (i) proving irreparable harm, (ii) establishing that monetary damages are inadequate or (iii) posting any bond with respect thereto) prohibiting such breach or attempted or threatened breach by proving only the existence of such breach or attempted or threatened breach.

You acknowledge that the remedies set forth in this Agreement are not the exclusive remedies and the Company may avail itself of other remedies at law or in equity in the event you breach any of the Restrictive Covenants. 
 
 16. Provisions Independent . The Restrictive Covenants will be construed as an agreement independent of any other agreement, including any employee benefit agreement, and independent of any other provision of this Agreement, and the existence of any claim or cause of action you bring against the Company or an Affiliate, whether predicated upon this Agreement or otherwise, will not constitute a defense to the enforcement by the Company of such covenants. 
 
 17. Notification of Subsequent Employer . You agree that the Company and or Affiliate may notify any person or entity hiring or engaging you, or considering hiring or engaging you, to serve as a director, officer, employee, consultant, contractor or advisor, or to provide services or advice in any capacity, of the existence and provisions of this Agreement.

Accordingly, in the event the Company determines that you have breached or attempted or threatened to breach any of the Restrictive Covenants, in addition to any other remedies at law or in equity the Company may have available to it, it is agreed that the Company will be entitled to institute and prosecute proceedings in any court, tribunal or arbitrator of competent jurisdiction for specific performance, a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction (without the necessity of (i) proving irreparable harm, (ii) establishing that monetary damages are inadequate or (iii) posting any bond with respect thereto) prohibiting such breach or attempted or threatened breach by proving only the existence of such breach or attempted or threatened breach. 
 
 14. Extension of Restrictive Period . You agree that the Restricted Time will be extended by any time during which you are in violation of any of the Restrictive Covenants. 
 
 15. Acknowledgments . You and the Company agree that it is our mutual intent to enter into a valid and enforceable agreement. You and the Company acknowledge the reasonableness of the Restrictive Covenants, including the reasonableness of the geographic area, duration as to time and scope of activity restrained. You further acknowledge that your skills are such that you can be gainfully employed in noncompetitive employment and that the agreement not to compete will not prevent you from earning a living. You acknowledge that the remedies set forth in this Agreement are not the exclusive remedies and the Company may avail itself of other remedies at law or in equity in the event you breach any of the Restrictive Covenants. 
 
 16. Provisions Independent . The Restrictive Covenants will be construed as an agreement independent of any other agreement, including any employee benefit agreement, and independent of any other provision of this Agreement, and the existence of any claim or cause of action you bring against the Company or an Affiliate, whether predicated upon this Agreement or otherwise, will not constitute a defense to the enforcement by the Company of such covenants. 
 
 17. Notification of Subsequent Employer . You agree that the Company and or Affiliate may notify any person or entity hiring or engaging you, or considering hiring or engaging you, to serve as a director, officer, employee, consultant, contractor or advisor, or to provide services or advice in any capacity, of the existence and provisions of this Agreement. 
 
 18. THE SCOPE OF THE RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS IN PARAGRAPH 2 OF THIS ANNEX A ARE SUBJECT TO THE SEVERABILITY OR REFORM BY COURT PROVISIONS SET FORTH IN SECTION C.7 OF THE AGREEMENT. TO THE EXTENT PERMISSIBLE, THE SCOPE OF THESE RESTRICTIONS SHOULD BE SUBJECT TO REFORMULATION BY A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION IN ORDER TO PROTECT THE LEGITIMATE BUSINESS INTERESTS OF THE COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. PARAGRAPH 2 OF THIS ANNEX A IS SEVERABLE AND WILL NOT APPLY TO, AND WILL NOT BE ENFORCED BY THE COMPANY WITH RESPECT TO, POST TERMINATION ACTIVITY IN ANY JURISDICTION IN WHICH THIS PROHIBITION IS NOT ENFORCEABLE UNDER APPLICABLE LAW .
