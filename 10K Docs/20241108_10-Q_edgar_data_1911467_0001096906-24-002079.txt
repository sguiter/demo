 Overview 
 
 We were incorporated on December 7, 2021, as a Nevada company for the purpose of acting as an independent exploration and production company to engage in oil and natural gas development, production, acquisition, and exploration activities currently focused in Texas. We have acquired a 75 working interest in an 80-acre oil and gas lease located in Andrews County, Texas, and have entered into a joint venture agreement to explore the area of mutual interest surrounding the current lease for further acquisitions and development. 
 
 Results of Operations and Known Trends or Future Events 
 
 We are in our startup phase of operations and have not generated any revenues to date. Activities since inception include corporate organizational activities, a private offering of our common shares, those activities necessary to prepare for the registration of shares for the selling stockholders, acquisition of our first oil and gas lease interest, and arrangements to expand operations in the current area of interest through a joint venture with a third party. We have incurred operating expenses related to legal and accounting services, and oil and gas lease acquisition costs. We expect to incur expenses to develop the oil and gas lease and anticipate increased expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting, and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses related to future oil and gas business growth. We expect our expenses to increase substantially as a result. 
 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Production, sales, production costs and production taxes . The Company does not currently have any producing wells and thus has no production, sales, production costs or production taxes nor has it ever had any to date. 
 
 Depreciation, depletion and amortization . We have no production and our current oil and gas properties thus are not yet subject to amortization. Further, we have no depreciable assets. 
 
 General and administrative expenses . General and administrative expenses were 15,273 for three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 16,306 for the same period of 2023. The largest costs during the period in 2024 were legal, accounting and transfer agent fees while the largest costs during the period in 2023 were legal and audit fees as well as amortization of fees related to listing our common shares. 
 
 Net loss . The Company had net loss of 15,273 for three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 16,306 for the same period of 2023. This decrease in loss was the result of decreased general and administrative costs. 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Production, sales, production costs and production taxes . The Company does not currently have any producing wells and thus has no production, sales, production costs or production taxes nor has it ever had any to date. 
 
 Depreciation, depletion and amortization . We have no production and our current oil and gas properties thus are not yet subject to amortization. Further, we have no depreciable assets.

The largest costs during the period in 2024 were legal, accounting and transfer agent fees while the largest costs in 2023 were legal, audit and other fees related to our annual 10K filing and additional costs to finalize the listing of our common shares and amortization of fess related to listing our common shares. 
 
 Net loss . The Company had net loss of 51,371 for nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 62,035 for the same period of 2023. This decrease in loss was the result of decreased general and administrative costs.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Management believes it has on hand sufficient cash resources to meet its material cash requirements for the next 12 months but will require further funding or other arrangements to commence extensive drilling operations or acquire further oil and gas interests. As discussed further below, management believes that through its resources and relationships, appropriate arrangements for required funding can be reasonably obtained. Mr. Rochford, one of our founders, paid 240,000 for his founder s shares in the Company. In addition, we received 264,000 in gross proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock in a non-public offering of the shares. We have no capital commitments for expenditures, other than those existing under our current oil and gas lease. We anticipate primarily utilizing these funds to increase our acreage position adjacent to our initial acreage position. Any remaining funds would be used to cover the initial costs of drilling wells on the Company s existing lease, to seek drilling partners for the costs of the wells, and to secure additional oil and gas properties. 
 
 Under our current oil and gas lease, we are required to drill two wells on the property within three years from the lease date. If we fail to commence, drill or develop one or both of the wells within the three-year period, the undrilled tract or tracts will automatically revert to the lessor. 
 
 Before commencing development activity, management first intends to increase our acreage position adjacent to our initial acreage position. Once this process is complete, we can determine how best to proceed, particularly as it relates to whether we would drill vertically or horizontally. The amount and configuration of the acreage will determine whether to implement vertical or horizontal drilling. 
 
 If the Company is not successful in adding additional acreage, we would proceed with developing our initial acreage, beginning with the drilling of the two vertical wells as required by the current oil and gas lease. Each of these wells would cost approximately 750,000 to drill and complete. To fund this drilling, the Company would likely enter into agreements with industry partners who would provide funding in return for a portion of the working interest in the wells. Management has not yet entered into any agreements but has had extended conversations with those industry partners regarding potential participation in the drilling. These discussions have concluded with positive indications that they would wish to participate and so the required funding would be available. In the alternative, management may seek funding through the sale of equity in the Company. 
 
 Cash Flows. We had no cash inflows during either of the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 or 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had cash outflow of 43,661 from operating activities as compared to cash outflow from operations of 45,784 for the same period of 2023. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash on hand of 217,677 and working capital of 216,491, as compared to cash on hand of 261,338 and working capital of 267,862 as of December 31, 2023. 
 15 
 
 BUSINESS 
 
 We are a corporation incorporated in Nevada formed for the purpose of acquiring and developing oil and gas prospects, primarily in the state of Texas and surrounding states. We anticipate acquiring these properties either directly from the owners or through one or more acquisitions of smaller oil and gas companies with existing oil and gas assets and established management teams. We have acquired an interest in our first oil and gas lease and have entered into an arrangement to develop an area of mutual interest in the same area. Management has also had ongoing preliminary discussions with multiple potential sellers and management teams as well as with contacts within the banking community to further develop the company s ongoing business. Through management s prior relationships, we acquired our first prospect and have identified a selection of additional potential acquisition targets. Further, the Company has been approved as an operator of oil and gas properties by the Texas Railroad Commission. In addition, Mr. Rochford, one of our founders, paid 240,000 for his founder s shares in the Company, and in March 2022, we completed a non-public offering of our common stock in which we raised gross proceeds of 264,000, all of which we intend to be used for general operating expenses, for our current project, and to search for additional suitable oil and gas properties or projects. 
 
 C. W. Logsdon Lease 
 
 Under the terms of a Farmout Agreement and Conditional Lease Assignment dated May 16, 2022, we have acquired a 75 working interest, and 55.5 net revenue interest, in the C. W. Logsdon Lease, an 80-acre tract located in Andrews County, Texas. We acquired the interest from Aspen Energy Partners, LTD., a Florida limited partnership which holds the remaining 25 working interest. Under the lease agreement, we are required to drill at least two wells, one on each 40-acre farmout tract, within three years or the rights under the lease to any undrilled tract or tracts will automatically revert to Aspen. 
 
 There are currently two plugged but no producing wells on the lease. These two wells were drilled on 40-acre spacing, produced from the Clear Fork and were economical. There are additional wells on surrounding acreage that have produced marketable quantities of oil and gas. 
 
 The initial intent is to drill two new Clear Fork wells based on 20-acre spacing. Management believes there is potential for further downspacing to 10-acre spacing, depending on oil and gas prices, development cost and completion results of the 20-acre development. Management also believes there is potential for San Andres development with possible 10-acre spacing, again depending on oil and gas prices, development costs and completion results. 
 
 We have also entered into a joint venture agreement with Aspen to mutually develop an area of mutual interest near the current lease. This area of mutual interest consists of approximately 880 acres including and adjoining the acquired acreage. If we are successful in acquiring additional acreage, we would jointly own mineral rights in the same percentage of ownership with Aspen as the current lease (75 Circle, 25 Aspen). The parties intend that the joint venture would use AAPL 610-19819 or AAPL 610-2015 or similar operating agreement to structure the joint venture. The liabilities of the parties would be severed and not joint, and each party would be responsible only for its share of the costs and liabilities incurred under the operating agreement. Aspen is a ten-year-old oil and gas exploration company with the majority of its projects located in Texas. During its operating history, Aspen has owned over 70 oil and gas producing wells. 
 
 Management intends to lease additional acreage within the area of mutual interest. Towards this end, we have engaged a petroleum engineer to prioritize the acreage for leasing and have engaged a landman to execute our leasing efforts. Once we have identified and acquired the specific acreage for development and evaluated our best options to develop it, we will be able to determine whether to utilize vertical or horizontal drilling. This will be determined based on the amount and configuration of any additional acquired acreage. 
 16 
 
 If we are unsuccessful in adding additional acreage, we intend to commence development or our existing property via vertical drilling, beginning with the two wells required under our current lease. We estimate that drilling and completing these wells would cost approximately 750,000 per well. If the results of the initial well are successful, we would commence drilling of the second well at a similar cost and timeframe. We intend to seek joint venture opportunities to fund the drilling of these wells. We anticipate that any wells drilled on the existing lease would produce primarily oil. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, and it is not anticipated that the Company will enter into any off-balance sheet arrangements. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 As a smaller reporting company, we have elected not to provide the disclosure required by this item. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Our Chief Executive Officer, who serves as our principal executive officer; and our Chief Financial Officer, who serves as our principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (the Evaluation Date ). In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. The Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as of the Evaluation Date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and financial officers, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 We will continue to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal controls over financial reporting on an ongoing basis and are committed to taking further action and implementing additional enhancements or improvements, as necessary and as funds allow. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 We regularly review our system of internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our processes and systems to improve controls and increase efficiency, while ensuring that we maintain an effective internal control environment. Changes may include such activities as implementing new, more efficient systems, consolidating activities, and migrating processes. 
 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
