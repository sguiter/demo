Accordingly, they do not include all of the 
 information and footnote disclosures required by U.S. GAAP for complete 
financial statements.
 The unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be 
read in conjunction with the audited 
 consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial 
statements contained in our Annual Report 
 on Form 10-K for the year ended December 30, 2023 and with the information 
contained in our other publicly-

The condensed consolidated financial statements 
 reflect all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of 
the consolidated results of operations and

All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. 

Our condensed consolidated financial statements reflect estimates and

 During the nine months ended September 28, 2024, we completed the accounting 
for certain acquisitions that 
 occurred in fiscal year 2024 and we did not record any material measurement 
period adjustments related to these 
 acquisitions. 
The accounting for other acquisitions in fiscal year 2024 has not 
been completed in several areas, 
 including but not limited to pending assessment of accounts receivable, 
right-of-use lease assets, lease liabilities, 
 accrued liabilities and non-income based taxes. 
 Goodwill is a result of the synergies and cross-selling opportunities that these acquisitions 
are expected to provide 
 for us, as well as the expected growth potential. 
The majority of the acquired goodwill is not deductible

 purposes. 
 During the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024, in connection

Factors that we considered when estimating the fair 
 value of our debt include market conditions, such as interest rates and credit 
spreads. 
 Derivative contracts 
 Derivative contracts are valued using quoted market prices and 
significant other observable inputs. 
Our derivative 
 instruments primarily include foreign currency forward agreements, forecasted 
inventory purchase commitments, 
 foreign currency forward contracts, interest rate swaps and total return swaps. 
 The fair values for the majority of our foreign currency derivative contracts 
are obtained by comparing our contract 
 rate to a published forward price of the underlying market rates, which 
are based on market rates for comparable 
 transactions that are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

, compared to 
 
 for the prior

The difference between our effective tax rate and the federal statutory tax rate primarily 
relates to state 
 and foreign income taxes and interest expense. 
 The Organization of Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) issued 
technical and administrative 
 guidance on Pillar Two rules in December 2021, which provides for a global minimum tax rate on the earnings of 
 large multinational businesses on a country-by-country basis. 
Effective January 1, 2024, the minimum global tax 
 rate is 15 for various jurisdictions pursuant to the Pillar Two rules. 
As of September 28, 2024, 
the impact of the 
 Pillar Two rules to our financial statements was immaterial. 
As we operate in jurisdictions which have adopted 
 Pillar Two, 
we are continuing to analyze the implications to effectively manage the impact 
for 2024 and beyond. 

 Future tax reform resulting from these developments may result in changes 
to long-standing tax principles, which 
 may adversely impact our effective tax rate going forward or result in higher cash 
tax liabilities. 
 The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits, which are included in 
 other liabilities within our condensed 
 consolidated balance sheets, as of September 28, 2024 and December 30, 
2023, was 

million and 

million, 
 respectively, of which 

million and 

million, respectively, would affect the effective tax rate if recognized. 

 It is possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will 
change in the next 12 months, which may result in a 
 material impact on our condensed consolidated statements of income. 
 All tax returns audited by the IRS are officially closed through 2020. 
The tax years subject to examination by the 
 IRS include years 2021 and forward. 
In addition, limited positions reported in the 2017 tax year are subject 
to IRS 
 examination. 
 The amount of tax interest expense included as a component of the provision 
for taxes was 

million and 
 
 million for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 
30, 2023, 
respectively.

The restructuring costs for these periods 
 primarily related to severance and employee-related costs, accelerated amortization

 fixed assets, and other exit costs. 
We expect to record immaterial charges associated with the 2022 Plan during the

 number of those cases). 
Generally, the lawsuits allege that the manufacturers of prescription opioid drugs engaged 
 in a false advertising campaign to expand the market for such drugs and 
their own market share and that the entities 
 in the supply chain (including Henry Schein, Inc. and its subsidiaries) reaped 
financial rewards by refusing or 
 otherwise failing to monitor appropriately and restrict the improper distribution 
of those drugs. 
These actions 
 consist of some that have been consolidated within the MultiDistrict Litigation MDL proceeding In Re National 
 Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804; Case No. 17-md-2804) 
and are currently stayed, and others which 
 remain pending in state courts and are proceeding independently and outside 
of the MDL. 
At this time, the 
 following case is set for trial: the action filed by Florida Health Sciences Center, Inc. (and 
 
 other hospitals located 
 throughout the State of Florida) in Florida state court, which is currently 
scheduled for a jury trial in September 
 2025. 
Of Henry Schein s 2023 net sales of approximately 

billion, sales of opioids represented less than 
 four
 -
 tenths of 1 percent. 
Opioids represent a negligible part of our business. 
We intend to defend ourselves vigorously 
 against these actions. 
 In August 2022, Henry Schein received a Grand Jury Subpoena from the United 
States Attorney s Office for the 
 Western District of Virginia, 
seeking documents in connection with an investigation of possible 
violations of the 
 Federal Food, Drug Cosmetic Act by Butler Animal Health Supply, LLC Butler ), a former subsidiary of 
 Henry Schein. 
The investigation relates to the sale of veterinary prescription drugs 
to certain customers. 
In 
 October 2022, Henry Schein received a second Grand Jury Subpoena 
from the United States Attorney s Office for 
 the Western District of Virginia. 
The October 2022 Subpoena seeks documents relating to payments Henry 
Schein 
 received from Butler or Covetrus, Inc. Covetrus ). 
Butler was spun off into a separate company and became a 
 subsidiary of Covetrus in 2019 and is no longer owned by Henry Schein.

 For these RSUs, we recognize the cost as compensation expense on a straight-line 
basis. 
 For all RSUs, we estimate the fair value based on our closing stock 
price on the grant date. 
With respect to 
 performance-based RSUs, the number of shares that ultimately vest and 
are received by the recipient is based upon 
 our performance as measured against specified targets over a specified period, as 
determined by the Compensation 
 Committee. 
Although there is no guarantee that performance targets will be achieved, we 
estimate the fair value of 
 performance-based RSUs based on our closing stock price at time of grant. 
 Each of the Plans provide for certain adjustments to the performance 
measurement in connection with awards under 
 the Plans. 
With respect to the performance-based RSUs granted under our 2024 Stock Incentive Plan, such 
 performance measurement adjustments relate to significant events, including, 
without limitation, acquisitions, 
 divestitures, new business ventures, certain capital transactions (including share 
repurchases), differences in 
 budgeted average outstanding shares (other than those resulting from capital 
transactions referred to above), 
 restructuring costs, if any, amortization expense recorded for acquisition-related intangible assets (solely with 
 respect to performance-based RSUs granted in the 2023 and 2024 plan years), 
certain litigation settlements or

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND 
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
 In accordance with the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities 
Litigation Reform Act of 1995, we 
 provide the following cautionary remarks regarding important factors 
that, among others, could cause future results 
 to differ materially from the forward-looking statements, expectations and assumptions 
expressed or implied 
 herein. 
All forward-looking statements made by us are subject to 
risks and uncertainties and are not guarantees of 
 future performance. 
These forward-looking statements involve known and unknown 
risks, uncertainties and other 
 factors that may cause our actual results, performance and achievements 
or industry results to be materially 
 different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such 
forward-looking 
 statements. 
These statements are generally identified by the use of such 
terms as may, could, expect, 
 intend, believe, plan, estimate, forecast, project, anticipate, 
 to be, to make or other comparable 
 terms. 
Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited 
to, those discussed in 
 the documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission 
(SEC), including our Annual Report on Form 
 10-K. 

 Risk factors and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from 
current and historical results 
 include, but are not limited to: our dependence on third parties for 
the manufacture and supply of our products; our 
 ability to develop or acquire and maintain and protect new products (particularly 
technology products) and 
 technologies that achieve market acceptance with acceptable margins; transitional 
challenges associated with 
 acquisitions, dispositions and joint ventures, including the failure 
to achieve anticipated synergies/benefits, as well 
 as significant demands on our operations, information systems, 
legal, regulatory, compliance, financial and human 
 resources functions in connection with acquisitions, dispositions and 
joint ventures; certain provisions in our 
 governing documents that may discourage third-party acquisitions of us; adverse 
changes in supplier rebates or 
 other purchasing incentives; risks related to the sale of corporate brand products; 
security risks associated with our 
 information systems and technology products and services, such as 
cyberattacks or other privacy or data security 
 breaches (including the October 2023 incident); effects of a highly competitive (including, without 
limitation, 
 competition from third-party online commerce sites) and consolidating 
market; changes in the health care industry; 
 risks from expansion of customer purchasing power and multi-tiered 
costing structures; increases in shipping costs 
 for our products or other service issues with our third-party shippers; general 
global and domestic macro-economic 
 and political conditions, including inflation, deflation, recession, ongoing 
wars, fluctuations in energy pricing and 
 the value of the U.S. dollar as compared to foreign currencies, and changes 
to other economic indicators, 
 international trade agreements, potential trade barriers and terrorism; geopolitical 
wars; failure to comply with 
 existing and future regulatory requirements; risks associated with the EU Medical 
Device Regulation; failure to 
 comply with laws and regulations relating to health care fraud or other 
laws and regulations; failure to comply with 
 laws and regulations relating to the collection, storage and processing of 
sensitive personal information or standards 
 in electronic health records or transmissions; changes in tax legislation; 
risks related to product liability, intellectual 
 property and other claims; risks associated with customs policies 
or legislative import restrictions; risks associated 
 with disease outbreaks, epidemics, pandemics (such as the COVID-19 
pandemic), or similar wide-spread public 
 health concerns and other natural or man-made disasters; risks associated with our 
global operations; litigation 
 risks; new or unanticipated litigation developments and the status 
of litigation matters; our dependence on our 
 senior management, employee hiring and retention, and our relationships 
with customers, suppliers and 
 manufacturers; and disruptions in financial markets. 
The order in which these factors appear should not be 
 construed to indicate their relative importance or priority.
 We caution that these factors may not be exhaustive and that many of these factors are beyond our ability to control 
 or predict. 
Accordingly, any forward-looking statements contained herein should not be relied upon as a prediction 
 of actual results. 
We undertake no duty and have no obligation to update forward-looking statements except as 
 required by law.

 Where You 
Can Find Important Information
 We may disclose important information through one or more of the following channels: SEC filings, public 
 conference calls and webcasts, press releases, the investor relations 
page of our website (www.henryschein.com) 
 and the social media channels identified on the About Media Center page 
of our website.
 Recent Developments 
 While the U.S. economy has experienced inflationary pressures and 
strengthening of the U.S. dollar, their impacts 
 have not been material to our results of operations. 
Though inflation impacts both our revenues and costs, the 
depth 
 and breadth of our product portfolio often allows us to offer lower-cost national brand solutions 
or corporate brand 
 alternatives to our more price-sensitive customers who are unwilling to 
absorb price increases, thus positioning us 
 to protect our gross profit. 
 Cyber Incident 
 In October 2023 Henry Schein experienced a cyber incident that primarily 
affected the operations of our North 
 American and European dental and medical distribution businesses. 
Henry Schein One, our practice management 
 software, revenue cycle management and patient relationship management 
solutions business, was not affected, and 
 our manufacturing businesses were mostly unaffected. 
On November 22, 2023, we experienced a disruption of our 
 ecommerce platform and related applications, which was remediated. 
 During the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024, we had a 
sales decrease in our dental and medical 
 distribution businesses, which we believe was primarily a result of lower sales 
to episodic customers following last 
 year s cyber incident. 
We have a number of programs underway focused on re-establishing these customers. 
 We maintain cyber insurance, subject to certain retentions and policy limitations. 
With respect to the October 2023 
 cyber incident, we have a 60 million insurance policy, following a 5 million retention. 
During the three and nine 
 months ended September 28, 2024, we received insurance proceeds of 
 10 million and 20 million, respectively, 
 representing a partial insurance recovery of losses related to the cyber incident.

 Executive-Level Overview 
 Henry Schein, Inc. is a solutions company for health care professionals powered 
by a network of people and 
 technology. 

 We 
 believe we are the world s largest provider of health care products and services primarily to office-
 based dental and medical practitioners, as well as alternate sites of care. 

 We 
 serve more than one million customers 
 worldwide including dental practitioners, laboratories, physician practices and 
ambulatory surgery centers, as well 
 as government, institutional health care clinics and other alternate care clinics. 

 We 
 believe that we have a strong 
 brand identity due to our more than 92 years of experience distributing health 
care products.
 We are headquartered in Melville, New York, 
employ approximately 26,000 people (of which approximately 
 13,000 are based outside of the United States) and have operations or 
affiliates in 33 countries and territories. 
Our 
 broad global footprint has evolved over time through our organic success as well as 
through contribution from 
 strategic acquisitions.
 We 
 have established strategically located distribution centers around 
the world to enable us to better serve our 
 customers and increase our operating efficiency. 
This infrastructure, together with broad product and service 
 offerings at competitive prices, and a strong commitment to customer service, enables 
us to be a single source of 
 supply for our customers needs.
 While our primary go-to-market strategy is in our capacity as a distributor, we also market and sell our own 
 corporate brand portfolio of cost-effective, high-quality consumable merchandise products, 
including in vitro 
 diagnostic devices, manufacture certain dental specialty products in 
the areas of implants, orthodontics and 
 endodontics, manufacture drug products, and repackage/relabel prescription drugs 
and/or devices. 

 We 
 have 
 achieved scale in these global businesses primarily through acquisitions, as 
manufacturers of these products 
 typically do not utilize a distribution channel to serve customers.
 We 
 conduct our business through two reportable segments: (i) health 
care distribution and (ii) technology and 
 value-added services. 
These segments offer different products and services to the same customer base. 
Our global 
 dental businesses serve office-based dental practitioners, dental laboratories, schools, government 
and other 
 institutions. 
Our medical businesses serve physician offices, urgent care centers, ambulatory care sites, 
emergency 
 medical technicians, dialysis centers, home health, federal and state governments 
and large enterprises, such as 
 group practices, and integrated delivery networks, among other providers 
across a wide range of specialties. 

 The health care distribution reportable segment, combining our global dental and 
medical operating segments, 
 distributes consumable products, small equipment, laboratory products, large equipment, equipment 
repair services, 
 branded and generic pharmaceuticals, vaccines, surgical products, dental specialty 
products (including implant, 
 orthodontic and endodontic products), diagnostic tests, infection-control products, 
personal protective equipment 
 PPE products, vitamins and orthopedic implants. 

 Our global technology and value-added services business provides software, technology 
and other value-added 
 services to health care practitioners. 
Our technology business offerings include practice management software 
 systems for dental and medical practitioners. 
Our value-added practice solutions include practice consultancy, 
 education, revenue cycle management and financial services on a non-recourse 
basis, e-services, practice 
 technology, network and hardware services, as well as consulting, and continuing education services for 
 practitioners.
 A key element to grow closer to our customers is our One Schein initiative, which 
is a unified go-to-market 
 approach that enables practitioners to work synergistically with our supply chain, 
equipment sales and service and 
 other value-added services, allowing our customers to leverage the 
combined value that we offer through a single 
 program. 
Specifically, One Schein provides customers with streamlined access to our comprehensive offering of 
 national brand products, our corporate brand products and proprietary specialty 
products and solutions (including 
 implant, orthodontic and endodontic products). 
In addition, customers have access to a wide range of services, 
 including software and other value-added services.

 Industry Overview
 In recent years, the health care industry has increasingly focused on cost containment. 
This trend has benefited 
 distributors capable of providing a broad array of products and services at low 
prices. 
It also has accelerated the 
 growth of HMOs, group practices, other managed care accounts and collective buying 
groups, which, in addition to 
 their emphasis on obtaining products at competitive prices, tend to favor distributors 
capable of providing 
 specialized management information support. 

 We 
 believe that the trend towards cost containment has the potential 
 to favorably affect demand for technology solutions, including software, which can 
enhance the efficiency and 
 facilitation of practice management.
 Our operating results in recent years have been significantly affected by strategies 
and transactions that we 
 undertook to expand our business, domestically and internationally, in part to address significant changes in the 
 health care industry, including consolidation of health care distribution companies, health care reform, trends 
 toward managed care, cuts in Medicare and collective purchasing arrangements.
 Industry Consolidation
 The health care products distribution industry, as it relates to office-based health care practitioners, is fragmented 
 and diverse. 
The industry ranges from sole practitioners working out of 
relatively small offices to group practices 
 or service organizations ranging in size from a few practitioners to a large number of practitioners who have 
 combined or otherwise associated their practices.
 Due in part to the inability of office-based health care practitioners to store and manage 
large quantities of supplies 
 in their offices, the distribution of health care supplies and small equipment to office-based health 
care practitioners 
 has been characterized by frequent, small quantity orders, and a need for rapid, 
reliable and substantially complete 
 order fulfillment. 
The purchasing decisions within an office-based health care practice are typically 
made by the 
 practitioner or an administrative assistant. 
Supplies and small equipment are generally purchased from more 
than 
 one distributor, with one generally serving as the primary supplier.
 The trend of consolidation extends to our customer base. 
Health care practitioners are increasingly seeking to 
 partner, affiliate or combine with larger entities such as hospitals, health systems, group practices or physician 
 hospital organizations. 
In many cases, purchasing decisions for consolidated groups 
are made at a centralized or 
 professional staff level; however, orders are delivered to the practitioners offices.
 We 
 believe that consolidation within the industry will continue to 
result in a number of distributors, particularly 
 those with limited financial, operating and marketing resources, seeking to 
combine with larger companies that can 
 provide growth opportunities. 
This consolidation also may continue to result in distributors seeking 
to acquire 
 companies that can enhance their current product and service offerings or provide 
opportunities to serve a broader 
 customer base.
 Our approach to acquisitions and joint ventures has been to expand our role as 
a provider of products and services 
 to the health care industry. 
This trend has resulted in our expansion into service areas that complement 
our existing 
 operations and provide opportunities for us to develop synergies with, and thus strengthen, the acquired 
businesses.
 As industry consolidation continues, we believe that we are positioned to 
capitalize on this trend, as we believe we 
 have the ability to support increased sales through our existing infrastructure, although 
there can be no assurances 
 that we will be able to successfully accomplish this. 

 We 
 are focused on building relationships with decision makers 
 who do not reside in the office-based practitioner setting.
 As the health care industry continues to change, we continually evaluate possible 
candidates for joint venture or 
 acquisition and intend to continue to seek opportunities to expand our 
role as a provider of products and services to 
 the health care industry. 
There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully pursue 
any such 
 opportunity or consummate any such transaction, if pursued. 
If additional transactions are entered into or 
 consummated, we would incur merger and/or acquisition-related costs, and there 
can be no assurance that the 
 integration efforts associated with any such transaction would be successful.

 Aging Population and Other Market Influences
 The health care products distribution industry continues to experience growth 
due to the aging population, 
 increased health care awareness, the proliferation of medical technology 
and testing, new pharmacological 
 treatments, and expanded third-party insurance coverage, partially offset by the effects of unemployment 
on 
 insurance coverage. 
In addition, the physician market continues to benefit from the 
shift of procedures and 
 diagnostic testing from acute care settings to alternate-care sites, particularly 
physicians offices.
 According to the U.S. Census Bureau s International Database, between 2024 
and 2034, the 45 and older 
 population is expected to grow by approximately 11 . 
Between 2024 and 2044, this age group is expected to grow 
 by approximately 20 . 
This compares with expected total U.S. population growth 
rates of approximately 6 
 between 2024 and 2034 
and approximately 11 between 2024 and 2044.
 According to the U.S. Census Bureau s International Database, in 2024 
there are approximately seven million 
 Americans aged 85 years or older, the segment of the population most in need of long-term care 
and elder-care 
 services. 
By the year 2050, that number is projected to nearly triple to approximately 
19 million. 
The population 
 aged 65 to 84 years is projected to increase by approximately 20 during 
the same period.
 As a result of these market dynamics, annual expenditures for health 
care services continue to increase in the 
 United States. 
We believe that demand for our products and services will grow while continuing to be impacted by 
 current and future operating, economic, and industry conditions. 
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services 
 CMS published National Health Expenditure Data indicating that total 
national health care spending reached 
 approximately 4.5 trillion in 2022, or 17.3 of the nation s gross domestic product, the benchmark 
measure for 
 annual production of goods and services in the United States. 
Health care spending is projected to reach 
 approximately 7.7 trillion by 2032, or 19.7 of the nation s projected gross domestic product.
 Government
 Certain of our businesses involve the distribution, manufacturing, importation, 
exportation, marketing, sale and 
 promotion of pharmaceuticals and/or medical devices, and in this regard, we 
are subject to extensive local, state, 
 federal and foreign governmental laws and regulations, including as applicable 
to our wholesale distribution of 
 pharmaceuticals and medical devices, manufacturing activities, and as part of 
our specialty home medical supply 
 businesses that distribute and sell medical equipment and supplies directly 
to patients. 
Federal, state and certain 
 foreign governments have also increased enforcement activity in the health care 
sector, particularly in areas of fraud 
 and abuse, anti-bribery and anti-corruption, controlled substances handling, 
medical device regulations and data 
 privacy and security standards.
 Certain of our businesses involve pharmaceuticals and/or medical devices, 
including in vitro diagnostic devices, 
 that are paid for by third parties and must operate in compliance with a variety of 
burdensome and complex coding, 
 billing and record-keeping requirements in order to substantiate claims for 
payment under federal, state and 
 commercial healthcare reimbursement programs.
 Government and private insurance programs fund a large portion of the total cost of medical care, 
and there have 
 been efforts to limit such private and government insurance programs, including efforts, thus far 
unsuccessful, to 
 seek repeal of the entire United States Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, 
as amended by the Health Care 
 and Education Reconciliation Act, each enacted in March 2010.
 Certain of our businesses are subject to various additional federal, state, 
local and foreign laws and regulations, 
 including with respect to the sale, transportation, importation, storage, handling 
and disposal of hazardous or 
 potentially hazardous substances; forever chemicals such as per-and 
polyfluoroalkyl substances; amalgam bans; 
 pricing disclosures; supply chain transparency around labor practices; and safe working 
conditions. 
In addition, 
 activities to control medical costs, including laws and regulations lowering 
reimbursement rates for 
 pharmaceuticals, medical devices, medical supplies and/or medical treatments 
or services, are ongoing. 
CMS 
 recently released the 2024 durable medical equipment, prosthetics, orthotics 
and supplies DMEPOS 

Table of Contents 
 42 
 reimbursement schedule, which, effective January 1, 2024, reduced the DMEPOS reimbursement 
rates for non-
 rural suppliers, such as us, by removing the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, 
and Economic Security (aka CARES) Act 
 relief rates in effect during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
This and other laws and regulations are subject to change and 
 their evolving implementation may impact our operations and our 
financial performance. 
 Our businesses are generally subject to numerous laws and regulations that could 
impact our financial performance, 
 and failure to comply with such laws or regulations could have a material adverse 
effect on our business.
 A more detailed discussion of governmental laws and regulations 
is included in Management s Discussion

in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the 
 fiscal year ended December 30, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 28, 2024.

 Plans of Restructuring 
 On August 1, 2022, we committed to a restructuring plan (the 2022 Plan 
focused on funding the priorities of the 
 BOLD+1 strategic plan, streamlining operations and other initiatives to 
increase efficiency. 
The 2022 Plan has 
 been completed as of July 31, 2024. 
During the three months ended September 28, 2024 and 
September 30, 2023, 
 in connection with our 2022 Plan, we recorded restructuring costs of 
 12 million and 11 million, respectively. 

 During the nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, 
in connection with our 2022 Plan, we 
 recorded restructuring costs of 37 million and 59 million, respectively. 
The restructuring costs for these periods 
 primarily related to severance and employee-related costs, accelerated amortization 
of right-of-use lease assets and 
 fixed assets, and other exit costs. 
We expect to record immaterial charges associated with the 2022 Plan during the 
 remainder of 2024. 

 On August 6, 2024, we committed to a new restructuring plan (the 2024 
Plan to integrate recent acquisitions, 
 right-size operations and further increase efficiencies. 
During the three and nine months ended September 28, 
 2024, we recorded restructuring charges associated with the 2024 Plan of 36 million 
which primarily related to 
 severance and employee-related costs, accelerated amortization of right-of-use 
lease assets and fixed assets, and 
 other lease exit costs. 
We expect to record restructuring charges associated with the 2024 Plan during the fourth 
 quarter of 2024 and in 2025, however an estimate of the amount of these charges has not 
yet been determined.

 Global Sales 
 Global net sales for the three months ended September 28, 2024 increased 0.4 . 
The components of our sales 
 growth are presented in the table above.
 The 2.6 decrease in our internally generated local currency sales was primarily 
attributable to the slower than 
 anticipated pace of recovery from the cyber incident, the challenging economic 
environment in certain markets and 
 lower sales of PPE products and COVID-19 test kits, partially offset by sales growth in 
dental equipment and dental 
 specialty products. 
For the three months ended September 28, 2024, the estimated 
decrease in internally generated 
 local currency sales, excluding PPE products and COVID-19 
test kits, was 2.2 . 
 We estimate that sales of PPE products and COVID-19 test kits were approximately 157 million and 175 million 
 for the three months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, 
respectively, representing an estimated 
 decrease of 18 million, or 10.1 versus the prior year, with the 18 million net decrease year-over-year 
 representing 0.6 of global net sales for the three months ended September 
28, 2024.

 Dental
 Dental net sales for the three months ended September 28, 2024 decreased 1.6 . 
The components of our sales 
 decline are presented in the table above. 
 The decrease in local currency sales was attributable to a 1.6 decrease 
in internally generated local currency sales 
 of dental merchandise, 
partially offset by an increase in internally generated local currency sales of dental 
 equipment and dental specialty products and sales from entities acquired 
during the twelve months ended 
 September 28, 2024. 
The decrease in internally generated local currency sales 
of dental merchandise was primarily 
 attributable to the slower than anticipated pace of recovery from 
the cyber incident, 
the challenging economic 
 environment in certain markets, and lower sales of PPE products. 
The increase in internally generated local 
 currency sales of dental equipment was primarily attributable to certain 
international markets and traditional 
 equipment and our parts and service business in North America, partially offset by 
a decline in digital imaging in 
 North America. 
 We estimate that sales of PPE products were approximately 72 million and 83 million for the three months ended 
 September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively, representing an estimated decrease of 11 million, or 
 13.0 versus the prior year, with the 11 million net decrease year-over-year representing 0.6 of dental net sales 
 for the three months ended September 28, 2024. 
The decrease in sales of PPE products was primarily due to lower 
 glove prices. 
The estimated decrease in internally generated local currency 
sales, excluding PPE products, 
was 
 1.0 . 

 Medical 
 Medical net sales for the three months ended September 28, 2024 
increased 2.9 . 
The components of our sales 
 growth are presented in the table above. 
 The increase in local currency sales was attributable to our expansion 
in the Home Solutions market, 
including the 
 acquisition of Shield Healthcare during the year ended December 
30, 2023, and our acquisition of TriMed, Inc. 
 during the second quarter of 2024, partially offset by a 4.8 decrease in internally 
generated local currency medical 
 sales, resulting from 
the slower than anticipated pace of recovery from the cyber incident, 
the conversion of 
 certain pharmaceutical products 
to lower priced generics, 
and lower sales of influenza vaccines, 
PPE products and 
 COVID-19 test kits. 
 We estimate that sales of PPE products and COVID-19 test kits were approximately 85 million and 92 million 
 for the three months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, 
respectively, representing an estimated 
 decrease of 7 million, or 7.5 
versus the prior year, with the 7 million net decrease year-over-year representing 
 0.6 of medical net sales for the three months ended September 28, 2024. 
The decrease in sales of these products 
 was primarily due to lower market prices of PPE products (primarily lower 
glove pricing). 
The estimated decrease 
 in internally generated local currency sales, excluding PPE 
products and COVID-19 test kits, 
was 4.6 .
 Technology and value-added services 
 Technology and value-added services net sales for the three months ended September 28, 2024 increased 5.1 . 

 The components of our sales growth are presented in the table above. 
The internally generated local currency 
 increase in technology and value-added services sales was primarily attributable 
to entities acquired during the 
 twelve months ended September 28, 2024, 
a continued increase in the number of cloud-based users of our practice 
 management software and an increase in revenue cycle management solutions.

 As a result of different practices of categorizing costs associated with distribution networks 
throughout our 
 industry, our gross margins may not necessarily be comparable to other distribution companies. 
Additionally, we 
 realize substantially higher gross margin percentages in our technology and value-added services 
segment than in 
 our health care distribution segment. 
These higher gross margins result from being both the developer and seller of 
 software products and services, as well as certain financial services. 
The software industry typically realizes higher 
 gross margins to recover investments in product development. 
 Within our health care distribution segment, gross profit margins may vary between the periods as a result of 
the 
 changes in the mix of products sold as well as changes in our customer 
mix. 
For example, sales of our corporate 
 brand and certain specialty products achieve gross profit margins that are higher than 
average total gross profit 
 margins of all products. 
With respect to customer mix, sales to our large-group customers are typically completed 
 at lower gross margins due to the higher volumes sold as opposed to the gross margin on sales to office-based 
 practitioners, who normally purchase lower volumes. 

 Health care distribution gross profit for the three months ended September 
28, 2024 was relatively flat compared to 
 the prior-year-period. 
 Technology and value-added services gross profit increased as a result of gross profit from acquisitions, partially 
 offset by lower internally generated sales.

 distribution segment, partially offset by a gain of 19 million related to the remeasurement 
to fair value of a 
 previously held equity investment within our healthcare distribution segment.

 During the three months ended September 28, 2024, 
we also incurred 1 million of expenses, within our health care 
 distribution segment, directly related to the cyber incident, 
mostly consisting of professional fees. 
During the three 
 months ended September 28, 2024, we received insurance proceeds of 
 10 million, recorded as a reduction of 
 selling, general and administrative expenses, representing a partial 
insurance recovery of losses related to the cyber 
 incident.

 Income Taxes 
 Our effective tax rate was 24.7 for the three months ended September 28, 2024, compared 
to 21.9 for the prior 
 year period. 
The difference between our effective and federal statutory tax rates 
primarily relates to state and 
 foreign income taxes and interest expense. 
 The Organization of Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) issued 
technical and administrative 
 guidance on Pillar Two rules in December 2021, which provides for a global minimum tax rate on the earnings of 
 large multinational businesses on a country-by-country basis. 
Effective January 1, 2024, the minimum global tax 
 rate is 15 for various jurisdictions pursuant to the Pillar Two rules. 
As of September 28, 2024, the impact of the 
 Pillar Two rules to our financial statements was immaterial. 
As we operate in jurisdictions which have adopted 
 Pillar Two, we are continuing to analyze the implications to effectively manage the impact for 2024 and beyond. 

 Future tax reform resulting from these developments may result in changes 
to long-standing tax principles, which 
 may adversely impact our effective tax rate going forward or result in higher cash 
tax liabilities.

 Global Sales 
 Global net sales for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 increased 1.7 . 
The components of our sales 
 growth are presented in the table above.
 The 2.3 decrease in our internally generated local currency sales was primarily 
attributable to the slower than 
 anticipated pace of recovery from the cyber incident, the challenging economic 
environment in certain markets and 
 lower sales of PPE products. 
For the nine months ended September 28, 2024, the estimated decrease 
in internally 
 generated local currency sales, excluding PPE products and COVID-19 
test kits, was 1.7 .
 We estimate that sales of PPE products and COVID-19 test kits were approximately 478 million and 540 million 
 for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, 
respectively, representing an estimated 
 decrease of 62 million, or 11.3

 Dental
 Dental net sales for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 decreased 
0.8 . 
The components of our sales 
 decline are presented in the table above. 

 The decrease in local currency sales was attributable to a decrease 
in internally generated local currency sales for 
 dental merchandise of 2.2 , 
partially offset by sales growth in internally generated local currency sales for dental 
 equipment and dental specialty products. 
The decrease in internally generated local currency sales of dental 
 merchandise was primarily attributable to the slower than anticipated pace 
of recovery from the cyber incident, the 
 challenging economic environment in certain markets, and lower sales 
of PPE products. 
Our sales growth in 
 internally generated local currency sales for dental equipment was primarily 
due to growth in North America for 
 traditional equipment and our parts and service business, partially offset by lower North American 
digital 
 equipment sales and declines in certain international markets, and some 
sales shifting into the first quarter of 2024 
 due to the delay of equipment installations during the fourth quarter of 2023 
resulting from the impact of the cyber 
 incident. 
 We estimate that sales of PPE products were approximately 228 million and 264 million for the nine months 
 ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively, representing an estimated decrease of 36 
 million, or 13.4 
versus the prior year, with the 36 million net decrease year-over-year representing 0.6 
of 
 dental net sales for the nine months ended September 28, 2024. 
The decrease in sales of PPE products was 
 primarily due to lower glove prices and reduced demand following the 
cyber incident. 
The estimated decrease in 
 internally generated local currency sales, excluding PPE products, 
was 1.6 . 

 Medical 
 Medical net sales for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 increased 
5.0 . 
The components of our sales 
 growth are presented in the table above. 
 The increase in local currency sales was attributable to our expansion 
in the Home Solutions market, 
including the 
 acquisition of Shield Healthcare during the year ended December 30, 2023, 
offset by a decrease of 3.3 in 
 internally generated local currency medical sales, resulting from the slower 
than anticipated pace of recovery from 
 the cyber incident, the conversion of certain pharmaceutical products to lower 
priced generics, and lower sales of 
 PPE products and influenza vaccines, 
partially offset by strong sales of point-of-care diagnostics including multi-
 assay flu/COVID combination test kits. 
 We estimate that sales of PPE products and COVID-19 test kits were approximately 250 million and 276 million 
 for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, 
respectively, representing an estimated 
 decrease of 26 million, or 9.4 versus the prior year, with the 26 million net decrease year-over-year 
 representing 0.8 of medical net sales for the nine months ended September 
28, 2024. 
The decrease in sales of 
 these products was primarily due to lower market prices of PPE products (primarily 
lower glove pricing). 
The 
 estimated decrease in internally generated local currency sales, excluding 
PPE products and COVID-19 test kits, 
 was 2.6 .
 Technology and value-added services 
 Technology and value-added services net sales for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 increased 9.7 . 
The 
 components of our sales growth are presented in the table above. 
The internally generated local currency increase 
 of 1.9 in technology and value-added services sales was primarily 
attributable to a continued increase in the 
 number of cloud-based users of our practice management software and an 
increase in revenue cycle management 
 solutions and our analytical products.

 We 
 also recorded an increase of 38 million in accrued contingent consideration

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our principal capital requirements have included funding of acquisitions, purchases 
of additional noncontrolling 
 interests, repayments of debt principal, the funding of working capital needs, 
purchases of fixed assets and 
 repurchases of common stock. 
Working capital requirements generally result from increased sales, special 
 inventory forward buy-in opportunities and payment terms for receivables 
and payables. 
Historically, sales have 
 tended to be stronger during the second half of the year and special inventory 
forward buy-in opportunities have 
 been most prevalent just before the end of the year, and have caused our working capital requirements 
to be higher 
 from the end of the third quarter to the end of the first quarter of 
the following year. 
 We finance our business primarily through cash generated from our operations, revolving credit facilities and debt 
 placements. 
Please see 
 Note 8 Debt 
 
for further information. 
Our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from 
 operations is dependent on the continued demand of our customers 
for our products and services, and access to 
 products and services from our suppliers. 
 Our business requires a substantial investment in working capital, which 
is susceptible to fluctuations during the 
 year as a result of inventory purchase patterns and seasonal demands. 
Inventory purchase activity is a function of 
 sales activity, special inventory forward buy-in opportunities and our desired level of inventory. 
We anticipate 
 future increases in our working capital requirements. 
 We finance our business to provide adequate funding for at least 12 months. 
Funding requirements are based on 
 forecasted profitability and working capital needs, which, on occasion, may 
change. 
Consequently, we may change 
 our funding structure to reflect any new requirements. 
 We believe that our cash and cash equivalents, our ability to access private debt markets and public equity markets, 
 and our available funds under existing credit facilities provide us with 
sufficient liquidity to meet our currently 
 foreseeable short-term and long-term capital needs. 
 Our acquisition strategy is focused on investments in companies that 
add new customers and sales teams, increase 
 our geographic footprint (whether entering a new country, such as emerging markets, or building scale where we 
 have already invested in businesses), and finally, those that enable us to access new products and technologies. 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 644 million for the 
nine months ended September 28, 2024, 
 compared to net cash provided by operating activities of 532 million for 
the prior year. 
The net change of 112 
 million was primarily attributable to changes in working capital accounts, 
primarily accounts receivable and 
 inventory; partially offset by lower cash net income. 
During the nine months ended September 28, 2024, the cyber 
 incident had several residual impacts to the operating cash flows from our 
working capital, net of acquisitions, 
 including an increase in operating cash flows from accounts receivable due 
to improved collection levels and 
 decreased cash flows from accounts payable and accrued expenses resulting 
from previously delayed payments. 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 372 million for the nine 
months ended September 28, 2024, compared to 
 net cash used in investing activities of 808 million for the prior year. 
The net change of 436 million was 
 primarily attributable to decreased payments for equity investments 
and business acquisitions. 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 306 million for the nine 
months ended September 28, 2024, compared to 
 net cash provided by financing activities of 307 million for the 
prior year. 
The net change of 613 million was 
 primarily due to decreased net borrowings from debt to finance our investments 
and increased acquisitions of 
 noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries and increased repurchases of common 
stock.

 Includes 341 million and 284 million of certain accounts receivable which serve as security for U.S. trade accounts receivable 
 securitization at September 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, respectively. 
 Our cash and cash equivalents consist of bank balances and investments 
in money market funds representing 
 overnight investments with a high degree of liquidity. 
 Accounts receivable days sales outstanding and inventory turns 
 Our accounts receivable days sales outstanding from operations 
increased to 48.6 days as of September 28, 2024 
 from 43.7 days as of September 30, 2023, which was primarily attributable 
to the impact of the cyber incident. 

 During the nine months ended September 28, 2024, we wrote off approximately 7 
million of fully reserved 
 accounts receivable against our trade receivable reserve. 
Our inventory turns from operations increased to 5.0 as of 
 September 28, 2024 from 4.5 as of September 30, 2023. 
Our working capital accounts may be impacted by current 
 and future economic conditions. 
 Leases 
 We 
 have operating and finance leases for corporate offices, office space, distribution and other facilities, 
vehicles 
 and certain equipment. 
Our leases have remaining terms of approximately one year 
to approximately 17 years, 
 some of which may include options to extend the leases for up to 15 years. 
As of September 28, 2024, our right-of-
 use assets related to operating leases were 304 million and our current and non-current 
operating lease liabilities 
 were 77 million and 262 million, respectively. 
 Stock Repurchases 
 On July 31, 2024 our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up 
to an additional 500 million in shares of 
 our common stock. 
 From March 3, 2003 through September 28, 2024, we repurchased 5.1 
billion, or 94,763,315 shares, under our 
 common stock repurchase programs, with 455 million available 
as of September 28, 2024 for future common 
 stock share repurchases. 
Subject to market conditions and other factors, we plan to continue 
to accelerate our share 
 repurchase activity in light of our favorable cash position. 
 Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests 
 Some minority stockholders in certain of our subsidiaries have the right, 
at certain times, to require us to acquire 
 their ownership interest in those entities at fair value. 
Accounting Standards Codification Topic 480-10 is 
 applicable for noncontrolling interests where we are or may be required 
to purchase all or a portion of the 
 outstanding interest in a consolidated subsidiary from the noncontrolling 
interest holder under the terms of a put 
 option contained in contractual agreements. 
As of September 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, our balance 
for

 ITEM 4. 
CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
 Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including 
our principal executive officer and 
 principal financial officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and 
 procedures as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report 
as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) 
 and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as 
amended (the Exchange Act ). 
Based 
 on this evaluation, our management, including our principal executive 
officer and principal financial officer, 
 concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 28, 
2024, to ensure that all 
 material information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file 
or submit under the Exchange Act is 
 accumulated and communicated to them as appropriate to allow timely 
decisions regarding required disclosure and 
 that all such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported 
within the time periods specified in the 
 SEC s rules and forms, and the rules of the Nasdaq stock exchange.
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
 The combination of acquisitions, 
including the acquisition of TriMed Inc. TriMed ), continued acquisition 
 integrations and systems implementation activity undertaken during 
the quarter and carried over from prior quarters 
 when considered in the aggregate, represents a material change in our internal 
control over financial reporting. As 
 previously reported, the full integration of TriMed will extend beyond year-end and, therefore, we anticipate 
 excluding TriMed from our annual assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 
28, 2024, 
 as permitted by related SEC staff interpretive guidance for newly acquired businesses.
 During the quarter ended September 28, 2024, we completed the acquisition 
of a dental distribution business and 
 acquired a controlling interest of a dental affiliate in Europe. 
Also, post-acquisition integration related activities 
 continued for our dental and medical businesses acquired during prior quarters. 
These acquisitions, the majority of 
 which utilize separate information and financial accounting systems, 
have been included in our condensed 
 consolidated financial statements since their respective dates of acquisition.
 Also, during the quarter ended September 28, 2024, we completed the 
systems implementation activities for 
 implementing a new e-commerce system for certain dental distribution 
businesses in the UK and Ireland. 

 Additionally, we completed the systems implementation activities related to the integration of a previously acquired 
 Australian medical distribution business into our existing Australian 
ERP system. 
Finally, we continued systems 
 implementation activities for two of our dental distribution businesses in France 
and Brazil.
 All acquisitions, continued acquisition integrations and systems implementation 
activities involve necessary and 
 appropriate change-management controls that are considered in our quarterly 
assessment of the design and 
 operating effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.
 The deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting identified 
as of December 30, 2023 at the application 
 control level related to logical and user access management and segregation 
of duties have continued to be the 
 subject of ongoing remediation including implementation of specific 
action plans and the testing/validation of 
 control operating effectiveness, which are expected to be substantially completed prior to year-end.
 Limitations of the Effectiveness of Internal Control 
 A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide 
only reasonable, not absolute, assurance 
 that the objectives of the internal control system are met. 
Because of the inherent limitations of any internal control 
 system, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that 
all control issues, if any, within a company 
 have been detected.

 ITEM 2. 
UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES 
AND USE OF PROCEEDS
 Purchases of equity securities by the issuer 
 Our share repurchase program, announced on March 3, 2003, originally 
allowed us to repurchase up to two million 
 shares pre-stock splits (eight million shares post-stock splits) of our common 
stock, which represented 
 approximately 2.3 of the shares outstanding at the commencement 
of the program. 
Subsequent additional 
 increases totaling 4.9 
billion, authorized by our Board of Directors, to the repurchase program 
provide for a total 
 of 5.5 billion (including 500 million authorized on July 31, 2024) of shares of 
our common stock to be 
 repurchased under this program. 
 As of September 28, 2024, we had repurchased approximately 5.1 billion 
of common stock (94,763,315 shares) 
 under these initiatives, with 455 million available for future common 
stock share repurchases. 
 The following table summarizes repurchases of our common stock
