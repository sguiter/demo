 (1) In Fiscal 2023, the total borrowing base availability and credit facility availability were both calculated net of the excess availability threshold, as prior to the Seventh Amendment, crossing that threshold would have resulted in cash dominion, which would have triggered a fixed charge coverage ratio covenant test and would likely have led to a default under the Credit Agreement. As of the Seventh Amendment, the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant has been removed from the Credit Agreement, and entering into cash dominion by crossing the excess availability threshold no longer poses the same risk of default under the Credit Agreement.

 million in fees, costs and incentive awards. The balance of funds initially reserved for the plaintiff counsel s fees and costs will now be issued as a single, final round of merchandise vouchers for qualified class members. In connection with the settlement, the Company recorded a reserve for million in its consolidated financial statements in the first quarter of 2017. Following the court s recent decision(s), the Company released million from its previously established reserve during the First Quarter 2024. 
 Similar to the Rael case above, the Company is also a defendant in Gabriela Gonzalez v. The Children s Place, Inc. , a purported class action, pending in the U.S. District Court, Central District of California. The plaintiff alleged that the Company had falsely advertised discounts that do not exist, in violation of California s Unfair Competition Laws, False Advertising Law and the California Consumer Legal Remedies Act. The Company filed a motion to compel arbitration, which the plaintiff did not oppose, and the court granted the motion on August 17, 2022 staying the case pending the outcome of the arbitration. The demand for arbitration was filed on October 4, 2022, in connection with the individual claim of the plaintiff. A mass arbitration firm associated with plaintiff s counsel then conducted an advertising campaign for claimants to conduct a mass arbitration. In part, to avoid the mass arbitration, the parties stipulated to return the original plaintiff s claim to court to proceed as a class action. Accordingly, the arbitration would not be proceeding and the Company s response to the original plaintiff s complaint in court was filed on July 20, 2023. On August 16, 2023, however, the Company began to receive notices regarding an initial tranche of approximately individual demands that were filed with Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc. JAMS as part of a related mass arbitration claim. The parties participated in mediation proceedings on November 15, 2023 and February 9, 2024. The parties agreed to further discuss settlement options in May 2024, which occurred without resolution. In late May, due to the judge s retirement, the Gonzalez action was transferred and reassigned to a different judge. Deadlines were therefore reset, including the Company s motion to dismiss. On June 10, 2024, JAMS advised that it would be pausing its administration of the claims until the parties resolve their dispute over which set of arbitration terms apply to the case. The Company s motion to dismiss was denied in November 2024. 
 As of February 2024, the Company was also a defendant in Randeep Singh Khalsa v. The Children s Place, Inc. et al. , a purported class action, pending in the United States District Court of New Jersey. The complaint purported to assert claims under the federal securities laws, alleging that between March 16, 2023, and February 8, 2024, the Company made materially false and/or misleading statements, and failed to disclose material adverse facts to its investors, which the complaint alleged led to a drop in the price of the Company s common stock. As of November 20, 2024, this case has been dismissed in its entirety, with prejudice. 
 The Company is also involved in various legal proceedings arising in the normal course of business. In the opinion of management, any ultimate liability arising out of these proceedings is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

 million share repurchase program (the Share Repurchase Program ). Under this program, the Company may repurchase shares on the open market at current market prices at the time of purchase or in privately negotiated transactions. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased under the program will depend on a variety of factors, including price, corporate and regulatory requirements, and other market and business conditions. The Company may suspend or discontinue the program at any time and may thereafter reinstitute purchases, all without prior announcement. Currently, given the terms of the Company s Credit Agreement as amended by its Seventh Amendment described above, the Company is not expecting to repurchase any shares in Fiscal 2024, except as described below, pursuant to our practice as a result of our insider trading policy. As of November 2, 2024, there was million remaining availability under the Share Repurchase Program. 
 Pursuant to the Company s practice, including due to restrictions imposed by the Company s insider trading policy during black-out periods, the Company withholds and repurchases shares of vesting stock awards and makes payments to taxing authorities as required by law to satisfy the withholding tax requirements of all equity award recipients. The Company s payment of the withholding taxes in exchange for the surrendered shares constitutes a repurchase of its common stock. The Company also acquires shares of its common stock in conjunction with liabilities owed under the Company s deferred compensation plan, which are held in treasury. 
 Shares acquired and held in treasury 
 In accordance with the FASB ASC 505 Equity , the par value of the shares retired is charged against Common stock and the remaining purchase price is allocated between Additional paid-in capital and Accumulated deficit. The portion charged against Additional paid-in capital is determined using a pro-rata allocation based on total shares outstanding. 
 Dividends 
 Future declarations of quarterly dividends and the establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to approval by the Company s Board of Directors based on a number of factors, including business and market conditions, the Company s financial performance, and other investment priorities. Currently, given the terms of the Credit Agreement as amended by the Seventh Amendment as described above, the Company is not expecting to pay any cash dividends in Fiscal 2024.

 million at November 2, 2024, was approximately million. The fair value of the Company s New Mithaq Term Loan with a carrying value (gross of debt issuance costs) of million at November 2, 2024, was approximately million. The fair value of debt was estimated using a market approach, which considers the Company s credit risk and market related conditions, and is therefore within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 
 The Company s non-financial assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include long-lived assets, such as intangible assets, fixed assets, and ROU assets. The Company reviews the carrying amounts of such assets when events indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Any resulting asset impairment would require that the asset be recorded at its fair value. The resulting fair value measurements of the assets are considered to fall within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. 
 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 
 The fair value of the Company s long-lived assets is primarily calculated using a discounted cash-flow model directly associated with those assets, which consist principally of property and equipment and ROU assets. These assets are tested for impairment when events indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. 
 The Company performed periodic quantitative impairment assessments of its long-lived assets and did t record an impairment charge in the Third Quarter 2024 and Year-To-Date 2024. The Company recorded asset impairment charges in the Third Quarter 2023 and Year-To-Date 2023 of million and million, respectively, inclusive of ROU assets. 
 Impairment of Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets 
 The Company estimates the fair value of its indefinite-lived Gymboree tradename based on an income approach using the relief-from-royalty method. Estimating fair value using this method requires management to estimate future revenues, royalty rates, discount rates, long-term growth rates, and other factors in order to project future cash flows. 
 The Company performs an annual impairment assessment of the Gymboree tradename at the end of December or whenever circumstances indicate that a decline in value may have occurred, in accordance with FASB ASC 350 Intangibles Goodwill and Other . Based on this assessment, the Company recorded an impairment charge of million in Fiscal 2023, and a further impairment charge of million in the Second Quarter 2024, which reduced the carrying value to its fair value of million. There were impairment charges recorded in the Third Quarter 2024. 
 Unfavorable changes in certain of the Company s key assumptions may affect future testing results. For example, keeping all other assumptions constant, a 100-basis point increase in the discount rate or a 10 decrease in forecasted revenue would result in further impairment charges of approximately million.

 13.) , or ) million, compared to ) , or ) million, during the Third Quarter 2023. The change in the effective income tax rate and income tax provision (benefit) for the Third Quarter 2024 compared to the Third Quarter 2023 was primarily driven by the establishment of a valuation allowance against the Company s net deferred tax assets in Fiscal 2023, partially offset by a favorable shift in the jurisdictional earnings mix in Fiscal 2024. Furthermore, the Company s provision (benefit) for income taxes in the Third Quarter 2024 has been calculated by applying an estimate of the annual effective tax rate. In the Third Quarter 2023, the Company computed its provision (benefit) for income taxes based on the actual effective tax rate for Year-To-Date 2023 by applying the discrete method. 
 The Company s effective income tax rate for Year-To-Date 2024 was a provision of ) , or million, compared to a benefit of , or ) million, for Year-To-Date 2023. The change in the effective income tax rate and income tax provision (benefit) for Year-To-Date 2024 compared to Year-To-Date 2023 was primarily driven by the establishment of a valuation allowance against the Company s net deferred tax assets in Fiscal 2023. 
 On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act was enacted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act allows net operating losses NOLs incurred in taxable years 2018, 2019, and 2020 to be carried back to each of the five preceding taxable years to offset of taxable income and to generate a refund of previously paid income taxes. Pursuant to the CARES Act, the Company carried back the taxable year 2020 tax loss of million to prior years. As of November 2, 2024, the remaining income tax receivable of million is included within Prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 The Company accrues interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as part of its provision (benefit) for income taxes. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits was million, million, and million as of November 2, 2024, February 3, 2024, and October 28, 2023, respectively, and is included within long-term liabilities. Additional interest expense recognized in the Third Quarter 2024 and Third Quarter 2023 related to unrecognized tax benefits was not significant. 
 The Company is subject to tax in the United States and foreign jurisdictions, including Canada and Hong Kong. The Company files a consolidated U.S. income tax return for federal income tax purposes. The Company is no longer subject to income tax examinations by U.S. federal, state and local or foreign tax authorities for tax years 2015 and prior. 
 The Internal Revenue Service is currently conducting an examination of the Company s tax return for fiscal year 2020 in conjunction with its review of the CARES Act NOL carryback to earlier fiscal years. The Company believes that its reserves for uncertain tax positions are adequate to cover existing risks or exposures. Management believes that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues arise as a result of a tax audit, and are resolved in a manner not consistent with management s expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs. 
 During the First Quarter 2024, Mithaq became the controlling shareholder of the Company. This change of control constituted an ownership change under the Internal Revenue Code Section 382, subjecting the Company to an annual limitation on its ability to utilize its existing NOLs and tax credits as of the ownership change date to offset future taxable income. The application of such limitation may cause U.S. federal income taxes to be paid by the Company earlier than they otherwise would be paid if such limitation was not in effect, which would adversely affect the Company s operating results and cash flows if it has taxable income in the future. In addition to the aforementioned federal income tax implications pursuant to Section 382 of the Code, most U.S. states follow the general provision of Section 382 of the Code, either explicitly or implicitly resulting in separate state NOL limitations. This could cause state income taxes to be paid earlier than otherwise would be paid if such limitation was not in effect and could cause such NOLs to expire unused.

 OVERVIEW 
 Our Business 
 We are an omni-channel children s specialty portfolio of brands. We design, contract to manufacture, and sell fashionable, high quality apparel, accessories and footwear predominantly at value prices, primarily under our proprietary brands: The Children s Place , Gymboree , Sugar Jade , and PJ Place . Our global retail and wholesale network includes two digital storefronts, more than 500 stores in North America, wholesale marketplaces, 199 international points of distribution in 15 countries through six international franchise partners, and social media channels on Instagram, Facebook, X, formerly known as Twitter, YouTube and Pinterest. 
 Segment Reporting 
 In accordance with FASB ASC 280 Segment Reporting , we report segment data based on geography: The Children s Place U.S. and The Children s Place International. Each segment includes an e-commerce business located at www.childrensplace.com and www.gymboree.com. Included in The Children s Place U.S. segment are our U.S. and Puerto Rico-based stores and revenue from our U.S.-based wholesale business. Included in The Children s Place International segment are our Canadian-based stores, revenue from our Canadian-based wholesale business, as well as revenue from international franchisees. We measure our segment profitability based on operating income, defined as income before interest and taxes. Net sales and direct costs are recorded by each segment. Certain inventory procurement functions such as production and design, as well as corporate overhead, including executive management, finance, real estate, human resources, legal, and information technology services, are managed by The Children s Place U.S. segment. Expenses related to these functions, including depreciation and amortization, are allocated to The Children s Place International segment based primarily on net sales. The assets related to these functions are not allocated. We periodically review these allocations and adjust them based upon changes in business circumstances. Net sales to external customers are derived from merchandise sales, and we have one U.S. wholesale customer that individually accounted for more than 10 of our net sales for the Third Quarter 2024 and Year-To-Date 2024. 
 Recent Developments 
 Macroeconomic conditions, including inflationary pressures, higher interest rates, and other domestic and geo-political factors, continue to adversely affect our core customer, resulting in a decrease in discretionary apparel purchases during the Third Quarter 2024. These macroeconomic conditions are expected to continue to have an adverse impact during the remainder of Fiscal 2024. 
 On August 23, 2024, we appointed Claudia Lima-Guinehut as Brand President, effective as of September 9, 2024. Ms. Lima-Guinehut succeeded Maegan Markee, who departed pursuant to a mutual agreement with the Company effective as of June 14, 2024. 
 On September 18, 2024, we entered into a lease agreement for office space in Lahore, Pakistan, with the lease term commencing on December 1, 2024 and expiring on November 30, 2034. We expect to utilize this office space primarily for back-office support, sourcing services and other business and corporate matters as needed. 
 On October 3, 2024, we announced Sheamus Toal will be leaving his positions as Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, effective December 13, 2024. 
 On October 30, 2024, we announced our partnership with global fashion and lifestyle online retailer, SHEIN. This collaboration brings our apparel to SHEIN s platform, opening up opportunities for us to reach customers that would not typically be found in our customer file. This partnership marks a significant step forward, combining our heritage and value with SHEIN s global reach. 
 On November 19, 2024, we opened our first Gymboree store at the Garden State Plaza in Paramus, New Jersey.

Also, as previously disclosed, we entered into a letter agreement with our majority shareholder, Mithaq Capital SPC, a Cayman segregated portfolio company Mithaq ), on February 29, 2024 (the Letter Agreement ), pursuant to which, among other things, we are required to use reasonable best efforts to prepare, file, and cause to be effective a registration statement, prospectus and other materials required under applicable law to permit, and to then commence and complete, a rights offering. In furtherance of our efforts to comply with such pre-existing contractual obligation, and following the determination of the disinterested directors on our current Board of Directors (the Disinterested Directors that a rights offering is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders and would, among other things, provide us with an opportunity to raise capital and deleverage and more generally strengthen our balance sheet, on September 25, 2024, the Disinterested Directors unanimously approved the commencement and completion of a rights offering. On October 15, 2024, we filed a preliminary prospectus with the SEC for the rights offering on Form S-1. On December 3, 2024, the Disinterested Directors unanimously approved that the record date for the rights offering would be December 13, 2024. 
 Operating Highlights 
 Net sales decreased 90.0 million, or 18.8 , to 390.2 million during the Third Quarter 2024 from 480.2 million during the Third Quarter 2023, driven by a combination of the anticipated decrease in e-commerce revenue, as we proactively rationalized our unprofitable promotional strategies, inflated marketing spend and free shipping offers to improve profitability, in addition to decreased brick and mortar revenue due to a lower store count and lower transactions. These efforts were successful during the Third Quarter 2024 in driving profitability despite having lower sales. During the Third Quarter 2024, we closed five stores and did not open any new stores. Comparable retail sales decreased 17.1 for the Third Quarter 2024, largely driven by the planned decrease in e-commerce revenue, as we proactively sacrificed unprofitable sales to improve profitability. 
 Gross profit decreased 23.8 million to 138.3 million during the Third Quarter 2024, compared to 162.1 million during the Third Quarter 2023. Gross margin, however, increased 180 basis points to 35.5 of net sales in the Third Quarter 2024, compared to 33.7 of net sales in the Third Quarter 2023. The increase in gross margin was caused by a combination of factors, including reductions in product input costs, including cotton and supply chain costs, which negatively impacted margins in the prior year. These improvements in input costs were combined with the success of our strategies to rationalize profit-draining promotions and limit unprofitable shipping offers, which resulted in a significant improvement in the leverage of e-commerce freight costs. 
 Operatin g income was 29.3 million during the Third Quarter 2024 compared to 45.0 million during the Third Quarter 2023. Operating margin deleveraged 190 basis points to 7.5 of net sales. 
 Net income was 20.1 million, or 1.57 per diluted share, during the Third Quarter 2024 compared to 38.5 million, or 3.05 per diluted share, during the Third Quarter 2023, due to the factors discussed above. 
 While we continue to face a challenging macroeconomic environment, including inflationary pressures, higher interest rates, and other domestic and geo-political concerns, we continue to focus on our key strategic growth initiatives superior product, digital transformation, alternative channels of distribution, and fleet optimization. 
 Digital remains a top priority and we continue to expand our digital capabilities. We have expanded our partnerships with our outside providers to help us monitor and reallocate our marketing budgets in a more efficient and timely manner to drive acquisition, retention and reactivation. As we continue to focus on our digital business, we continue to strengthen our partnership with our third party logistics providers in an effort to provide our customers with a best-in-class digital experience. 
 In November 2021, our Board authorized a 250.0 million share repurchase program (the Share Repurchase Program ). Currently, given the terms of our credit agreement, dated as of May 9, 2019 (as amended from time to time, the Credit Agreement ), by and among the Company and certain of its subsidiaries, and the lenders party thereto (collectively, the Credit Agreement Lenders ), as amended by the seventh amendment to the Credit Agreement (the Seventh Amendment ), we are not expecting to repurchase any shares in Fiscal 2024, except pursuant to our practice as a result of our insider trading policy. As of November 2, 2024, there was 156.7 million remaining availability under the Share Repurchase Program.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 We describe our significant accounting policies in Note 1. Basis of Preparation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 3, 2024. There have been no significant changes in our accounting policies from those described in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the amounts of revenues and expenses reported during the period. We continuously review the appropriateness of the estimates used in preparing our financial statements; however, estimates routinely require adjustment based on changing circumstances and the receipt of new or better information. Consequently, actual results could differ materially from our estimates. 
 Our critical accounting estimates are described under the heading Critical Accounting Estimates in Item 7 of our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 3, 2024. Our critical accounting estimates include impairment of long-lived assets, impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets, income taxes, stock-based compensation, and inventory valuation. There have been no material changes in these critical accounting estimates from those described in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Recent Accounting Standards Updates 
 Refer to Note 1. Basis of Presentation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for discussion regarding the impact of recently issued accounting standards on our consolidated financial statements. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 We believe that our e-commerce and brick-and-mortar retail store operations are highly interdependent, with both sharing common customers purchasing from a common pool of product inventory. Accordingly, we believe that consolidated omni-channel reporting presents the most meaningful and appropriate measure of our performance, including net sales. 
 The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, selected data from our Consolidated Statements of Operations expressed as a percentage of Net sales. We primarily evaluate the results of our operations as a percentage of Net sales rather than in terms of absolute dollar increases or decreases by analyzing the year over year change in our business expressed as a percentage of Net sales (i.e., basis points ). For example, SG A increased 380 basis points to 25.6 of Net sales during the Third Quarter 2024 from 21.8 during the Third Quarter 2023. Accordingly, to the extent that our sales decrease or if our costs grow at a faster pace than our sales (i.e., deleveraging ), we have less efficiently utilized the investments we have made in our business. Conversely, if our sales increase at a faster rate than our costs (i.e., leveraging ), the more efficiently we have utilized the investments we have made in our business.

 The following table sets forth net sales by segment, for the periods indicated: 
 Thirteen Weeks Ended Thirty-nine Weeks Ended November 2, 2024 October 28, 2023 November 2, 2024 October 28, 2023 (in thousands) Net sales: The Children s Place U.S. 356,163 441,865 894,744 1,048,568 The Children s Place International 34,010 38,369 82,962 98,906 Total net sales 390,173 480,234 977,706 1,147,474 
 Third Quarter 2024 Compared to Third Quarter 2023 
 Net sales decreased 90.0 million or 18.8 , to 390.2 million during the Third Quarter 2024 from 480.2 million during the Third Quarter 2023, driven by a combination of the anticipated decrease in e-commerce revenue, as we proactively rationalized our unprofitable promotional strategies, inflated marketing spend and free shipping offers to improve profitability, in addition to decreased brick and mortar revenue due to a lower store count and lower transactions. These efforts were successful during the Third Quarter 2024 in driving profitability despite having lower sales. During the Third Quarter 2024, we closed five stores and did not open any new stores. Comparable retail sales decreased 17.1 for the Third Quarter 2024, largely driven by the planned decrease in e-commerce revenue, as we proactively sacrificed unprofitable sales to improve profitability. 
 The Children s Place U.S. net sales decreased 85.7 million or 19.4 , to 356.2 million in the Third Quarter 2024, compared to 441.9 million in the Third Quarter 2023, driven by a combination of the anticipated decrease in e-commerce revenue, as we proactively rationalized our unprofitable promotional strategies, inflated marketing spend and free shipping offers to improve profitability, in addition to decreased brick and mortar revenue due to a lower store count and lower transactions. 
 The Children s Place International net sales decreased 4.4 million or 11.4 , to 34.0 million in the Third Quarter 2024, compared to 38.4 million in the Third Quarter 2023, driven by a combination of the anticipated decrease in e-commerce revenue, as we proactively rationalized our unprofitable promotional strategies, inflated marketing spend and free shipping offers to improve profitability. 
 Total e-commerce sales, which include postage and handling, were 55.3 of net retail sales and 46.5 of net sales during the Third Quarter 2024, compared to 57.0 and 50.0 , respectively, during the Third Quarter 2023. 
 28 

Gross profit decreased 23.8 million to 138.3 million in the Third Quarter 2024, compared to 162.1 million in the Third Quarter 2023. Gross margin, however, increased 180 basis points to 35.5 of net sales in the Third Quarter 2024, compared to 33.7 of net sales in the Third Quarter 2023. The increase in gross margin was caused by a combination of factors, including reductions in product input costs, including cotton and supply chain costs, which negatively impacted margins in the prior year. These improvements in input costs were combined with the success of our strategies to rationalize profit-draining promotions and limit unprofitable shipping offers, which resulted in a significant improvement in the leverage of e-commerce freight costs. 
 Gross profit as a percentage of net sales is dependent upon a variety of factors, including changes in the relative sales mix among distribution channels, changes in the mix of products sold, the timing and level of promotional activities, foreign currency exchange rates, and fluctuations in shipping and material costs. These factors, among others, may cause gross profit as a percentage of net sales to fluctuate from period to period. 
 Selling, general, and administrative expenses were well-controlled at 99.8 million during the Third Quarter 2024, compared to 104.8 million during the Third Quarter 2023 . The Third Quarter 2024 results included incremental operating expenses of 6.0 million, including restructuring costs of 4.8 million, primarily due to recent changes in our senior leadership team, lender required consulting fees of 0.5 million, broken financing deal fees of 0.3 million, other professional and consulting fees of 0.2 million, and fleet optimization costs of 0.1 million. The Third Quarter 2023 results included incremental operating expenses of 1.9 million, including restructuring costs of 0.8 million, credit agreement amendment costs of 0.8 million, and fleet optimization costs of 0.4 million. Excluding the impact of these incremental charges, Adjusted SG A expenses were 93.8 million during the Third Quarter 2024, compared to 102.9 million during the Third Quarter 2023, and deleveraged 260 basis points to 24.0 of net sales, given the planned lower sales. We were successful in reducing Adjusted SG A expenses by 9.1 million despite the reversal of 12.6 million in incentive compensation and equity compensation accruals in the prior year. This decrease was due to significant reductions in marketing expenses, as we eliminated inflated and unprofitable marketing costs and to a lesser extent, due to reductions in store payroll and home office payroll, partially offset by the impact of the change in incentive compensation and equity compensation accruals. This represents the lowest level of Adjusted selling, general, and administrative expenses in over 15 years for the third quarter of a fiscal year. 
 Depreciation and amortization was 9.3 million during the Third Quarter 2024, compared to 11.7 million during the Third Quarter 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by reduced depreciation of capitalized software and the permanent closure of 81 stores during the past twelve months. 
 Asset impairment charges were 0.6 million during the Third Quarter 2023 , inclusive of right-of-use ROU assets. These charges were relate d to underperforming stores identified in our ongoing store portfolio evaluation primarily as a result of decreased net sales and cash flow projections. There were no asset impairment charges during the Third Quarter 2024 . 
 Operating income was 29.3 million during the Third Quarter 2024, compared to 45.0 million during the Third Quarter 2023. The Third Quarter 2024 results were impacted by incremental operating expenses of 6.0 million, as described within SG A expenses above. The Third Quarter 2023 results were impacted by incremental operating expenses of 2.9 million, including SG A expenses of 1.9 million, as described above, asset impairment charges of 0.6 million, and accelerated depreciation of 0.5 million. Excluding the impact of these incremental charges, Adjusted operating income was 35.3 million in the Third Quarter 2024, compared to 47.9 million in the Third Quarter 2023, and deleveraged 100 basis points to 9.0 of net sales. The Children s Place International operating margin was negatively impacted during the Third Quarter 2024 due to the closure of our distribution center in Toronto, Canada, and is expected to be partially offset by potential duty drawback claims in the future. 
 Related party interest expense was 2.1 million during the Third Quarter 2024, due to interest-bearing borrowings from loans entered into with Mithaq during Fiscal 2024. There was no related party interest expense during the Third Quarter 2023. 
 Other interest expense, net was 8.0 million during the Third Quarter 2024, compared to 7.9 million during the Third Quarter 2023. The increase in interest expense was primarily driven by higher average interest rates associated with our revolving credit facility due to the impact of refinancings, partially offset by lower average borrowings. 
 Provision (benefit) for income taxes was a benefit of (0.9) million during the Third Quarter 2024, compared to (1.5) million during the Third Quarter 2023. Our effective tax rate was a benefit of (4.7) and (3.9) in the Third Quarter 2024 and Third Quarter 2023, respectively. The change in our effective tax rate and income tax provision (benefit) for the Third Quarter 2024 compared to the Third Quarter 2023 was primarily driven by the establishment of a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets in Fiscal 2023, partially offset by a favorable shift in the jurisdictional earnings mix in Fiscal 2024. In the comparable period last year, we calculated the provision (benefit) for income taxes based on the actual effective tax rate for Year-To-Date 2023 by applying the discrete method. 
 Net income was 20.1 million, or 1.57 per diluted share during the Third Quarter 2024, compared to 38.5 million, or 3.05 per diluted share during the Third Quarter 2023, due to the factors discussed above . 
 29 

Year-To-Date 2024 Compared to Year-To-Date 2023 
 Net sales decreased 169.8 million or 14.8 , to 977.7 million during Year-To-Date 2024 from 1.147 billion during Year-To-Date 2023, primar ily due to reductions in retail sales due to a lower store count, and anticipated declines in e-commerce demand due to the rationalization of promotions, reductions in inflated and unprofitable marketing spend, and the strategic decision to change free shipping offers, as we proactively sacrificed unprofitable sales in an effort to improve profitability. Comparable retail sales decreased 12.6 during Year-To-Date 2024, largely due to the planned decrease in e-commerce revenue. 
 The Children s Place U.S. net sales decreased 153.8 million or 14.7 , to 894.7 million during Year-To-Date 2024, compared to 1.049 billion during Year-To-Date 2023, primarily due to a lower store count, and anticipated declines in e-commerce demand due to the rationalization of promotions, reductions in inflated and unprofitable marketing spend, and the strategic decision to change free shipping offers, as we proactively sacrificed unprofitable sales in an effort to improve profitability. 
 The Children s Place International net sales decreased 15.9 million or 16.1 , to 83.0 million during Year-To-Date 2024, compared to 98.9 million during Year-To-Date 2023, primarily due to anticipated declines in e-commerce demand due to the rationalization of promotions, reductions in inflated and unprofitable marketing spend, and the strategic decision to change free shipping offers, as we proactively sacrificed unprofitable sales in an effort to improve profitability. 
 Total e-commerce sales, which include postage and handling, were 52.8 of net retail sales and 45.7 of net sales during Year-To-Date 2024, compared to 52.1 and 46.2 , respectively, during Year-To-Date 2023. 
 Gross profit decreased 3.5 million to 342.9 million during Year-To-Date 2024, compared to 346.4 million during Year-To-Date 2023. Gross margin, however, leveraged 490 basis points to 35.1 of net sales during Year-To-Date 2024, compared to 30.2 during Year-To-Date 2023. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to reductions in product input costs, including cotton and supply chain costs, which negatively impacted margins in the prior year. These improvements in input costs were combined with the success of our strategies to rationalize profit-draining promotions and limit unprofitable shipping offers, which resulted in a significant improvement in the leverage of e-commerce freight costs. 
 Gross profit as a percentage of net sales is dependent upon a variety of factors, including changes in the relative sales mix among distribution channels, changes in the mix of products sold, the timing and level of promotional activities, foreign currency exchange rates, and fluctuations in shipping and material costs. These factors, among others, may cause gross profit as a percentage of net sales to fluctuate from period to period. 
 Selling, general, and administrative expenses were 305.0 million during Year-To-Date 2024, compared to 329.8 million during Year-To-Date 2023. The Year-To-Date 2024 results included incremental operating expenses of 34.2 million, including restructuring costs of 11.2 million, primarily due to changes in our senior leadership team, non-cash equity compensation charges of 9.9 million and other fees of 3.8 million associated with the change of control, financing-related charges of 7.0 million, lender required consulting fees of 2.4 million, fleet optimization costs of 0.9 million, costs associated with the closure of our Canada distribution center of 0.8 million, and other professional and consulting fees of 0.6 million, partially offset by the reversal of a legal settlement accrual of 2.3 million. The Year-To-Date 2023 results included incremental operating expenses of 15.9 million, including restructuring costs of 10.7 million, contract termination fees of 3.0 million, fleet optimization costs of 1.5 million, and credit agreement amendment costs of 0.8 million. Excluding the impact of these incremental charges, Adjusted SG A expenses were 270.8 million during Year-To-Date 2024, compared to 313.8 million during Year-To-Date 2023, and deleveraged 40 basis points to 27.7 of net sales, given the planned lower sales. We were successful in reducing Adjusted SG A expenses by 43.0 million despite the reversal of 18.7 million in incentive compensation and equity compensation accruals in the prior year. This decrease was due to significant reductions in marketing expenses, as we eliminated inflated and unprofitable marketing costs and to a lesser extent, due to reductions in store payroll, home office payroll and professional fees, partially offset by the impact of the change in incentive compensation and equity compensation accruals. This represents the lowest level of Adjusted selling, general, and administrative expenses in over 15 years for the first three quarters of a fiscal year. 
 Depreciation and amortization was 30.4 million during Year-To-Date 2024, compared to 35.5 million during Year-To-Date 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by reduced depreciation of capitalized software and the permanent closure of 81 stores during the past twelve months. 
 Asset impairment charges were 28.0 million during Year-To-Date 2024 due to the reduction in fair value of the Gymboree tradename during the Second Quarter 2024, which was primarily due to reductions in Gymboree sales forecasts and a reduction in the royalty rate used to value the tradename. Asset impairment charges were 3.1 million during Year-To-Date 2023, inclusive of ROU assets. These charges were relate d to underperforming stores identified in our ongoing store portfolio evaluation primarily as a result of decreased net sales and cash flow projections. 
 30 

Operating loss was (20.5) million during Year-To-Date 2024, compared to (22.0) million during Year-To-Date 2023. The Year-To-Date 2024 results were impacted by incremental operating expenses of 64.9 million, including SG A expenses of 34.2 million, as described above, an impairment charge of 28.0 million on the Gymboree tradename, accelerated depreciation of 1.8 million, and additional change in control charges impacting gross margin of 0.9 million. The Year-To-Date 2023 results were impacted by incremental operating expenses of 20.4 million, including SG A expenses of 15.9 million, as described above, asset impairment charges of 3.1 million, and accelerated depreciation of 1.4 million. Excluding the impact of these incremental charges, Adjusted operating income was 44.4 million during Year-To-Date 2024, or an improvement of 46.0 million compared to an Adjusted operating loss of (1.6) million during Year-To-Date 2023, and leveraged 460 basis points to 4.5 of net sales. The Children s Place International operating margin was negatively impacted during Year-To-Date 2024 due to the closure of our distribution center in Toronto, Canada, and is expected to be partially offset by potential duty drawback claims in the future. 
 Related party interest expense was 4.6 million during Year-To-Date 2024, due to interest-bearing borrowings from loans entered into with Mithaq during Fiscal 2024. There was no related party interest expense during Year-To-Date 2023. 
 Other interest expense, net was 22.5 million during Year-To-Date 2024, compared to 21.5 million during Year-To-Date 2023. The increase was primarily driven by higher average interest rates associated with our revolving credit facility due to the impact of refinancings, partially offset by lower average borrowings. 
 Provision (benefit) for income taxes was a provision of 2.3 million during Year-To-Date 2024 compared to a benefit of (17.8) million during Year-To-Date 2023. Our effective tax rate was a provision of (4.8) and a benefit of 40.9 during Year-To-Date 2024 and Year-To-Date 2023, respectively. The change in our effective tax rate and income tax provision (benefit) for Year-To-Date 2024 compared to Year-To-Date 2023 was primarily driven by the establishment of a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets in Fiscal 2023. 
 Net loss , which included certain non-cash impairment charges, restructuring charges, and charges due to our change in control, as described above, was (49.8) million , or (3.91) per diluted share during Year-To-Date 2024, compared to (25.7) million , or (2.06) per diluted share during Year-To-Date 2023 , due to the factors discussed abov e. Adjusted net income was 15.1 million, or 1.18 per diluted share during Year-To-Date 2024, compared to an Adjusted net loss of (10.6) million, or (0.85) per diluted share during Year-To-Date 2023. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Liquidity 
 Our working capital needs typically follow a seasonal pattern, peaking during the third fiscal quarter based on seasonal inventory purchases. Our primary uses of cash are for working capital requirements, which are principally inventory purchases, the payment of interest expense on our revolving credit facility, and the financing of capital projects. 
 Our working capital deficit decreased 62.1 million to 46.3 million at November 2, 2024, compared to 108.4 million at October 28, 2023, primarily reflecting a decrease in our accounts payable balances and an increase in our accounts receivable balances. 
 At November 2, 2024, we had 362.4 million of outstanding borrowings under our 433.0 million asset-based revolving credit facility (the ABL Credit Facility under our Credit Agreement and no borrowings under our 40.0 million senior unsecured credit facility with Mithaq (the Mithaq Credit Facility ). We had total liquidity of 94.0 million, including 48.3 million of availability under our ABL Credit Facility, 40.0 million of availability under our Mithaq Credit Facility, and 5.7 million of cash on hand. At November 2, 2024, we had 12.2 million of outstanding letters of credit, with an additional 12.8 million available for issuing letters of credit under our ABL Credit Facility. 
 We expect to be able to meet our working capital, capital expenditure, and debt service requirements for at least the next twelve months from the date that our consolidated financial statements for the Third Quarter 2024 were issued, by using our cash on hand, cash flows from operations, and availability under our ABL Credit Facility and Mithaq Credit Facility. This liquidity may be further supplemented with proceeds from the rights offering, that we are currently contemplating, and for which a preliminary prospectus has been filed with the SEC on Form S-1 on October 15, 2024. 

31 

ABL Credit Facility and 2021 Term Loan 
 We and certain of our subsidiaries maintain the 433.0 million ABL Credit Facility and, before it was fully repaid, maintained a 50.0 million term loan (the 2021 Term Loan under our Credit Agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association Wells Fargo ), Truist Bank, Bank of America, N.A., HSBC Business Credit (USA) Inc., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., and PNC Bank, National Association as the Credit Agreement Lenders and Wells Fargo, as Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent, Swing Line Lender and, before the 2021 Term Loan was fully repaid, Term Agent. The ABL Credit Facility will mature and, before it was fully repaid, the 2021 Term Loan would have matured, in November 2026. 
 As of April 18, 2024, which is the effective date of the Seventh Amendment, the ABL Credit Facility includes a 25.0 million Canadian sublimit and a 25.0 million sublimit for standby and documentary letters of credit. 
 Under the ABL Credit Facility, borrowings outstanding bear interest, at our option, at: 
 (i) the prime rate per annum, plus a margin of 2.000 ; or 
 (ii) the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR per annum, plus 0.100 , plus a margin of 3.000 . 
 Prior to April 18, 2024, we were charged a fee of 0.200 on the unused portion of the commitments. As of April 18, 2024, based on the size of the unused portion of the commitments, we are charged a fee ranging from 0.250 to 0.375 . Letter of credit fees are at 1.125 for commercial letters of credit and 1.750 for standby letters of credit. The amount available for loans and letters of credit under the ABL Credit Facility is determined by a borrowing base consisting of certain credit card receivables, certain trade receivables, certain inventory, and the fair market value of certain real estate, subject to certain reserves and an availability block. 
 From and after February 4, 2025 and on the first day of each fiscal quarter thereafter, based on the amount of our average daily excess availability under the facility, borrowings outstanding under the ABL Credit Facility will bear interest, at our option, at: 
 (i) the prime rate per annum, plus a margin of 1.750 or 2.000 ; or 
 (ii) the SOFR per annum, plus 0.100 , plus a margin of 2.750 or 3.000 . 
 Letter of credit fees will range from 1.000 to 1.125 for commercial letters of credit and will range from 1.500 to 1.750 for standby letters of credit. Letter of credit fees will be determined based on the amount of our average daily excess availability under the facility. 
 For the Third Quarter 2024 and Year-To-Date 2024, we recognized 7.1 million and 19.1 million, respectively, in interest expense related to the ABL Credit Facility. For the Third Quarter 2023 and Year-To-Date 2023, we recognized 7.2 million and 18.0 million, respectively, in interest expense related to the ABL Credit Facility. 
 Prior to April 18, 2024, when the 2021 Term Loan was fully repaid, credit extended under the ABL Credit Facility was secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of our U.S. and Canadian assets other than intellectual property, certain furniture, fixtures, equipment, and pledges of subsidiary capital stock, and a second priority security interest in our intellectual property, certain furniture, fixtures, equipment, and pledges of subsidiary capital stock. As of April 18, 2024, the ABL Credit Facility is secured on a first priority basis by all of the foregoing collateral. 
 The outstanding obligations under the ABL Credit Facility may be accelerated upon the occurrence of certain customary events of default, as further described below. We are not subject to any early termination fees. 
 The ABL Credit Facility contains covenants, which include conditions on stock buybacks and the payment of cash dividends or similar payments. These covenants also limit our ability to incur certain liens, to incur certain indebtedness, to make certain investments, acquisitions, or dispositions or to change the nature of our business. Pursuant to the Seventh Amendment, the requisite payment condition thresholds for some of these covenants have been heightened, resulting in certain actions such as the repurchase of shares and payment of cash dividends becoming more difficult to perform. Additionally, if we are unable to maintain a certain amount of excess availability for borrowings (the excess availability threshold ), we may be subject to cash dominion. 
 The ABL Credit Facility contains customary events of default, which include (subject in certain cases to customary grace and cure periods) nonpayment of principal or interest, breach of covenants, failure to pay certain other indebtedness, and certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization, such as a change of control.

The tables below present the components of our ABL Credit Facility: 
 November 2, 2024 February 3, 2024 October 28, 2023 (in millions) Total borrowing base availability (1) 
 422.9 258.4 394.7 Credit facility availability (1) 
 433.0 400.5 400.5 Maximum borrowing availability (2) 
 422.9 258.4 394.7 Outstanding borrowings 362.4 226.7 358.7 Letters of credit outstanding standby 12.2 7.4 7.4 Utilization of credit facility at end of period 374.6 234.1 366.1 Availability (3)

 (1) In Fiscal 2023, the total borrowing base availability and credit facility availability were both calculated net of the excess availability threshold under the Credit Agreement, as prior to the Seventh Amendment, crossing that threshold would have resulted in cash dominion, which would have triggered a fixed charge coverage ratio covenant test and would likely have led to a default under the Credit Agreement. As of the Seventh Amendment, the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant has been removed from the Credit Agreement, and entering into cash dominion by crossing the excess availability threshold no longer poses the same risk of default under the Credit Agreement. 
 (2) The lower of the credit facility availability and the total borrowing base availability. 
 (3) The sub-limit availability for letters of credit was 12.8 million at November 2, 2024, and 42.6 million at February 3, 2024 and October 28, 2023. 
 Year-To-Date 2024 Fiscal 2023 Year-To-Date 2023 (in millions) Average end of day loan balance during the period 280.9 315.5 327.6 Highest end of day loan balance during the period 366.9 379.4 379.4 Average interest rate 9.0 7.5 7.0 
 The 2021 Term Loan bore interest, payable monthly, at (a) the SOFR per annum plus 2.750 for any portion that was a SOFR loan, or (b) the base rate per annum plus 2.000 for any portion that was a base rate loan. The 2021 Term Loan was pre-payable at any time without penalty, and did not require amortization. We recognized 1.1 million in interest expense related to the 2021 Term Loan during Year-To-Date 2024. For the Third Quarter 2023 and Year-To-Date 2023, we recognized 0.4 million and 2.4 million, respectively, in interest expense related to the 2021 Term Loan. 
 As of April 18, 2024, the 2021 Term Loan was fully repaid. 
 As of November 2, 2024, unamortized deferred financing costs amounted to 4.3 million related to our ABL Credit Facility. 
 Mithaq Term Loans 
 We and certain of our subsidiaries maintain an interest-free, unsecured and subordinated promissory note with Mithaq for a 78.6 million term loan (the Initial Mithaq Term Loan ), consisting of (a) a first tranche in an aggregate principal amount of 30.0 million (the First Tranche and (b) a second tranche in an aggregate principal amount of 48.6 million (the Second Tranche ). We received the First Tranche on February 29, 2024 and the Second Tranche on March 8, 2024. 
 The Initial Mithaq Term Loan matures on February 15, 2027. The Initial Mithaq Term Loan is guaranteed by each of our subsidiaries that guarantee our ABL Credit Facility. 
 We and certain of our subsidiaries also maintain an unsecured and subordinated 90.0 million term loan with Mithaq (the New Mithaq Term Loan and together with the Initial Mithaq Term Loan, collectively, the Mithaq Term Loans ). 
 33 

The New Mithaq Term Loan matures on April 16, 2027, and requires monthly payments equivalent to interest charged at the SOFR plus 4.000 per annum, with such monthly payments to Mithaq deferred until April 30, 2025. The New Mithaq Term Loan is guaranteed by each of our subsidiaries that guarantee our ABL Credit Facility. For the Third Quarter 2024 and Year-To-Date 2024, we recognized 2.1 million and 4.6 million, respectively, in deferred interest-equivalent expense related to the New Mithaq Term Loan. 
 The Mithaq Term Loans are subject to an amended and restated subordination agreement (as amended from time to time, the Subordination Agreement ), dated as of April 16, 2024, by and among us and certain of our subsidiaries, Wells Fargo and Mithaq, pursuant to which the Mithaq Term Loans are subordinated in payment priority to our obligations under the Credit Agreement. Subject to such subordination terms, the Mithaq Term Loans are prepayable at any time and from time to time without penalty and do not require any mandatory prepayments. 
 The Mithaq Term Loans contain customary affirmative and negative covenants substantially similar to a subset of the covenants set forth in the Credit Agreement, including limits on our ability to incur certain liens, to incur certain indebtedness, to make certain investments, acquisitions, dispositions or restricted payments, or to change the nature of our business. The Mithaq Term Loans, however, do not provide for any closing, prepayment or exit fees, or other fees typical for transactions of this nature, do not impose additional reserves on borrowings under the Credit Agreement, and do not contain certain other restrictive covenants. 
 The Mithaq Term Loans contain certain customary events of default, which include (subject in certain cases to customary grace periods), nonpayment of principal, breach of other covenants of the Mithaq Term Loans, inaccuracy in representations or warranties, acceleration of certain other indebtedness (including under the Credit Agreement), certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization, such as a change of control, and invalidity of any part of the Mithaq Term Loans. 
 As of November 2, 2024 unamortized deferred financing costs amounted to 2.9 million related to the Mithaq Term Loans. 
 Maturities of our principal debt payments on the Mithaq Term Loans as of November 2, 2024 are as follows: November 2, 2024 (in thousands) Remainder of 2024 
 2025 2026 2027 168,600 Thereafter Total related party debt 
 168,600 
 Mithaq Commitment Letter 
 On May 2, 2024, we entered into a commitment letter the Commitment Letter with Mithaq for a 40.0 million Mithaq Credit Facility. Under the Mithaq Credit Facility, we had the ability to request for advances at any time prior to July 1, 2025. On September 10, 2024, we entered into an Amendment No. 1 to the Commitment Letter with Mithaq, that extended the deadline for requesting advances until July 1, 2026. 
 If any debt is incurred under the Mithaq Credit Facility, it shall require monthly payments equivalent to interest charged at the SOFR plus 5.000 per annum. Such debt shall be unsecured and shall be guaranteed by each of our subsidiaries that guarantee our ABL Credit Facility. Similar to the Mithaq Term Loans, such debt shall also be subject to the Subordination Agreement, contain customary affirmative and negative covenants substantially similar to a subset of the covenants set forth in the Credit Agreement, and contain certain customary events of default. Additionally, such debt shall require no mandatory prepayments and shall mature no earlier than July 1, 2026. As of November 2, 2024, no debt had been incurred under the Mithaq Credit Facility.

Cash Flows and Capital Expenditures 
 Cash used in operating activities was 238.9 million during Year-To-Date 2024, compared to 42.6 million during Year-To-Date 2023. Cash used in operating activities during Year-To-Date 2024 was primarily the result of higher inventory purchases and a lower accounts payable balance compared to Fiscal 2023. 
 Cash used in investing activities was 15.9 million during Year-To-Date 2024, compared to 24.5 million during Year-To-Date 2023, driven by lower capital expenditures. 
 Cash provided by financing activities was 248.0 million during Year-To-Date 2024, compared to 64.0 million during Year-To-Date 2023. The increase primarily resulted from proceeds from higher net borrowings under our ABL Credit Facility and the Mithaq Term Loans, partially offset by the repayment of the 2021 Term Loan. 
 Our ability to continue to meet our capital requirements in Fiscal 2024 depends on our cash on hand, our ability to generate cash flows from operations, and available borrowings under our ABL Credit Facility and Mithaq Credit Facility. Cash flows generated from operations depends on our ability to achieve our financial plans. We believe that our cash on hand, cash generated from operations, and funds available to us through our ABL Credit Facility and Mithaq Credit Facility will be sufficient to fund our capital and other cash requirements for at least the next twelve months from the date that our consolidated financial statements for the Third Quarter 2024 were issued. 
 35 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 
 In the normal course of business, our financial position and results of operations are routinely subject to market risk associated with interest rate movements on borrowings and investments and currency rate movements on non-U.S. dollar denominated assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. We utilize cash from operations and short-term borrowings to fund our working capital and investment needs. 
 Cash and Cash Equivalents 
 Cash and cash equivalents are normally invested in short-term financial instruments that will be used in operations within 90 days of the balance sheet date. Because of the short-term nature of these instruments, changes in interest rates would not materially affect their fair values. 
 Interest Rates 
 Until February 4, 2025, our ABL Credit Facility bears interest at a floating rate equal to the prime rate plus 2.000 or SOFR, plus 0.100 , plus 3.000 . As of November 2, 2024, we had 362.4 million in borrowings under our ABL Credit Facility. A 10 change in the prime rate or SOFR would not have had a material impact on our interest expense. 
 Our 2021 Term Loan bore interest, payable monthly, at (a) the SOFR per annum plus 2.750 for any portion that was a SOFR loan, or (b) the base rate per annum plus 2.000 for any portion that was a base rate loan. As of April 18, 2024, our 2021 Term Loan was fully repaid. 
 The New Mithaq Term Loan requires monthly payments equivalent to interest charged at the SOFR per annum plus 4.000 per annum, with such monthly payments to Mithaq deferred until April 30, 2025. A 10 change in the prime rate or SOFR would not have had a material impact on our interest expense. 
 As of November 2, 2024, we had no borrowings under our Mithaq Credit Facility. If any debt is incurred under the Mithaq Credit Facility, it shall require monthly payments equivalent to interest charged at the SOFR plus 5.000 per annum. A 10 change in the prime rate or SOFR would not have had a material impact on our interest expense. 
 Assets and Liabilities of Foreign Subsidiaries 
 Assets and liabilities outside the United States are primarily located in Canada and Hong Kong, where our investments in our subsidiaries are considered long-term. As of November 2, 2024, net liabilities in Canada and Hong Kong amounted to 12.9 million. A 10 increase or decrease in the Canadian and Hong Kong foreign currency exchange rates would increase or decrease the corresponding net investment by 1.3 million. All changes in the net investments in our foreign subsidiaries are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss). 
 As of November 2, 2024, we had 3.4 million of our cash and cash equivalents held in foreign subsidiaries, of which 1.5 million was in India, 1.2 million was in China, 0.3 million was in Canada, 0.2 million was in Hong Kong, and 0.2 million was held in other foreign countries. 
 Foreign Operations 
 We have exchange rate exposure primarily with respect to certain revenues and expenses denominated in Canadian dollars. As a result, fluctuations in exchange rates impact the amount of our reported sales and expenses. Assuming a 10 change in foreign currency exchange rates, Year-To-Date 2024 net sales would have decreased or increased by approximately 7.7 million, and total costs and expenses would have decreased or increased by approximately 10.8 million. Additionally, we have foreign currency denominated receivables and payables that, when settled, result in transaction gains or losses. A 10 change in foreign currency exchange rates would not result in a significant transaction gain or loss in earnings. 
 We import a vast majority of our merchandise from foreign countries, primarily Vietnam, Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Cambodia, Kenya, India, and China. Consequently, any significant or sudden change in the political, foreign trade, financial, banking, currency policies and practices, or the occurrence of significant labor unrest in these countries or changes in foreign policies of the United States, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Disclosure controls and procedures are designed only to provide reasonable assurance that the controls and procedures will meet their objectives. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our Company have been detected. 
 Management, including our President and Interim Chief Executive Officer, and our Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), as of November 2, 2024. 
 Based on that evaluation, our President and Interim Chief Executive Officer, and our Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level, as of November 2, 2024, to ensure that all information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive, principal accounting, and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended November 2, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. 
 Certain legal proceedings in which we are involved are discussed in Note 8. Commitments and Contingencies to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and Part I, Item 3 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended February 3, 2024. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. 
 Except for the new risk factor described in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended May 4, 2024, there were no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in Item 1A of Part I in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended February 3, 2024. 

ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS. 
 In November 2021, our Board authorized a 250.0 million share repurchase program (the Share Repurchase Program ). Under this program, we may repurchase shares on the open market at current market prices at the time of purchase or in privately negotiated transactions. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased under the program will depend on a variety of factors, including price, corporate and regulatory requirements, and other market and business conditions. We may suspend or discontinue the program at any time and may thereafter reinstitute purchases, all without prior announcement. Pursuant to the Credit Agreement as amended by the Seventh Amendment as described above, we are not expecting to repurchase any shares in Fiscal 2024, except as described below, pursuant to our practice as a result of our insider trading policy. As of November 2, 2024, there was 156.7 million remaining availability under the Share Repurchase Program. 
 Pursuant to our practice, including due to restrictions imposed by our insider trading policy during black-out periods, we withhold and repurchase shares of vesting stock awards and make payments to taxing authorities as required by law to satisfy the withholding tax requirements of all equity award recipients. Our payment of the withholding taxes in exchange for the surrendered shares constitutes a repurchase of our common stock. We also acquire shares of our common stock in conjunction with liabilities owed under our deferred compensation plan, which are held in treasury. 
 There was no share repurchase activity during the Third Quarter 2024. 

ITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION. 
 During the Third Quarter 2024, none of the Company s directors or officers, as defined in Section 16 of the Exchange Act, or a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or a non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement, as each term is defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K of the Exchange Act.
