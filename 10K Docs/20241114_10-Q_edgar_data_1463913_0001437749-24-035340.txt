per share with shares authorized. As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, USAC had common shares issued and outstanding. 

Income (loss) per share attributable to USAC s common stockholders were computed based on the net income (loss) and the weighted average number of shares outstanding during each year. The weighted average number of shares outstanding during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were and shares, respectively. The weighted average number of shares outstanding during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were and shares, respectively. Potential common shares are excluded from the computation when their effect is anti-dilutive. There was no difference between basic and diluted net loss per common share for the three or nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures 

In December 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2023-09 Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures ("ASU 2023-09"). ASU 2023-09 is intended to improve the effectiveness of income tax disclosures by requiring, among other things, the disclosure on an annual basis of: (i) specific categories in the rate reconciliation; and (ii) additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold. In addition, ASU 2023-09 requires disclosure (on an annual basis) of the following information about income taxes paid: (i) the amount of income taxes paid (net of refunds received) disaggregated by federal (national), state, and foreign taxes; and (ii) the amount of income taxes paid (net of refunds received) disaggregated by individual jurisdictions in which income taxes paid (net of refunds received) is equal to or greater than 5 percent of total income taxes paid (net of refunds received). ASU 2023-09 is effective for annual periods beginning January 1, 2026, to be applied prospectively with an option for retrospective application (with early adoption permitted). The adoption of ASU 2023-09 will modify our disclosures but will not have an impact on our financial position or results of operations. 

All other new accounting standards and updates of existing standards issued through the date of this filing were considered by management and did not relate to accounting policies and procedures pertinent or material to the Company at this time.

Allowance for credit losses 

Carrying value 

The Company individually evaluates its commercial mortgage loan portfolio for the establishment of a specific loan loss allowance. A mortgage loan requires a specific allowance when it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. If the Company determines that the value of any specific mortgage loan requires an allowance, the carrying amount of the mortgage loan will be reduced to its fair value, based upon the present value of expected future cash flows from the loan discounted at the loan's effective interest rate, or the fair value of the underlying collateral less estimated costs to sell. The Company had no mortgage loans that were on non-accrued status as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The were no mortgage loans delinquent on payments due to the Company as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 

The Company analyzes our commercial mortgage loan portfolio for the need of a general loan allowance for expected credit losses on all other loans on a quantitative and qualitative basis by grouping assets with similar risk characteristics when there is not a specific expectation of a loss for an individual loan. The amount of the general loan allowance is based upon management's evaluation of the collectability of the loan portfolio, historical loss experience, delinquencies, credit concentrations, underwriting standards and national and local economic conditions. The Company does not measure a credit loss allowance on accrued interest receivable as we write off any uncollectible accrued interest receivable balance to net investment income in a timely manner. The Company did not charge off any uncollectible accrued interest receivable on our commercial mortgage loan portfolio during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2023. 

The Company's commercial mortgage loans are pooled by risk rating and property collateral type and an estimated loss ratio is applied against each risk pool. The loss ratios are generally based upon historical loss experience for each risk pool and are adjusted for current and forecasted economic factors management believes to be relevant and supportable. Economic factors are forecasted for two years with immediate reversion to historical experience. 

The following table presents a roll-forward of our specific and general valuation allowances for our commercial mortgage loan portfolio: 

Cumulative adjustment for changes in accounting principals 

Charge-offs 

Recoveries 

Change in provision for credit losses 

Ending Allowance 

The individually evaluated allowance represents the total credit loss allowances on loans which are individually evaluated for allowance. The general allowance is for the group of loans discussed above which are collectively evaluated for impairment. The change in provision for credit losses is recorded in net investment gains (losses). 

Charge-offs include allowances that have been established on loans that were satisfied either by taking ownership of the collateral or by some other means such as discounted pay-off or loan sale. When ownership of the property is taken it is recorded at the lower of the loan's carrying value or the property's fair value (based on appraised values) less estimated costs to sell. The real estate owned is recorded as a component of other investments and the loan is recorded as fully paid, with any allowance for credit loss that has been established charged off. Fair value of the real estate is determined by third party appraisal. Recoveries are situations where the Company has received a payment from the borrower in an amount greater than the carrying value of the loan (principal outstanding less specific allowance). The Company did not own any real estate related to our mortgage participations during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

The Company will record an "intent-to-sell impairment" as a reduction to the amortized cost of fixed maturities, available-for-sale (AFS) in an unrealized loss position if the Company intends to sell or it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the fixed maturity before a recovery in value. A corresponding charge is recorded in net realized losses equal to the difference between the fair value on the impairment date and the amortized cost basis of the fixed maturity before recognizing the impairment. 

For fixed maturity securities where a credit loss has been identified and no intent-to-sell impairment has been recorded, the Company will record an allowance for credit loss ("ACL") for the portion of the unrealized loss related to a credit loss. Any remaining unrealized loss on a fixed maturity after recording an ACL is the non-credit amount is recorded in OCI. The ACL is the excess of the amortized cost over the greater of the Company's best estimate present value of the expected future cash flows or the security's fair value. Cash flows are discounted at the effective yield that is used to record interest income. The ACL cannot exceed the unrealized loss and, therefore, it may fluctuate with the changes in the fair value of the fixed maturity if the fair is greater than the Company's best estimate of the present value of expected future cash flows. The initial ACL and any subsequent changes are recorded in net realized gains and losses. The ACL is written off against amortized cost in the period in which all or a portion of the related fixed maturity is determined to be uncollectible. 

Developing the Company's best estimate of expected future cash flows is a quantitative and qualitative process that incorporates information received from third party sources along with certain internal assumptions regarding the future performance. The Company's considerations include a) changes in the financial condition of the issuer and/or the underlying collateral, (b) whether the issuer is current on contractually obligated interest and principal payments, (c) credit ratings, (d) payment structure of the security, and (e) the extent to which the fair value has been less than the amortized cost of the security. For non-structured securities, assumptions included, but are not limited to, economic and industry specific trends and fundamentals, instrument specific developments including changes in credit ratings, industry earnings multiples and the issuer's ability to restructure, access capital markets, and execute asset sales.

The Company discloses the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities, including those financial assets and financial liabilities that are not measured and reported at fair value on a recurring basis or non-recurring basis. The methodologies for estimating the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring or non-recurring basis are discussed on the previous page. The estimated fair value approximates carrying value for accrued interest. The methodologies for other financial assets and financial liabilities are discussed below: 

Cash and cash equivalents : The carrying amounts approximate fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments. 

Investment income due and accrued: The carrying amounts approximate fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments. 

Mortgage loans on real estate: Mortgage loans are carried at their unpaid principal value as that is considered the fair market values for these loans. The fair values of mortgage loans on real estate are calculated using discounted expected cash flows using competitive market interest rates currently being offered for similar loans. The inputs utilized to determine fair value of all mortgage loans are unobservable market data (competitive market interest rates); therefore, fair value of mortgage loans falls into Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. 

Limited partnership interests : Limited partnership interests are carried at net asset value which approximates fair value. 

Reinsurance contract allocated hedge : The carrying value of funds withheld at interest approximates fair value as funds are specifically identified in the agreement. The fair value of the specified funds is based on the fair value of the underlying assets that are held by the ceding company. The ceding company uses a variety of sources and pricing methodologies, which are not transparent to the Company and may include significant unobservable inputs to value the securities held in distinct portfolios, therefore the valuation of these funds withheld assets are considered Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. 

Policy loans : Policy loans are stated at unpaid principal balances. As these loans are fully collateralized by the cash surrender value of the underlying insurance policies, the carrying value of the policy loans approximates their fair value. 

Federal Home Loan Bank Advances: FHLB advances are stated at the outstanding principal balances and the carrying value approximates fair value. 

Policyholder deposits in deposit-type contracts : The fair value for policyholder deposits deposit-type insurance contracts (accumulation annuities) is calculated using a discounted cash flow approach. Cash flows are projected using actuarial assumptions and discounted to the valuation date using risk-free rates adjusted for credit risk and the nonperformance risk of the liabilities. 

The estimated fair values of the Company s financial assets and liabilities at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 are as follows:

for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with for the same period in 2023. The ETR differs from the statutory rate of primarily due to tax favored investments (i.e., tax-exempt interest and the dividends received deduction) and an increase the the valuation allowance associated with capital loss carryforwards. The change in the ETR for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was due to the relationship of taxable income to consolidated pre-tax income (loss). The ETR differs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from the full year-ended December 31, 2023 ETR of ) due to the prior year release in valuation allowance offset by prior period adjustments. 

The Company is required to evaluate the recoverability of its deferred tax assets and establish a valuation allowance, if necessary, to reduce its deferred tax asset to an amount that is more likely than not to be realizable. Considerable judgment and the use of estimates are required when determining whether a valuation allowance is necessary and, if so, the amount of such valuation allowance. When evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, the Company considers many factors, including: the nature and character of the deferred tax assets and liabilities; taxable income in prior carryback years; future reversals of temporary differences; the length of time carryovers can be utilized; and any tax planning strategies the Company would employ to avoid a tax benefit from expiring unused. 

As of September 30, 2024, based on all available evidence, we concluded that a valuation allowance should remain on a portion of the deferred tax asset related to capital loss carryforwards that are not more-likely-than-not to be realized. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded an increase of to the valuation allowance associated with capital loss carryforwards. The expense was recorded in the income tax expense. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company has recorded a total valuation allowance for and , respectively, associated with the life insurance net operating losses subject to limitations under IRC section 382 and capital loss carryforwards.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Our accounting and reporting policies are in accordance with GAAP. Preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. The following is an explanation of our accounting policies and the estimates considered most significant by management. These accounting policies inherently require significant judgment and assumptions and actual operating results could differ significantly from management s estimates determined using these policies. We believe the following accounting policies, judgments and estimates are the most critical to the understanding of our results of operations and financial position. A detailed discussion of significant accounting policies is provided in this report in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included with this quarterly report. 

Valuation of Investments 

The Company's principal investments are in fixed maturity, mortgages, and equity securities. Fixed maturity, classified as available for sale, are carried at their fair value in the consolidated balance sheets, with unrealized gains or losses recorded in comprehensive income (loss). Our fixed income investment manager utilizes external independent third-party pricing services to determine the fair values of investment securities available for sale. Equity securities are carried at their fair value in the consolidated balance sheets, with unrealized gains or losses recorded in net income (loss). Mortgages, including mortgage loan participations, are carried at unpaid principal balances, net of any unamortized premium or discount and valuation allowances. 

The recognition of credit losses on debt securities is dependent on the facts and circumstances related to the specific security. If we determine a credit loss exists, the difference between amortized cost and fair value is recognized in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). Our membership in the Federal Home Loan Bank FHLB provides additional liquidity which further reduces the likelihood that we would be required to sell a security prior to recovery for liquidity purposes. 

Mortgage loans on real estate, including mortgage loan participations, are carried at unpaid principal balances, net of any unamortized premium or discount and valuation allowances. Interest income is accrued on the principal amount of the mortgage loans based on its contractual interest rate. Amortization of premiums and discounts is recorded using the effective yield method. The Company accrues interest on loans until probable the Company will not receive interest or the loan is 90 days past due. Interest income, amortization of premiums, accretion of discounts and prepayment fees are reported in investment income, net of related expenses in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). 

A mortgage loan is considered to be impaired when, based on the current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the mortgage agreement. 

Valuation allowances on mortgage loans are established based upon inherent losses expected by management to be realized in connection with future dispositions or settlement of mortgage loans, including foreclosures. The Company establishes valuation allowances for estimated impairments on an individual loan basis as of the balance sheet date. Such valuation allowances are based on the excess carrying value of the loan over the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s original effective interest rate, the value of the loan s collateral if the loan is in the process of foreclosure or is otherwise collateral-dependent, or the loan s market value if the loan is being sold. These evaluations are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available. In addition to historical experience, management considers qualitative factors that include the impact of changing macro-economic conditions, which may not be currently reflected in the loan portfolio performance, and the quality of the loan portfolio. 

Any interest accrued or received on the net carrying amount of the impaired loan will be included in investment income or applied to the principal of the loan, depending on the assessment of the collectability of the loan. Mortgage loans deemed to be uncollectible or that have been foreclosed would be charged off against the valuation allowances and subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the valuation allowances. Changes in valuation allowances are reported in net investment gains (losses) on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). 

Other invested assets include collateral loans and private credit investments. The collateral loans and private credit investments are carried at fair value. The inputs used to measure these assets are classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy. 

Limited partnership interests consist of an investment in Mutual Capital Investment Fund. Limited partnerships interests are carried at net asset value as determined by a third-party valuation.

Deferred Acquisition Costs 

Incremental direct costs, net of amounts ceded to reinsurers, that result directly from and are essential to a product sale and would not have been incurred by us had the sale not occurred, are capitalized, to the extent recoverable, and amortized over the life of the premiums produced. Recoverability of deferred acquisition costs is evaluated periodically by comparing the current estimate of the present value of expected pretax future profits to the unamortized asset balance. If this current estimate is less than the existing balance, the difference is charged to expense. 

Future Policy Benefits 

We establish liabilities for amounts payable under insurance policies, including traditional life insurance and annuities. Generally, amounts are payable over an extended period of time. Liabilities for future policy benefits of traditional life insurance have been computed by using a net level premium method based upon estimates at the time of issue for investment yields, mortality and withdrawals. These estimates include provisions for experience less favorable than initially expected. Mortality assumptions are based on industry experience expressed as a percentage of standard mortality tables. Such liabilities are reviewed quarterly by an independent consulting actuary. 

New Accounting Standards 

A detailed discussion of new accounting standards is provided in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on p. 7 of this quarterly report.

Market Risk of Financial Instruments 

We hold a diversified portfolio of investments that primarily includes cash, bonds, equity securities, mortgage loans, and other invested assets. Each of these investments is subject to market risks that can affect their return and their fair value. The primary market risks affecting the investment portfolio are interest rate risk, credit risk, and equity risk. 

Interest Rate Risk 

Interest rate risk arises from the price sensitivity of investments to changes in interest rates. Interest represents the greatest portion of an investment's return for most fixed maturity securities in stable interest rate environments. The changes in the fair value of such investments are inversely related to changes in market interest rates. As interest rates fall, the interest and dividend streams of existing fixed-rate investments become more valuable and fair values rise. As interest rates rise, the opposite effect occurs. 

We work to mitigate our exposure to adverse interest rate movements through laddering the maturities of the fixed maturity investments and through maintaining cash and other short-term investments to assure sufficient liquidity to meet our obligations and to address reinvestment risk considerations. Due to the composition of our book of insurance business, we believe it is unlikely that we would encounter large surrender activity due to an interest rate increase that would force the disposal of fixed maturities at a loss. Additionally, USALSC is a member of the FHLB of Topeka, which provides access to liquidity and further reduces the likelihood of disposing of fixed maturities at a loss. 

Credit Risk 

We are exposed to credit risk through counterparties and within the investment portfolio. Credit risk relates to the uncertainty associated with an obligor's ability to make timely payments of principal and interest in accordance with the contractual terms of an instrument or contract. We manage our credit risk through established investment policies and guidelines which address the quality of creditors and counterparties, concentration limits, diversification practices and acceptable risk levels. These policies and guidelines are regularly reviewed and approved by senior management and USAC's Board of Directors.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Premium income, deposits to policyholder account balances, investment income, and capital raising are the primary sources of funds while withdrawals of policyholder account balances, investment purchases, policy benefits in the form of claims, and operating expenses are the primary uses of funds. To ensure we will be able to pay future commitments, the funds received as premium payments and deposits are invested in primarily fixed income securities. Funds are invested with the intent that the income from investments, plus proceeds from maturities, will in the future meet our ongoing cash flow needs. The approach of matching asset and liability durations and yields requires an appropriate mix of investments. Our investments consist primarily of marketable debt securities that could be readily converted to cash for liquidity needs. Cash flow projections and cash flow tests under various market interest scenarios are also performed annually to assist in evaluating liquidity needs and adequacy. As a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank, USALSC has immediate access to additional cash liquidity, if needed. 

Net cash provided by operating activities was 4,827,724 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The primary sources of cash from operating activities were premiums received from policyholders as well as investment income. The primary uses of cash for operating activities were for payments of commissions to agents and settlement of policy liabilities. Net cash used in investing activities was 8,412,198. The primary source of cash was proceeds of fixed maturity, mortgage, and equity investments sales and repayments. Cash used by financing activities was 905,658. The primary uses of cash were withdrawals on deposit-type contracts. 

At September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents totaling 4,492,006. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents are sufficient to fund the anticipated operating expenses and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future. We have based this estimate upon assumptions that may prove to be wrong and we could use our capital resources sooner than we currently expect. The growth of USALSC, our primary insurance subsidiary, is uncertain and may require additional capital as it continues to grow. 

Impact of Inflation 

Insurance premiums are established before the amount of losses, or the extent to which inflation may affect such losses and expenses, are known. We attempt, in establishing premiums, to anticipate the potential impact of inflation. If, for competitive reasons, premiums cannot be increased to anticipate inflation, this cost would be absorbed by us. Inflation also affects the rate of investment return on the investment portfolio with a corresponding effect on investment income. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.
