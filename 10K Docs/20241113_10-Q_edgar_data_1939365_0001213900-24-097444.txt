and , respectively. For the three and nine months ending September 30, 2024, the Company sustained a
net loss of and , respectively. These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern for the next twelve months from the date these financial statements were issued. These financial
statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts
and classification of liabilities that may be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. The Company s
continuation as a going concern is contingent upon its ability to obtain additional financing and to generate revenue and cash flow to
meet its obligations on a timely basis. The Company will continue to seek to raise additional funding through debt or equity financing
during the next twelve months from the date of issuance of these financial statements. Management believes that actions presently being
taken to obtain additional funding provide the opportunity for the Company to continue as a going concern. There is no guarantee the
Company will be successful in achieving these objectives.

class A common shares are traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market NASDAQ under the symbol IVP. The Company owns and operates

manner of companion pets, emphasizing canine and feline breeds. As the Company expands, additional modalities are expected to become
a part of the offerings at its hospitals. With the acquisition of The Pony Express Veterinary Hospital, Inc. including equine care and
emergency and specialty services and intends to continue to expand such services. 

With thirteen clinics located in nine states
as of the date of this filing, Inspire purchases existing hospitals which have the financial track record, marketplace advantages and
future growth potential which make them worthy acquisition targets. Because the Company leverages a leadership and support structure
which is distributed throughout the United States, acquisitions are not centralized to one geographic area. The Company operates it business
as one operating and one reportable segment.

Our Business Model 

Services provided at owned hospitals include
preventive care for companion animals consisting of annual health exams which include: parasite control; dental health; nutrition and
body condition counseling; neurological examinations; radiology; bloodwork; skin and coat health and many breed specific preventive care
services. Surgical offerings include all soft tissue procedures such as spays and neuters, mass removals, splenectomies and can also
include gastropexies, orthopedic procedures and other types of surgical offerings based on a doctor s training. In many locations
additional means of care and alternative procedures are also offered such as acupuncture, chiropractic and various other health and wellness
offerings. 

With acquisitions serving as one key driver of
growth, the Company has developed metrics and processes for assessing, valuing, acquiring and integrating new hospitals into its network.
With a focus in its early years on general practice, small companion animal hospitals, the Company selects hospitals in markets with
large addressable pet populations, but not necessarily in city/urban centers. The Company recently entered the equine care, or the care
of horses, sector with the addition of the Pony Express Veterinary Hospital into the Company s small-animal-only mix of locations. 

Growth strategies and expansion plans call for
the Company to enter emergency care and mixed animal (such as bovine and additional equine care) in future years of growth. Staffing,
ownership transition plans, demographics, quality of medicine, financial performance and quality of exiting leadership are some of the
many factors that are analyzed before a pending acquisition is offered a letter of intent. The Company uses a field support structure
that is nationally distributed and therefore the targets for acquisition can be in most states within the United States, taking special
care with more complex states which have very specific veterinary practice ownership and operations guidelines. 

Risks to the ability to swiftly acquire and integrate
new hospitals include: (i) national staffing shortages of veterinarians and technicians which pre-existed the current market conditions
which make finding credentialed talent even more difficult; (ii) costs and time associated with finding suitable targets and performing
due diligence; and (iii) difficulties in achieving growth targets post purchase which ensure hospitals grow revenue and earnings in the
years post purchase. 

Post purchase pressures include rising talent
acquisition and staffing costs in addition to challenges in achieving productivity and average patient charges necessary to achieve growth
and profitability.

Results of Operations 

Acquisition and Growth Strategy 

With an emphasis on general practice hospitals
in its first seven to eight quarters, the Company expanded into purchase of mixed animal hospitals in late 2022, adding equine care to
its mix. Further, in the third quarter of 2024 and beyond, the Company intends to continue to the due diligence toward acquisition toward
strategically acquiring existing general practice, specialty hospitals and/or expand existing locations to include emergency care and
more complex surgeries, holistic care and comprehensive diagnostics which allow it to offer more complex surgeries and internal medicine
work ups. 

The Company has plans to seek multi-unit practices
with regional presence to facilitate growth for the Company and also to move more swiftly into being a prime provider in select markets.
While purchases of individual clinics will remain a focus for the Company, these opportunities to acquire hospitals in clusters of 2
to 6 will significantly increase our pace of growth and provide numerous internal benefits such as internal case referrals and career
pathing for clinicians and leadership. 

We account for acquisitions under the acquisition
method and are required to measure identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed of the acquiree at the fair values on the closing
date. The Company makes an initial allocation of the purchase price at the date of acquisition based upon its understanding of the fair
value of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities. Below is a summary of the acquisitions that closed from the inception of the Company

Revenue in General: The Company believes
the breakdown of gross revenue into service revenue and product revenue categories produces meaningful measures to Company management
and the Company s investors in light of the Company s objective to protect the service channel and derive the majority of
its revenue from services and expertise which are not capable of disruption from other channels. To achieve this objective, the Company
seeks to match the industry target metric of 70 to 80 of gross revenue being derived from services: examination fees, diagnostics fees,
laboratory work, surgery and others veterinary services. The Company believes these service revenue sources require veterinary professionals
to preside over care delivery and, unlike some veterinary care products, cannot be replaced or sold by other non-veterinary hospital
channels such as retail (including over-the-counter and online). Accordingly, the Company views products such as parasite controls, veterinary
nutrition products and additives as important, but the Company does not rely on product revenue to account for more than 20 to 30 of
gross revenue. Medications and therapeutics which only a licensed veterinary doctor or licensed technician can administer, while still
making up part of the 20 to 30 of gross revenue, are less easily diverted to non-veterinary hospital channels as they require licensed
professionals to prescribe or utilize them. 

The Company uses these percentages in concert
with metrics such as Revenue Per Patient Per day RPP and Average Patient Charge APC to analyze the comprehensive
nature of diagnostics and services provided by each veterinary hospital. Sometimes referred to quality medicine metrics
within the veterinary service industry, the Company uses RPP and APC to determine how a doctor s time is being utilized (inclusive
of all diagnostics and therapies). RPP and APC metrics are consolidated into the presentation of average daily service revenue and average
daily product revenue. The Company believes these analyses helps the Company ensure that its caseload is revenue positive to avoid clinicians
spending time on patient work which underutilizes their time and erodes labor profitability. The Company also believes these metrics
are useful to investors and potential investors to compare the Company s service-to-product revenue mix against generally accepted
industry targets and specific veterinary care service provider competitors. 

The services revenue and product revenue metrics
are measured in dollars as calculated by the practice management software we provide to each of our clinics to track medical notes, treatment
plans, services and products prescribed and provided, as well as to manage invoicing related to all of the above. Reports are generated
which allow Company management to view each of these as line-items as well as measure the ratio of service revenue versus product revenue
within our revenue mix. 

The Company believes the ratio metric is useful
for the management and its investors for several reasons: 

The Company and its medical
 leadership teach and enable its medical staff to provide comprehensive medical care which is appropriate for each animal patient.
 For example, charges to a client which skew too heavily toward products and do not include necessary services may be indicator that
 medical cases are not being fully diagnosed using an appropriate standard of available and appropriate diagnostics and care. This
 broad analysis can indicate more questions should be asked about how cases are managed by certain providers, particularly if patterns
 emerge; 

Comprehensive care for
 pets means physical exams, dental care, blood work and many other service related line-items. An overreliance on product revenue
 alone (which products may be available over-the-counter outside of the veterinary channel) leaves veterinary clinics susceptible
 to sales transfer to other channels. In addition, appropriate veterinary care (as defined by market practice and some state licensing
 boards) does not include prescribing products without the delivery of diagnostic and care services. 

Advancements in veterinary
 care within the last decade such as anesthetic protocols, pain management, fear free medicine and other services have shown great
 efficacy for the betterment of patients and their recovery from illness or surgeries. The absence of certain services and procedures
 within, for instance, a surgery package for a patient, would indicate an opportunity to improve outcomes for a patient and extend
 life expectancy. These are positive outcomes for clients and, therefore, of interest and value to the Company and our investors. 

36 

Service Revenues: The Company recognizes service revenue
from health exams, pet grooming, veterinary care, and certain other services performed at our animal hospitals or clinics and is recognized
once the service is completed, as this is when the customer has the ability to direct the use of and obtain the benefits of the services.
Payment terms are at the point of sale but may also occur upon completion of the service. Service revenue increased 526,084 or 6 , to
 9,735,585 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 9,209,501 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase
was driven primarily by the acquisition of animal hospital in Q4 2023. 

Product Revenues: Product revenue is recognized
when control passes, which occurs at a point in time when the customer completes a transaction at our animal hospitals or clinics and
receives the product. Product revenue decreased 146,700, or 4 , to 3,535,388 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared
to 3,682,088 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The overall decrease was a result of customers purchasing less products per
visit. 

Cost of service revenue (exclusive of depreciation
and amortization): Cost of service revenue consists of cost directly related to the animal services provided at the Company s
veterinary clinics and animal hospitals, which primarily includes personnel-related compensation costs of the employees at the Company s
veterinary clinics or animal hospitals, laboratory costs, pet supply costs, third-party veterinarian contractors, office rent, utilities,
supplies, and other cost arising as a result of the services being performed, excluding depreciation and amortization. Cost of service
revenue increased 858,009, or 13 , to 7,705,972 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 6,847,963 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in cost of service revenue sold excluding depreciation and amortization was driven primarily
by the acquisition of Valley Veterinary animal hospital and increase to service costs. 

Cost of product revenue (exclusive of depreciation
and amortization): Cost of product revenue consists of cost directly related to the product sales at the Company s veterinary
clinics and animal hospitals, which primarily includes personnel-related compensation costs of the employees at the Company s veterinary
clinics or animal hospitals, purchase price of the medication we dispense, and purchase price of product sold, excluding depreciation
and amortization. Cost of product revenue increased 175,273, or 7 , to 2,807,025 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared
to 2,631,752 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in cost of product revenue was driven primarily by the acquisition
of Valley Veterinary animal hospital, an increase to payroll costs and increase in product cost. 

General and Administrative Expense: General
and administrative expenses include personnel-related compensation costs for corporate employees, such as management, accounting, legal,
acquisition related and non-recurring expenses, insurance and other expenses used to operate the business. General and administrative
expenses increased 830,949, or 11 to 8,080,199 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 7,249,250 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to the expenses generated by the Valley Veterinary practice acquisition,
the IR agency contracts, marketing agreements and consulting contracts the Company entered into during the first quarter of 2024 following
the February 2024 public acquisition. 

Depreciation and Amortization Expense: Depreciation
and amortization expenses mainly relate to the assets used in generating revenue. Depreciation and amortization increased 132,466, or
14 , to 1,048,290 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 915,824 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.
The increase was primarily due to the acquisition of depreciable or amortizable assets as part of the Valley Veterinary acquisition. 

37 

Other Expense: Other expenses are composed primarily of
interest expenses and small denomination bank fee charges. Other expenses decreased 3,075,227, or 52 , to 2,806,213 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 5,881,440 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to the
decrease in the beneficial conversion offset by the financing arrangements to fund working capital at a very high effective interest
rate as compared to the Company s term loans. 

Net Loss: Net Loss decreased 353,206
, or 3 , to 10,297,539 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 10,650,745 for the nine months ended September 30,
2023. The net loss is primarily attributable to the operating expenses associated with the Valley Veterinary acquisitions, the cost associated
with the February 2024 and July 2024 public raise during the period, the IR Agency Consulting Agreement and other 3 rd party
consulting arrangements entered into to increase customer outreach and improve operations.

the cost associated with the public raise during the quarter, the IR Agency Consulting Agreement and other 3 rd party consulting
arrangements entered into to increase customer outreach and improve operations. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Since inception, we have financed our operations
from a combination of: 

issuances and sales of
 senior convertible notes; 

issuance of convertible
 debentures; 

borrowings under other
 debt consisting of: (i) a principal lending relationship with Farmers National Bank of Danville; (ii)a principal lending relationship
 with First Southern National Bank; (iii) short term financing arrangements under merchant cash advance agreement; 

common stock purchase agreement
 with Tumim Stone Capital LLC, 

proceeds from issuance
 of equity; and 

cash generated from operations. 

The Company has experienced operating losses
since its inception and had a total accumulated deficit of 31,733,646 as of September 30, 2024. The Company expects to incur additional
costs and require additional capital as the Company continues to acquire additional veterinary hospitals, clinics and practices. During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 the Company s cash used in operations was 9,328,339. 

The Company s primary short-term cash requirements
are to fund working capital, lease obligations and short-term debt, including current maturities of long-term debt. Working capital requirements
can vary significantly from period to period, particularly as a result of additional business acquisitions. The Company s medium-term
to long-term cash requirements are to service and repay debt, to expand through acquisitions, and to invest in facilities and equipment
for growth initiatives. 

The Company s ability to fund its cash
needs will depend, in part, on its ability to generate cash in the future, which depends on future financial results. The Company s
future results are subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors that may be outside of our
control. The Company s future access to, and the availability of credit on acceptable terms and conditions, is impacted by many
factors, including capital market liquidity and overall economic conditions.

These financial statements have been prepared
on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.
The Company has incurred recurring losses and as of September 30, 2024, had an accumulated deficit and negative working capital of 31,733,646
and 2,576,544. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company sustained a net loss of 3,489,326 and 10,297,539.
These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for the next twelve
months from the date these financial statements were issued. These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the
recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may be necessary should
the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. The Company s continuation as a going concern is contingent upon its ability
to obtain additional financing and to generate revenue and cash flow to meet its obligations on a timely basis. The Company will continue
to seek to raise additional funding through debt or equity financing during the next twelve months. Management believes that actions
presently being taken to obtain additional funding provide the opportunity for the Company to continue as a going concern. There is no
guarantee the Company will be successful in achieving these objectives. 

We cannot be sure that future funding will be
available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Due to often volatile nature of the financial markets, equity and debt financing may
be difficult to obtain. 

We may seek to raise any necessary additional
capital through a combination of private or public equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances, licensing
arrangements and other marketing and distribution arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through marketing and
distribution arrangements or other collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish
valuable rights or future revenue streams on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we raise additional capital through private or
public equity offerings, the ownership interest of our existing stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include
liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect our stockholders rights. If we raise additional capital through debt financing,
we may be subject to covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making
capital expenditures or declaring dividends. 

As of the date of this filing, the Company was
in compliance with all covenants and restrictions associated with our debt agreements. The Company is not aware of any instances of breaches
or non-compliance with its covenants and commitments under its debt agreements.

In conjunction with the Original Issue Discount
Secured Convertible Note with 662 Capital LLC the company issued the holder equity classified warrants that entitle the holder to purchase
the Company s common stock at a purchase price equal to the per share price in an IPO. The quantity of the Company s common
stock of subject to purchase upon exercise of the warrants is equal to 50 of the face value of the Bridge Note, divided by the per-share
price in the Qualified Financing, unless a Qualified Financing has not been completed by March 31, 2023 in which case the quantity of
Class A common stock subject to purchase upon exercise of the warrants will be an amount equal to 75 of the face value of the Bridge
Note divided by the per-share price in the Qualified Financing. 

The warrants were deemed legally detachable from
the Bridge Note and were fair valued using the Black Scholes Method to determine the relative fair values of the Bridge Note and the
detachable warrants. The significant inputs for the Black Scholes calculation included the exercise price and common share price of 0.44,
volatility rate of 27 and risk-free rate of 1.53 with a 5 year term. The proceeds received for the Bridge Note were allocated to the
detached warrants based on the relative fair values. Pursuant to ASC 470 the relative fair value of the warrants attributable to a discount
on debt is 429,284; this is amortized to interest expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the loan.

Critical Accounting Policies and Significant
Judgments and Estimates 

A summary of our significant accounting policies
is included in Note 2 of our audited consolidated annual financial statements included in Form 10-K filed with the SEC on April 8, 2024.
The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported
in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Our estimates and assumptions are based on historical experiences and
changes in the business environment. However, actual results may differ from estimates under different conditions, sometimes materially.
Critical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition
and results of operations and require management judgment. Our critical accounting policies and estimates are described below. 

Acquisitions 

The Company enters into acquisitions primarily
with existing veterinary hospitals throughout the United States. When we acquire a business or assets that are determined to meet the
definition of a business, we allocate the purchase consideration paid to acquire the business to the assets and liabilities acquired
based on estimated fair values at the acquisition date, with the excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets
acquired recorded as goodwill. If during the measurement period (a period not to exceed 12 months from the acquisition date) we receive
additional information that existed as of the acquisition date but at the time of the original allocation described above was unknown
to us, we make the appropriate adjustments to the purchase price allocation in the reporting period that the amounts are determined. 

Goodwill 

Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of
an acquired business over the amounts assigned to its net assets. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at a reporting
unit level on an annual basis or when an event occurs, or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value
of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Events or changes in circumstances that may trigger interim impairment reviews include
significant changes in business climate, operating results, planned investments in the reporting unit, or an expectation that the carrying
amount may not be recoverable, among other factors. 

The Company may first assess qualitative factors
to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing
the totality of events and circumstances, the Company determines it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit
is greater than it s carrying amount, an impairment test is unnecessary. If an impairment test is necessary, the Company will estimate
the fair value of its related reporting units. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the goodwill of that
reporting unit is determined to be impaired, and the Company will proceed with recording an impairment charge equal to the excess of
the carrying value over the related fair value. 

51 

Intangible Assets 

Intangible assets consist of client list, trademark
and non-compete intangibles that result from the acquisition of veterinary hospital or practices. Client list intangible represent the
value of the long-term client relationship from the veterinary hospitals and practices. Trademark intangible assets represent the value
associated with the brand names in place at the date of the acquisition. Non-compete intangible assets represent the value associated
with non-compete agreements for former employees and owners in place at the date of the acquisition. The client lists and trademark are
included in intangible asset reported in the balance sheet which are being amortized over a 5-year term based on the estimated economic
useful life of the client list and trademark. The amortization of the intangible asset is computed using the straight-line method. The
intangibles are evaluated for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently whenever events or circumstances occur indicating that
the carrying amount may not be recoverable. 

The Company uses the Multi-Period Excess Earnings
Method MPEEM ), a form of the income approach to determine the fair market value of the client list (customer relationship)
intangible assets acquired as part of the acquisitions of veterinary hospitals or practices. The principle behind the MPEEM is that the
value of an intangible asset is equal to the present value of the incremental after-tax cash flows attributable only to the subject intangible
asset after deducting contributory asset charges CAC ). 

The principle behind a contributory asset charge
is that an intangible asset rents or leases from a hypothetical third party all the assets it requires to
produce the cash flows resulting from its development, that each project rents only those assets it needs (including elements of goodwill)
and not the ones that it does not, and that each project pays the owner of the assets a fair return on (and of, when appropriate) the
fair value of the rented assets. Thus, any net cash flows remaining after such charges are attributable to the subject intangible asset
being valued. The incremental after tax cash flows attributable to the subject intangible asset are then discounted to their present
value. CACs generally reflect an estimate of the amount a typical market participant would have to pay to use these contributory assets
to generate income with the intangible asset. 

The most significant assumptions used in our
application of the MPEEM and in the valuation analysis of acquired client lists are: 

A useful life of 15 years
 where after 10 years the remaining customer base results in small positive cash flows and no terminal value was calculated. 

A discount rate of 19.6 
 was selected to calculate the present value of the prospective after tax cash flows associated with the customer base and business
 development relationships. 

We utilized an annual Company
 sales retention rate of 74.0 (Veterinary Services industry rate) for the Customer Base. 

The contributory asset
 charges are based on returns (8.3 to 19.7 for Net Working Capital (normalized); Fixed Assets; Assembled Workforce; Trade Name;
 and Non-Competes. 

As of September 30, 2024, our intangible assets
and goodwill balances were as follows: 

September 30, 

2024 
 
 Client List 
 1,945,000 
 
 Noncompete Agreement 
 398,300 
 
 Trademark

 Other Intangible Assets 
 45,836 
 
 Goodwill 
 8,022,082 

11,487,118 

52 

Our valuations of the intangible assets apart
of our veterinary clinics and animal hospital acquisitions has a relatively small value allocated to the client list (customer relationship)
due to our use of the Veterinary Services industry rate of 74 for the retention rate in our valuations. An increase in the rate by 6 
to 80 in our valuations would result in an increase of approximately 1.2 million to the client list and a decrease of approximately
 1.2 million to goodwill. We have elected to use the industry standard as our Company has minimal historical operations with less than
3 years of revenue producing activities through December 31, 2023. No acquisitions occurred during the nine months ended September 30,
2024. Management continues to evaluate the inputs used in our valuations based on quantitative and qualitative information available
to the Company. 

Stock-Based Compensation 

The stock-based payments are accounted for in
accordance with the provisions of ASC 718, Compensation Stock Compensation. The Company measures the estimated fair value of
the stock-based award on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model Black-Scholes Model and
recognizes compensation expense for those awards over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective
award. The Black-Scholes Model requires the use of a number of assumptions including volatility of the stock price, the weighted average
risk-free interest rate, and the vesting period in determining the fair value of stock-based awards. The expected term is based on the
 simplified method , due to the Company s limited stock award history. Under this method, the term is estimated using
the weighted average of the service vesting period and contractual term of the option award. As the Company Class A common stock has
a limited history in the public markets, the Company has identified several public entities of similar size, complexities and industry
and calculates historical volatility based on the volatilities of these companies. Although the Company believes its assumptions used
to calculate stock-based compensation expenses are reasonable, these assumptions can involve complex judgments about future events, which
are open to interpretation and inherent uncertainty. In addition, significant changes to our assumptions could significantly impact the
amount of expense recorded in a given period. The Company accounts for forfeitures in the period in which they occur, rather than estimate
expected forfeitures. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 

We are exposed to market risks in the ordinary
course of our business. Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial
market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily the result of fluctuations in interest rates, regulatory, and inflation. 

Interest Rate Risk 

Our credit facilities bear interest at a floating
rate, generally equal to the New York Prime Rate plus an applicable margin. As a result, we are exposed to fluctuations in in interest
rates to the extent of our net borrowings under the Master Lending and Credit Facility, which were 12,322,552 as of September 30, 2024.
The exposure to interest rate fluctuations for the Company is considered minimal. The Company s term loans issued under the Master
Lending and Credit Facility have a fixed interest rate for the initial five years followed by a variable interest rate. The Company has
not used any financial instruments to hedge potential fluctuations in interest rates. 

As interest rates rise, there is risk in the
form of more expensive loans which would negatively impact the valuation and profitability of each hospital which is purchased. 

53 

Inflation Risk 

We do not believe that inflation has had a material
effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. If our costs become subject to significant inflationary pressures,
we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. Our inability or failure to do so could harm our business,
financial condition, and operating results. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation of Disclosure
Controls and Procedures 

Under the supervision and with the participation
of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of the design
and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange
Act as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, these
disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports
filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s
rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure. 

Our management does not expect that our disclosure
controls and procedures will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide
only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. The design of any system of controls is based
in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in
achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that
there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations
in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any,
within our company have been detected. 

Changes in Internal
Control over Financial Reporting 

During the period covered
by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, there were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that have materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity
Securities and Use of Proceeds . 

Underwriter Warrants 

In connection with the Company s initial
public offering (the IPO of shares of Class A common stock, on August 30, 2023, the Company issued to Spartan Capital
Securities, LLC warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 5 of the shares of Class A common stock sold in the IPO (the Underwriter
Warrants ). The Underwriter Warrants are exercisable 180 days after the effective date of the registration statement relating
to the IPO at 5.50 per share (110 of the public offering price), but may not be transferred at any time prior to the date which
is 180 days beginning on the date of commencement of sales of securities in connection with this offering and expiring on a date
which is three (3) years from the commencement of sales of the public offering in compliance with FINRA Rule 5110 (1)(A).
The Underwriter Warrants have been deemed compensation by FINRA and are therefore subject to a 180-day lock-up pursuant to FINRA Rule 5110(e).
Spartan Capital Securities, LLC (or its respective permitted assignees under Rule 5110(e)(2)(B)) will not sell, transfer, assign,
pledge, or hypothecate the Underwriter Warrants or the securities underlying such warrants, nor will they engage in any hedging, short
sale, derivative, put, or call transaction that would result in the effective economic disposition of such warrants or the underlying
securities for a period of 180 days following the date of commencement of sales pursuant to the offering. In addition, the Underwriter
Warrants provide for piggy-back registration rights with respect to the shares underlying such warrants, exercisable for
a period of seven (7) years from the effective date of the offering in compliance with FINRA Rule 5110(g)(8)(D). The Company
will bear all fees and expenses attendant to registering the securities issuable on exercise of the Underwriter Warrants other than underwriting
commissions incurred and payable by the holders thereof. The exercise price and number of shares issuable upon exercise of the Underwriter
Warrants may be adjusted in certain circumstances including in the event of a stock dividend, extraordinary cash dividend or our recapitalization,
reorganization, merger or consolidation. However, the exercise price of the Underwriter Warrants or the underlying shares of such warrants
will not be adjusted for issuances of shares of Class A common stock at a price below such warrants exercise price.
