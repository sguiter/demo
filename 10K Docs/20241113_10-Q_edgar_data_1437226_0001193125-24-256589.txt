of the total contract revenues. Revenue is earned on a per transaction or labor hour basis, as that amount directly corresponds to the value of the Company s performance. Revenue recognition is negatively impacted by holidays and consultant vacation and sick days. 
 The Company recognizes revenue on fixed price contracts over time as services are rendered and uses a cost-based input method to measure progress. Determining a measure of progress requires management to make judgments that affect the timing of revenue recognized. Under the cost-based input method, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation. Revenues, including estimated fees or profits, are recorded proportionally as costs are incurred. The Company has determined that the cost-based input method provides a faithful depiction of the transfer of goods or services to the customer. Estimated losses are recognized immediately in the period in which current estimates indicate a loss. We record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance, including amounts which may be refundable. 
 The Company s time-and-material

 and fixed price revenue streams are recognized over time as the customer receives and consumes the benefits of the Company s performance as the work is performed. 
 In certain situations, related to client direct hire assignments, where the Company s fee is contingent upon the hired resources continued employment with the client, revenue is not fully recognized until such employment conditions are satisfied. 
 We do not sell, lease or otherwise market computer software or hardware, and, essentially, of our revenue is derived from the sale of data and analytics, IT staffing and digital transformation services. We expense sales commissions in the same period in which revenues are realized. These costs are recorded within sales, general and administrative expenses. 
 Each contract the Company enters is assessed to determine the promised services to be performed and includes identification of the performance obligations required by the contract. In substantially all contracts, we have identified a single performance obligation for each contract either because the promised services are distinct, or the promised services are highly interrelated and interdependent and therefore represent a combined single performance obligation. 
 Our Data and Analytics Services segment provides specialized capabilities in delivering data management and analytics services to its customers globally. This business offers project-based consulting services in the areas of Master Data Management, Enterprise Data Integration, Big Data, Analytics and Digital Transformation, which can be delivered using onsite and offshore resources. 
 Our IT Staffing Services segment combines technical expertise with business process experience to deliver a broad range of services in digital and mainstream technologies. Our digital technology stack includes data management and analytics, cloud, mobility, social and automation. Our mainstream technologies include business intelligence / data warehousing; web services; enterprise resource planning customer resource management; and e-Business
 solutions. We work with businesses and institutions with significant IT spend and recurring staffing needs. We also support smaller organizations with their project focused temporary IT staffing requirements. In late 2023, we expanded our service offerings to include engineering staffing services. Substantially all our revenue is recognized over time.

Overview: We are a provider of Digital Transformation IT Services to mostly large and medium-sized organizations. Our portfolio of offerings includes data management and analytics services, other digital transformation services, such as digital learning services, and IT Staffing Services. We operate in two reporting segments Data and Analytics Services and IT Staffing Services. Our data and analytics services are marketed on a global basis under the brand Mastech InfoTrellis and are delivered largely on a project basis with on-site and off-shore resources. These data and analytics capabilities and expertise were acquired through our acquisition of InfoTrellis and enhanced and expanded subsequent to the acquisition. In October 2020, we acquired AmberLeaf Partners, Inc. AmberLeaf ), a Chicago-based customer experience consulting firm. This acquisition enhanced our capabilities in customer experience strategy and managed services offerings for a variety of Cloud-based enterprise applications across sales, marketing and customer services organizations. Our IT staffing business combines technical expertise with business process experience to deliver a broad range of staffing services in digital and mainstream technologies, as well as other digital transformation services. Both business segments provide their services across various industry verticals, including financial services, government, healthcare, manufacturing, retail, technology telecommunications and transportation. In our Data and Analytics Services segment, we evaluate our revenues and gross profits largely by service line. In our IT Staffing Services segment, we evaluate our revenues and gross profits largely by sales channel responsibility. This analysis within both our reporting segments is multi-purposed and includes technologies employed, client relationships, and geographic locations. Data and Analytics: We provide information regarding our new bookings in our Data and Analytics Services segment, which represents the estimated value of client engagements, including those acquired through acquisitions, as well as renewals and extensions to existing contracts, because we believe doing so provides useful trend information regarding changes in the volume of our new business over time. New bookings can vary significantly quarter to quarter, depending, in part, on the timing of the signing of a small number of large engagements. Among other factors, the types of services and solutions to be delivered, the duration of the engagement and the pace and level of client spending impact the timing of the conversion of new bookings to revenues. In addition, substantially all of our contracts are terminable by the client on short notice, with little or no termination penalties. Information regarding our new bookings is not comparable to, nor should it be substituted for, an analysis of our revenues over time. New bookings involve estimates and judgments. There are no third-party standards or requirements governing the calculation of bookings. We do not update our new bookings for material subsequent terminations or reductions related to bookings originally provided in prior periods.

Economic Trends and Outlook: Generally, our business outlook is highly correlated to general North American economic conditions, particularly with respect to our IT Staffing Services segment. During periods of increasing employment and economic expansion, demand for our services tends to increase. Conversely, during periods of contracting employment and / or a slowing global economy, demand for our services tends to decline. With economic expansion in 2010 through 2019 activity levels improved. However, as economic conditions strengthened, we experienced increased tightness in the supply side (skilled IT professionals) of our businesses. These supply-side challenges pressured resource costs and, to some extent, gross margins. As we entered 2020, we were encouraged by continued growth in the domestic job markets and expanding U.S. and global economies. However, with the COVID-19 pandemic surfacing in the first quarter of 2020, we realized that economic growth would quickly turn into recessionary conditions, which had a material impact on activity levels in both of our business segments. In 2021, we were encouraged by the global rollout of vaccination programs and signs of economic improvement, however, the proliferation of COVID-19 variants had caused some uncertainty and disruption in the global markets. In 2022 and 2023, COVID-19-related concerns seemed to subside; however, increased inflation, challenges in the financial sector related to increasing interest rates, and concerns about a possible recession created much uncertainty and impacted demand for our services in the second half of 2022 and for the entire year of 2023. While economic conditions in North American have shown signs of improvement during 2024, a level of uncertainty remains with respect to inflation and job growth, the potential of escalations of existing conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine and the impacts of the U.S. presidential election. It is difficult to predict the impact or duration that these market pressures may have on our businesses and results of operations during the remainder of 2024 and beyond. In addition to tracking general economic conditions in the markets that we service, a large portion of our revenues is generated from a limited number of clients (see Item 1A, the Risk Factor entitled Our revenues are highly concentrated, and the loss of a significant client would adversely affect our business and revenues in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023). Accordingly, our trends and outlook are additionally impacted by the prospects and well-being of these specific clients. This account concentration factor may result in our results of operations deviating from the prevailing economic trends from time to time. Within our IT Staffing Services segment, a larger portion of our revenues has come from strategic relationships with systems integrators. Additionally, many large end users of IT staffing services are employing MSPs to manage their contractor spending. Both of these dynamics may pressure our IT staffing gross margins in the future. Recent growth in advanced technologies (social, cloud, analytics, mobility, automation) is providing opportunities within our IT Staffing Services segment. However, supply side challenges have proven to be acute with respect to many of these technologies. Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 as Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023: Revenues: Revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 51.8 million, compared to 47.8 million for the corresponding three-month period in 2023.

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had two clients that each had revenues in excess of 10 of total revenues (CGI = 14.0 and Allegis = 11.7 ). For the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Company had one client that had revenues in excess of 10 of total revenues (CGI = 21.1 ).

Fluctuations within SG A expense components during the third quarter of 2024, compared to the third quarter of 2023, included the following: 

Sales expenses increased by 0.2 million in the 2024 period compared to the corresponding 2023 period. Sales expenses in our Data and Analytics Services segment decreased 0.1 million due to lower staff headcount in our sales organization. Sales expenses in our IT Staffing Services segment increased by 0.3 million, largely due to higher sales commissions and other variable expenses. 

Operations expenses were flat in the 2024 period compared to the corresponding 2023 period. Operations expenses decreased 0.1 million in our Data and Analytics Services segment due to staff reductions. In our IT Staffing Services segment, operations expenses increased by 0.1 million and reflected an increase in recruitment staff and higher commission expenses. 

General and administrative expenses decreased 0.4 million in the 2024 period compared to the corresponding 2023 period.

For the three months ended September 30, 2023, Other Income / (Expense) consisted of interest income of 148,000 and foreign exchange gains of 55,000.

Sales expenses in our Data and Analytics Services segment increased by 0.8 million in the 2024 period and reflected higher marketing and event costs and higher sales compensation expense. Sales expenses in our IT Staffing Services segment were higher by 0.3 million due to higher sales commissions and other variable expenses. 

Operations expenses decreased by 0.9 million in the 2024 period, compared to the corresponding 2023 period. In our Data and Analytics Services segment, operations expenses decreased by 0.6 million due to staff reductions and lower variable compensation expenses. Operations expenses in our IT Staffing Services segment decreased by 0.3 million and largely related to recruitment staff reductions and lower other variable expenses in the first half of 2024, partially offset by higher commission expenses in the 2024 third quarter. 

General and administrative expenses decreased by 1.8 million in the 2024 period compared to the corresponding 2023 period. General and administrative expenses in our Data and Analytics Services segment decreased by 2.4 million due to executive leadership staff reductions, lower stock-based compensation expense and higher professional services fees in 2023 of 1.2 million related to an employment claim. In our IT Staffing Services segment, general and administrative expenses increased by 0.6 million, largely due to strategic consulting expenses associated with our consulting agreement with Primentor. 

Amortization of acquired intangible assets was 2.0 million in 2024, compared to 2.1 million in the 2023 period, as a portion of our intangible assets become fully amortized in 2024. 

Employment-related claim reserve, net of expected recoveries, totaled 3.1 million in the 2023 period, compared to no expense in the corresponding 2024 period. Other Income / (Expense) Components: Other Income / (Expense) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted of interest income of 447,000 and foreign exchange losses of 74,000). For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, Other Income / (Expense) consisted of interest income of 232,000 and foreign exchange losses of 32,000). The higher interest income reflected higher cash balances on hand in the 2024 period was responsible for the favorable year-over-year variance in Other Income, net and was partially offset by currency fluctuations. Income Tax Expense: Income tax expense (benefit) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 994,000, representing an effective tax rate on pre-tax income of 24.2 compared to an income tax benefit of 358,000) for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which represented a 16.7 effective tax rate on a pre-tax (loss). In 2023, foreign pre-tax income reduced the consolidated tax benefit which included a domestic pre-tax loss. The favorable effective tax rate in the 2024 period was largely due to a worthless stock deduction recognized on the dissolution of our Singapore entity, partially offset by excess tax expense related to stock options/restricted shares. Liquidity and Capital Resources: Financial Conditions and Liquidity: As of September 30, 2024, we had cash balances on hand of 23.9 million, no bank debt outstanding and approximately 25 million of borrowing capacity under our existing credit facility. Historically, we have funded our organic business needs with cash generated from operating activities. Controlling our operating working capital levels by closely managing our accounts receivable balance is an important element of cash generation. As of September 30, 2024, our accounts receivable days sales outstanding DSOs measurement was 55-days. We believe that cash provided by operating activities, cash balances on hand and current availability under our credit facility will be adequate to fund our business needs and support our share repurchase program that we announced in February 2023 over the next twelve months, exclusive of any acquisition activity.

Cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities: Cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 3.2 million compared to cash provided by operating activities of 10.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Elements of cash flows in the 2024 period were net income of 3.1 million, non-cash charges of 4.4 million, and an increase in operating working capital levels of 4.3 million). During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, elements of cash flows were a net loss of 1.8 million), non-cash charges of 5.1 million and a decrease in operating working capital levels of 7.2 million. Operating working capital increased in 2024 due to higher accounts receivable balances resulting from our sequential revenue growth during the first nine months. During the 2023 period, accounts receivable balances decreased due to revenue decreases during the period. Cash flows (used in) investing activities: Cash (used in) investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 0.8 million) compared to 0.1 million) for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. During the nine months ended September 2024, capital expenditures totaled 0.8 million). In the 2023 period, capital expenditures totaled 0.2 million), partially offset by the recovery of non-current deposits of 0.1 million. The increase in capital expenditures during the 2024 period compared to the 2023 period reflected higher expenditures for laptop replacements and other technology enhancements. Cash flows provided by (used in) financing activities: Cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 0.5 million and consisted of proceeds from the exercise of stock options of 440,000 and the issuance of common shares related to our Employee Stock Purchase Plan of 136,000, which was partially offset by the purchase of treasury shares of 80,000). Cash (used in) financings activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, totaled 1.5 million) and consisted of 1.1 million) of term loan repayments and the purchase of treasury shares under our share repurchase program of 572,000), which was partially offset by 150,000 related to proceeds from the issuance of shares of common stock under the Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements: Other than 324,000 in outstanding letters of credit issued under our Credit Agreement, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements. For further details about the outstanding letters of credit, refer to Note 8 Credit Facility in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included herein. Inflation: We do not believe that inflation had a significant impact on our results of operations for the periods presented, although economic uncertainty, including the concerns of our clients and other companies with respect to inflationary conditions in North America and elsewhere, has had and may continue to have an adverse impact on the demand for our services. On an ongoing basis, we attempt to minimize any effects of inflation on our operating results by controlling operating costs and, whenever possible, seek to ensure that billing rates reflect increases in costs due to inflation. However, high levels of inflation may result in higher interest rates which could increase our borrowing costs in the future if we elect to draw on our current or future credit facilities. In addition, refer to Item 1A. Risk factors in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion about risks that inflation directly or indirectly may pose to our business. Seasonality: Our operations are generally not affected by seasonal fluctuations. However, our consultants billable hours are affected by national holidays and vacation policies. Accordingly, we generally have lower utilization rates and higher benefit costs during the fourth quarter. Additionally, assignment completions tend to be higher near the end of the calendar year, which largely impacts our revenue and gross profit performance during the subsequent quarter. Recently Issued Accounting Standards: Recent accounting pronouncements are described in Note 13 to the accompanying financial statements. 

ITEM 3. 
 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK In addition to the inherent operational risks, the Company is exposed to certain market risks, primarily related to changes in interest rates and currency fluctuations.

Table of Contents 

Interest Rates As of September 30, 2024, we had no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement Refer to Note 8 Credit Facility in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, included herein. Currency Fluctuations The reporting currency of the Company and its subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. The functional currency of the Company s subsidiary in Canada is the U.S. dollar because the majority of its revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars. The functional currencies of the Company s Indian and European subsidiaries are the local currency of the location of such subsidiary. The results of operations of the Company s Indian and European subsidiaries are translated at the monthly average exchange rates prevailing during the period. The financial position of the Company s Indian and European subsidiaries is translated at the current exchange rates at the end of the period, and the related translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within Shareholders Equity. Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included as a component of other income (expense), net in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations, and have not been material for all periods presented. A hypothetical 10 increase or decrease in overall foreign currency rates in the first nine months of 2024 would not have had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

ITEM 4. 
 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Disclosure Controls and Procedures The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of Company management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(b). Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective. We do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all our control deficiencies and instances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. 
 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS In the ordinary course of our business, we are involved in a number of lawsuits and administrative proceedings. While uncertainties are inherent in the final outcome of these matters, management believes, after consultation with legal counsel, that the disposition of these proceedings should not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

ITEM 1A. 
 RISK FACTORS There have been no material changes from the risk factors as previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on March 15, 2024.
