 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 AND
2023 

In August 2020, the FASB issued
ASU No. 2020-06, Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity s
Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40) ASU 2020-06 ). ASU 2020-06 simplifies the accounting for convertible debt instruments
and convertible preferred stock by removing the existing guidance in ASC 470-20 that requires entities to account for beneficial conversion
features and cash conversion features in equity, separately from the host convertible debt or preferred stock. Two methods of transition
were permitted upon adoption: full retrospective and modified retrospective. The Company has yet to adopt ASC 2020-06. The accounting
impact will be a reclassification from Additional Paid-In Capital to Retained Earnings. The Company adopted ASC 2020-06 as of April 1,
2023. 

and for the six-month
periods ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. The Company s accumulated deficit was and as
of September 30, 2024, and March 31, 2024, respectively. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding the Company s ability to
continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustment relating to the recoverability and classification
of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. The Company is taking certain steps
to provide the necessary capital to continue its operations. These steps include but are not limited to: 1) focus on our new business
model and 2) raising equity or debt financing. Our auditors express substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 

and as of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, respectively. These amounts consist of funds
contributed by the management for the purpose of providing financing during periods of low or negative cashflow in order to cover essential
costs of continuing operations, as well as funds payable to management as compensation. On an annual basis the Company accrues 48,000
of wages payable to its CEO, Kent Rodriguez, under the terms of a four-year employment agreement entered into April 1, 2020, which
designates monthly payments due Mr. Rodriguez in the amount of 4,000. On July 30, 2024, the Company and During
each of the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 salary of and , respectively were accrued for Mr. Rodriquez. 

During each of the three-and
six-month periods ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, the Company accrued and , respectively in preferred dividends from
the Series A preferred shares to Mr. Kent Rodriguez, the holder of the Series A Preferred shares. Upon conversion the number of shares
of common stock to be exchanged shall equal 51 of the then fully diluted issued and outstanding common stock.

date of this note, the outstanding principal balance of this note shall bear annual interest at , with interest commencing on
the sixth month anniversary of the Issuance Date. The note has a maturity date of . Additionally, the note
has a fixed conversion feature of 0.02 per share, and therefore the Convertible Note is measured at the net of Debt Discount, calculated
based off its Beneficial Conversion Features. The note was booked with a debt discount of the full principal balance of . As of
June 30, 2022, this entire debt discount had been amortized. Further, on March 7, 2022, the Company issued additional convertible promissory
note in the amount of , with a maturity date of , an annual interest rate of and a fixed conversion
price of per share, in exchange for consulting services. The convertible amount is accounted for based off the outstanding
principal and related interest pertaining to the portion convertible debt instrument being converted, multiplied by the previously specified
conversion rate. 

On July 18, 2022, a Letter
Agreement was drafted between the Company and the debtholder, which establishes the settlement of these debts once the Company s
Form 10 goes effective. On January 23, 2023 the Company and the convertible note holder mutually agreed to settle any and all amounts
owed pursuant to 1) the Consulting Agreement and Convertible Promissory Note in the amount of dated March 5, 2021; and 2)
the Consulting Agreement and a Convertible Promissory Note in the amount of dated March 7, 2022; 3) all interest accrued

the Company. On January 12, 2018, our Board of Directors agreed to amend Designation of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock be amended
by changing the ratio for conversion, in Article IV, subparagraph (a), from 0.4 to 0.51 so that upon conversion the number of shares
of common stock to be exchanged shall equal 51 of then issued and outstanding common stock. In addition, on January 12, 2018, the Company
and the Series A Holder agreed to forgive all accrued interest to date on the Series A, and to pause any accruals until April 1, 2023.
The Series A Convertible Preferred Stock carries liquidating preference, over all other classes of stock, equal to the amount paid for
the stock plus any unpaid dividends. Currently the value of the liquidation preference is , the amount of debt that the related
party converted into the preferred stock. If this Preferred Stock were to be redeemed by the holder, it would result in an aggregate of
the 500,000 liquidation preference, on a per share basis, this would equal per share. The Company and Series A Preferred
Holder agreed to forgive all accrued interest and arrearages in preferred share dividends of Series A Preferred Stock through March 31,
2023. Dividends began to accrue on the Series A Preferred Stock as of April 1, 2023. During each of the three- and six-month periods ended

The following discussion of our financial condition and results
of operations should be read in conjunction with the notes to the consolidated unaudited financial statements appearing elsewhere in this
Report and the Company s audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024, as filed with the SEC in its Annual

Plan of Operations 

On September 14, 2023, we filed a registration statement on
Form 10-12g which was deemed effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC on November 8, 2023. 

We plan to assemble a portfolio of early-stage EV Battery
Technologies developed from Universities in Norway, Sweden and Finland, and seek grants from the State of Minnesota Department of Economic
Development to find and identify corporate partners to commercialize these technologies and ultimately produce revenues for the Company. 

We do not currently have any products. We are working to assemble
a portfolio of early-stage EV Battery Technologies. 

As the Company continues its business development and asset
acquisitions, the Company anticipates our capital needs to be between 500,000 and 5,000,000 (varying based on growth strategies).

Revenue 

We have not generated any revenue since our inception and
do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of products in the near future. 

Net Loss 

We reported a net loss of 29,833 in the three months ended
September 30, 2024 as compared to a net loss of 30,045 in the three months ended September 30, 2023 and a net loss attributable to our
common stockholders of 84,452 in the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to a net loss attributable to our common stockholders
of 84,663 as of September 30, 2023 which is reflective of a dividend on our Preferred Stock of 54,618 at September 30, 2024 and September

Operating Expenses 

Total operating expenses
for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023, remained relatively constant with 29,833 at September 30, 2024
compared to total operating expenses of 30,045 at September 30, 2023. The increase in operating expenses during the three months ended
September 30, 2024, is mainly due to an increase in legal and professional fees from 1,298 (September 30, 2023) to 7,410 (September
30, 2024) offset by a reduction in general and administrative expenses from 21,852 in the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 18,332
for the three months e nded September 30, 2024. Rent remained relatively constant. The increase in legal and professional expenses
was largely due to an increase in audit and accounting fees, filing fees and tax services from 1,298 for the period ended September 30,
2023 to 7,410 for the period ended September 30, 2024 due to continuing costs related to the audit of our interim financial statements
following notice of effect for our Form 10 in November 2023. Consulting fees increased by 500 from
 0 in the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 500 in the three months ended September 30, 2024.

2024, was nil, as compared to other income in the three months ended September 30, 2023, of 2,250, related to interest expense of
 2,250 with no comparable expense in the three months ended September 30, 2024. 

Dividends on Preferred Stock 

Dividends on Preferred Stock for the period ended September
30, 2024, and 2023 remained constant, at 54,618 for each period. These dividends on preferred stock are required subject to the designation
of the preferred stock and contribute to the net loss attributable to our common stockholders. 

Six Months Ended September 30, 2024, and September 30,
2023 

Revenue 

We have not generated any revenue since our inception and
do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of products in the near future.

September 30, 2024 as compared to a net loss of 156,272 in the six months ended September 30, 2023 and a net loss attributable to our
common stockholders of 175,607 in the six months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to a net loss attributable to our common stockholders
of 265,507 as of September 30, 2023 which is reflective of a dividend on our Preferred Stock of 109,235 at September 30, 2024 and September

Operating Expenses 

Total operating expenses
for the six months ended September 30, 2024, were 66,372 compared to total operating expenses of 151,772 for the six months ended September
30, 2023. The decrease in operating expenses during the six months ended September 30, 2024, is mainly due to reduction in consulting
expenses from 78,300 (September 30, 2023) to 1,250 (September 30, 2024) and a slight reduction in general and administrative expenses
from 38,816 in the six months ended September 30, 2023, to 34,931 for the six months ended September 30, 2024. Rent, legal and professional
expenses remained relatively constant for the six months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023 with a slight decrease of 3,412 in the six
months ended September 30, 2024. Consulting fees decreased from 78,300 in the six months ended September 30, 2023, to 1,250 in the six
months ended September 30, 2024, due to a consulting agreement with an independent third party settled by shares valued at 78,300 which
terminated in the period ended September 30, 2023. 

Other Income (Expense) 

Other income in the six months ended September 30, 2024,
was nil, as compared to other income in the six months ended September 30, 2023, of 4500, related to interest expense of 4,500
with no comparable expense in the six months ended September 30, 2024, due to the payment of outstanding loans with no outstanding loans
for the six months ended September 30, 2024. 

Dividends on Preferred Stock 

Dividends on Preferred Stock for the period ended September
30, 2024, and 2023 remained constant, 109,235 for each of the six month periods ended September 30, 2024, and 2023. These dividends on
preferred stock are required subject to the designation of the preferred stock and contribute to the net loss attributable to our common
stockholders.

 Financing Activities 

 Net cash provided by financing activities
was 67,913 for the six months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 49,102 for the six months ended September 30, 2023. During
the six months ended September 30, 2024, the Company received 67,913 in proceeds from a related party in the form of unsecured advances.
During the six months ended September 30, 2023, the Company received net proceeds of 49,102 from a related party in the form of unsecured
advances. 

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 

 We are in need of additional cash resources to maintain our
operations. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash of 6,133 and prepaid expenses of 4,992. We are in the early stage of development and
have experienced net losses to date and have not generated revenue from operations which raises substantial doubt about our ability to
continue as a going concern. There are a number of conditions that we must satisfy before we will be able to acquire, license and acquire
products and intellectual property, not the least of which is negotiating and financing any acquisitions. We are in the process of identifying
and establishing strategic partners and technologies in order to establish a market and generate commercial orders by customers and licensing
which will include effective marketing and sales capabilities for any products. We do not currently have sufficient resources to accomplish
any of these conditions necessary for us to generate revenue and expect to incur increasing operating expenses. We will require substantial
additional funds for operations, the service of debt and to fund our business objectives. There can be no assurance that financing, whether
debt or equity, will always be available to us in the amount required at any particular time or for any particular period or, if available,
that it can be obtained on terms favorable to us. If additional funds are raised by the issuance of equity securities, such as through
the issuance and exercise of warrants, then existing stockholders will experience dilution of their ownership interest. If additional
funds are raised by the issuance of debt or other equity instruments, we may be subject to certain limitations in our operations, and
issuance of such securities may have rights senior to those of the then existing stockholders. We currently have no agreements, arrangements
or understandings with any person or entity to obtain funds through bank loans, lines of credit or any other sources. 

Going Concern 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have
been prepared on a going concern basis which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal
course of business. As shown in the consolidated financial statements, the Company has incurred recurring net losses since its inception
and has raised limited capital. The Company had a net loss of 66,372 and 156,272 for the six month periods ended September 30, 2024,
and 2023, respectively. The Company s accumulated deficit was 35,022,884 and 34,847,277 as of September 30, 2024, and March 31,
2024, respectively. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated
financial statements do not include any adjustment relating to the recoverability and classification of liabilities that might be necessary
should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. The Company is taking certain steps to provide the necessary capital to continue
its operations. These steps include but are not limited to: 1) focus on our new business model and 2) raising equity or debt financing.
Our auditors express substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements.

Critical Accounting Estimates 

The financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the U.S. GAAP ). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, costs and expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates
on historical experience, as appropriate, and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Changes
in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Accordingly, actual results could differ significantly
from the estimates made by our management. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. To the extent that there are
material differences between these estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results
of operations and cash flows will be affected. Our significant accounting policies are more fully discussed in Note 2 to our unaudited
condensed financial statements contained herein. 

Estimates 

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets
and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Specifically, such estimates were made by the Company for the valuation of derivative
liability, stock compensation and beneficial conversion feature expenses. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

In November 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update
2023-07, Segment Reporting Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures ASU 2023-07 ), which requires
incremental disclosures related to a public entity s reportable segments. Required disclosures include, on an annual and interim
basis, significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker CODM and included
within each reported measure of segment profit or loss, an amount for other segment items (which is the difference between segment revenue
less segment expenses and less segment profit or loss) and a description of its composition, the title and position of the CODM, and an
explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measure(s) of segment profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to
allocate resources. The standard also permits disclosure of more than one measure of segment profit. ASU 2023-07 is effective for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company does not
believe the adoption of ASU 2023-07 will have any impact on our financial statements. 

In December 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update
2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures ASU 2023-09 ), which requires public entities on an annual
basis to (1) disclose specific categories in the rate reconciliation and (2) provide additional information for reconciling items that
meet a quantitative threshold (if the effect of those reconciling items is equal to or greater than 5 percent of the amount computed by
multiplying pretax income or loss by the applicable statutory income tax rate). ASU 2023-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2025. We are evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2023-09 on our financial statements. 

In March 2024, the SEC adopted the final rule under SEC Release
No. 33-11275, The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate Related Disclosures for Investors , which requires registrants
to disclose climate-related information in registration statements and annual reports. The new rules would be effective for annual reporting
periods beginning in fiscal year 2025. However, in April 2024, the SEC exercised its discretion to stay these rules pending the completion
of judicial review of certain consolidated petitions with the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit in connection with
these rules. We are evaluating the impact the adoption of this rule, if any, may have on our financial statements.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management,
including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as of September 30, 2024, we conducted an evaluation of our
disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that,
based on the material weaknesses discussed below, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of such date to ensure
that information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act were recorded, processed,
summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Act Commission s rules and forms and that
our disclosure controls are not effectively designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that
we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer
and principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure. 

Our internal controls and procedures are not effective for
the following reasons: (i) there is an inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives as management is comprised
of only one person, who is the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer and, (ii) the Company does
not have a formal audit committee with a financial expert, and thus the Company lacks the board oversight role within the financial reporting
process. 

In order to mitigate the foregoing material weakness, we have
engaged an outside accounting consultant with significant experience in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP
to assist us in the preparation of our financial statements to ensure that these financial statements are prepared in conformity with
GAAP. We will continue to monitor the effectiveness of this action and make any changes that our management deems appropriate. 

We would need to hire additional staff to provide greater
segregation of duties. Currently, it is not feasible to hire additional staff to obtain optimal segregation of duties. Management will
continue to reassess this matter to determine whether improvement in segregation of duty is feasible. In addition, we would need
to expand our board to include independent members. 

Going forward, we intend to evaluate our processes and procedures
and, where practicable and resources permit, implement changes in order to have more effective controls over financial reporting. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

During the period covered by this report, there were no changes
in our internal controls over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting.
