Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

As
of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had an accumulated deficit of 20,936,297 and 20,054,293, respectively. As of September
30, 2024, we had cash of 153,716 and a working capital of 68,998. As of December 31, 2023, we had cash of 18,449 and a working capital
deficit of 335,139. The increase in the working capital was primarily due to cash provided by financing activities for the issuance
of commons stocks which was partially offset by cash used in operating activities. 

Going
Concern Assessment 

The
Company has adverse conditions that raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. These adverse
conditions are negative financial trends, specifically cash outflow from operating activities, operating losses, accumulated deficit
and other adverse key financial ratios. 

Management s
plan to alleviate the substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern include attempting to improve
its business profitability, its ability to generate sufficient cash flow from its operations to meet its operating needs on a timely
basis, obtain additional working capital funds from the majority shareholder and the President of the Company to eliminate inefficiencies
in order to meet its anticipated cash requirements. However, there can be no assurance that these plans and arrangements will be sufficient
to fund the Company s ongoing capital expenditures and other requirements. 

The
unaudited condensed financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded
assets, or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary in the event that the Company cannot continue as a going
concern. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We
have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition,
changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that
is material to stockholders. 

Critical
Accounting Policies 

The
financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
The preparation of these financial statements requires making estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The estimates are based on historical experience
and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making
judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ
from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 

The
critical accounting policies are discussed in further detail in the notes to the unaudited financial statements appearing elsewhere
in this Form 10-Q report. Management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables us to provide
useful and reliable financial information about our operating results and financial condition.
