 NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

NOTE 1. 
 separate reportable segments, which we describe in Note 12. In the fourth quarter of 2023, Sempra realigned its reportable segments to reflect changes in how the CODM oversees our platforms: Sempra California, Sempra Texas Utilities and Sempra Infrastructure. Our former SDG E and SoCalGas reportable segments were combined into operating and reportable segment, Sempra California, which is consistent with how the CODM assesses performance due to the similarities of their operations, including geographic location and regulatory framework in California. Sempra s historical segment disclosures have been restated to conform with the current presentation, so that all discussions reflect the revised segment information of its reportable segments. All references in these Notes to our reportable segments are not intended to refer to any legal entity with the same or similar name. 
 SDG E 
 SDG E s common stock is wholly owned by Enova Corporation, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Sempra. SDG E is a regulated public utility that provides electric service to San Diego and southern Orange counties and natural gas service to San Diego County. SDG E has reportable segment. 
 SoCalGas 
 SoCalGas common stock is wholly owned by Pacific Enterprises, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Sempra. SoCalGas is a regulated public natural gas distribution utility, serving customers throughout most of Southern California and part of central California. SoCalGas has reportable segment.

Table of Contents 

SDG E 
 SDG E s power procurement is subject to reliability requirements that may require SDG E to enter into various PPAs that include variable interests. SDG E evaluates the respective entities to determine if variable interests exist and, based on the qualitative and quantitative analyses described above, if SDG E, and indirectly Sempra, is the primary beneficiary. 
 SDG E has agreements under which it purchases power generated by facilities for which it supplies all of the natural gas to fuel the power plant (i.e., tolling agreements). SDG E s obligation to absorb natural gas costs may be a significant variable interest. In addition, SDG E has the power to direct the dispatch of electricity generated by these facilities. Based on our analysis, the ability to direct the dispatch of electricity may have the most significant impact on the economic performance of the entity owning the generating facility because of the associated exposure to the cost of natural gas, which fuels the plants, and the value of electricity produced. To the extent that SDG E (1) is obligated to purchase and provide fuel to operate the facility, (2) has the power to direct the dispatch, and (3) purchases all of the output from the facility for a substantial portion of the facility s useful life, SDG E may be the primary beneficiary of the entity owning the generating facility. SDG E determines if it is the primary beneficiary in these cases based on a qualitative approach in which it considers the operational characteristics of the facility, including its expected power generation output relative to its capacity to generate and the financial structure of the entity, among other factors. If SDG E determines that it is the primary beneficiary, SDG E and Sempra consolidate the entity that owns the facility as a VIE. 
 In addition to tolling agreements, other variable interests involve various elements of fuel and power costs, and other components of cash flows expected to be paid to or received by our counterparties. In most of these cases, the expectation of variability is not substantial, and SDG E generally does not have the power to direct activities, including the operation and maintenance activities of the generating facility, that most significantly impact the economic performance of the other VIEs. If our ongoing evaluation of these VIEs were to conclude that SDG E becomes the primary beneficiary and consolidation by SDG E becomes necessary, the effects could be significant to the financial position and liquidity of SDG E and Sempra.

 million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. SDG E recovers costs incurred on PPAs, tolling agreements and other variable interests through CPUC-approved long-term power procurement plans. SDG E has no residual interest in the respective entities and has not provided or guaranteed any debt or equity support, liquidity arrangements, performance guarantees or other commitments associated with these contracts other than the purchase commitments described in Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report. As a result, SDG E s potential exposure to loss from its variable interest in these VIEs is not significant. 
 Other Sempra 
 Oncor Holdings 
 Oncor Holdings is a VIE. Sempra is not the primary beneficiary of this VIE because of the structural and operational ring-fencing and governance measures in place that prevent us from having the power to direct the significant activities of Oncor Holdings. As a result, we do not consolidate Oncor Holdings and instead account for our ownership interest as an equity method investment. See Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report for additional information about our equity method investment in Oncor Holdings and restrictions on our ability to influence its activities. Our maximum exposure to loss, which fluctuates over time, from our interest in Oncor Holdings does not exceed the carrying value of our investment, which was million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Cameron LNG JV 
 Cameron LNG JV is a VIE principally due to contractual provisions that transfer certain risks to customers. Sempra is not the primary beneficiary of this VIE because we do not have the power to direct the most significant activities of Cameron LNG JV, including LNG production and operation and maintenance activities at the liquefaction facility. Therefore, we account for our investment in Cameron LNG JV under the equity method. The carrying value of our investment was million at September 30, 2024 and million at December 31, 2023. Our maximum exposure to loss, which fluctuates over time, includes the carrying value of our investment and our obligation under the SDSRA, which we discuss in Note 5. 
 CFIN 
 As we discuss in Note 5, in July 2020, Sempra entered into a Support Agreement for the benefit of CFIN, which is a VIE. Sempra is not the primary beneficiary of this VIE because we do not have the power to direct the most significant activities of CFIN, including modification, prepayment, and refinance decisions related to the financing arrangement with external lenders and Cameron LNG JV s project owners as well as the ability to determine and enforce remedies in the event of default. The conditional obligations of the Support Agreement represent a variable interest that we measure at fair value on a recurring basis (see Note 8). Sempra s maximum exposure to loss under the terms of the Support Agreement is million. 
 ECA LNG Phase 1 
 ECA LNG Phase 1 is a VIE because its total equity at risk is not sufficient to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support. We expect that ECA LNG Phase 1 will require future capital contributions or other financial support to finance the construction of the facility. Sempra is the primary beneficiary of this VIE because we have the power to direct the activities related to the construction and future operation and maintenance of the liquefaction facility. As a result, we consolidate ECA LNG Phase 1. Sempra consolidated million and million of assets at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, consisting primarily of PP E, net, attributable to ECA LNG Phase 1 that could be used only to settle obligations of this VIE and that are not available to settle obligations of Sempra, and million and million of liabilities at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, consisting primarily of long-term debt attributable to ECA LNG Phase 1 for which creditors do not have recourse to the general credit of Sempra. Additionally, as we discuss in Note 6, IEnova and TotalEnergies SE have provided guarantees for and , respectively, of the loan facility supporting construction of the liquefaction facility.

 Cash Flows 

The implementation of customer assistance programs and higher 2023 winter season customer billings have resulted in certain SDG E and SoCalGas customers exhibiting slower payment and higher levels of nonpayment than has been the case historically. In January 2024, the CPUC directed SDG E and SoCalGas to offer long-term repayment plans to eligible residential customers with past-due balances. 
 SDG E and SoCalGas have regulatory mechanisms to recover credit losses and thus record changes in the allowances for credit losses related to Accounts Receivable Trade that are probable of recovery in regulatory accounts. We discuss regulatory accounts in Note 4 below and in Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report.

 As we discuss below in Note Receivable, we have an interest-bearing promissory note due from KKR Pinnacle. On a quarterly basis, we evaluate credit losses and record allowances for expected credit losses on this note receivable, including compounded interest and unamortized transaction costs, based on published default rate studies, the maturity date of the instrument and an internally developed credit rating. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, million and million, respectively, of expected credit losses are included in Other Long-Term Assets on Sempra s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 As we discuss in Note 5, Sempra provided a guarantee for the benefit of Cameron LNG JV related to amounts withdrawn by Sempra Infrastructure from the SDSRA. On a quarterly basis, we evaluate credit losses and record liabilities for expected credit losses on this off-balance sheet arrangement based on external credit ratings, published default rate studies and the maturity date of the arrangement. At both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, million of expected credit losses are included in Deferred Credits and Other on Sempra s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

 pipeline segments, the Sasabe-Puerto Libertad-Guaymas segment and the Guaymas-El Oro segment. Each segment has its own service agreement with the CFE. Following the start of commercial operations of the Guaymas-El Oro segment, Sempra Infrastructure reported damage to the pipeline in the Yaqui territory that has made that section inoperable since August 2017. Sempra Infrastructure and the CFE have agreed to an amendment to their transportation services agreement and to re-route the portion of the pipeline that is in the Yaqui territory, whereby the CFE would pay for the re-routing with a new tariff. This amendment will terminate if certain conditions are not met, and Sempra Infrastructure retains the right to terminate the transportation services agreement and seek to recover its reasonable and documented costs and lost profit. Sempra Infrastructure continues to acquire and pursue the necessary rights-of-way and permits for the re-routed portion of the pipeline. At September 30, 2024, Sempra Infrastructure had million in PP E, net, related to the Guaymas-El Oro segment of the Sonora pipeline, which could be subject to impairment if Sempra Infrastructure is unable to re-route a portion of the pipeline and resume operations or if Sempra Infrastructure terminates the contract and is unable to obtain recovery.

 CPUC GRC 
 The CPUC uses GRCs to set revenues to allow SDG E and SoCalGas to recover their reasonable operating costs and to provide the opportunity to realize their authorized rates of return on their investments. 
 On October 18, 2024, the CPUC issued a proposed decision in the 2024 GRC for SDG E s and SoCalGas test year revenue requirements for 2024 and attrition year adjustments for 2025 through 2027.

 million for SDG E s combined operations million for its electric operations and million for its natural gas operations), which is million lower than the million that SDG E had requested in its updated application. The proposed 2024 combined revenue requirement, if adopted, represents an increase of million compared to its authorized 2023 combined revenue requirement. The proposed post-test year revenue requirement, if adopted, would be annual increases of approximately for 2025-2027 at SDG E. 
 The 2024 GRC proposed decision adopts a 2024 test year revenue requirement of million for SoCalGas, which is million lower than the million that SoCalGas had requested in its May 2022 application. The proposed 2024 revenue requirement, if adopted, represents an increase of million over its authorized 2023 revenue requirement. The proposed post-test year revenue requirement, if adopted, would be annual increases of approximately for 2025-2027 at SoCalGas. 
 Because a final decision for the 2024 GRC was not issued by September 30, 2024, SDG E and SoCalGas recorded CPUC-authorized base revenues in the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024 based on 2023 levels authorized under the 2019 GRC. The impact of the final decision, retroactive to January 1, 2024, as authorized by the CPUC, will be reflected in SDG E s and SoCalGas financial statements in the period in which the final decision is issued. We expect the CPUC to issue a final decision by the end of this year. 
 2024 GRC Track 2 
 In October 2023, SDG E submitted a separate request to the CPUC in its 2024 GRC, known as a Track 2 request. This request seeks review and recovery of billion of wildfire mitigation plan costs incurred from 2019 through 2022 that were in addition to amounts authorized in the 2019 GRC. SDG E expects to receive a proposed reasonableness review decision for its Track 2 request in the first half of 2025. 
 Revenues associated with the Track 2 request amounts described above have been recorded in a regulatory account. In February 2024, the CPUC approved an interim cost recovery mechanism that would permit SDG E to recover in rates million and million of this regulatory account balance in 2024 and 2025, respectively. Such recovery of SDG E s wildfire mitigation plan regulatory account balance will be subject to refund, contingent on the reasonableness review decision for its Track 2 request. 
 2024 GRC Track 3 
 SDG E expects to submit in the first half of 2025 an additional request to the CPUC in its 2024 GRC, known as a Track 3 request, for review and recovery of its 2023 wildfire mitigation plan costs. 
 CPUC COST OF CAPITAL 
 The CPUC approved the following cost of capital for SDG E and SoCalGas that became effective on January 1, 2023 and was to remain in effect through December 31, 2025, subject to the CCM.

 Long-Term Debt Preferred Equity Common Equity 
 In October 2023, the CPUC issued a ruling to initiate a second phase of the 2023-2025 cost of capital proceeding to evaluate potential modifications to the CCM. In October 2024, the CPUC issued a final decision to modify the CCM. The final decision reduces the upward or downward adjustment to authorized ROE, if the CCM is triggered, to of the change in the benchmark rate during the measurement period from the current . The final decision adopts this change effective January 1, 2025, reducing both SDG E s and SoCalGas ROE by bps to and , respectively, and allowing SDG E and SoCalGas to update their respective costs of preferred equity and debt for 2025. SDG E and SoCalGas intend to file advice letters in November 2024 to address the implementation, subject to approval, of the updated cost of capital. 
 FERC RATE MATTERS 
 SDG E files separately with the FERC for its authorized transmission revenue requirement and ROE on FERC-regulated electric transmission operations and assets. SDG E s currently effective TO5 settlement provides for an ROE of , consisting of a base ROE of plus an additional bps for participation in the California ISO (the California ISO adder). In May 2024, the CPUC and other parties filed a petition and complaint with the FERC seeking an order that directs SDG E to remove the California ISO adder from its currently effective TO5 settlement and refund the California ISO adder retroactively from June 1, 2019. In June 2024, SDG E exercised its right to terminate the TO5 settlement. Accordingly, in October 2024, SDG E submitted its TO6 filing to the FERC to be effective January 1, 2025, subject to refund. SDG E s TO6 filing proposes, among other items, an increase to SDG E s currently authorized base ROE from to and continuation of the California ISO adder. SDG E expects further proceedings on these two matters.

 Sempra Promissory Note for SDSRA Distribution 
 Cameron LNG JV s debt agreements require Cameron LNG JV to maintain the SDSRA, which is an additional reserve account beyond the Senior Debt Service Accrual Account, where funds accumulate from operations to satisfy senior debt obligations due and payable on the next payment date. Both accounts can be funded with cash or authorized investments. In June 2021, Sempra Infrastructure received a distribution of million based on its proportionate share of the SDSRA, for which Sempra provided a promissory note and letters of credit to secure a proportionate share of Cameron LNG JV s obligation to fund the SDSRA. Sempra s maximum exposure to loss is replenishment of the amount withdrawn by Sempra Infrastructure from the SDSRA, or million. We recorded a guarantee liability of million in June 2021, with an associated carrying value of million at September 30, 2024, for the fair value of the promissory note, which is being reduced over the duration of the guarantee through Sempra Infrastructure s investment in Cameron LNG JV. The guarantee will terminate upon full repayment of Cameron LNG JV s debt, scheduled to occur in 2039, or replenishment of the amount withdrawn by Sempra Infrastructure from the SDSRA. 
 Sempra Support Agreement for CFIN 
 In July 2020, CFIN entered into a financing arrangement with Cameron LNG JV s project owners and received aggregate proceeds of billion from project owners and from external lenders on behalf of the other project owners (collectively, the affiliate loans), based on their proportionate ownership interest in Cameron LNG JV. CFIN used the proceeds from the affiliate loans to provide a loan to Cameron LNG JV. The affiliate loans mature in 2039. Principal and interest are paid from Cameron LNG JV s project cash flows from its three-train natural gas liquefaction facility. Cameron LNG JV used the proceeds from its loan to return equity to its project owners. 
 Sempra Infrastructure s million proportionate share of the affiliate loans, based on SI Partners ownership interest in Cameron LNG JV, was funded by external lenders comprised of a syndicate of banks (the bank debt) to whom Sempra has provided a guarantee pursuant to a Support Agreement under which: 
 Sempra has severally guaranteed repayment of the bank debt plus accrued and unpaid interest if CFIN fails to pay the external lenders; 
 the external lenders may exercise an option to put the bank debt to Sempra Infrastructure upon the occurrence of certain events, including a failure by CFIN to meet its payment obligations under the bank debt; 
 the external lenders will put some or all of the bank debt to Sempra Infrastructure on the fifth, tenth, or fifteenth anniversary date of the affiliate loans, except the portion of the debt owed to any external lender that has elected not to participate in the put option six months prior to the respective anniversary date;

 The impact associated with discounting is not significant. Because these auction prices are a less observable input, these instruments are classified as Level 3. The fair value of these instruments is derived from auction price differences between two locations. Positive values between two locations represent expected future reductions in congestion costs, whereas negative values between two locations represent expected future charges. Valuation of our CRRs is sensitive to a change in auction price. If auction prices at one location increase (decrease) relative to another location, this could result in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement. We summarize CRR volumes in Note 7.

 COMMON STOCK SPLIT IN THE FORM OF A STOCK DIVIDEND 
 On August 2, 2023, Sempra s board of directors declared a -for-one split of Sempra s common stock in the form of a stock dividend for shareholders of record at the close of business on August 14, 2023. Each such shareholder of record received one additional share of Sempra common stock for every then-held share of Sempra common stock, which was distributed after the close of trading on August 21, 2023. Sempra s common stock began trading on a post-split basis effective August 22, 2023. Sempra s common stock continues to have no par value with authorized shares. 
 Except as expressly noted, all share and per share information related to issued and outstanding common stock and outstanding equity awards with respect to common stock has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split and is presented on a post-split basis herein. 
 COMMON STOCK OFFERINGS 
 ATM Program 
 On November 6, 2024, we established an ATM program, providing for the offer and sale of shares of Sempra common stock having an aggregate gross sales price of up to billion through agents acting as our sales agents or as forward sellers or directly to the agents as principals. The shares may be offered and sold in amounts and at times to be determined by us from time to time. The agents will be entitled to a commission that will not exceed of the gross sales price of all shares sold through it as agent pursuant to the sales agreement. 
 Under the ATM program, we may enter into separate forward sale agreements with affiliates of the agents as forward purchasers. We expect to fully physically settle each forward sale agreement, if any. However, we will generally have the right, subject to certain exceptions, to elect to cash settle or net share settle all or any portion of our obligations under any such forward sale agreement. If we enter into a forward sale agreement with any forward purchaser, we expect that such forward purchaser (or its affiliate) will attempt to borrow from third parties and sell, through the relevant agent acting, as sales agent for such forward purchaser, shares of our common stock to hedge such forward purchaser s exposure under such forward sale agreement. We will not receive any proceeds from any sale of shares borrowed by a forward purchaser (or its affiliate) and sold through a forward seller. The forward seller will receive a commission, in the form of a reduction to the initial forward price under the related forward sale agreement, at a mutually agreed rate that will not exceed (subject to certain exceptions) of the volume-weighted average of the gross sales price per share of all of the borrowed shares of Sempra common stock sold through such forward seller. 
 We intend to use a substantial portion of the net proceeds we receive from the issuance and sale by us of any shares of our common stock to or through the agents and any net proceeds we receive through the settlement of any forward sale agreements with the forward purchasers for working capital and other general corporate purposes, including to partly finance anticipated increases to our long-term capital plan and to repay outstanding commercial paper and potentially other indebtedness. 
 November 2023 Forward Sale Agreements 
 In November 2023, we completed the offering of shares of our common stock, par value, in a registered public offering at per share per share after deducting underwriting discounts), shares of which were pursuant to forward sale agreements. We discuss the common stock offering in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report.

 shares of Sempra common stock from our November 2023 offering remain subject to future settlement under these forward sale agreements, which may be settled on one or more dates specified by us occurring no later than December 31, 2024, which is the final settlement date under the agreements. Although we expect to settle the forward sale agreements entirely by the physical delivery of shares of our common stock in exchange for cash proceeds, we may, subject to certain conditions, elect cash settlement or net share settlement for all or a portion of our obligations under the forward sale agreements. The forward sale agreements are also subject to acceleration by the counterparties to the agreements upon the occurrence of certain events. 
 COMMON STOCK REPURCHASES 
 In the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we withheld shares for million and shares for million, respectively, of our common stock that would otherwise be issued to long-term incentive plan participants who do not elect otherwise upon the vesting of RSUs and exercise of stock options in an amount sufficient to satisfy minimum statutory tax withholding requirements. Such share withholding is considered a share repurchase for accounting purposes.

 Contributions from NCI. In the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2023, KKR Pinnacle used million and million, respectively, of a credit from Sempra pursuant to the SI Partners limited partnership agreement, to fund its share of contributions to SI Partners. As a result, we recorded a million increase in equity held by NCI and a decrease in Sempra s shareholders equity of million, net of a tax benefit. 
 SI Partners Subsidiaries 
 Sale of NCI to KKR Denali. In September 2023, an indirect subsidiary of SI Partners completed the sale of a interest in an SI Partners subsidiary (resulting in an indirect NCI in the PA LNG Phase 1 project) to KKR Denali for aggregate cash consideration of million, before post-closing adjustments recorded subsequently. As a result of this sale, we recorded a billion increase in equity held by NCI and a decrease in Sempra s shareholders equity of million, including million in transaction costs and net of a million tax benefit. 
 The indirect subsidiary of SI Partners and KKR Denali have made capital contribution commitments to fund their respective equity share of the equity funding amount of anticipated development costs of the PA LNG Phase 1 project, except in certain budget overrun scenarios. 
 Sale of NCI to ConocoPhillips Affiliate. In March 2023, an indirect subsidiary of SI Partners completed the sale of an indirect interest in an SI Partners subsidiary (resulting in an indirect NCI in the PA LNG Phase 1 project) to an affiliate of ConocoPhillips for aggregate cash consideration of million. As a result of this sale, we recorded a million increase in equity held by NCI and an increase in Sempra s shareholders equity of million, net of million in transaction costs and million in tax expense.

These fully vested RSUs are included in weighted-average common shares outstanding for basic EPS because there are no conditions under which the corresponding shares will not be issued. 

The computation of diluted EPS for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024 excludes and potentially dilutive shares, respectively, and the computation of diluted EPS for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2023 excludes and potentially dilutive shares, respectively, because to include them would be antidilutive for the period. However, these shares could potentially dilute basic EPS in the future. 
 The potentially dilutive impact from the forward sale of our common stock pursuant to the forward sale agreements that we discuss above is reflected in our diluted EPS calculation using the treasury stock method. We anticipate there will be a dilutive effect on our EPS when the average market price of our common stock shares is above the applicable adjusted forward sale price, subject to increase or decrease based on the overnight bank funding rate, less a spread, and subject to decrease by amounts related to expected dividends on shares of our common stock during the term of the forward sale agreements. Additionally, if we decide to physically settle or net share settle the forward sale agreements, delivery of our shares to the forward purchasers on any such physical settlement or net share settlement of the forward sale agreements would result in dilution to our EPS.

 NUCLEAR DECOMMISSIONING AND FUNDING 
 As a result of Edison s decision to permanently retire SONGS Units 2 and 3, Edison began the decommissioning phase of the plant. Major decommissioning work began in 2020. We expect the majority of the decommissioning work to be completed around 2030. Decommissioning of Unit 1, removed from service in 1992, is largely complete. The remaining work for Unit 1 will be completed once Units 2 and 3 are dismantled and the spent fuel is removed from the site. The spent fuel is currently being stored on-site, until the DOE identifies a spent fuel storage facility and puts in place a program for the fuel s disposal. SDG E is responsible for approximately of the total decommissioning cost. 
 In accordance with state and federal requirements and regulations, SDG E has assets held in the NDT to fund its share of decommissioning costs for SONGS Units 1, 2 and 3. Amounts that were collected in rates for SONGS decommissioning are invested in the NDT, which is comprised of externally managed trust funds. Amounts held by the NDT are invested in accordance with CPUC regulations. SDG E classifies debt and equity securities held in the NDT as available-for-sale. The NDT assets are presented on the Sempra and SDG E Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value with the offsetting credits recorded in noncurrent Regulatory Liabilities. 
 Except for the use of funds for the planning of decommissioning activities or NDT administrative costs, CPUC approval is required for SDG E to access the NDT assets to fund SONGS decommissioning costs for Units 2 and 3. In December 2023, the CPUC granted SDG E authorization to access NDT funds of up to million for forecasted 2024 costs.

 million in coverage limits, the maximum amount available, including coverage for acts of terrorism. In addition, the Price-Anderson Act provides an additional million of coverage. If a nuclear liability loss occurs at SONGS and exceeds the million insurance limit, this additional coverage would be available to provide a total of million in coverage limits per incident. 
 The SONGS owners have nuclear property damage insurance of million, which exceeds the minimum federal requirement of million. This insurance coverage is provided through NEIL. The NEIL policies have specific exclusions and limitations that can result in reduced coverage. Insured members as a group are subject to retrospective premium assessments to cover losses sustained by NEIL under all issued policies. SDG E could be assessed a negligible amount for retrospective premiums based on overall member claims. 
 The nuclear property insurance program includes an industry aggregate loss limit for non-certified acts of terrorism (as defined by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act) of billion. This is the maximum amount that will be paid to insured members who suffer losses or damages from these non-certified terrorist acts. 

NOTE 11. 
 At September 30, 2024, loss contingency accruals for legal matters that are probable and estimable were million for Sempra, negligible for SDG E and million for SoCalGas. 
 
 lawsuits were filed in the California Superior Court challenging various aspects of the natural gas and electric franchise agreements granted by the City of San Diego to SDG E. Both lawsuits ultimately sought to void the franchise agreements. In one of the cases, judgment was granted in favor of SDG E and the City of San Diego, and the plaintiff in that case has appealed. We expect a ruling on the appeal in the first quarter of 2025. In the second case, the court ruled in favor of SDG E and the City of San Diego, upholding all terms of the franchise agreements, except for the two-thirds City Council vote requirement for termination if the City decides to terminate under certain circumstances. Under the court s ruling, the City can instead terminate on a majority vote, so long as it satisfies repayment provisions under the franchise agreements. Both sides have appealed the ruling. 
 SoCalGas 
 Aliso Canyon Natural Gas Storage Facility Gas Leak 
 From October 23, 2015 through February 11, 2016, SoCalGas experienced a natural gas leak from of the injection-and-withdrawal wells, SS25, at its Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility in Los Angeles County. 
 In September 2021, SoCalGas and Sempra entered into an agreement with counsel to resolve approximately lawsuits including approximately plaintiffs (the Individual Plaintiffs) then pending against SoCalGas and Sempra related to the Leak for a payment of up to billion. Over of the Individual Plaintiffs participated and submitted valid releases, and SoCalGas paid billion in 2022 under the agreement. The Individual Plaintiffs who did not participate in the settlement (the Non-Settling Individual Plaintiffs) are able to continue to pursue their claims. As of November 1, 2024, there are approximately plaintiffs, who are either new plaintiffs or Non-Settling Individual Plaintiffs.

 million is accrued in Other Current Liabilities and million is accrued in Deferred Credits and Other on SoCalGas and Sempra s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. These accruals do not include any amounts in excess of what has been reasonably estimated to resolve certain matters that we describe above, nor any amounts that may be necessary to resolve threatened litigation, other potential litigation or other costs. We are not able to reasonably estimate the possible loss or a range of possible losses in excess of the amounts accrued, which could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on SoCalGas and Sempra s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. 
 Aliso Canyon Natural Gas Storage Facility Regulatory Proceeding 
 In February 2017, the CPUC opened proceeding SB 380 OII to determine the feasibility of minimizing or eliminating the use of the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility while still maintaining energy and electric reliability for the region, but excluding issues with respect to air quality, public health, causation, culpability or cost responsibility regarding the Leak. The first phase of the proceeding established a framework for the hydraulic, production cost and economic modeling assumptions for the potential reduction in usage or elimination of the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility, as well as evaluating the impacts of reducing or eliminating the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility using the established framework and models. The next phase of the proceeding included engaging a consultant to analyze alternative means for meeting or avoiding the demand for the facility s services if it were eliminated in either the 2027 or 2035 timeframe, and to address potential implementation of alternatives to the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility if the CPUC determines that the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility should be permanently closed. The CPUC also added all California IOUs as parties to the proceeding and encouraged all load serving entities in the Los Angeles Basin to join the proceeding. We expect a final decision by the end of this year. 
 In August 2023, the CPUC issued a decision on the interim range of gas inventory levels at the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility, setting an interim range of gas inventory levels of up to Bcf. The CPUC may issue future changes to this interim range of authorized gas inventory levels before issuing a final decision within the SB 380 OII proceeding. 
 At September 30, 2024, the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility had a net book value of billion. If the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility were to be permanently closed or if future cash flows from its operation were otherwise insufficient to recover its carrying value, we may record an impairment of the facility, which could be material, and natural gas reliability and electric generation could be jeopardized.

related claimants filed separate challenges in the federal district court in Ensenada, Baja California seeking revocation of the environmental and social impact permits issued by each of ASEA and SENER to ECA LNG authorizing natural gas liquefaction activities at the ECA Regas Facility, as follows: 
 In the first case, the court issued a provisional injunction against the permits in September 2018. In December 2018, ASEA approved modifications to the environmental permit that facilitate the development of the proposed natural gas liquefaction facility in two phases. In May 2019, the court canceled the provisional injunction. The claimant appealed the court s decision to cancel the injunction but was not successful. The lower court s ruling was favorable to the ECA Regas Facility, as the court determined that no harm has been caused to the plaintiff and dismissed the lawsuit. The claimant appealed and the appellate court s ruling is pending. 
 In the second case, the initial request for a provisional injunction against the permits was denied. That decision was reversed on appeal in January 2020, resulting in the issuance of a new injunction against the permits that were issued by ASEA and SENER. This injunction has uncertain application absent clarification by the court. The claimants petitioned the court to rule that construction of natural gas liquefaction facilities violated the injunction and, in February 2022, the court ruled in favor of the ECA Regas Facility, holding that the natural gas liquefaction construction activities did not violate the injunction. The claimants appealed this ruling but were not successful. The lower court s ruling was favorable to the ECA Regas Facility, as the court determined that no harm has been caused to the plaintiffs and dismissed the lawsuit. The claimants appealed and the appellate court s ruling is pending. 
 In the third case, a group of residents filed a complaint in June 2021 against various federal and state authorities alleging deficiencies in the public consultation process for the issuance of the permits. The request for an initial injunction was denied. The claimants appealed this ruling but were not successful. The lower court s ruling was favorable to the ECA Regas Facility, as the court determined that no harm has been caused to the plaintiffs and dismissed the lawsuit. The claimants appealed and the appellate court s ruling is pending. 
 Port Arthur LNG 
 The PA LNG Phase 1 project holds two Clean Air Act, Prevention of Significant Deterioration permits issued by the TCEQ, which we refer to as the 2016 Permit and the 2022 Permit. The 2022 Permit also governs emissions for the proposed PA LNG Phase 2 project. In November 2023, a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit issued a decision to vacate and remand the 2022 Permit to the TCEQ for additional explanation of the agency s permit decision. In February 2024, the court withdrew its opinion and referred the case to the Supreme Court of Texas to resolve the question of the appropriate standard to be applied by the TCEQ. The 2022 Permit is effective during the Texas Supreme Court s review. The 2016 Permit was not the subject of, and is unaffected by, the pending litigation of the 2022 Permit. Construction of the PA LNG Phase 1 project is proceeding uninterrupted under existing permits, and we do not currently anticipate the pending litigation to materially impact the PA LNG Phase 1 project cost, schedule or expected commercial operations at this stage.

 companies (the Liquidating Companies) that engaged in carbon credit trading via chains that included a company that traded directly with RBS Sempra Energy Europe, a subsidiary of RBS Sempra Commodities LLP. The claim alleged that the Defendants participation in the purchase and sale of carbon credits resulted in the Liquidating Companies carbon credit trading transactions creating a VAT liability they were unable to pay, and that the Defendants were liable to provide for equitable compensation due to dishonest assistance and compensation under the U.K. Insolvency Act of 1986. In January 2024, the parties settled the Liquidating Companies claim against the Defendants to fully resolve the matter; our share of such settlement was approximately million (approximately million in U.S. dollars at December 31, 2023). For the year ended December 31, 2023, we recorded million in equity earnings from our investment in RBS Sempra Commodities LLP to reduce our estimate of our obligations to settle these VAT matters and related legal costs based on the settlement reached with the Liquidating Companies in January 2024.

At September 30, 2024, we expect future payments to decrease by million in 2024, and increase by million in 2025, million in 2026, million in 2027, and million in 2028 compared to December 31, 2023. 
 Sempra Infrastructure s natural gas contracts and transportation commitments have increased by approximately million since December 31, 2023, primarily from entering into new natural gas contracts in the first nine months of 2024. We expect future payments to decrease by million in 2024, and increase by million in 2025, million in 2026, million in each of 2027 and 2028, and million thereafter (through expiration in 2059) compared to December 31, 2023. 
 LNG Purchase Agreement 
 Sempra Infrastructure has an SPA for the supply of LNG to the ECA Regas Facility. The commitment amount is calculated using a predetermined formula based on estimated forward prices of the index applicable from 2024 to 2029. Although this agreement specifies a number of cargoes to be delivered, under its terms, the supplier may divert certain cargoes, which would reduce amounts paid under the agreement by Sempra Infrastructure. At September 30, 2024, we expect the commitment amount to decrease by million in 2024, million in 2025, million in 2026, million in 2027, million in 2028 and million thereafter (through expiration in 2029) compared to December 31, 2023, reflecting changes in estimated forward prices since December 31, 2023 and actual transactions for the first nine months of 2024. These LNG commitment amounts are based on the assumption that all LNG cargoes under the agreement are delivered, less those already confirmed to be diverted as of September 30, 2024. Actual LNG purchases in the current and prior years have been significantly lower than the maximum amount provided under the agreement due to the supplier electing to divert cargoes as allowed by the agreement.

OVERVIEW 
 This combined MD A includes the operational and financial results of the following three Registrants: 
 Sempra is a California-based holding company with energy infrastructure investments in North America. Our businesses invest in, develop and operate energy infrastructure, and provide electric and gas services to customers. 
 SDG E is a regulated public utility that provides electric service to San Diego and southern Orange counties and natural gas service to San Diego County. 
 SoCalGas is a regulated public natural gas distribution utility, serving customers throughout most of Southern California and part of central California. 
 This combined MD A should be read in conjunction with the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes thereto in this report, and the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes thereto, Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors and Part II Item 7. MD A in the Annual Report. 
 In the fourth quarter of 2023, Sempra realigned its reportable segments to reflect changes in how the CODM oversees our three platforms: Sempra California, Sempra Texas Utilities and Sempra Infrastructure. Our former SDG E and SoCalGas reportable segments were combined into one operating and reportable segment, Sempra California, which is consistent with how the CODM assesses performance due to the similarities of their operations, including geographic location and regulatory framework in California. 
 Sempra s historical segment disclosures have been restated to conform with the current presentation, so that all discussions reflect the revised segment information of its three reportable segments: 
 Sempra California 
 Sempra Texas Utilities 
 Sempra Infrastructure 
 SDG E and SoCalGas each has one reportable segment. 
 
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS BY REGISTRANT 
 Throughout the MD A, our references to earnings represent earnings attributable to common shares. Variance amounts presented are the after-tax earnings impact (based on applicable statutory tax rates unless otherwise noted) and after NCI but before foreign currency and inflation effects, where applicable. 

We discuss herein Sempra s results of operations and significant changes in earnings (losses), revenues and costs by segment, as well as Parent and other, for the three months (Q3) and nine months (YTD) ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023. We also discuss herein the impact of foreign currency and inflation rates on Sempra s results of operations. 
 Sempra California recorded CPUC-authorized base revenues in the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024 based on 2023 levels authorized under the 2019 GRC because a final decision in the 2024 GRC remains pending.

Sempra California 
 Sempra California s earnings are comprised of SDG E and SoCalGas. Because changes in SDG E s and SoCalGas cost of natural gas and/or electricity are recovered in rates, changes in these costs are offset in the changes in revenues and therefore do not impact earnings, other than potential impacts related to the GCIM for SoCalGas that we describe below. In addition to the changes in cost or market prices, natural gas or electric revenues recorded during a period are impacted by the difference between customer billings and recorded or CPUC-authorized amounts. These differences are required to be balanced over time, resulting in over- and undercollected regulatory balancing accounts. We discuss balancing accounts and their effects further in Note 4 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this report and in Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report. 
 In the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, the decrease in earnings of 43 million (15 to 247 million was primarily due to: 
 38 million lower income tax benefits primarily from flow-through items and the resolution of prior year income tax items 
 19 million higher net interest expense 
 Offset by: 
 5 million higher CPUC base operating margin, net of operating expenses, including higher authorized cost of capital. Sempra California recorded CPUC-authorized revenues based on 2023 authorized levels 
 4 million higher AFUDC equity 
 4 million higher net regulatory interest income

 SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN REVENUES AND COSTS 
 The regulatory framework permits SDG E and SoCalGas to recover certain program expenditures and other costs authorized by the CPUC (referred to as refundable programs ). 
 Utilities: Natural Gas Revenues and Cost of Natural Gas 
 Our utilities revenues include natural gas revenues at Sempra California and Sempra Infrastructure, which includes Ecogas. Intercompany revenues are eliminated in Sempra s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 SoCalGas and SDG E operate under a regulatory framework that permits the cost of natural gas purchased for customers (residential and small commercial and industrial customers, also referred to as core customers for SoCalGas) to be passed through to customers in rates substantially as incurred and without markup. The GCIM provides for SoCalGas to share in the savings and/or costs from buying natural gas for its core customers at prices below or above monthly market-based benchmarks. This mechanism permits full recovery of costs incurred when average purchase costs are within a price range around the benchmark price. Any higher costs incurred or savings realized outside this range are shared between SoCalGas and its core customers. We provide further discussion in Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report.

However, we do not record income taxes for a portion of this income or loss, as some of our entities with NCI are currently treated as partnerships for U.S. income tax purposes, and thus we are only liable for income taxes on the portion of the earnings that are allocated to us. Our pretax income, however, includes 100 of these entities. If our entities with NCI grow, and if we continue to invest in such entities, the impact on our ETR may become more significant.

 In April 2023, the IRS issued Revenue Procedure 2023-15, which provides a safe harbor method of accounting for gas repairs expenditures. Sempra elected this change in tax accounting method in its consolidated 2023 income tax return filing and has applied this methodology in the calculation of its 2024 forecasted ETR. 
 Sempra records regulatory liabilities for benefits that will be flowed through to customers in the future. 
 In the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, Sempra s income tax benefit increased by 53 million primarily due to: 
 34 million higher income tax benefit from the resolution of prior year income tax items 
 30 million income tax benefit in 2024 from an outside basis difference in a domestic partnership investment 
 29 million from 78 million income tax benefit in 2024 compared to 49 million income tax benefit in 2023 from foreign currency and inflation effects on our monetary positions in Mexico 
 Offset by: 
 lower income tax benefit in 2024 from lower ITCs from standalone energy storage projects under the IRA 
 23 million income tax benefit in 2023 from the remeasurement of certain deferred income taxes 
 In the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, Sempra had an income tax benefit in 2024 compared to income tax expense in 2023 primarily due to: 
 414 million from 211 million income tax benefit in 2024 compared to 203 million income tax expense in 2023 from foreign currency and inflation effects on our monetary positions in Mexico 
 lower pretax income 
 higher income tax benefits from flow-through items, including an income tax benefit in 2024 from adopting a change in tax accounting method for gas repairs expenditures 
 34 million higher income tax benefit from the resolution of prior year income tax items 
 30 million income tax benefit in 2024 from an outside basis difference in a domestic partnership investment 
 Offset by: 
 lower income tax benefit in 2024 from lower ITCs from standalone energy storage projects under the IRA 
 43 million income tax benefit in 2023 from the recognition of previously unrecognized income tax benefits pertaining to gas repairs expenditures 
 23 million income tax benefit in 2023 from the remeasurement of certain deferred income taxes 
 We discuss the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and inflation on income taxes below in Impact of Foreign Currency and Inflation Rates on Results of Operations. See Note 1 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this report and Notes 1 and 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report for further details about our accounting for income taxes and items subject to flow-through treatment. 
 
 Equity Earnings 
 In the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, Sempra s equity earnings decreased by 25 million (5 to 454 million primarily due to:

IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY AND INFLATION RATES ON RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 Because our natural gas distribution utility in Mexico, Ecogas, uses its local currency as its functional currency, revenues and expenses are translated into U.S. dollars at average exchange rates for the period for consolidation in Sempra s results of operations. We discuss further the impact of foreign currency and inflation rates on results of operations, including impacts on income taxes and related hedging activity, in Part II Item 7. MD A Impact of Foreign Currency and Inflation Rates on Results of Operations in the Annual Report. 
 Foreign Currency Translation 
 Any difference in average exchange rates used for the translation of income statement activity from year to year can cause a variance in Sempra s comparative results of operations. In the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023, the change in our earnings as a result of foreign currency translation rates was negligible.

CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY 
 OVERVIEW 
 Sempra 
 Liquidity 
 We expect to meet our cash requirements through cash flows from operations, unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, borrowings under or supported by our credit facilities, other incurrences of debt which may include issuing debt securities and obtaining term loans, issuing equity securities under our ATM program or otherwise, and other financing transactions which may include distributions from our equity method investments, project financing and funding from NCI owners. We believe that these cash flow sources, combined with available funds, will be adequate to fund our operations in both the short-term and long-term, including to: 
 finance capital expenditures 
 repay debt 
 fund dividends 
 fund contractual and other obligations and otherwise meet liquidity requirements 
 fund capital contribution requirements 
 fund new business or asset acquisitions 
 Sempra, SDG E and SoCalGas currently have reasonable access to the money markets and capital markets and are not currently constrained in their ability to borrow or otherwise raise money at market rates from commercial banks, under existing revolving credit facilities, through public offerings of debt or equity securities (including under our ATM program or otherwise), or through private placements of debt supported by our revolving credit facilities in the case of commercial paper. However, our ability to access these markets or obtain credit from commercial banks outside of our committed revolving credit facilities could become materially constrained if economic conditions worsen or disruptions to or volatility in these markets increase. In addition, our financing activities, actions by credit rating agencies and prevailing interest rates, as well as many other factors, could negatively affect the availability and cost of both short-term and long-term debt and equity financing. Also, cash flows from operations may be impacted by the timing of regulatory proceedings, commencement and completion of, and potential cost overruns for, large projects and other material events. If cash flows from operations were to be significantly reduced or we were unable to borrow or obtain other financing under acceptable terms, we would likely first reduce or postpone discretionary capital expenditures (not related to safety/reliability) and investments in new businesses. We monitor our ability to finance the needs of our operating, investing and financing activities in a manner consistent with our goal to maintain our investment-grade credit ratings. 
 Common Stock Offering and Forward Sale Agreements 
 As we discuss in Note 9 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this report and Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report, our offering of Sempra common stock completed in November 2023 provided initial net proceeds of 144 million upon the underwriters partial exercise of their over-allotment option to purchase additional shares of our common stock. We did not initially receive any proceeds from the sale of our common stock pursuant to the forward sale agreements entered into in connection with the offering. The forward sale agreements permit us to elect, subject to certain conditions, physical settlement, cash settlement or net share settlement for all or a portion of our obligations under the agreements. We expect to settle the forward sale agreements entirely by delivery of shares of our common stock under physical settlement in exchange for cash proceeds in one or more settlements no later than December 31, 2024, which is the final settlement date under the agreements. As of November 6, 2024, at the initial forward sale price of 68.845 per share, we expect that the net proceeds from full physical settlement of the forward sale agreements would be approximately 1.2 billion (net of underwriting discounts, but before deducting equity issuance costs, and subject to certain adjustments pursuant to the forward sale agreements). If we were to elect cash settlement or net share settlement instead of physical settlement, the amount of cash proceeds we receive upon settlement would be less, perhaps substantially, or we may not receive any cash proceeds or we may deliver cash (in an amount that could be significant) or shares of our common stock to the counterparties to the forward sale agreements.

Table of Contents 

 We used the initial net proceeds from this offering, and we expect to use any net proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock pursuant to the forward sale agreements, to fund working capital and for other general corporate purposes, including to partly finance our long-term capital plan and to repay commercial paper and potentially other indebtedness. 
 
 Available Funds 
 Our committed lines of credit provide liquidity and support commercial paper. Sempra, SDG E and SoCalGas each has a committed line of credit expiring in 2029 and Sempra Infrastructure has four committed lines of credit expiring on various dates from 2025 through 2030, and an uncommitted line of credit expiring in 2026.

 (2) Available unused credit is the total available on committed and uncommitted lines of credit that we discuss in Note 6 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Because our commercial paper programs are supported by these lines, we reflect the amount of commercial paper outstanding and any letters of credit outstanding as a reduction to the available unused credit. 
 Short-Term Borrowings 
 We use short-term debt primarily to meet liquidity requirements, fund shareholder dividends, and temporarily finance capital expenditures or acquisitions. SDG E and SoCalGas use short-term debt primarily to meet working capital needs or to help fund event-specific costs. Commercial paper, a term loan and lines of credit were our primary sources of short-term debt funding in the first nine months of 2024. 
 We discuss our short-term debt activities in Note 6 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and below in Sources and Uses of Cash.

 Significant issuances of and payments on long-term debt in the first nine months of 2024 included the following: 
 LONG-TERM DEBT ISSUANCES AND PAYMENTS (Dollars in millions) Issuances: Amount at issuance Maturity Sempra 6.40 junior subordinated notes 1,250 2054 Sempra 6.875 junior subordinated notes 1,100 2054 SDG E 5.55 first mortgage bonds 600 2054 SoCalGas 5.05 first mortgage bonds 600 2034 SoCalGas 5.60 first mortgage bonds 500 2054 Sempra Infrastructure variable rate notes (ECA LNG Phase 1 project) 201 2025 Sempra Infrastructure variable rate notes (PA LNG Phase 1 project) 162 2030 Payments: Payments Maturity SDG E variable rate term loan 400 2024 SoCalGas 3.15 first mortgage bonds 500 2024 
 We discuss our long-term debt activities, including the use of proceeds on long-term debt issuances, in Note 6 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 Credit Ratings 
 We provide additional information about the credit ratings of Sempra, SDG E and SoCalGas in Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors and Part II Item 2. MD A Capital Resources and Liquidity in the Annual Report.

Table of Contents 

 The credit ratings of Sempra, SDG E and SoCalGas remained at investment grade levels in the first nine months of 2024. 
 ISSUER CREDIT RATINGS AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 
 Sempra SDG E SoCalGas Moody s Baa2 with a stable outlook A3 with a stable outlook A2 with a stable outlook S P BBB+ with a stable outlook BBB+ with a stable outlook A with a negative outlook Fitch BBB+ with a stable outlook BBB+ with a stable outlook A with a stable outlook 
 A downgrade of Sempra s or any of its subsidiaries credit ratings or rating outlooks may, depending on the severity, result in the imposition of financial or other burdensome covenants or a requirement for collateral to be posted in the case of certain financing arrangements and may materially and adversely affect the market prices of their equity and debt securities, the rates at which borrowings are made and commercial paper is issued, and the various fees on their outstanding credit facilities. This could make it more costly for Sempra, SDG E, SoCalGas and Sempra s other subsidiaries to issue debt securities, to borrow under credit facilities and to raise certain other types of financing. 
 Sempra has agreed that, if the credit rating of Oncor s senior secured debt by any of the three major rating agencies falls below BBB (or the equivalent), Oncor will suspend dividends and other distributions (except for contractual tax payments), unless otherwise allowed by the PUCT. Oncor s senior secured debt was rated A2, A+ and A at Moody s, S P and Fitch, respectively, at September 30, 2024. 
 
 Loans due to/from Affiliates 
 At September 30, 2024, Sempra had 347 million in loans due to unconsolidated affiliates. 
 Minimum Tax Directive 
 The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has introduced a framework to implement a global minimum corporate tax of 15 , referred to as the minimum tax directive. Many aspects of the minimum tax directive became effective beginning in 2024. While it is uncertain whether the U.S. will enact legislation to adopt the minimum tax directive, other countries are in the process of introducing and enacting legislation to implement the minimum tax directive. We do not currently expect the minimum tax directive to have a material effect on Sempra s, SDG E s or SoCalGas results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. 
 Market for Sempra s Common Stock 
 Sempra s common stock began trading on the Mexican Stock Exchange under the trading symbol SRE.MX in May 2021 following an exchange offer launched in the U.S. and Mexico to acquire the then publicly owned shares of IEnova for newly issued shares of our common stock. In August 2024, we submitted an application to cross-list our common stock on the International Trading System (SIC) of the Mexican Stock Exchange and delist our common stock from the general listing of the Mexican Stock Exchange, which application is currently under review by the CNBV. Following approval, our common stock will no longer be quoted or traded on the general listing of the Mexican Stock Exchange or subject to applicable reporting requirements, but will remain eligible for trading by Mexican investors on the SIC. 
 
 Sempra California 
 SDG E s and SoCalGas operations have historically provided relatively stable earnings and liquidity. Their future performance and liquidity will depend primarily on the ratemaking and regulatory process, environmental regulations, economic conditions, actions by legislatures, litigation and the changing energy marketplace, as well as other matters described in this report and the Annual Report. SDG E and SoCalGas expect that the available unused funds from their credit facilities described above, which also supports their commercial paper programs, cash flows from operations, and other incurrences of debt including issuing debt securities and obtaining term loans will continue to be adequate to fund their respective current operations and planned capital expenditures. SDG E and SoCalGas manage their capital structures and pay dividends when appropriate and as approved by their respective boards of directors. 
 The implementation of customer assistance programs and higher 2023 winter season customer billings have resulted in certain SDG E and SoCalGas customers exhibiting slower payment and higher levels of nonpayment than has been the case historically. In January 2024, the CPUC directed SDG E and SoCalGas to offer long-term repayment plans to eligible residential customers with past-due balances until October 2026. Delay in payments by customers impacts the timing of SDG E s and SoCalGas cash flows.

Table of Contents 

 As we discuss in Note 4 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this report and in Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report, changes in regulatory balancing accounts for significant costs at SDG E and SoCalGas, particularly a change between over- and undercollected status, may have a significant impact on cash flows. These changes generally represent the difference between when costs are incurred and when they are ultimately recovered or refunded in rates through billings to customers. 
 CPUC GRC 
 On October 18, 2024, the CPUC issued a proposed decision in the 2024 GRC for SDG E s and SoCalGas test year revenue requirements for 2024 and attrition year adjustments for 2025 through 2027. We discuss certain details of the proposed decision in Note 4 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The CPUC has authorized SDG E and SoCalGas to recognize the effects of the 2024 GRC final decision retroactive to January 1, 2024. We expect the CPUC to issue a final decision by the end of this year. 
 CCM 
 In October 2024, the CPUC issued a final decision to modify the CCM. The final decision reduces the upward or downward adjustment to authorized ROE, if the CCM is triggered, to 20 of the change in the benchmark rate during the measurement period from the current 50 . The final decision adopts this change effective January 1, 2025, reducing both SDG E s and SoCalGas ROE by 42 bps to 10.23 and 10.08 , respectively, and allowing SDG E and SoCalGas to update their respective costs of preferred equity and debt for 2025. SDG E and SoCalGas intend to file advice letters in November 2024 to address the implementation, subject to approval, of the updated cost of capital. 
 
 SDG E 
 Wildfire Fund 
 The carrying value of SDG E s Wildfire Fund asset totaled 282 million at September 30, 2024. We describe the Wildfire Legislation and SDG E s commitment to make annual shareholder contributions to the Wildfire Fund through 2028 in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report. 
 SDG E is exposed to the risk that the participating California electric IOUs may incur third-party wildfire costs for which they will seek recovery from the Wildfire Fund with respect to wildfires that have occurred since enactment of the Wildfire Legislation in July 2019. In such a situation, SDG E may recognize a reduction of its Wildfire Fund asset and record accelerated amortization against earnings when available coverage is reduced due to recoverable claims from any of the participating IOUs, as was the case in 2023 after Pacific Gas and Electric Company indicated that it will seek reimbursement from the Wildfire Fund for losses associated with the Dixie Fire, which burned from July 2021 through October 2021 and was reported to be the largest single wildfire (measured by acres burned) in California history. If any California electric IOU s equipment is determined to be a cause of a fire, it could have a material adverse effect on SDG E s and Sempra s financial condition and results of operations up to the carrying value of our Wildfire Fund asset, with additional potential material exposure if SDG E s equipment is determined to be a cause of a fire. In addition, the Wildfire Fund could be completely exhausted due to fires in the other California electric IOUs service territories, by fires in SDG E s service territory or by a combination thereof. In the event that the Wildfire Fund is materially diminished, exhausted or terminated, SDG E will lose the protection afforded by the Wildfire Fund, and as a consequence, a fire in SDG E s service territory could have a material adverse effect on SDG E s and Sempra s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. 
 Wildfire Mitigation Cost Recovery Mechanism 
 2024 GRC Track 2. In October 2023, SDG E submitted a separate request to the CPUC in its 2024 GRC, known as a Track 2 request. This request seeks review and recovery of 1.5 billion of wildfire mitigation plan costs incurred from 2019 through 2022 that were in addition to amounts authorized in the 2019 GRC. SDG E expects to receive a proposed reasonableness review decision for its Track 2 request in the first half of 2025. 
 Revenues associated with the Track 2 request amounts described above have been recorded in a regulatory account. In February 2024, the CPUC approved an interim cost recovery mechanism that would permit SDG E to recover in rates 194 million and 96 million of this regulatory account balance in 2024 and 2025, respectively. Such recovery of SDG E s wildfire mitigation plan regulatory account balance will be subject to refund, contingent on the reasonableness review decision for its Track 2 request. 
 104 

Table of Contents 

 2024 GRC Track 3. SDG E expects to submit in the first half of 2025 an additional request to the CPUC in its 2024 GRC, known as a Track 3 request, for review and recovery of its 2023 wildfire mitigation plan costs. 
 FERC Rate Matters 
 In June 2024, SDG E exercised its right to terminate the TO5 settlement. Accordingly, in October 2024, SDG E submitted its TO6 filing to the FERC to be effective January 1, 2025, subject to refund. SDG E s TO6 filing proposes, among other items, an increase to SDG E s currently authorized base ROE from 10.10 to 11.75 and continuation of the California ISO adder. SDG E expects further proceedings on this matter. We further discuss SDG E s TO6 filing in Note 4 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 SDG E has entered into PPAs and tolling agreements that are variable interests in unconsolidated entities. We discuss variable interests in Note 1 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 SoCalGas 
 Aliso Canyon Natural Gas Storage Facility Gas Leak 
 From October 23, 2015 through February 11, 2016, SoCalGas experienced the Leak, which we discuss in Note 11 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this report and in Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors in the Annual Report. 
 At September 30, 2024, 21 million is accrued in Other Current Liabilities and 1 million is accrued in Deferred Credits and Other on SoCalGas and Sempra s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. These accruals do not include any amounts in excess of what has been reasonably estimated to resolve certain matters that we describe in Legal Proceedings SoCalGas Aliso Canyon Natural Gas Storage Facility Gas Leak in Note 11 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, nor any amounts that may be necessary to resolve threatened litigation, other potential litigation or other costs. We are not able to reasonably estimate the possible loss or a range of possible losses in excess of the amounts accrued, which could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on SoCalGas and Sempra s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. 
 Natural Gas Storage Operations and Reliability 
 Natural gas withdrawn from storage is important to help maintain service reliability during peak demand periods, including consumer heating needs in the winter and peak electric generation needs in the summer. The Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility is the largest SoCalGas storage facility and an important component of SoCalGas delivery system. In February 2017, the CPUC opened proceeding SB 380 OII to determine the feasibility of minimizing or eliminating the use of the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility while still maintaining energy and electric reliability for the region, including analyzing alternative means for meeting or avoiding the demand for the facility s services if it were eliminated. We expect a final decision by the end of this year. 
 At September 30, 2024, the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility had a net book value of 1.0 billion. If the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility were to be permanently closed or if future cash flows from its operation were otherwise insufficient to recover its carrying value, we may record an impairment of the facility, which could be material, and natural gas reliability and electric generation could be jeopardized. 
 Franchise Agreement 
 SoCalGas Los Angeles County franchise initially expired in June 2023 and the subsequent extension expired in December 2023. SoCalGas is in the process of negotiating a new agreement with Los Angeles County. SoCalGas is operating under the terms and provisions of the expired franchise and expects to continue to do so until a new agreement is reached and does not anticipate disruption of service to customers in unincorporated Los Angeles County while negotiations continue. 
 Labor Relations 
 Field, technical and most clerical employees at SoCalGas are represented by the Utility Workers Union of America or the International Chemical Workers Union Council. The collective bargaining agreement for these employees covering wages, hours, working conditions, and medical and other benefit plans was due to expire on September 30, 2024, but was extended by mutual agreement to allow time for further negotiation of new terms and a subsequent ratification vote. SoCalGas and representatives of the unions reached a tentative agreement for a new collective bargaining agreement on October 3, 2024, but the ratification vote did not pass. The terms and conditions of the existing agreement are currently scheduled to expire on November 8, 2024. 
 105 

Table of Contents 

 Negotiations for the new collective bargaining agreement and extension of the existing collective bargaining agreement are presently ongoing. If we are unable to extend the existing agreement, there could be labor disruptions following the expiration of that agreement, though we do not anticipate that such labor disruptions would have a material impact on service. 
 
 Sempra Texas Utilities 
 Oncor relies on external financing as a significant source of liquidity for its capital requirements. In the event that Oncor fails to meet its capital requirements, access sufficient capital, or raise capital on favorable terms to finance its ongoing needs, we may elect to make additional capital contributions to Oncor (as our commitments to the PUCT prohibit us from making loans to Oncor), which could be substantial and reduce the cash available to us for other purposes, increase our indebtedness and ultimately materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. Oncor s ability to make distributions may be limited by factors such as its credit ratings, regulatory capital requirements, increases in its capital plan, debt-to-equity ratio approved by the PUCT and other restrictions and considerations. In addition, Oncor will not make distributions if a majority of Oncor s independent directors or any minority member director determines it is in the best interests of Oncor to retain such amounts to meet expected future requirements. 
 Rates and Cost Recovery 
 The PUCT issued a final order in Oncor s most recent comprehensive base rate proceeding in April 2023, and rates implementing that order went into effect on May 1, 2023. In June 2023, the PUCT issued an order on rehearing in response to the motions for rehearing filed by Oncor and certain intervening parties in the proceeding. The order on rehearing made certain technical and typographical corrections to the final order but otherwise affirmed the material provisions of the final order and did not require modification of the rates that went into effect on May 1, 2023. In September 2023, Oncor filed an appeal in Travis County District Court seeking judicial review of certain rate base disallowances and related expense effects of those disallowances in the PUCT s order on rehearing. In February 2024, the court dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. In March 2024, Oncor appealed the court s dismissal, which is currently with the Fifteenth Court of Appeals in Texas. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement 
 Our investment in Oncor Holdings is a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity. We discuss variable interests in Note 1 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 Sempra Infrastructure 
 Sempra Infrastructure expects to fund capital expenditures, investments and operations in part with available funds, including existing credit facilities, and cash flows from operations from the Sempra Infrastructure businesses. We expect Sempra Infrastructure will require additional funding for the development and expansion of its portfolio of projects, which may be financed through a combination of funding from the parent and NCI owners, bank financing, issuances of debt, project financing, partnering in JVs and asset sales. 
 Sempra, KKR Pinnacle and ADIA directly or indirectly own a 70 , 20 , and 10 interest, respectively, in SI Partners, and KKR Denali, an affiliate of ConocoPhillips and TotalEnergies SE each own a 60 , 30 and 16.6 interest, respectively, in three separate SI Partners subsidiaries. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, Sempra Infrastructure distributed 235 million and 289 million, respectively, to its NCI owners, and NCI owners contributed 1,121 million and 1,236 million, respectively, to Sempra Infrastructure. 
 Sempra Infrastructure is in various stages of development or construction on natural gas liquefaction projects, pipeline and terminal projects, and renewable generation and sequestration projects, which we describe below. The successful development and/or construction of these projects is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. 
 With respect to projects in development, these risks and uncertainties include, as applicable depending on the project, any failure to: 
 secure binding customer commitments 
 identify suitable project and equity partners 
 obtain sufficient financing 
 reach agreement with project partners or other applicable parties to proceed 
 obtain, modify, and/or maintain permits and regulatory approvals, including LNG export applications to non-FTA countries 
 negotiate, complete and maintain suitable commercial agreements, which may include EPC, tolling, equity acquisition, governance, LNG sales, gas supply and transportation contracts 
 reach a positive final investment decision 
 106 

Table of Contents 

 With respect to projects under construction, these risks and uncertainties include, in addition to the risks described above as applicable to each project, construction delays and cost overruns. 
 An unfavorable outcome with respect to any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on (i) the development and construction of the applicable project, including a potential impairment of all or a substantial portion of the capital costs invested in the project to date, which could be material, and (ii) for any project that has reached a positive final investment decision, Sempra s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. For a further discussion of these risks, see Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors in the Annual Report. 
 The descriptions below discuss several HOAs, MOUs and other non-binding development agreements with respect to Sempra Infrastructure s various development projects. These arrangements do not commit any party to enter into definitive agreements or otherwise participate in the applicable project, and the ultimate participation by the parties remains subject to negotiation and finalization of definitive agreements, among other factors. 
 LNG 
 Cameron LNG Phase 2 Project. Cameron LNG JV is developing a proposed expansion project that would add one electric drive liquefaction train with an expected maximum production capacity of approximately 6.75 Mtpa and would increase the production capacity of the existing three trains at the Cameron LNG Phase 1 facility by up to approximately 1 Mtpa through debottlenecking activities. The Cameron LNG JV site can accommodate additional trains beyond the proposed Cameron LNG Phase 2 project. 
 Cameron LNG JV has received major permits, as amended to allow the use of electric drives for a one-train electric drive expansion along with other design enhancements, and FTA and non-FTA approvals associated with the potential expansion. The non-FTA approval for the proposed Cameron LNG Phase 2 project includes, among other things, a May 2026 deadline to commence commercial exports, for which we expect to request an extension. 
 Sempra Infrastructure and the other Cameron LNG JV members, namely affiliates of TotalEnergies SE, Mitsui Co., Ltd. and Japan LNG Investment, LLC, a company jointly owned by Mitsubishi Corporation and Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha, have entered into a non-binding HOA for the potential development of the Cameron LNG Phase 2 project. The non-binding HOA provides a commercial framework for the proposed project, including the contemplated allocation to SI Partners of 50.2 of the fourth train production capacity and 25 of the debottlenecking capacity from the project under tolling agreements. The non-binding HOA contemplates the remaining capacity to be allocated equally to the existing Cameron LNG Phase 1 facility customers. Sempra Infrastructure plans to sell the LNG corresponding to its allocated capacity from the proposed Cameron LNG Phase 2 project under long-term SPAs prior to making a final investment decision. 
 After completion of certain value engineering work in the first quarter of 2024, Cameron LNG JV is conducting additional value engineering work to improve the overall value of the project and evaluate other potential EPC contractors. We expect this work will continue through the end of 2024 as we continue to evaluate the timeframe to make a final investment decision, which we no longer expect to occur in the first half of 2025 and which remains subject to satisfactory conclusion on the EPC process as well as negotiation and finalization of definitive offtake agreements and completion of all related financing and permitting activities necessary to align our authorizations with the proposed schedule for the project. 
 In December 2023, Entergy Louisiana, LLC, a subsidiary of Entergy Corporation, and Cameron LNG JV signed a new electricity service agreement (and related ancillary agreements) for the supply to Cameron LNG JV of up to 950 MW of renewable power from new renewable resources in Louisiana. 
 Expansion of the Cameron LNG Phase 1 facility beyond the first three trains is subject to certain restrictions and conditions under the JV project financing agreements, including among others, scope restrictions on expansion of the project unless appropriate prior consent is obtained from the existing project lenders. Under the Cameron LNG JV equity agreements, the expansion of the project requires the unanimous consent of all the members, including with respect to the equity investment obligation of each member. 
 ECA LNG Phase 1 Project. ECA LNG Phase 1 is constructing a one-train natural gas liquefaction facility at the site of Sempra Infrastructure s existing ECA Regas Facility with a nameplate capacity of 3.25 Mtpa and an initial offtake capacity of 2.5 Mtpa. We do not expect the construction or operation of the ECA LNG Phase 1 project to disrupt operations at the ECA Regas Facility. SI Partners owns an 83.4 interest in ECA LNG Phase 1, and an affiliate of TotalEnergies SE owns the remaining 16.6 interest. Sempra holds an indirect interest in the ECA LNG Phase 1 project of 58.4 . 
 107 

Table of Contents 

 We received authorizations from the DOE to export U.S.-produced natural gas to Mexico and to re-export LNG to non-FTA countries from the ECA LNG Phase 1 project. ECA LNG Phase 1 has definitive 20-year SPAs with an affiliate of TotalEnergies SE for approximately 1.7 Mtpa of LNG and with Mitsui Co., Ltd. for approximately 0.8 Mtpa of LNG. The customers have a termination right if the ECA LNG Phase 1 project does not commence commercial operations under the SPAs by February 24, 2026, subject to certain additional conditions, for which we expect to request an extension if necessary. 
 We have an EPC contract with TP Oil Gas Mexico, S. De R.L. De C.V., an affiliate of Technip Energies N.V., to construct the ECA LNG Phase 1 project. We estimate the total price of the EPC contract to be approximately 1.6 billion, with capital expenditures approximating 2.5 billion including capitalized interest at the project level and project contingency. The actual cost of the EPC contract and the actual amount of these capital expenditures may differ substantially from our estimates. We expect the ECA LNG Phase 1 project to commence commercial operations in the spring of 2026. 
 ECA LNG Phase 1 has a five-year loan agreement with a syndicate of seven external lenders that matures in December 2025 for an aggregate principal amount of up to 1.3 billion, of which 1.0 billion was outstanding at September 30, 2024. Proceeds from the loan are being used to finance the cost of construction of the ECA LNG Phase 1 project. 
 With respect to the ECA LNG Phase 1 and Phase 2 projects, recent and proposed changes to the law in Mexico and an unfavorable resolution of land disputes and permit challenges, in each case that we discuss in Note 11 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, could have a material adverse effect on the development and construction of these projects. 
 ECA LNG Phase 2 Project. Sempra Infrastructure is developing a second, large-scale natural gas liquefaction project at the site of its existing ECA Regas Facility. We expect the proposed ECA LNG Phase 2 project to be comprised of two trains and one LNG storage tank and produce approximately 12 Mtpa of export capacity. We expect that construction of the proposed ECA LNG Phase 2 project would conflict with the current operations at the ECA Regas Facility, which currently has long-term regasification contracts for 100 of the regasification facility s capacity through 2028. This makes the decisions on whether, when and how to pursue the proposed ECA LNG Phase 2 project dependent in part on whether the investment in a large-scale liquefaction facility would, over the long term, be more beneficial financially than continuing to supply regasification services under our existing contracts. 
 We received authorizations from the DOE to export U.S.-produced natural gas to Mexico and to re-export LNG to non-FTA countries from the proposed ECA LNG Phase 2 project. 
 We have non-binding MOUs and/or HOAs with Mitsui Co., Ltd., an affiliate of TotalEnergies SE, and ConocoPhillips that provide a framework for their potential offtake of LNG from the proposed ECA LNG Phase 2 project and potential acquisition of an equity interest in ECA LNG Phase 2. 
 PA LNG Phase 1 Project. Sempra Infrastructure is constructing a natural gas liquefaction project on a greenfield site that it owns in the vicinity of Port Arthur, Texas, located along the Sabine-Neches waterway. The PA LNG Phase 1 project will consist of two liquefaction trains, two LNG storage tanks, a marine berth and associated loading facilities and related infrastructure necessary to provide liquefaction services with a nameplate capacity of approximately 13 Mtpa and an initial offtake capacity of approximately 10.5 Mtpa. SI Partners, KKR Denali and an affiliate of ConocoPhillips indirectly own a 28 , 42 and 30 interest, respectively, in the PA LNG Phase 1 project, and Sempra holds a 19.6 indirect interest in the project. 
 Sempra Infrastructure has received authorizations from the DOE that permit the LNG to be produced from the PA LNG Phase 1 project to be exported to all current and future FTA and non-FTA countries. In April 2019, the FERC approved the siting, construction and operation of the PA LNG Phase 1 project. In June 2023, Port Arthur LNG requested authorization from the FERC to increase its work force and implement a 24-hours-per-day construction schedule to further enhance construction efficiency while reducing temporal impacts to the community and environment in the vicinity of the project. The authorization was granted in May 2024 and provides the EPC contractor with more optionality to meet or exceed the project s construction schedule. 
 The PA LNG Phase 1 project holds two Clean Air Act, Prevention of Significant Deterioration permits issued by the TCEQ, which we refer to as the 2016 Permit and the 2022 Permit. The 2022 Permit also governs emissions for the proposed PA LNG Phase 2 project. In November 2023, a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit issued a decision to vacate and remand the 2022 Permit to the TCEQ for additional explanation of the agency s permit decision. In February 2024, the court withdrew its opinion and referred the case to the Supreme Court of Texas to resolve the question of the appropriate standard to be applied by the TCEQ. The 2022 Permit is effective during the Texas Supreme Court s review. The 2016 Permit was not the subject of, and is unaffected by, the pending litigation of the 2022 Permit. Construction of the PA LNG Phase 1 project is proceeding uninterrupted under existing permits, and we do not currently anticipate the pending litigation to materially impact the PA LNG Phase 1 project cost, schedule or expected commercial operations at this stage.

Table of Contents 

 Sempra Infrastructure has definitive SPAs for LNG offtake from the PA LNG Phase 1 project with: 
 an affiliate of ConocoPhillips for a 20-year term for 5 Mtpa of LNG, as well as a natural gas supply management agreement whereby an affiliate of ConocoPhillips will manage the feed gas supply requirements for the PA LNG Phase 1 project. 
 RWE Supply Trading GmbH, a subsidiary of RWE AG, for a 15-year term for 2.25 Mtpa of LNG. 
 INEOS for a 20-year term for approximately 1.4 Mtpa of LNG. 
 ORLEN for a 20-year term for approximately 1 Mtpa of LNG. 
 ENGIE S.A. for a 15-year term for approximately 0.875 Mtpa of LNG. 
 We have an EPC contract with Bechtel to construct the PA LNG Phase 1 project. In March 2023, we issued a final notice to proceed under the EPC contract, which has an estimated price of approximately 10.7 billion. We estimate the capital expenditures for the PA LNG Phase 1 project will be approximately 13 billion, including capitalized interest at the project level and project contingency. The actual cost of the EPC contract and the actual amount of these capital expenditures may differ substantially from our estimates. We expect the first and second trains of the PA LNG Phase 1 project to commence commercial operations in 2027 and 2028, respectively. 
 As we discuss in Note 9 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, SI Partners and ConocoPhillips have provided guarantees relating to their respective affiliate s commitment to make its pro rata equity share of capital contributions to fund 110 of the development budget of the PA LNG Phase 1 project, in an aggregate amount of up to 9.0 billion. SI Partners guarantee covers 70 of this amount plus enforcement costs of its guarantee. As of September 30, 2024, an aggregate amount of 2.7 billion has been paid by SI Partners indirect subsidiary in satisfaction of its commitment to fund its portion of the development budget of the PA LNG Phase 1 project. 
 In March 2023, Port Arthur LNG entered into a seven-year term loan facility agreement with a syndicate of lenders for an aggregate principal amount of approximately 6.8 billion and an initial working capital facility agreement for up to 200 million. The facilities mature in March 2030. Proceeds from the loans will be used to finance the cost of construction of the PA LNG Phase 1 project. At September 30, 2024, 420 million of borrowings were outstanding under the term loan facility agreement. 
 PA LNG Phase 2 Project. Sempra Infrastructure is developing a second phase of the Port Arthur natural gas liquefaction project that we expect will be a similar size to the PA LNG Phase 1 project. We are progressing the development of the proposed PA LNG Phase 2 project, while continuing to evaluate overall opportunities to develop the entirety of the Port Arthur site. 
 In September 2023, the FERC approved the siting, construction and operation of the proposed PA LNG Phase 2 project, including the potential addition of up to two liquefaction trains. In February 2020, Sempra Infrastructure filed an application with the DOE to permit LNG produced from the proposed PA LNG Phase 2 project to be exported to all current and future FTA and non-FTA countries. We received the FTA authorization from the DOE in July 2020. 
 As we discuss above, a U.S. federal court previously issued and subsequently withdrew a decision that would have vacated and remanded the 2022 Permit authorizing emissions from the PA LNG Phase 1 and Phase 2 projects to the TCEQ for additional explanation of the agency s permit decision. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has referred the case to the Supreme Court of Texas to resolve the question of the appropriate standard to be applied by the TCEQ. The 2022 Permit is effective pending the Texas Supreme Court s review. 
 Sempra Infrastructure has entered into a non-binding HOA for the negotiation and potential finalization of a definitive SPA with INEOS for approximately 0.2 Mtpa of LNG offtake from the proposed PA LNG Phase 2 project. Additionally, Sempra Infrastructure has entered into a non-binding HOA for a 20-year SPA with Aramco for 5 Mtpa of LNG offtake from the proposed PA LNG Phase 2 project. The HOA further contemplates Aramco s 25 participation in the project-level equity of the PA LNG Phase 2 project. 
 In July 2024, Sempra Infrastructure entered into an 8.2 billion EPC contract with Bechtel for the proposed PA LNG Phase 2 project. The EPC contract contemplates the construction of two liquefaction trains capable of producing approximately 13 Mtpa, an additional LNG storage tank and marine berth and associated loading facilities and related infrastructure necessary to provide liquefaction services. We have no obligation to move forward on the EPC contract, and we may release Bechtel to perform portions of the work pursuant to limited notices to proceed. The price is subject to change if certain limited notices to proceed and the full notice to proceed are not issued, each by specified dates. We expect to work with Bechtel with respect to such changes based on the ultimate timeline for the project and plan to fully release Bechtel to perform all the work to construct the PA LNG Phase 2 project only after we reach a final investment decision with respect to the project and after certain other conditions are met, including obtaining permits, executing definitive agreements for LNG offtake and equity investments, and securing project financing.

 Vista Pacifico LNG Liquefaction Project. Sempra Infrastructure is developing the Vista Pacifico LNG project, a mid-scale natural gas liquefaction export facility proposed to be located in the vicinity of the Port of Topolobampo in Sinaloa, Mexico. In June 2024, we extended the non-binding development agreement with the CFE to December 15, 2024, with an automatic one-year extension to December 15, 2025. We continue to progress with the CFE on the negotiation of definitive agreements, including a natural gas supply agreement. The proposed LNG export terminal would be supplied with U.S. natural gas and would use excess capacity on existing pipelines in Mexico with the intent of helping to meet growing demand for natural gas and LNG in the Mexican and Pacific markets. 
 Sempra Infrastructure received authorization from the DOE to permit the export of U.S.-produced natural gas to Mexico and for LNG produced from the proposed Vista Pacifico LNG facility to be re-exported to all current and future FTA countries and non-FTA countries. 
 In March 2022, TotalEnergies SE and Sempra Infrastructure entered into a non-binding MOU that contemplates TotalEnergies SE potentially contracting approximately one-third of the long-term export production of the proposed Vista Pacifico LNG project and potentially participating as a minority partner in the project. 
 Asset and Supply Optimization. As we discuss in Part II Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in the Annual Report, Sempra Infrastructure enters into hedging transactions to help mitigate commodity price risk and optimize the value of its LNG, natural gas pipelines and storage, and power-generating assets. Some of these derivatives that we use as economic hedges do not meet the requirements for hedge accounting, or hedge accounting is not elected, and as a result, the changes in fair value of these derivatives are recorded in earnings. Consequently, significant changes in commodity prices have in the past and could in the future result in earnings volatility, which may be material, as the economic offset of these derivatives may not be recorded at fair value. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements. Our investment in Cameron LNG JV is a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity. We discuss variable interests in Note 1 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 In June 2021, Sempra provided a promissory note, which constitutes a guarantee, for the benefit of Cameron LNG JV with a maximum exposure to loss of 165 million. The guarantee will terminate upon full repayment of Cameron LNG JV s debt, scheduled to occur in 2039, or replenishment of the amount withdrawn by Sempra Infrastructure from the SDSRA. We discuss this guarantee in Note 5 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 In July 2020, Sempra entered into a Support Agreement, which contains a guarantee and represents a variable interest, for the benefit of CFIN with a maximum exposure to loss of 979 million. The guarantee will terminate upon full repayment of the guaranteed debt by 2039, including repayment following an event in which the guaranteed debt is put to Sempra. We discuss this guarantee in Notes 1, 5 and 8 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Energy Networks 
 Sonora Pipeline. Sempra Infrastructure s Sonora natural gas pipeline consists of two pipeline segments, the Sasabe-Puerto Libertad-Guaymas segment and the Guaymas-El Oro segment. Each segment has its own service agreement with the CFE. Following the start of commercial operations of the Guaymas-El Oro segment, Sempra Infrastructure reported damage to the pipeline in the Yaqui territory that has made that section inoperable since August 2017. In September 2019, Sempra Infrastructure and the CFE reached an agreement to modify the tariff structure and extend the term of the contract by 10 years. Under the revised agreement, the CFE will resume making payments only when the damaged section of the Guaymas-El Oro segment of the Sonora pipeline is back in service. 
 Sempra Infrastructure and the CFE have agreed to an amendment to their transportation services agreement and to re-route the portion of the pipeline that is in the Yaqui territory, whereby the CFE would pay for the re-routing with a new tariff. This amendment will terminate if certain conditions are not met, and Sempra Infrastructure retains the right to terminate the transportation services agreement and seek to recover its reasonable and documented costs and lost profit. Sempra Infrastructure continues to acquire and pursue the necessary rights-of-way and permits for the re-routed portion of the pipeline. 
 The Guaymas-El Oro segment of the Sonora pipeline currently constitutes a Sole Risk Project under the terms of the SI Partners limited partnership agreement. Sole Risk Projects are separated from other SI Partners projects and are conducted at Sempra s sole cost, expense and liability and we receive, through the acquisition of Sole Risk Interests, any economic and other benefits from such projects. At September 30, 2024, Sempra Infrastructure had 404 million in PP E, net, related to the Guaymas-El Oro segment of the Sonora pipeline, which could be subject to impairment if Sempra Infrastructure is unable to re-route a portion of the pipeline and resume operations or if Sempra Infrastructure terminates the contract and is unable to obtain recovery, which in each case could have a material adverse effect on Sempra s business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.

 Refined Products Terminals. Sempra Infrastructure owns and operates a terminal for the receipt, storage, and delivery of refined products in Topolobampo, which commenced commercial operations in June 2024. 
 Sempra Infrastructure is also developing terminals for the receipt, storage, and delivery of refined products in the vicinity of Manzanillo and Ensenada. 
 SI Partners holds a 100 indirect interest and Sempra holds a 70 indirect interest in these terminals. 
 Port Arthur Pipeline Louisiana Connector. Sempra Infrastructure is constructing the Port Arthur Pipeline Louisiana Connector, a 72-mile pipeline connecting the PA LNG Phase 1 project to Gillis, Louisiana, in which SI Partners holds a 100 indirect interest and Sempra holds a 70 indirect interest. In April 2019, the FERC approved the siting, construction and operation of the Port Arthur Pipeline Louisiana Connector, which will be used to supply feed gas to the PA LNG Phase 1 project. In July 2023, Sempra Infrastructure filed a limited amendment application with the FERC to implement construction process enhancements and minor modifications to several discrete sections of the Port Arthur Pipeline Louisiana Connector. These modifications are intended to decrease environmental impacts, accommodate landowner routing requests and enhance construction procedures. In May 2024, the FERC approved the Port Arthur Pipeline Louisiana Connector amendment application. We expect the Port Arthur Pipeline Louisiana Connector to be ready for service ahead of the PA LNG Phase 1 project s gas requirements. We estimate the capital expenditures for the project will be approximately 1 billion, including capitalized interest at the project level and project contingency. The actual amount of these capital expenditures may differ substantially from our estimates. 
 Louisiana Storage. Sempra Infrastructure is constructing Louisiana Storage, a 12.5-Bcf salt dome natural gas storage facility to support the PA LNG Phase 1 project, in which SI Partners holds a 100 indirect interest and Sempra holds a 70 indirect interest. The construction includes an 11-mile pipeline that will connect to the Port Arthur Pipeline Louisiana Connector. In September 2022, the FERC approved the development of the project. We expect Louisiana Storage to be ready for service in time to support the needs of the PA LNG Phase 1 project. We estimate the capital expenditures for the project will be approximately 300 million, including capitalized interest at the project level and project contingency. The actual amount of these capital expenditures may differ substantially from our estimates. 
 Low Carbon Solutions 
 Cimarr n Wind. Sempra Infrastructure has made a positive final investment decision on and begun constructing the Cimarr n Wind project, an approximately 320-MW wind generation facility in Baja California, Mexico, in which SI Partners holds a 100 indirect interest and Sempra holds a 70 indirect interest. Sempra Infrastructure has a 20-year PPA with Silicon Valley Power for the long-term supply of renewable energy to the City of Santa Clara, California. Cimarr n Wind will utilize Sempra Infrastructure s existing cross-border high voltage transmission line to interconnect and deliver clean energy to the East County substation in San Diego County. We estimate the capital expenditures for the project will be approximately 550 million, including capitalized interest at the project level and project contingency. The actual amount of these capital expenditures may differ substantially from our estimates. We expect the Cimarr n Wind project to begin generating energy in late 2025 and commence commercial operations in the first half of 2026. 
 Hackberry Carbon Sequestration Project. Sempra Infrastructure is developing the potential Hackberry Carbon Sequestration project near Hackberry, Louisiana. This proposed project under development is designed to permanently sequester carbon dioxide from the Cameron LNG Phase 1 facility and the proposed Cameron LNG Phase 2 project. In 2021, Sempra Infrastructure filed an application with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for a Class VI carbon injection well to advance this project. The permit is pending approval from the State of Louisiana as the EPA has transferred Class VI permitting authority to the state. 
 Sempra Infrastructure, TotalEnergies SE, Mitsui Co., Ltd. and Mitsubishi Corporation have entered into a Participation Agreement for the development of the proposed Hackberry Carbon Sequestration project. The Participation Agreement contemplates that the combined Cameron LNG Phase 1 facility and proposed Cameron LNG Phase 2 project would potentially serve as the anchor source for the capture and sequestration of carbon dioxide by the proposed project. It also provides the basis for the parties to acquire an equity interest by entering into a JV with Sempra Infrastructure for the Hackberry Carbon Sequestration project. In May 2023, Sempra Infrastructure and Cameron LNG JV entered into a non-binding HOA, which sets forth a framework for further development of the Hackberry Carbon Sequestration project.

 Legal and Regulatory Matters 
 See Note 11 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this report and Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors in the Annual Report for discussions of the following legal and regulatory matters affecting our operations in Mexico and risks associated with Mexican laws, policies and government influence: 
 Energ a Costa Azul 
 Land Disputes 
 Environmental and Social Impact Permits 
 One or more unfavorable final decisions on these land disputes or environmental and social impact permit challenges could materially adversely affect our existing natural gas regasification operations and proposed natural gas liquefaction projects at the site of the ECA Regas Facility and have a material adverse effect on Sempra s business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. 
 Regulatory and Other Actions by the Mexican Government 
 Amendments to Mexico s Hydrocarbons Law 
 Amendments to Mexico s Electricity Industry Law 
 Sempra Infrastructure and other parties affected by these amendments to Mexican law have challenged them by filing amparo and other claims, some of which remain pending. In particular, Sempra Infrastructure filed one lawsuit concerning the provision of Mexico s Electricity Industry Law permitting revocation of self-supply permits deemed improperly obtained that was dismissed by the court. Consequently, the CRE may be required to seek to revoke such self-supply permits, under a legal standard that is ambiguous and not well defined under the law. An unfavorable decision on one or more of these amparo or other challenges, the impact of the amendments that have become effective (due to unsuccessful amparo challenges or otherwise), or the possibility of future reforms to the energy industry through additional amendments to Mexican laws, regulations or rules (including through amendments to the constitution) may impact our ability to operate our facilities at existing levels or at all, may result in increased costs for Sempra Infrastructure and its customers, may adversely affect our ability to develop new projects, may result in decreased revenues and cash flows, and may negatively impact our ability to recover the carrying values of our investments in Mexico, any of which may have a material adverse effect on Sempra s business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. 
 Subsequent to the federal elections in Mexico, the Mexican government has begun to introduce significant changes to the Constitution, which will require changes in laws, policies, and regulations in order to be implemented. These changes have included constitutional reforms to the judiciary and to the treatment of certain state-owned enterprises. The changes to the judiciary include a requirement that all judges be elected rather than appointed. These reforms and any further constitutional, legal or regulatory changes could affect the Mexican economy, energy sector and our businesses, the extent of which we currently are unable to predict.

 ERCOT has been experiencing, and expects to continue to experience, growth in power demand. Additionally, pursuant to recently enacted Texas House Bill 2555 and related rules promulgated by the PUCT, Oncor filed for PUCT review and approval a system resiliency plan to help enhance the resiliency of its transmission and distribution system. Oncor anticipates its 2025 through 2029 five-year capital expenditures plan may increase by 40 to 50 compared to its previously announced 2024 through 2028 plan. 
 An increase in Oncor s 2025 through 2029 five-year capital expenditures plan would likely result in an increase to Sempra s capital expenditures and investments in its 2025 through 2029 five-year plan. The amounts and timing of capital expenditures and certain investments may vary substantially from our estimates and are generally subject to approvals by various regulatory and other governmental and environmental bodies, including the CPUC, the FERC and the PUCT, the cost and availability of financing, changes in tax law and business opportunities providing desirable rates of return, among various other factors described in this MD A and in Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors in the Annual Report. We intend to finance our capital expenditures and investments in a manner that will maintain our investment-grade credit ratings and capital structure, but there is no guarantee that we will be able to do so. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 Management views certain accounting estimates as critical because their application is the most relevant, judgmental and/or material to our financial position and results of operations, and/or because they require the use of material judgments and estimates. We discuss critical accounting estimates in Part II Item 7. MD A in the Annual Report. 

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS 
 We discuss any recent accounting pronouncements that have had or may have a significant effect on our financial statements and/or disclosures in Note 2 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 We provide disclosure regarding derivative activity in Note 7 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. We discuss our market risk and risk policies in detail in Part II Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in the Annual Report. 
 COMMODITY PRICE RISK 
 Sempra Infrastructure is exposed to commodity price risk indirectly through its LNG, natural gas pipelines and storage, and power-generating assets. In the first nine months of 2024, a hypothetical 10 change in commodity prices would have resulted in a change in the fair value of our commodity-based natural gas and electricity derivatives of 15 million at September 30, 2024 compared to 14 million at December 31, 2023. 
 114 

Table of Contents 

 The one-day value at risk for SDG E s and SoCalGas commodity positions were 2 million and 3 million, respectively, at September 30, 2024 compared to 2 million and 4 million, respectively, at December 31, 2023. 
 INTEREST RATE RISK 
 The table below shows the nominal amount of our debt: 
 NOMINAL AMOUNT OF DEBT (1) 
 (Dollars in millions) September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Sempra SDG E SoCalGas Sempra SDG E SoCalGas Short-term: Sempra California 884 384 500 947 947 Other

 1,034 890 
 (1) After the effects of interest rate swaps. Before reductions for unamortized discount and debt issuance costs and excluding finance lease obligations. 
 
 An interest rate risk sensitivity analysis measures interest rate risk by calculating the estimated changes in earnings attributable to common shares (but disregarding capitalized interest and impacts on equity earnings from debt at our equity method investees) that would result from a hypothetical change in market interest rates. Earnings attributable to common shares are affected by changes in interest rates on short-term debt and variable-rate long-term debt. If weighted-average interest rates on short-term debt outstanding at September 30, 2024 increased or decreased by 10 , the change in earnings attributable to common shares over the 12-month period ending September 30, 2025 would be approximately 8 million. If interest rates increased or decreased by 10 on all variable-rate long-term debt at September 30, 2024, after considering the effects of interest rate swaps, the change in earnings attributable to common shares over the 12-month period ending September 30, 2025 would be approximately 3 million. 
 FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISK AND INFLATION EXPOSURE 
 We discuss our foreign currency exchange rate risk and inflation exposure in Part I Item 2. MD A Impact of Foreign Currency and Inflation Rates on Results of Operations in this report and in Part II Item 7. MD A Impact of Foreign Currency and Inflation Rates on Results of Operations in the Annual Report. At September 30, 2024, there were no significant changes to our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk since December 31, 2023. 
 In 2023 and 2024 to date, SDG E and SoCalGas have experienced inflationary pressures from increases in various costs, including the cost of natural gas, electric fuel and purchased power, labor, materials and supplies, as well as availability of labor and materials. Sempra Texas Utilities has experienced increased costs, including labor and contractor related costs as well as higher insurance premiums, and does not have specific regulatory mechanisms that allow for recovery of higher non-reconcilable costs due to inflation; rather, recovery is limited to rate updates through capital trackers and base rate reviews, which may result in partial non-recovery due to the regulatory lag. If such costs continue to be subject to significant inflationary pressures and we are not able to fully recover such higher costs in rates or there is a delay in recovery, these increased costs may have a significant effect on Sempra s, SDG E s and SoCalGas results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. 
 Sempra Infrastructure has experienced inflationary pressures from increases in various costs, including the cost of labor, materials and supplies. Sempra Infrastructure generally secures long-term contracts that are U.S. dollar-denominated or referenced and are periodically adjusted for market factors, including inflation, and Sempra Infrastructure generally enters into lump-sum contracts for its large construction projects in which much of the risk during construction is absorbed or hedged by the EPC contractor. If additional costs become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully recover such higher costs through contractual adjustments for inflation, which may have a significant effect on Sempra s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Sempra, SDG E and SoCalGas maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in their respective reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and is accumulated and communicated to the management of each company, including each respective principal executive officer and principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating these controls and procedures, the management of each company recognizes that any system of controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives; therefore, the management of each company applies judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of the principal executive officers and principal financial officers of Sempra, SDG E and SoCalGas, each such company s management evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, the end of the period covered by this report. Based on these evaluations, the principal executive officers and principal financial officers of Sempra, SDG E and SoCalGas concluded that their respective company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of such date. 
 INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 
 There have been no changes in Sempra s, SDG E s or SoCalGas internal control over financial reporting during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, any such company s internal control over financial reporting.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 We are not party to, and our property is not the subject of, any material pending legal proceedings (other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to our businesses) or environmental proceedings described in Item 103(c)(3) of SEC Regulation S-K except for the matters (1) described in Note 11 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this report and in Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report, or (2) referred to in Part I Item 2. MD A in this report or in Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors or Part II Item 7. MD A in the Annual Report. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 When evaluating our company and its consolidated entities and any investment in our or their securities, you should carefully consider the risk factors and all other information contained in this report and the other documents we file with the SEC (including those filed subsequent to this report), including the factors discussed in Part I Item 2. MD A in this report and Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors and Part II Item 7. MD A in the Annual Report. This section supplements the risk factors described in our Annual Report by adding the below risk factor under the heading Risks Related to Sempra Financial and Capital Stock-Related Risks in Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors. Any of the risks and other information discussed in this report or any of the risk factors discussed in Part I Item 1A. Risk Factors or Part II Item 7. MD A in the Annual Report, as well as additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial, could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, prospects and/or the trading prices of our securities or those of our consolidated entities. 
 Settlement provisions contained in the forward sale agreements we may enter into in connection with our ATM program subject us to certain risks. 
 In November 2024, Sempra established an ATM program, which we discuss in Note 9 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and in part (a) of Part II - Item 5. Other Information below. We are permitted to sell shares of our common stock in the ATM program pursuant to forward sale agreements, which grant each counterparty (each a forward purchaser) the right to accelerate its forward sale agreement (or, in certain cases, the portion thereof that the forward purchaser determines is affected by the relevant event) and require us to physically settle the forward sale agreement on a date specified by the forward purchaser if, subject to a prior notice requirement: 
 the forward purchaser determines in its commercially reasonable judgment that it is unable to hedge in a commercially reasonable manner its exposure to the applicable forward sale agreement because insufficient shares of our common stock are made available for borrowing by securities lenders or that, with respect to borrowing such number of shares of our common stock, it would incur a rate that is greater than the borrow cost specified in the forward sale agreement; 
 we declare any dividend, issue or distribution to existing holders of shares of our common stock that constitutes an extraordinary dividend under the forward sale agreement or is payable in (i) cash in excess of specified amounts (unless it is an extraordinary dividend), (ii) securities of another company that we acquire or own (directly or indirectly) as a result of a spin-off or similar transaction or (iii) any other type of securities (other than our common stock), rights, warrants or other assets for payment at less than the prevailing market price; 
 an event (i) is announced that, if consummated, would result in an extraordinary event (including certain mergers and tender offers, our nationalization, our insolvency and the delisting of the shares of our common stock) or (ii) occurs that would constitute a hedging disruption or change in law; 
 an ownership event (as such term is defined in the forward sale agreement) occurs; or 
 certain other events of default, termination events or other specified events occur, including, among other things, a change in law. 
 A forward purchaser s decision to exercise its right to accelerate all or a portion of the settlement of its forward sale agreement and to require us to physically settle the relevant shares will be made irrespective of our interests, including our need for capital. In such cases, we could be required to issue and deliver shares of our common stock under the terms of the physical settlement, 
 117 

Table of Contents 

 which would result in dilution to our EPS and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, Series C preferred stock and any other series of preferred stock we may issue in the future. 
 The forward price that we expect to receive upon physical settlement of a forward sale agreement will be subject to adjustment on a daily basis based on a floating interest rate factor. If the specified daily rate is less than the applicable spread on any day, this will result in a daily reduction of the forward price. In addition, the forward price will be subject to decrease on certain dates specified in the relevant forward sale agreement by the amount per share of quarterly dividends we expect to declare on our common stock during the term of such forward sale agreement. 
 We will generally have the right, in lieu of physical settlement of any forward sale agreement, to elect cash or net share settlement in respect of any or all of the shares of our common stock subject to such forward sale agreement. If we elect to cash or net share settle all or any part of any forward sale agreement, we would expect to issue a substantially lower number of shares than if we settled by physical delivery, but would not receive the cash for the shares that would have otherwise been issued if we settled the entire forward sale agreement by physical delivery and, as a result, would not derive the same credit metrics benefits. 
 If the price of our common stock at which these purchases are made by such forward purchaser (or its affiliate) exceeds the applicable forward price, we will pay such forward purchaser an amount in cash equal to such difference (if we elect to cash settle) or we will deliver to such forward purchaser a number of shares of our common stock having a market value equal to such difference (if we elect to net share settle). Any such difference could be significant and could require us to pay a significant amount of cash or deliver a significant number of shares of our common stock to such forward purchaser. 
 The purchase of shares of our common stock by a forward purchaser or its affiliate to unwind the forward purchaser s hedge position could cause the price of our common stock to increase above the price that would have prevailed in the absence of those purchases (or prevent a decrease in such price), thereby increasing the amount of cash (in the case of cash settlement) or the number of shares (in the case of net share settlement) that we would owe such forward purchaser upon settlement of the applicable forward sale agreement or decreasing the amount of cash (in the case of cash settlement) or the number of shares (in the case of net share settlement) that such forward purchaser would owe us upon settlement of the applicable forward sale agreement. 

ITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION 
 (a) On November 6, 2024, we entered into the sales agreement with Barclays Capital Inc., BofA Securities, Inc., Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Goldman Sachs Co. LLC, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Mizuho Securities USA LLC, Morgan Stanley Co. LLC, MUFG Securities Americas Inc., RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Scotia Capital (USA) Inc., and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC (each an agent) and the forward purchasers (as defined below), providing for the offer and sale of shares of Sempra common stock having an aggregate gross sales price of up to billion through the agents, as our sales agents or, if applicable, as forward sellers, or directly to the agents as principals. 
 The shares may be offered and sold in amounts and at times to be determined by us from time to time. Actual sales, if any, will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by us and the agents from time to time, including, among other things, market conditions, the trading price of our common stock, capital needs and determinations by us of the appropriate sources of our funding. 
 Sales of the shares, if any, pursuant to the sales agreement will be made in negotiated transactions, including block trades, or transactions that are deemed to be at-the-market offerings as defined in Rule 415 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, by means of ordinary brokers transactions at market prices prevailing at the time of sale, including sales made directly on the NYSE, sales made to or through a market maker and sales made through other securities exchanges or electronic communications networks or by any other method permitted by applicable law as otherwise agreed between the applicable agent and us. 
 The sales agreement contemplates that, in addition to the issuance and sale by us of shares of our common stock to or through the agents, we may enter into separate forward sale agreements with Barclays Bank PLC, Bank of America, N.A., Citibank, N.A., Goldman Sachs Co. LLC, JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association, Mizuho Markets Americas LLC, Morgan Stanley Co. LLC, MUFG Securities EMEA plc, Royal Bank of Canada, The Bank of Nova Scotia and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, or one of their respective affiliates (the forward purchasers). If we enter into a forward sale agreement with any forward purchaser, we expect that such forward purchaser (or its affiliate) will attempt to borrow from third parties and sell, through the relevant agent, acting as sales agent for such forward purchaser, shares of our common stock to hedge

 such forward purchaser s exposure under such forward sale agreement. We will not receive any proceeds from any sale of shares borrowed by a forward purchaser (or its affiliate) and sold through a forward seller. 
 A copy of the opinion of Latham Watkins LLP relating to the validity of the securities to be issued pursuant to the sales agreement is filed hereto as Exhibit 5.1 . 
 We currently expect to fully physically settle each forward sale agreement, if any, on one or more dates specified by us on or prior to the maturity date of such forward sale agreement. However, we will generally have the right, subject to certain exceptions, to elect to cash settle or net share settle all or any portion of our obligations under any such forward sale agreement. If we elect or are deemed to have elected to physically settle any forward sale agreement by delivering shares of our common stock, we will receive an amount of cash from the relevant forward purchaser equal to the product of (1) the initial forward price per share under such forward sale agreement and (2) the number of shares as to which we have elected or are deemed to have elected physical settlement, subject to the price adjustment and other provisions of such forward sale agreement. 
 The agents are not required to sell any specific number or dollar amount of shares but have agreed to use their commercially reasonable efforts, consistent with their normal trading and sales practices and applicable law and regulations, as our sales agents or as forward sellers, and subject to the terms of the sales agreement and, in the case of shares offered through such agents as forward sellers, the relevant forward sale agreement, to sell shares of our common stock on mutually agreed terms between the agent and us. 
 The sales agreement provides that an agent will be entitled to a commission that will not exceed of the gross sales price of all shares sold through it as agent pursuant to the sales agreement. We may also sell shares to one or more agents as principal, at a price per share to be agreed upon at the time of sale. If we sell shares to one or more of the agents as principal, we will enter into a separate agreement with such agent or agents setting forth the terms of such transaction. In connection with any forward sale agreement under the sales agreement, the applicable agent, as forward seller, will receive a commission, in the form of a reduction to the initial forward price under the related forward sale agreement, at a mutually agreed rate that will not exceed (subject to certain exceptions) of the volume-weighted average of the gross sales price per share of all of the borrowed shares of our common stock sold through such agent, as forward seller, during the applicable forward selling period for such shares. 
 We intend to use a substantial portion of the net proceeds we receive from the issuance and sale by us of any shares of our common stock to or through the agents and any net proceeds we receive pursuant to the settlement of any forward sale agreements with the relevant forward purchasers for working capital and other general corporate purposes, including to partly finance anticipated increases to our long-term capital plan and to repay outstanding commercial paper and potentially other indebtedness. 
 The foregoing description of the sales agreement and any forward sale agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the sales agreement and the form of forward sale agreement, which are filed hereto as Exhibit 10.1 . 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q does not constitute an offer to sell the shares of our common stock subject to the sales agreement or a solicitation of an offer to buy any such shares, nor shall there be any sale of such shares in any state or jurisdiction in which such an offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction. 
 (b) None. 
 (c) During the most recent fiscal quarter, (i) each of the individuals listed below, who were at the time Sempra directors or officers, adopted a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement with respect to the securities of Sempra, with the material terms described below; (ii) no Sempra directors or officers a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or or a non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement with respect to the securities of Sempra; and (iii) no SDG E or SoCalGas directors or officers adopted or terminated a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or a non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement with respect to the securities of each such Registrant. As used herein, directors and officers are as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) under the Exchange Act, a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement is as defined in Item 408(a) of SEC Regulation S-K, and a non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement is as defined in Item 408(c) of SEC Regulation S-K.

Commission on May 26, 2023 (Registration No. 333-272237) (as so filed and as amended, the Registration Statement ), a base prospectus dated May 26, 2023 included in the Registration Statement (the Base Prospectus ), and a prospectus supplement dated November 6, 2024 filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Act (the Prospectus Supplement , and together with the Base Prospectus, the Prospectus ). In connection with the Sales Agreement, the Company may enter into one or more forward sale agreements with the Forward Purchasers (each, a Confirmation in the form attached as Annex II to the Sales Agreement (the Form of Confirmation ), relating to the forward sale by the Company of shares of Common Stock (the Confirmation Shares ), subject to the Company s right to elect net share settlement or cash settlement of all or a portion of its obligations under the applicable Confirmation and certain other terms and conditions. 
 
 This opinion is being furnished in connection with the requirements of Item 601(b)(5) of Regulation S-K under the Act, and no opinion is expressed herein as to any matter pertaining to the contents of the Registration Statement or related prospectus, other than as expressly stated herein with respect to the issue of the Shares. 
 
 As such counsel, we have examined such matters of fact and questions of law as we have considered appropriate for purposes of this letter. With your consent, we have relied upon certificates and other assurances of officers of the Company and others as to factual matters without having independently verified such factual matters. We are opining herein as to the Corporations Code of the State of California (the Corporations Code ), and we express no opinion with respect to any other laws. 
 
 Subject to the foregoing and the other matters set forth herein, it is our opinion that, as of the date hereof, (i) when the Issuance Shares shall have been duly registered on the books of the transfer agent and registrar therefor in the name or on behalf of the purchasers, and have been issued by the Company against payment therefor in the circumstances contemplated by the Sales Agreement, the issue and sale of the Issuance Shares will have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action of the Company, and the Issuance Shares will be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and (ii) when and to the extent the Confirmation Shares shall have been duly registered on the books of the transfer agent and registrar therefor in the name or on behalf of the purchasers, and have been issued by the Company against payment therefor in the circumstances contemplated by the Confirmation, the issue and sale of the Confirmation Shares will have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action of the Company, and the Confirmation Shares will be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. In rendering the foregoing opinions, we have assumed that the Company will comply with all applicable notice requirements regarding uncertificated shares provided in the Corporations Code. 
 
 Our opinion is subject to (i) the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, preference, fraudulent transfer, moratorium or other similar laws relating to or affecting the rights or remedies of creditors (ii) the effects of general principles of equity, whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law (including the possible unavailability of specific performance or injunctive relief), concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith, fair dealing and the discretion of the court before which a proceeding is brought (iii) the invalidity under certain

circumstances under law or court decisions of provisions for the indemnification or exculpation of, or contribution to, a party with respect to a liability where such indemnification, exculpation or contribution is contrary to public policy and (iv) we express no opinion with respect to (a) consents to, or restrictions upon, governing law, jurisdiction, venue, service of process, arbitration, remedies or judicial relief, (b) advance waivers of claims, defenses, rights granted by law, or notice, opportunity for hearing, evidentiary requirements, statutes of limitation, trial by jury or at law, or other procedural rights, (c) waivers of rights or defenses contained in Section 515 of the Indenture, and waivers of broadly or vaguely stated rights, (d) provisions for exclusivity, election or cumulation of rights or remedies, (e) provisions authorizing or validating conclusive or discretionary determinations, (f) provisions for the payment of attorneys fees where such payment is contrary to law or public policy and we call to your attention the provisions of Sections 1717 and 1717.5 of the California Civil Code, which limit and create obligations for the payment of attorneys fees, (g) provisions prohibiting, restricting, or requiring consent to assignment or transfer of any agreement, right or property, or the effect thereon of California Civil Code Section 711, (h) provisions for liquidated damages, default interest, late charges, monetary penalties, prepayment or make-whole premiums or other economic remedies to the extent such provisions are deemed to constitute a penalty, (i) provisions permitting, upon acceleration of any indebtedness (including the Shares), collection of that portion of the stated principal amount thereof which might be determined to constitute unearned interest thereon, and (j) the severability, if invalid, of provisions to the foregoing effect. 
 With your consent, except to the extent we have expressly opined as to such matters with respect to the Company herein, we have assumed (a) that the Sales Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the parties thereto, (b) the Confirmations shall be duly authorized, executed and delivered by the parties thereto in the form of the Form of Confirmation, (c) that the Sales Agreement and the Confirmations constitute legally valid and binding obligations of the parties thereto, enforceable against each of them in accordance with their respective terms, and (d) that the status of the Sales Agreement and Confirmations as legally valid and binding obligations of the parties is not affected by any (i) breaches of, or defaults under, agreements or instruments, (ii) violations of statutes, rules, regulations or court or governmental orders, or (iii) failures to obtain required consents, approvals or authorizations from, or make required registrations, declarations or filings with, governmental authorities. 
 This opinion is for your benefit in connection with the Registration Statement and may be relied upon by you and by persons entitled to rely upon it pursuant to the applicable provisions of the Act. We consent to your filing this opinion as an exhibit to the Company s Form 10-Q dated November 6, 2024 and to the reference to our firm contained in the prospectus for the offering of the Shares under the heading Legal Matters. In giving such consent, we do not thereby admit that we are in the category of persons whose consent is required under Section 7 of the Act or the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the Company engages an Agent as sales agent for the sale of Shares that would constitute a distribution within the meaning of Rule 100 of Regulation M under the Exchange Act, the Company and such Agent will agree to compensation for such Agent that is customary for such sales. For the avoidance of doubt, the compensation and commissions payable pursuant to this Section 2(d) all constitute consideration for services rendered and not consideration for the applicable Shares. 
 (e) If acting as sales agent hereunder, the applicable Agent shall provide written confirmation to the Company following the close of trading on the NYSE on each Trading Day on which Shares are sold under this Agreement setting forth the number of Shares sold on such day, the aggregate gross sales proceeds of the Shares, the aggregate Net Proceeds to the Company or the aggregate net proceeds to the applicable Forward Purchaser and the aggregate compensation payable by the Company to such Agent with respect to such sales. 
 (f) Under no circumstances shall the aggregate gross sales price for or number of, as the case may be, Shares offered or sold pursuant to this Agreement, or which are the subject of instructions to an Agent as sales agent pursuant to Section 2(b) hereof, exceed the aggregate gross sales price for or number of, as the case may be, Shares (i) referred to in the preamble paragraph of this Agreement, as reduced by prior sales of Shares under this Agreement, (ii) available for sale under the Registration Statement or (iii) duly authorized from time to time to be issued and sold under this Agreement by the Company or approved for listing on the NYSE. In addition, under no circumstances shall any Shares with respect to which the Agent acts as sales agent be offered or sold, or be the subject of instructions to an Agent as sales agent pursuant to Section 2(b) hereof, at a price lower than the minimum price therefor duly authorized from time to time by the Company and notified to the Agent(s) in writing (email shall constitute written notice for this Section 2(f)). The Agents shall have no responsibility for maintaining records with respect to Shares available for sale under the Registration Statement or for determining the aggregate gross sales price, number or minimum price of Shares duly authorized by the Company. 
 (g) If the exemptive provisions set forth in Rule 101(c)(1) of Regulation M under the Exchange Act are not satisfied with respect to the Company or the Shares, the Company shall promptly notify the Agents and future offers and sales of Shares through the Agents on an agented basis under this ATM Equity Offering Sales Agreement shall be suspended until that or other exemptive provisions have been satisfied in the judgment of each party. 
 (h) Settlement for sales of Shares will occur on the first business day that is also a Trading Day following the trade date on which such sales are made, unless another date shall be agreed to in writing by the Company and the applicable Agents (each such day, a Settlement Date ). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Confirmations shall be settled separately in accordance with their terms. On each Settlement Date for the sale of Shares through an Agent as sales agent of the Company, such Shares shall be delivered by the Company to such Agent in book-entry form to such Agent s account at The Depository Trust Company against payment by such Agent of the Net Proceeds from the sale of such Shares in same day funds delivered to an account designated by the Company. If the Company shall default on its obligation to deliver Shares through an Agent as sales agent of the Company on any Settlement Date, the Company shall (i) indemnify and hold such Agent harmless against any loss, claim or damage arising from or as a result of such default by the Company and (ii) pay such Agent any commission to which it would otherwise be entitled absent such default. 
 (i) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Company shall not offer or sell, or instruct an Agent to offer or sell, any Shares through an Agent as sales agent of the Company or as forward seller (and, by notice to the applicable Agents given by telephone (confirmed promptly by telecopy or email), shall cancel 
 11 

any instructions for any such offer or sale of any Shares prior to the commencement of the periods referenced below), and the Agents shall not be obligated to make any such offer or sale of Shares, during any period in which the Company is in possession of material non-public information. 
 (j) If the Company wishes to offer or sell Shares to an Agent as sales agent of the Company or as forward seller at any time during the period from and including the time the Company issues a press release containing, or shall otherwise publicly announce, its earnings, revenues or other operating results for a fiscal period or periods (each, an Earnings Announcement through and including the time that is 24 hours after the time that the Company files a Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or an Annual Report on Form 10-K that includes consolidated financial statements as of and for the same fiscal period or periods, as the case may be, covered by such Earnings Announcement, the Company shall first (i) prepare and deliver to such Agent and the applicable Forward Purchaser (with a copy to counsel for the Agents and the Forward Purchasers) a Current Report on Form 8-K that includes substantially the same financial and related information (together with management s discussion and analysis thereof) that was included in such Earnings Announcement (other than any earnings projections and similar forward-looking data and officers quotations) (each, an Earnings 8-K ), in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such Agent and Forward Purchaser, and, prior to its filing, obtain the written consent of such Agent and Forward Purchaser to such filing (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), (ii) provide such Agent with the officers certificate, opinions and letters of counsel and accountants letter specified in Section 3(o), (p) and (q), respectively, hereof, (iii) afford such Agent and Forward Purchaser the opportunity to conduct a due diligence review in accordance with Section 3(s) hereof prior to filing such Earnings 8-K and (iv) file such Earnings 8-K with the Commission. For purposes of clarity, the parties hereto agree that (A) the delivery of any officers certificate, opinion or letter of counsel or accountants letter pursuant to this Section 2(j) shall not relieve the Company from any of its obligations under this Agreement with respect to any Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or Annual Report on Form 10-K, as the case may be, including, without limitation, the obligation to deliver officers certificates, opinions and letters of counsel and accountants letters as provided in Section 3(o), (p) and (q), respectively, hereof unless such obligations have been waived hereunder, and (B) this Section 2(j) shall in no way affect or limit the operation of clause (i) of Section 2(i) hereof, which shall have independent application. 
 (k) The Agents shall not have any obligation to purchase Shares as principal, whether from the Company or otherwise, unless the Company and the applicable Agent(s) agree as set forth in this Section 2(k). Shares purchased from the Company by the applicable Agent(s), individually or in a syndicate, as principal shall be made in accordance with terms agreed upon between such Agent(s) and the Company as evidenced by a Terms Agreement. The applicable Agents commitment to purchase Shares from the Company as principal shall be deemed to have been made on the basis of the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company, and performance by the Company of its covenants and other obligations, herein contained and shall be subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth. At the time of each Terms Agreement, the applicable Agent(s) shall specify the requirements, if any, for the officers certificate, opinions and letters of counsel and accountants letter pursuant to Section 3(o), (p) and (q), respectively, hereof. In the event of a conflict between the terms of this ATM Equity Offering Sales Agreement and a Terms Agreement, the terms of such Terms Agreement shall control. 
 (l) As set out in the Confirmations and notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the event that either (i) a Forward Purchaser is unable to borrow and deliver any Shares for sale under this Agreement pursuant to the terms of such Confirmation, or (ii) in the commercially reasonable judgment of a Forward Purchaser, it is either impracticable to do so or the Forward Purchaser would incur a stock loan cost that is equal to or greater than the rate per annum set forth in Section 7(f)(i) of the applicable Confirmation, then the applicable Agent, as forward seller, shall be obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to sell only the aggregate number of Shares that such Forward Purchaser is able to, and that in the commercially reasonable judgment of such Forward Purchaser it is practicable to, so borrow below such cost. For the avoidance of doubt, any obligation hereunder with respect to the borrowing of or offer or sale of any Shares in connection with a forward stock purchase transaction shall be subject to the related Confirmation being effective and not having been terminated.

 (v) Ceasing Eligibility For Use of Automatic Shelf Registration Statement Form . If, at any time, during the term of this Agreement or otherwise when Shares purchased by an Agent as principal remain unsold, the Company receives a notice from the Commission pursuant to Rule 401(g)(2) or otherwise ceases to be eligible to use the automatic shelf registration statement form, the Company will (i) promptly notify the Agents and the Forward Purchasers, (ii) promptly file a new shelf registration statement or post-effective amendment on the proper form relating to such Shares, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Agents and the Forward Purchasers, (iii) use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause such new shelf registration statement or post-effective amendment

 (b) Indemnification of Company .

 (c) Actions against Parties Notification . Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement thereof but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party under such subsection to the extent it is not materially prejudiced as a result thereof and in any event shall not relieve it from any liability otherwise than under such subsection. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the 
 22 

indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation provided, however, that the Agents and Forward Purchasers shall have the right to employ counsel to represent jointly the Agents and Forward Purchasers and their respective directors, officers, employees, agents and controlling persons who may be subject to liability arising out of any claim in respect of which indemnity may be sought by the Agents or Forward Purchasers against the Company under this Section 6 if the Agents and Forward Purchasers shall have reasonably concluded that there may be one or more legal defenses available to the Agents and Forward Purchasers and their respective directors, officers, employees, agents and controlling persons that are different from or additional to those available to the Company and its officers, directors, employees and controlling persons and the Forward Purchasers shall have the right to employ counsel to represent jointly the Forward Purchasers and their respective directors, officers, employees, agents and controlling persons who may be subject to liability arising out of any claim in respect of which indemnity may be sought by the Forward Purchasers against the Company or any Agent under this Section 6 if the Forward Purchasers shall have reasonably concluded that there may be one or more legal defenses available to the Forward Purchasers and their respective directors, officers, employees, agents and controlling persons that are different from or additional to those available to the Company and its officers, directors, employees and controlling persons (if the indemnifying person is the Company) or different from or additional to those available to the Agents and their respective directors, officers, employees, agents and controlling persons (if the indemnifying person is any Agent), and in each case the fees and expenses of a single separate counsel for the Agents and their respective directors, officers, employees, agents and controlling persons (in addition to local counsel) shall be paid by the Company and the fees and expenses of a single separate counsel for the Forward Purchasers and their respective directors, officers, employees, agents and controlling persons (in addition to local counsel) shall be paid by the Company or the applicable Agent or Agents, as the case may be. The indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement or compromise of, or the consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification may be sought hereunder effected without the prior written consent of the indemnifying party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), but, if settled or compromised with the indemnifying party s consent, or if judgment shall be entered following consent to the entry of such judgment given with the indemnifying party s consent, or if there shall otherwise be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each indemnified party against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses, joint or several, by reason of such settlement, compromise or judgment, as the case may be. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and (ii) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party. 
 (d) Contribution . If the indemnification provided for in this Section 6 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand, and the applicable Agents and Forward Purchasers on the other, from the offering of the Shares. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law, or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under subsection (c) above, then in each case each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the applicable Agents and Forward Purchasers on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which 
 23 

resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the applicable Agents and Forward Purchasers on the other, in connection with the applicable offering of Shares, shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as (x) in the case of the Company, the total net proceeds from the offering of the Shares(before deducting expenses) received by the Company (such total net proceeds shall include the total proceeds that would be received by the Company pursuant to any Confirmations assuming full physical settlement of such Confirmations assuming the aggregate amount payable by such Forward Purchaser to the Company for such Confirmation Shares is equal to the aggregate amount of net proceeds received by such Forward Purchaser from the sale of such Shares through such Agent), (y) in the case of the Agents, the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Agents from the offering of the Shares and (z) in the case of the Forward Purchasers, the aggregate Spread (as defined in the Confirmations) retained by the Forward Purchasers under the Confirmations, net of any costs associated therewith, as reasonably determined by the Forward Purchasers, bear to an amount equal to the sum of the amounts set forth in (x), (y) and (z) above. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or the Agents or Forward Purchasers on the other and the parties relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company, the Agents and Forward Purchasers agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Agents and the Forward Purchasers were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Agent shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total commissions or underwriting discounts received by such Agent in connection with Shares placed or underwritten by it for sale to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Agent has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the Agent and Forward Purchasers in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in proportion to their respective obligations and not joint. 
 (e) Directors, Officers, Employees and Agents . The obligations of the Company under this Section 6 shall be in addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each director, officer, employee and agent of any Agent or Forward Purchaser and each person, if any, who controls any Agent or Forward Purchaser within the meaning of the Securities Act and the obligations of the Agents and Forward Purchasers under this Section 6 shall be in addition to any liability which the respective Agents and Forward Purchasers may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each officer, director and employee of the Company, and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act. 
 Section 7. Reserved. 
 Section 8. Representations, Warranties and Agreements to Survive . All representations, warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement or in certificates of officers of the Company or any of its subsidiaries submitted pursuant hereto, shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any investigation made by or on behalf of an Agent, a Forward Purchaser or their respective affiliates, selling agents, officers or directors or any person controlling such Agent or Forward Purchaser, or the Company or its officers or directors, or any person controlling the Company and (ii) delivery of and payment for the Shares. 
 Section 9. Termination . 
 24 

(a) This ATM Equity Offering Sales Agreement may be terminated for any reason, at any time, by either the Company, an Agent or Forward Purchaser, as to itself, upon giving prior written notice to the other parties hereto. 
 (b) The applicable Agents may terminate a Terms Agreement to which they are a party, at any time at or prior to the Settlement Date, (i) if, since the time of execution of such Terms Agreement or since the respective dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, (a) the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, have sustained, since the date of the latest audited financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package or the Prospectus, any material loss or interference with its business from fire, explosion, flood or other calamity, whether or not covered by insurance, or from any labor dispute or court or governmental action, order or decree, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Registration Statement, the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, or (b) since the respective dates as of which information is given in the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, there has been any material change in the capital stock or long-term debt of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any material adverse change, or any development involving a prospective material adverse change, in or affecting the general affairs, management or consolidated financial position, shareholders equity or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in each case otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the General Disclosure Package and the Prospectus, the effect of which, in any such case described in this clause (i)(a) or (i)(b), is in the judgment of the applicable Agents so material and adverse to the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as to make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or delivery of the Shares subject to such Terms Agreement, or (ii) if a suspension or material limitation in trading in securities generally on the NYSE or the Nasdaq Global Market occurs, or (iii) if a suspension or material limitation in trading in the Company s securities on the NYSE occurs, or (iv) if a general moratorium on commercial banking activities declared by either Federal or New York or California State authorities or a material disruption in commercial banking or securities settlements or clearance services in the United States occurs, or (v) if the outbreak or escalation of hostilities involving the United States of a national emergency or war, or other calamity or crisis or any change or development involving a prospective change in national or international political, financial or economic conditions occurs, if the effect of any such event specified in this clause (v) in the judgement of such applicable Agents (A) is material and adverse and (B) makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offering or delivery of the Shares subject to such Terms Agreement. 
 (c) If the Company and two or more Agents enter into a Terms Agreement pursuant to which such Agents agree to purchase Shares from the Company as principal and one or more of such Agents shall fail at the Settlement Date to purchase the Shares which it or they are obligated to purchase (the Defaulted Shares ), then the nondefaulting Agents shall have the right, within 24 hours thereafter, to make arrangements for one of them or one or more other Agents or underwriters to purchase all, but not less than all, of the Defaulted Shares in such amounts as may be agreed upon and upon the terms set forth herein and in the applicable Terms Agreement provided, however, that if such arrangements shall not have been completed within such 24-hour period, then 
 (i) if the number of Defaulted Shares does not exceed 10 of the number of Shares to be so purchased by all of such Agents on the Settlement Date, the nondefaulting Agents shall be obligated, severally and not jointly, to purchase the full amount thereof in the proportions that their respective initial purchase obligation bears to the purchase obligations of all nondefaulting Agents or 
 (ii) if the number of Defaulted Shares exceeds 10 of the number of Shares to be so purchased by all of such Agents on the Settlement Date, such Terms Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any nondefaulting Agent. 
 No action taken pursuant to this Section 9(c) shall relieve any defaulting Agent from liability in respect of its default.

SEMPRA 
 YEAR LONG TERM INCENTIVE PLAN 
 
 Year YEAR Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement 
 Award You have been granted a restricted stock unit award under Sempra s YEAR Long Term Incentive Plan (the Plan ). The award consists of the number of restricted stock units set forth on the Cover Page Summary to this Award Agreement, and dividend equivalents with respect to the restricted stock units (described below). Capitalized terms used in this Award Agreement and not defined shall have the meaning set forth in the Plan. 
 Your restricted stock units represent the right to receive shares of Common Stock in the future, subject to the terms and conditions of your award. Your restricted stock units are not shares of Common Stock. 
 Each restricted stock unit represents the right to receive one share of Common Stock upon the vesting of the unit. 
 Unless and until they vest, your restricted stock units and any dividend equivalents will be subject to transfer restrictions and forfeiture and vesting conditions. 
 Subject to certain exceptions set forth herein, your restricted stock units (and dividend equivalents) will be forfeited effective immediately following such termination if your employment terminates before they vest provided, however, that the Compensation and Talent Development Committee of Sempra s Board of Directors (the Compensation Committee ), in its sole discretion, may determine to vest you in all or a portion of such restricted stock units (subject to Code Section 409A requirements and the terms of the Plan). 
 See Vesting Forfeiture, Transfer Restrictions, and Termination of Employment below. 
 Vesting Forfeiture Subject to the provisions below relating to the treatment of your restricted stock units in connection with a Change in Control, your restricted stock units (and dividend equivalents) will vest in equal annual installments of one-fourth of the original number of units covered by this award (together with related dividend equivalents) on each of the first New York Stock Exchange trading days of YEAR , YEAR , YEAR and YEAR for awards granted on the first New York Stock Exchange trading day of the year or first four anniversaries of the award date for awards not granted on the first New York Stock Exchange trading day of the year, unless a different vesting schedule is approved by the Compensation Committee , subject to your continued employment by Sempra or its Subsidiaries through the applicable vesting date and the terms of this Award Agreement. 
 Certificates for the shares will be transferred to your brokerage account unless you specifically instruct otherwise. When the shares of Common Stock are issued to you, your restricted stock units (vested and unvested) and your dividend equivalents will terminate. 
 Transfer Restrictions You may not sell or otherwise transfer or assign your restricted stock units (or your dividend equivalents). 

Dividend Equivalents & Capitalization Adjustments You also have been awarded dividend equivalents with respect to your restricted stock units. Your dividend equivalents represent the right to receive additional shares of Common Stock in the future, subject to the terms and conditions of your award. Your dividend equivalents will be determined based on the dividends that you would have received had you held shares of Common Stock equal to the vested number of your restricted stock units from the date of your award to the date of the distribution of shares of Common Stock following the vesting of your restricted stock units, and assuming that the dividends were reinvested in Common Stock (and any dividends on such shares were reinvested in Common Stock). The dividends will be deemed reinvested in Common Stock in the same manner as dividends reinvested pursuant to the terms of the Sempra Direct Stock Purchase Plan (also known as the Sempra Dividend Reinvestment Plan). 
 Your dividend equivalents will be subject to the same transfer restrictions, forfeiture and recoupment provisions, and vesting conditions as your restricted stock units. They will vest when and to the extent that your restricted stock units vest. 
 Also, your restricted stock units (and dividend equivalents), including the terms and conditions thereof, will, in the sole discretion of the Compensation Committee, be substituted or adjusted, as applicable, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Plan. Any additional restricted stock units (and dividend equivalents) awarded to you as a result of such substitution or adjustment also will be subject to the same transfer restrictions, forfeiture and recoupment provisions, and vesting conditions and other terms and conditions that are applicable to your restricted stock units (and dividend equivalents). 
 No Shareholder Rights Your restricted stock units (and dividend equivalents) are not shares of Common Stock. You will have no rights as a shareholder unless and until shares of Common Stock are issued to you following the vesting of your restricted stock units (and dividend equivalents) as provided in this Award Agreement and the Plan. 
 Distribution of Shares Following the vesting of your restricted stock units, you will receive the number of shares of Common Stock equal to the number of your restricted stock units that have vested. However, in no event will you receive under this award, and other awards granted to you under the Plan in the same fiscal year of Sempra, more than the maximum number of shares of Common Stock permitted under the Plan. Also, you will receive the number of shares of Common Stock equal to your vested dividend equivalents. 
 You will receive the shares as soon as reasonably practicable following each vesting date (and in no event later than March 15 of the year following the applicable vesting date). Once you receive the shares of Common Stock, your restricted stock units (and dividend equivalents) will terminate. 
 Termination of Employment Termination 
 If your employment with Sempra and its Subsidiaries terminates for any reason other than by reason of your death or in connection with a Change in Control prior to the vesting of your restricted stock units (and dividend equivalents), all of your restricted stock units (and dividend equivalents) will be forfeited effective immediately following such termination provided, however, that the Compensation Committee in its sole discretion may determine to vest you in all or a portion of such restricted stock units (subject to Code Section 409A requirements and the terms of the Plan). If your employment terminates by reason of your death prior to the vesting of your restricted stock units (and dividend equivalents), all of your restricted stock units (and dividend equivalents) will vest upon your death. 
 
 2 

Termination for Cause 
 If your employment with Sempra and its Subsidiaries terminates for cause, or your employment would have been subject to termination for cause, prior to the vesting of your restricted stock units (and dividend equivalents), all of your restricted stock units (and dividend equivalents) will be forfeited effective immediately following such termination. 
 Prior to the consummation of a Change in Control, a termination for cause is (i) the willful failure by you to substantially perform your duties with Sempra or your employer (other than any such failure resulting from your incapacity due to physical or mental illness), (ii) the grossly negligent performance of such obligations referenced in clause (i) of this definition, (iii) your gross insubordination and or (iv) your commission of one or more acts of moral turpitude that constitute a violation of applicable law (including but not limited to a felony) which have or result in an adverse effect on Sempra, monetarily or otherwise, or one or more significant acts of dishonesty. For purposes of clause (i), no act, or failure to act, on your part shall be deemed willful unless done, or omitted to be done, by you not in good faith and without reasonable belief that your act, or failure to act, was in the best interests of Sempra and its Subsidiaries. If your restricted stock units remain outstanding following a Change in Control pursuant to a Replacement Award, a termination for cause following such Change in Control shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Plan that define Cause , including reasonable notice and, if possible, a reasonable opportunity to cure as provided therein. 
 Taxes Withholding Taxes 
 When you become subject to withholding taxes upon distribution of the shares of Common Stock or otherwise, Sempra or its Subsidiary is required to withhold taxes. Unless you instruct otherwise and pay or make arrangements satisfactory to Sempra to pay these taxes, upon the distribution of your shares, Sempra will withhold a sufficient number of shares of common stock that you would otherwise be entitled to receive to cover the minimum required withholding taxes and transfer to you only the remaining balance of your shares. In the event that, following a Change in Control, your restricted stock units become eligible for a distribution upon your Retirement by reason of your combined age and service, your restricted stock units may become subject to employment tax withholding prior to the distribution of shares with respect to such units. 
 Code Section 409A 
 
 Recoupment 
 Your restricted stock units are subject to provisions of the Plan which set forth terms to comply with Code Section 409A. 
 Sempra reserves the right to recoup the compensation received in connection with your award of restricted stock units (i) as required by applicable law or the rules or requirements of the primary national securities exchange on which Sempra s common stock is listed, (ii) as required by the compensation recovery policy implemented or maintained by Sempra Compensation Recovery Policy or (iii) if your fraudulent or intentional misconduct is found, in the sole discretion of the Compensation Committee, to have materially affected the operations or financial results of Sempra or its Subsidiaries. 
 Retention Rights Neither your restricted stock unit award nor this Award Agreement gives you any right to be retained by Sempra or any of its Subsidiaries in any capacity and your employer reserves the right to terminate your employment at any time, with or without cause. The value of your award will not be included as compensation or earnings for purposes of any other benefit plan offered by Sempra or any of its Subsidiaries. 
 
 3 

Change in Control In the event of a Change in Control, the following terms shall apply 
 If (i) you have achieved age 55 and have completed at least five years of continuous service with Sempra and its Subsidiaries as of the date of a Change in Control and your restricted stock units have not been forfeited prior to the Change in Control, (ii) your outstanding restricted stock units as of the date of a Change in Control are not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture within the meaning of Code Section 409A and or (iii) your outstanding restricted stock units are not assumed or substituted with one or more Replacement Awards (as defined in the Plan), then in each case your outstanding restricted stock units and any associated dividend equivalents will vest immediately prior to the Change in Control. If the foregoing terms apply, immediately prior to the date of the Change in Control you will receive a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the number of your restricted stock units and dividend equivalents that have vested. 
 If your outstanding restricted stock awards are assumed or substituted with one or more Replacement Awards, then, except as provided otherwise in an individual severance agreement or employment agreement to which you are a party, the terms set forth in the Plan shall apply with respect to such Replacement Award following the Change in Control. If the foregoing terms apply and the Replacement Award vests upon your separation from service or death, on such date, you will receive a number of shares or other property in settlement of the Replacement Awards. 
 Further Actions You agree to take all actions and execute all documents appropriate to carry out the provisions of this Award Agreement. 
 You shall be deemed to have accepted this award unless you affirmatively reject it in writing addressed to the Corporate Secretary of Sempra no later than 90 days following the Date of Award. 
 You also appoint as your attorney-in-fact each individual who at the time of so acting is the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of Sempra with full authority to effect any transfer of any shares of Common Stock distributable to you, including any transfer to pay withholding taxes, that is authorized by this Award Agreement. 
 Applicable Law This Award Agreement will be interpreted and enforced under the laws of the State of California. 
 Other Agreements In the event of any conflict between the terms of this Award Agreement and any written employment, severance or other employment-related agreement between you and Sempra, the terms of this Award Agreement, or the terms of such other agreement, whichever are more favorable to you, shall prevail, provided that in each case a conflict shall be resolved in a manner consistent with the intent that your restricted stock units comply with Code Section 409A. In the event of a conflict between the terms of this Award Agreement and the Plan, the Plan document shall prevail. In the event of a conflict between the terms of this Award Agreement and Sempra s Compensation Recovery Policy, the terms of the Compensation Recovery Policy shall prevail. 
 
 By your acceptance of this award, you agree to all of the terms and conditions set forth in the Cover Page Summary, this Award Agreement and the Plan. You will be deemed to have accepted this award unless you affirmatively reject the award in accordance with the procedures described herein.
