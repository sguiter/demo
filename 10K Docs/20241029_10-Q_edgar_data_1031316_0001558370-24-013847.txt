 to of collected rents and the applicable contracts are cancellable with notice. Asset management fee income from non-consolidated entities amounted to approximately and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Prior to the consolidation of Monument Circle on January 1, 2023, the Company held the Sponsored REIT Loan, which was reported in the balance sheet as a related party mortgage loan receivable. The Company reviewed the need for an allowance under the current expected credit loss model for the Sponsored REIT Loan at each reporting period. The measurement of expected credit losses was based upon historical experiences, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affected the collectability of the reported amount. The Company elected to apply the practical expedient for financial assets secured by collateral in instances where the borrower was experiencing financial difficulty and repayment of the Sponsored REIT Loan was expected to be provided substantially through operation or sale of the collateral. The Company used the fair value of the collateral at the reporting date, and an adjustment to the allowance for expected credit losses was recorded when the amortized cost basis of the financial asset exceeded the fair value of the collateral, less costs to sell. The Company regularly evaluated the extent and impact of any credit deterioration that could affect performance and the value of the secured property, as well as the financial and operating capability of the borrower. A property s fair value, operating results and existing cash balances were considered and used to assess whether cash flows from operations were sufficient to cover the current and future operating and debt service requirements. The Company also evaluated the borrower s competency in managing and operating the secured property and considered the overall economic environment, real estate sector and geographic sub-market in which the secured property is located. The Company applied normal loan review and underwriting procedures (as may be implemented or modified from time to time) in making that judgment. The outstanding Sponsored REIT Loan is secured by a mortgage on the underlying property and the balances within the borrower s cash accounts. 

The Company recognized interest income and fees from the Sponsored REIT Loan for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. On October 29, 2021, the Company agreed to amend and restate the then existing Sponsored REIT Loan to extend the maturity date from December 6, 2022 to June 30, 2023 and to advance an additional million tranche of indebtedness to FSP Monument Circle LLC with the same June 30, 2023 maturity date, effectively increasing the aggregate principal amount of the Sponsored REIT Loan from million to million. In addition, the Company agreed to defer all principal and interest payments due under the Sponsored REIT Loan until the maturity date. As part of its consideration for agreeing to amend and restate the Sponsored REIT Loan, the Company obtained from the stockholders of the parent of Monument Circle the right to vote their shares in favor of any sale of the property owned by Monument Circle any time on or after January 1, 2023. There were no commitments to lend additional funds to the Sponsored REIT. On June 26, 2023, the Sponsored REIT Loan maturity was extended to September 30, 2023. On September 26, 2023, the Sponsored REIT Loan maturity was extended to September 30, 2024. On September 27, 2024, the Sponsored REIT Loan maturity was extended to September 30, 2025. The Company recorded a million decrease in its provision for credit losses during the three months ended March 31, 2023. The change in the allowance for credit losses during the three months ended March 31, 2023 was due to the consolidation of Monument Circle. There were adjustments during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The following table presents a roll-forward of the Company s allowance for credit losses.

The Original Note Purchase Agreement, as amended by the NPA First Amendment, is referred to as the Note Purchase Agreement. On February 21, 2024, as part of the NPA First Amendment, the Company repaid an approximately million portion of the Series A Notes and an approximately million portion of the Series B Notes. On July 10, 2024, the Company repaid an approximately million portion of the Series A Notes and an approximately million portion of the Series B Notes from asset sale proceeds of a property located in Glen Allen, Virginia. As of September 30, 2024, approximately million aggregate principal amount of the Series A Notes remained outstanding and approximately million aggregate principal amount of the Series B Notes remained outstanding. As of September 30, 2024, the interest rate on the Series A Notes was per annum and the interest rate on the Series B Notes was per annum. As of December 31, 2023, the interest rate on the Series A Notes was per annum and the interest rate on the Series B Notes was per annum.

 million as a result of such terminations, of which approximately million related to interest receivable. As of September 30, 2024, there were derivative instruments. The 2019 BMO Interest Rate Swap qualified as a cash flow hedge and has been recognized on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value. If a derivative qualifies as a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged asset, liability, or firm commitment through earnings, or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The ineffective portion of a derivative s change in fair value will be recognized in earnings in the same period in which the hedged interest payments affect earnings, which may increase or decrease reported net income and stockholders equity prospectively, depending on future levels of interest rates and other variables affecting the fair values of derivative instruments and hedged items, but will have no effect on cash flows. The gain (loss) on the Company s 2019 BMO Interest Rate Swap was recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) (OCI), and the accompanying consolidated statements of operations as a component of interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, was as follows: Amounts of previously recorded gain (loss) reclassified from OCI into Interest Expense Total amount of Interest Expense presented in the consolidated statements of operations Over time, the realized gains in accumulated other comprehensive income were reclassified into earnings as a decrease to interest expense in the same periods in which the hedged interest payments affected earnings.

The Plan is an equity-based incentive compensation plan and provides for the grants of up to a maximum of shares of the Company s common stock Awards ). All of the Company s employees, officers, directors, consultants and advisors are eligible to be granted Awards. Awards under the Plan are made at the discretion of the Company s Board of Directors, and have vesting requirements. Upon granting an Award, the Company will recognize compensation cost equal to the fair value of the Company s common stock, as determined by the Company s Board of Directors, on the date of the grant. On May 31, 2024 and May 18, 2023, the Company granted shares under the Plan to non-employee directors with the compensation cost related to such grants indicated in the table below, which was recognized during the three months ended June 30, 2024 and year ended December 31, 2023, respectively, and is included in general and administrative expenses for such periods.

FSP Investments LLC and FSP Protective TRS Corp. are the Company s taxable REIT subsidiaries operating as taxable corporations under the Code. The TRSs have gross amounts of net operating losses NOLs available to those taxable corporations of million and million as of December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. The NOLs created prior to 2018 will expire between 2030 and 2047 and the NOLs generated after 2017 will not expire. A valuation allowance is provided for the full amount of the NOLs as the realization of any tax benefits from such NOLs is not assured. Income taxes are recorded based on the future tax effects of the difference between the tax and financial reporting bases of the Company s assets and liabilities. In estimating future tax consequences, potential future events are considered except for potential changes in income tax law or in rates. The Company adopted an accounting pronouncement related to uncertainty in income taxes effective January 1, 2007, which did not result in recording a liability, nor was any accrued interest and penalties recognized with the adoption. Accrued interest and penalties will be recorded as income tax expense, if the Company records a liability in the future. The Company s effective tax rate was not affected by the adoption. The Company and one or more of its subsidiaries files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state jurisdictions. The statute of limitations for the Company s income tax returns is generally and as such, the Company s returns that remain subject to examination would be primarily from 2020 and thereafter. Net operating losses Section 382 of the Code restricts a corporation s ability to use net operating losses NOLs to offset future taxable income following certain ownership changes. Such ownership changes occurred with past mergers and accordingly a portion of the NOLs incurred by the Company s prior sponsored REITs available for use by the Company in any particular future taxable year will be limited. To the extent that the Company does not utilize the full amount of the annual NOLs limit, the unused amount may be carried forward to offset taxable income in future years. NOLs expire after the year in which they arise, and the last of the Company s NOLs will expire in 2027. Approximately million of NOLs expired in 2023. A valuation allowance is provided for the full amount of the gross NOLs available as the realization of any tax benefits remaining from such NOLs is not assured. The gross amount of NOLs available to the Company was approximately million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Income Tax Expense The Company is subject to a business tax known as the Revised Texas Franchise Tax. Some of the Company s leases allow reimbursement by tenants for these amounts because the Revised Texas Franchise Tax replaces a portion of the property tax for school districts. Because the tax base on the Revised Texas Franchise Tax is derived from an income based measure, it is considered an income tax. The Company recorded a provision for the Revised Texas Franchise Tax of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The income tax expense reflected in the consolidated statements of operations relates primarily to a franchise tax on the Company s Texas properties. Other Taxes Tax expense Taxes on income are a current tax expense. deferred income taxes were provided as there were no material temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the TRSs.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Historical results and percentage relationships set forth in the consolidated financial statements, including trends which might appear, should not be taken as necessarily indicative of future operations. The following discussion and other parts of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may also contain forward-looking statements based on current judgments and current knowledge of management, which are subject to certain risks, trends and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in such forward-looking statements. Accordingly, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Investors are cautioned that our forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainty, including without limitation, adverse changes in general economic or local market conditions, including the impact of recessionary concerns, inflation, energy prices and interest rates, as well as those resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, and the impact of work-from-home and return-to-work policies, and other potential infectious disease outbreaks and terrorist attacks or other acts of violence, which may negatively affect the markets in which we and our tenants operate, our inability to extend and/or refinance our debt or effect asset sales sufficient to repay such debt prior to the maturity dates thereof, adverse changes in energy prices, which if sustained, could negatively impact occupancy and rental rates in the markets in which we own properties, including energy-influenced markets such as Dallas, Denver and Houston, expectations for future potential property dispositions, expectations for future potential leasing activity, expectations for the potential payment of special dividends, changes in interest rates as a result of economic market conditions, disruptions in the debt markets, economic conditions in the markets in which we own properties, risks of a lessening of demand for the types of real estate owned by us, uncertainties relating to fiscal policy, changes in government regulations and regulatory uncertainty, geopolitical events, and expenditures that cannot be anticipated such as utility rate and usage increases, delays in construction schedules, unanticipated increases in construction costs, unanticipated repairs, increases in the level of general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues as revenues decrease as a result of property dispositions, additional staffing, insurance increases and real estate tax valuation reassessments. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Although we believe the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. We may not update any of the forward-looking statements after the date this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q is filed to conform them to actual results or to changes in our expectations that occur after such date, other than as required by law. Overview FSP Corp., or we or the Company, operates in a single reportable segment: real estate operations. The real estate operations market involves real estate rental operations, leasing, secured financing of real estate and services provided for asset management, property management, property acquisitions, dispositions and development. Our current strategy is to focus on infill and central business district office properties in the United States sunbelt and mountain west regions as well as select opportunistic markets. We believe that the United States sunbelt and mountain west regions have macro-economic drivers that have the potential to increase occupancies and rents. We are focused on long-term growth and appreciation, as well as current income. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 4.8 million square feet, or approximately 92.8 of our total owned and consolidated portfolio, was located in Dallas, Denver, Houston and Minneapolis. The main factor that affects our real estate operations is the broad economic market conditions in the United States. These market conditions affect the occupancy levels and the rent levels on both a national and local level. We have no influence on broader economic market conditions. In the future, we may look to acquire and/or develop quality properties in good locations in order to lessen the impact of downturns in the market and to take advantage of upturns when they occur. We continue to believe that the current price of our common stock does not accurately reflect the value of our underlying real estate assets and we will seek to increase shareholder value by (1) pursuing the sale of select properties where we believe that short to intermediate term valuation potential has been reached and (2) striving to lease vacant space. As we continue to execute this strategy, our revenue, Funds From Operations, and capital expenditures may decrease in the short term. Proceeds from dispositions are intended to be used primarily for the repayment of debt.

 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the year ended December 31, 2023, our disposition strategy resulted in aggregate gross sale proceeds of 66.0 million and 154.5 million, respectively. In July 2022, we adopted a variable quarterly dividend policy, which replaced our previous regular quarterly dividend policy. Under the variable quarterly dividend policy, the Board of Directors determines quarterly dividends based upon a variety of factors, including the Company s estimates of its annual taxable income and the amount that the Company is required to distribute annually in the aggregate to enable the Company to continue to qualify as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes. As more fully described in Note 3 Bank Note Payable, Term Loans Payable and Senior Notes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report and in Liquidity and Capital Resources below, on February 21, 2024, we entered into amendments to each of the BofA Term Loan, BMO Term Loan, Series A Notes and Series B Notes (each as defined in Note 3 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report) to extend the maturity dates of each facility and modify the interest rate payable under each facility and in connection with such amendments, repaid an aggregate of 102 million principal amount of debt. On July 10, 2024, we used proceeds from the sale of a property in Glen Allen, Virginia to repay an aggregate of approximately 25.3 million of principal amount of debt. The credit rating for our senior unsecured debt was downgraded by Moody s Investor Service from Ba1 to Ba3 on April 12, 2023, and from Ba3 to B3 on June 14, 2023, which continues to be the rating as of September 30, 2024. As of February 21, 2024, the interest rate applicable to borrowings under the Senior Notes ceased to be based on the rating of our debt. Trends and Uncertainties Long-Term Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic Considerable uncertainty still surrounds the long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and its potential effects on the population, including the spread of more contagious variants of the virus, and on the commercial real estate market and our business. Many of our tenants still do not fully occupy the space that they lease. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to present material uncertainty and risk with respect to the performance of our properties and our financial results, such as the potential negative impact to the businesses of our tenants, the impact of work-from-home and return-to-work policies, the potential negative impact to leasing efforts and occupancy at our properties, uncertainty regarding future rent collection levels or requests for rent concessions from our tenants, the occurrence of a default under any of our debt agreements, the potential for increased borrowing costs, negative impacts on our ability to refinance existing indebtedness or to secure new sources of capital on favorable terms, fluctuations in our level of dividends, increased costs of operations, making more difficult our ability to complete required capital expenditures in a timely manner and on budget, decreases in values of our real estate assets, changes in law and/or regulation, and uncertainty regarding government and regulatory policy. We are unable to estimate the full extent of the long-term impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our future financial results at this time. See Risk Factors in Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Economic Conditions Although recent indicators suggest that economic activity has expanded at a modest pace, the global economy continues to experience significant disruptions as a result of various factors, including geopolitical events such as the ongoing wars between Russia and Ukraine, between Israel and Hamas, a U.S. designated foreign Terrorist Organization, in the Gaza Strip, and between Israel and Hezbollah, a U.S. designated Foreign Terrorist Organization, in Lebanon and ongoing conflicts in various other parts of the Middle East, increasing tensions with China and Iran, the long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and continuing supply chain difficulties. In addition, various economic factors, including but not limited to, inflation and interest rates, are contributing to recessionary concerns for the economy of the United States. Economic conditions directly affect the demand for office space, our primary income producing asset. In addition, the broad economic market conditions in the United States are typically affected by numerous other factors, including but not limited to, employment levels, energy prices, uncertainty about government fiscal, monetary, trade and tax policies, changes in currency exchange rates, the regulatory environment and the availability of credit. During 2023 and 2024, the Federal Reserve adjusted the federal funds rate target several times, most recently decreasing it by 50 basis points on September 18, 2024, to a 

 22 

Table of Contents 
 range of 4.75 to 5.0 . If interest rates increase, then the interest costs on our unhedged variable rate debt would be adversely affected, which could in turn adversely affect our cash flow, our ability to pay principal and interest on our debt and our ability to make distributions to stockholders. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 50.6 of our total debt constituted unhedged variable rate debt. Increased interest rates could also decrease the amount third parties are willing to pay for our assets and limit our ability to incur new debt or refinance existing debt when it matures. As of the date of this report, the impact of current economic conditions and geopolitical events and the long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic are adversely affecting the demand for office space in the United States. Real Estate Operations As of September 30, 2024, our real estate portfolio was comprised of 15 owned properties, which we refer to as our owned properties, and a non-controlling common stock interest in the corporation that is the sole member of FSP Monument Circle LLC, which corporation was organized to operate as a real estate investment trust, which we refer to as the Sponsored REIT. The Sponsored REIT, which we also refer to as Monument Circle, was consolidated effective January 1, 2023. We refer to these 16 properties as our owned and consolidated properties. Our owned properties were approximately 70.4 leased as of September 30, 2024, a decrease from 74.0 leased as of December 31, 2023. The 3.6 decrease in leased space was primarily a result of lease maturities that occurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and the impact on leased percentage from the disposition of a properties on January 26, 2024 and July 8, 2024, respectively. These decreases were partially offset by new leasing during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 1,469,000 square feet of vacancy in our owned properties compared to approximately 1,445,000 square feet of vacancy at December 31, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we leased approximately 364,000 square feet of office space in our owned properties, of which approximately 242,000 square feet were with existing tenants, at a weighted average term of 5.4 years. On average, tenant improvements for such leases were 25.30 per square foot, lease commissions were 7.83 per square foot and rent concessions were approximately four months of free rent. Average GAAP base rents under such leases were 29.94 per square foot, or 10.9 higher than average rents in the respective properties as applicable compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. Our owned and consolidated properties were approximately 67.7 and 72.4 leased, as of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, leases for approximately 1.5 and 8.4 of the square footage in our owned and consolidated properties are scheduled to expire during 2024 and 2025, respectively. As the fourth quarter of 2024 begins, we believe that our operating properties are stabilized, with a balanced lease expiration schedule, and existing vacancy is being actively marketed to numerous potential tenants. While leasing activity at our properties has continued, we believe that the impact of geopolitical events, current economic conditions and the long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may limit or delay new tenant leasing during at least the fourth quarter of 2024 and potentially in future periods. While we cannot generally predict when an existing vacancy in our owned properties will be leased or if existing tenants with expiring leases will renew their leases or what the terms and conditions of the lease renewals will be, we expect to renew or sign new leases at then-current market rates for locations in which the buildings are located, which could be above or below the expiring rates. Also, we believe the potential exists for any of our tenants to default on its lease or to seek the protection of bankruptcy. If any of our tenants defaults on its lease, we may experience delays in enforcing our rights as a landlord and may incur substantial costs in protecting our investment. In addition, at any time, a tenant of one of our properties may seek the protection of bankruptcy laws, which could result in the rejection and termination of such tenant s lease and thereby cause a reduction in cash available for distribution to our stockholders. Consolidation of Sponsored REIT As of January 1, 2023, we consolidated Monument Circle into our financial statements. On October 29, 2021, we agreed to amend and restate our existing loan to Monument Circle that is secured by a mortgage on real estate owned by Monument Circle, which we refer to as the Sponsored REIT Loan. The amended and restated Sponsored REIT Loan extended the maturity date from December 6, 2022 to June 30, 2023, increased the aggregate principal amount of the loan from 21 million to 24 million, and included certain other modifications. In consideration of our agreement to amend and restate the Sponsored REIT Loan, we obtained from the stockholders of Monument Circle the right to vote their shares in favor of any

Table of Contents 
 sale of the property owned by Monument Circle any time on or after January 1, 2023. As a result of our obtaining this right to vote shares, GAAP variable interest entity (VIE) rules required us to consolidate Monument Circle as of January 1, 2023. A gain on consolidation of approximately 0.4 million was recognized in the three months ended March 31, 2023. On June 26, 2023, the Sponsored REIT Loan maturity was initially extended to September 30, 2023 and on September 26, 2023 was further extended to September 30, 2024. On September 27, 2024, the Sponsored REIT Loan maturity was extended to September 30, 2025. Additional information about the consolidation of Monument Circle is incorporated herein by reference to Note 1, Organization, Properties, Basis of Presentation, Financial Instruments, and Recent Accounting Standards Variable Interest Entities (VIEs) and Note 2, Related Party Transactions and Investments in Non-Consolidated Entities - Management fees and interest income from loans , in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report. Dispositions of Properties and Assets Held for Sale In the three months ended March 31, 2023, we sold an office property located in Elk Grove, Illinois for a sales price of 29.1 million, at a gain of approximately 8.4 million. During the three months ended June 30, 2023, we entered into an agreement to sell a property in Charlotte, North Carolina at an expected loss of 0.8 million, which was recorded as an impairment, and we classified the property as an asset held for sale as of June 30, 2023. The property was sold on August 9, 2023, for a sales price of 9.2 million, at a loss of 0.8 million, which had been our expected loss. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded a gain on sale of 53,000 as a result of conveying approximately 7,826 square feet of land at our Addison, Texas property to the Town of Addison as part of a road revitalization project. In addition, during the three months ended September 30, 2023, we executed purchase and sale agreements with four different unrelated purchasers for the potential sale of four properties. Three of these potential dispositions were classified as assets held for sale as of September 30, 2023. On October 26, 2023, we completed the sale of one of the assets held for sale as of September 30, 2023, an office building located in Plano, Texas for a sales price of 48.0 million at a gain of approximately 10.6 million. On December 6, 2023, we sold another of the assets held for sale, an office property located in Miami, Florida for a sales price of 68.0 million at a loss of approximately 18.9 million. The one remaining asset held for sale was expected to sell for a sales price of 40.0 million at a loss of approximately 20.5 million, which was recorded as an impairment as of September 30, 2023; however, on November 15, 2023, we received notice from the buyer indicating that the buyer was terminating the transaction and directing the deposit and interest be disbursed to us. During the three months September 30, 2024, the expected loss on this property was increased by 6.6 million after the Company entered into a new agreement to sell the property for a gross sales price of 34.0 million. The property was sold on October 23, 2024. During the three months ended December 31, 2023, we executed a purchase and sale agreement to sell a property located in Richardson, Texas for 35 million at an expected loss of approximately 2.1 million, which had been recorded as an impairment as of December 31, 2023. On January 26, 2024, we sold the office property located in Richardson, Texas for a sales price of 35 million. The property was classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2023 and an impairment of 2.1 million had been recorded during the year ended December 31, 2023. An additional 5,000 of costs related to the sale were recorded during the three months ended March 31, 2024. We used the proceeds from the disposition primarily for the repayment of debt. During the three months ended June 30, 2024, the Company entered into an agreement to sell a property in Glen Allen, Virginia for a gross sales price of approximately 31.0 million and an expected loss of 13.2 million, which was recorded as an impairment as of June 30, 2024. The property was sold on July 8, 2024. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company used proceeds of 25.3 million, or 90 of the net proceeds from the disposition, to repay outstanding indebtedness. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, an additional 0.7 million in costs related to the sale of properties previously sold was recorded. The dispositions of these properties did not represent a strategic shift that has a major effect on our operations and financial results. Our current strategy is to focus on the sunbelt and mountain west regions of the United States. Accordingly, the properties sold remained classified within continuing operations for all periods presented.

 We continue to believe that the current price of our common stock does not accurately reflect the value of our underlying real estate assets, and we will seek to increase shareholder value by (1) pursuing the sale of select properties where we believe that short to intermediate term valuation potential has been reached and (2) striving to lease vacant space. As we continue to execute this strategy, our revenue, Funds From Operations, and capital expenditures may decrease in the short term. Proceeds from dispositions are intended to be used primarily for the repayment of debt. Critical Accounting Estimates We have certain critical accounting policies that are subject to judgments and estimates by our management and uncertainties of outcome that affect the application of these policies. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates. In the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information. The accounting policies that we believe are most critical to the understanding of our financial position and results of operations, and that require significant management estimates and judgments, are discussed in Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Critical accounting policies are those that have the most impact on the reporting of our financial condition and results of operations and those requiring significant judgments and estimates. We believe that our judgments and estimates are consistently applied and produce financial information that fairly presents our results of operations. Recent Accounting Standards In October 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued ASU No. 2023-06, Disclosure Improvements: Codification Amendments in Response to the SEC s Disclosure Update and Simplification Initiative ASU 2023-06 ). ASU 2023-06 adds interim and annual disclosure requirements to GAAP at the request of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The guidance in ASU 2023-06 is required to be applied prospectively and the GAAP requirements will be effective when the removal of the related SEC disclosure requirements is effective. If the SEC does not act to remove its related requirements by June 30, 2027, any related FASB amendments will be removed from the Accounting Standards Codification and will not be effective. The Company does not anticipate that the adoption of ASU 2023-06 will have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures ASU 2023-07 ). ASU 2023-07 requires public entities to disclose significant segment expense and other segment items on an annual and interim basis and to provide in interim periods all disclosures about a reportable segment s profit or loss and assets that are currently required annually. The guidance in ASU 2023-07 is applied retrospectively to all periods presented in the financial statements and is effective for public entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not anticipate that the adoption of ASU 2023-07 will have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures ASU 2023-09 ). ASU 2023-09 enhances the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures and disclosures about income taxes paid. The guidance in ASU 2023-09 should be applied prospectively but may be applied retrospectively for each period presented. ASU 2023-09 is effective for public entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company does not anticipate that the adoption of ASU 2023-09 will have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.

The decrease was primarily a result of: A decrease in rental revenue of approximately 7.2 million arising primarily from the sale of four properties in 2023, and two properties in 2024 and other losses of rental income from lease expirations during the periods presented. These decreases were partially offset by rental income earned from leases commencing after September 30, 2023. Our leased space in our owned and consolidated properties was 67.7 as of September 30, 2024 and 72.4 as of September 30, 2023. Expenses Total expenses decreased by 4.9 million to 37.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily a result of: A decrease in real estate operating expenses and real estate taxes and insurance of approximately 2.8 million, which was primarily attributable to the property dispositions noted above. A decrease in depreciation and amortization of approximately 2.5 million, which was primarily attributable to the property dispositions noted above. These decreases were partially offset by: An increase in general and administrative expenses of 10,000, which was primarily attributable to higher professional fees during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023.

 An increase in interest expense of approximately 0.4 million. The increase was primarily due to higher interest expense as a result of higher interest rates under the loan amendments we entered into on February 10, 2023, and February 21, 2024, described above and was partially offset by a lower principal amount of debt outstanding compared to the same period in 2023. Loss on extinguishment of debt During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, we repaid debt and incurred a loss on extinguishment of debt of 477,000 and 39,000, respectively, related to unamortized deferred financing costs on the dates of the repayments.

During the three months ended September 30, 2024, an additional 0.7 million in costs related to the sale of properties previously sold were recorded. Interest income During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we invested disposition proceeds in an interest-bearing account and earned 0.3 million in interest income.

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures Funds From Operations The Company evaluates performance based on Funds From Operations, which we refer to as FFO, as management believes that FFO represents the most accurate measure of activity and is the basis for distributions paid to equity holders. The Company defines FFO as net income or loss (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of property, hedge ineffectiveness, acquisition costs of newly acquired properties that are not capitalized and lease acquisition costs that are not capitalized plus depreciation and amortization, including amortization of acquired above and below market lease intangibles and impairment charges on properties or investments in non-consolidated REITs, and after adjustments to exclude equity in income or losses from, and, to include the proportionate share of FFO from, non-consolidated REITs. FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income or loss (determined in accordance with GAAP), nor as an indicator of the Company s financial performance, nor as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP), nor as a measure of the Company s liquidity, nor is it necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the Company s needs. Other real estate companies and the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT, may define this term in a different manner. We have included the NAREIT FFO definition as of May 17, 2016 in the table and note that other REITs may not define FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition or may interpret the current NAREIT definition differently than we do. We believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of the results of the Company, FFO should be examined in connection with net income or loss and cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities in the consolidated financial statements. The calculations of FFO are shown in the following table:

Management believes that investors are interested in this information. NOI is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Company defines as net income or loss (the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure) plus selling, general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, including amortization of acquired above and below market lease intangibles and impairment charges, interest expense, less equity in earnings of nonconsolidated REITs, interest income, management fee income, hedge ineffectiveness, gains or losses on the sale of assets and excludes non-property specific income and expenses. The information presented includes footnotes and the data is shown by region with properties owned and consolidated in the periods presented, which we call Same Store. The comparative Same Store results include properties held for the periods presented and exclude acquired properties or properties that have been placed in service, but that do not have operating activity for all periods presented, dispositions and significant nonrecurring income such as bankruptcy

 settlements and lease termination fees. NOI, as defined by the Company, may not be comparable to NOI reported by other REITs that define NOI differently. NOI should not be considered an alternative to net income or loss as an indication of our performance or to cash flows as a measure of the Company s liquidity or its ability to make distributions.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash and cash equivalents were 42.4 million and 127.9 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The decrease of 85.5 million is attributable to 6.7 million provided by operating activities, plus 43.8 million provided by investing activities less 136.0 million used in financing activities. Management believes that existing cash and cash anticipated to be generated internally by operations, including property dispositions, will be sufficient to meet working capital requirements and anticipated capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months. Although there is no guarantee that we will be able to obtain the funds necessary for our future growth, we anticipate generating funds from continuing real estate operations and property dispositions. We believe that we have adequate funds to cover unusual expenses and capital improvements, in addition to normal operating expenses. Our ability to maintain or increase our level of dividends to stockholders, however, depends in significant part upon the level of rental income from our real properties, property dispositions and our interest costs. Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, of 6.7 million is primarily attributable to a net loss of 44.2 million. excluding 20.5 million of losses on asset sales and impairments on an asset held for sale, plus the add-back of 38.0 million of non-cash expenses, less a decrease in accounts payable and accrued compensation of 4.8 million, an increase in payment of deferred leasing commissions of 3.2 million, an increase in lease acquisition costs of 0.7 million plus a decrease in tenant receivables of 0.8 million and a decrease in prepaid expenses of 0.3 million. Investing Activities Cash provided by investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, of 43.8 million is primarily attributable to proceeds from an asset sale of 62.9 million, which was partially offset by purchases of other real estate assets and office equipment investments of 19.1 million. Financing Activities Cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 136.0 million is primarily attributable to the repayment of a portion of the BMO Term Loan of 36.2 million, repayment of a portion of the BofA Revolver (defined below) of 22.6 million, repayment of a portion of the BofA Term Loan (defined below) of 5.6 million, repayment of a portion of the Senior Notes (defined below) of 62.9 million, payment of deferred financing costs of 5.6 million and payment of distributions to stockholders of 3.1 million. Liquidity beyond the next 12 months Our ability to generate cash adequate to meet our needs is dependent primarily on income from real estate investments, the sale of real estate investments, leveraging of real estate investments, proceeds from public offerings of stock, private placement of debt and access to the capital markets. The acquisition of new properties, the payment of expenses related to real estate operations, capital improvement expenses, debt service payments, general and administrative expenses, and distribution requirements place demands on our liquidity. We intend to operate our properties from the cash flows generated by our properties. However, our expenses are affected by various factors, including inflation. See Part II, Item 1A, Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for additional factors. Increases in operating expenses are predominantly borne by our tenants. To the extent that increases cannot be passed on to our tenants through rent reimbursements, such expenses would reduce the amount of available cash flow, which can adversely affect the market value of the applicable property. We have used a variety of sources to fund our cash needs in addition to our free cash flow generated from our investments in real estate. We have considered adding or refinancing existing term debt or raising capital through public offerings or At The Market (ATM) programs of our common stock. We believe these sources of funds will provide sufficient funds to adequately meet our obligations beyond the next twelve months.

 BMO Term Loan We have a term loan borrowing in the aggregate principal amount of approximately 78.8 million as of September 30, 2024, which we refer to as the BMO Term Loan, with Bank of Montreal, as administrative agent, and the other lending institutions party thereto, that matures on April 1, 2026. On February 21, 2024, we amended the BMO Term Loan by entering into a Second Amendment to Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with Bank of Montreal and the other lending institutions party thereto, which we refer to as the BMO Second Amendment. The BMO Second Amendment amended the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated September 27, 2018, which we refer to as the Original BMO Credit Agreement, as amended by the First Amendment to Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated February 10, 2023, which we refer to as the BMO First Amendment, to, among other things: (1) extend the maturity date from October 1, 2024 to April 1, 2026; (2) change the interest rate from either 300 basis points over SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing Rate) or 200 basis points over the base rate to either 300 basis points over SOFR with a floor on SOFR of 500 basis points or 200 basis points over the base rate with a floor on the base rate of 600 basis points; (3) provide that, if, as of March 31, 2025, the aggregate principal amount outstanding under the BMO Term Loan, the BofA Term Loan (defined below) and the Senior Notes (defined below) exceeds 200 million, the spread over SOFR or the base rate, as applicable, will permanently increase by 100 basis points, from 300 basis points to 400 basis points in the case of SOFR, and from 200 basis points to 300 basis points in the case of the base rate; (4) require mandatory prepayments of the BMO Term Loan, the BofA Term Loan and the Senior Notes with net cash proceeds from the disposition of property, assets and equity issuances as follows: (a) 25.55556 to the BMO Term Loan; (b) 20.00000 to the BofA Term Loan; (c) 44.44444 to the Senior Notes; and (d) the remaining 10 to be retained by us; (5) require that, within 90 days of the February 21, 2024 effective date of the BMO Second Amendment, certain of our subsidiaries guarantee the BMO Term Loan; (6) require that, within 90 days of the February 21, 2024 effective date of the BMO Second Amendment, we pledge our equity interests in certain of our subsidiaries as collateral for the BMO Term Loan; (7) reduce our minimum fixed charge coverage ratio from 1.50x to 1.25x; and (8) reduce our minimum unsecured interest coverage ratio from 1.75x to 1.25x. We refer to the Original BMO Credit Agreement, as amended by the BMO First Amendment and the BMO Second Amendment, as the BMO Credit Agreement. The BMO Credit Agreement initially provided for an unsecured term loan borrowing in the amount of 220 million. The BMO Term Loan initially consisted of a 55 million tranche A term loan and a 165 million tranche B term loan. On June 4, 2021, we repaid the tranche A term loan that was scheduled to mature on November 30, 2021, and incurred a loss on extinguishment of debt of 0.1 million related to unamortized deferred financing costs. On February 10, 2023, we repaid a 40 million portion of the tranche B term loan. On August 10, 2023, we repaid an additional 10 million portion of the tranche B term loan. On February 21, 2024, as part of the BMO Second Amendment, we repaid an approximately 29.0 million portion of the tranche B term loan. On July 10, 2024, we repaid an approximately 7.2 million portion of the BMO Term Loan from asset sale proceeds of a property located in Glen Allen, Virginia. The tranche B term loan matures on April 1, 2026. Effective February 21, 2024 upon entering into the BMO Second Amendment, the BMO Term Loan bears interest at either (i) 300 basis points over one, three or six month term SOFR, plus a corresponding adjustment of 0.11448 , 0.26161 or 0.42826 , respectively, with a floor on SOFR of 5.00 or (ii) 200 basis points over the base rate with a floor on the base rate of 6.00 . In addition, effective February 21, 2024 upon entering into the BMO Second Amendment, if, as of March 31, 2025, the aggregate principal amount outstanding under the BMO Term Loan, the BofA Term Loan and the Senior Notes exceeds 200 million, the spread over SOFR or the base rate, as applicable, will permanently increase by 100 basis points from 300 basis points to 400 basis points in the case of SOFR, and from 200 basis points to 300 basis points in the case of the base rate. As of September 30, 2024, the interest rate on the BMO Term Loan was 8.00 per annum. The weighted average variable interest rate on all amounts outstanding under the BMO Term Loan was 8.44 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As of December 31, 2023, the interest rate on the BMO Term Loan was 8.47 per annum. The weighted average variable interest rate on all amounts outstanding under the BMO Term Loan from February 8, 2023, which is when the Company terminated its outstanding interest rate swaps applicable to the BMO Term Loan as described below, through December 31, 2023 was approximately 8.11 per annum. Although the interest rate on the BMO Term Loan is currently variable under the BMO Credit Agreement, we previously fixed the base LIBOR interest rate that previously applied to the BMO Term Loan by entering into interest rate

 swap transactions. On February 20, 2019, we entered into ISDA Master Agreements with a group of banks that fixed the base LIBOR interest rate on the BMO Term Loan at 2.39 per annum for the period beginning on August 26, 2020 and ending January 31, 2024. On February 8, 2023, we terminated all remaining interest rate swaps applicable to the BMO Term Loan and, on February 10, 2023, we received an aggregate of approximately 4.3 million as a result of such terminations. The BMO Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants for credit facilities of this type, including limitations with respect to indebtedness, liens, investments, mergers and acquisitions, disposition of assets, use of net cash proceeds from the disposition of property, assets and equity issuances, mandatory prepayments, the requirement to have certain subsidiaries provide guarantees, the requirement to pledge our equity interests in certain subsidiaries as collateral, changes in business, certain restricted payments, repurchases and redemptions of our common stock, going concern qualifications to our financial statements, and transactions with affiliates. In addition, the BMO Credit Agreement also restricts our ability to make quarterly dividend distributions that exceed 0.01 per share of our common stock; provided, however, that notwithstanding such restriction, we are permitted to make dividend distributions based on our good faith estimate of projected or estimated taxable income or otherwise as necessary to retain our status as a real estate investment trust, to meet the distribution requirements of Section 857 of the Internal Revenue Code or to eliminate any income or excise taxes to which we would otherwise be subject. The BMO Credit Agreement also contains financial covenants that require us to maintain a minimum tangible net worth, a maximum leverage ratio, a maximum secured leverage ratio, a maximum secured recourse leverage ratio, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, a maximum unencumbered leverage ratio, and minimum unsecured interest coverage. We were in compliance with the BMO Term Loan financial covenants as of September 30, 2024. The BMO Credit Agreement provides for customary events of default with corresponding grace periods, including failure to pay any principal or interest when due, certain cross defaults and a change in control (as defined in the BMO Credit Agreement). In the event of a default by us, the administrative agent may, and at the request of the requisite number of lenders shall, declare all obligations under the BMO Credit Agreement immediately due and payable, terminate the lenders commitments to make loans under the BMO Credit Agreement, and enforce any and all rights of the lenders or administrative agent under the BMO Credit Agreement and related documents. For certain events of default related to bankruptcy, insolvency, and receivership, the commitments of lenders will be automatically terminated and all of our outstanding obligations will become immediately due and payable. BofA Term Loan As of September 30, 2024, we have a term loan borrowing in the amount of approximately 61.7 million, which we refer to as the BofA Term Loan, with Bank of America, N.A. as administrative agent, and other lending institutions party thereto that matures on April 1, 2026. Prior to February 21, 2024, we referred to the BofA Term Loan as the BofA Revolver. On February 21, 2024, we amended the BofA Term Loan by entering into a Second Amendment to Credit Agreement with the lending institutions party thereto, which we refer to as the BofA Second Amendment. The BofA Second Amendment amended the Credit Agreement dated January 10, 2022, which we refer to as the Original BofA Credit Agreement, as amended by the First Amendment to Credit Agreement dated February 10, 2023, which we refer to as the BofA First Amendment, to, among other things: (1) extend the maturity date from October 1, 2024 to April 1, 2026; (2) convert borrowings from being either revolving loans or letters of credit to a term loan; (3) change the interest rate from 300 basis points over SOFR to 300 basis points over SOFR with a floor on SOFR of 500 basis points; (4) provide that, if, as of March 31, 2025, the aggregate principal amount outstanding under the BMO Term Loan, the BofA Term Loan and the Senior Notes exceeds 200 million, the spread over SOFR will permanently increase by 100 basis points from 300 basis points to 400 basis points; (5) require mandatory prepayments of the BMO Term Loan, the BofA Term Loan and the Senior Notes with net cash proceeds from the disposition of property, assets and equity issuances as follows: (a) 25.55556 to the BMO Term Loan; (b) 20.00000 to the BofA Term Loan; (c) 44.44444 to the Senior Notes; and (d) the remaining 10 to be retained by us; (6) require that, within 90 days of the February 21, 2024 effective date of the BofA Second Amendment, certain of our subsidiaries guarantee the BofA Term Loan; (7) require that, within 90 days of the February 21, 2024 effective date of the BofA Second Amendment, we pledge our equity interests in certain of our subsidiaries as collateral for the BofA Term Loan; (8) reduce our minimum fixed charge coverage ratio from 1.50x to 1.25x; and (9) reduce our minimum unsecured interest coverage ratio from 1.75x to 1.25x. We refer to the Original BofA Credit Agreement, as amended by the BofA First Amendment and the BofA Second Amendment, as the BofA Credit Agreement.

 Prior to entering into the BofA Second Amendment on February 21, 2024, borrowings made under the BofA Revolver could be revolving loans or letters of credit, the combined sum of which could not exceed 150 million outstanding at any time. On February 10, 2023, we borrowed 40.0 million under the BofA Revolver to repay a portion of the BMO Term Loan. Effective October 1, 2023, availability under the BofA Revolver was reduced to 125 million. As of December 31, 2023, there were borrowings of 90 million drawn and outstanding under the BofA Revolver. On February 21, 2024, as part of the BofA Second Amendment, we repaid an approximately 22.7 million portion of the BofA Revolver. On July 10, 2024, we repaid an approximately 5.6 million portion of the BofA Term Loan from asset sale proceeds of a property located in Glen Allen, Virginia. Effective February 21, 2024 upon entering into the BofA Second Amendment, the BofA Term Loan bears interest at 300 basis points over either (i) the daily simple SOFR, plus an adjustment of 0.11448 , or (ii) one, three or six month term SOFR, plus a corresponding adjustment of 0.11448 , 0.26161 or 0.42826 , respectively, with a floor on SOFR of 5.00 . In addition, effective February 21, 2024 upon entering into the BofA Second Amendment, under certain circumstances, such as if SOFR is not able to be determined, the BofA Term Loan bears interest at 200 basis points over the base rate with a floor on the base rate of 600 basis points. In addition, effective February 21, 2024 upon entering into the BofA Second Amendment, if, as of March 31, 2025, the aggregate principal amount outstanding under the BMO Term Loan, the BofA Term Loan and the Senior Notes exceeds 200 million, the spread over SOFR will permanently increase by 100 basis points from 300 basis points to 400 basis points in the case of SOFR, and from 200 basis points to 300 basis points in the case of the base rate. As of September 30, 2024, the interest rate on the BofA Term Loan was 8.00 per annum. The weighted average variable interest rate on all amounts outstanding under the BofA Term Loan was 8.44 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As of December 31, 2023, the interest rate on the BofA Revolver was 8.47 per annum. The weighted average variable interest rate on all amounts outstanding under the BofA Revolver through December 31, 2023 was approximately 8.05 per annum. The BofA Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants for credit facilities of this type, including limitations with respect to indebtedness, liens, investments, mergers and acquisitions, disposition of assets, use of net cash proceeds from the disposition of property, assets and equity issuances, mandatory prepayments, the requirement to have certain subsidiaries provide guarantees, the requirement to pledge our equity interests in certain subsidiaries as collateral, changes in business, certain restricted payments, repurchases and redemptions of our common stock, going concern qualifications to our financial statements, and transactions with affiliates. In addition, the BofA Credit Agreement also restricts our ability to make quarterly dividend distributions that exceed 0.01 per share of our common stock; provided, however, that notwithstanding such restriction, we are permitted to make dividend distributions based on our good faith estimate of projected or estimated taxable income or otherwise as necessary to retain our status as a real estate investment trust, to meet the distribution requirements of Section 857 of the Internal Revenue Code or to eliminate any income or excise taxes to which we would otherwise be subject. The BofA Credit Agreement also contains financial covenants that require us to maintain a minimum tangible net worth, a maximum leverage ratio, a maximum secured leverage ratio, a maximum secured recourse leverage ratio, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, a maximum unencumbered leverage ratio, and minimum unsecured interest coverage. We were in compliance with the BofA Term Loan financial covenants as of September 30, 2024. The BofA Credit Agreement provides for customary events of default with corresponding grace periods, including failure to pay any principal or interest when due, failure to comply with the provisions of the BofA Credit Agreement, certain cross defaults and a change in control (as defined in the BofA Credit Agreement). In the event of a default by us, the administrative agent may, and at the request of the requisite number of lenders shall, declare all obligations under the BofA Credit Agreement immediately due and payable and enforce any and all rights of the lenders or BofA under the BofA Credit Agreement and related documents. For certain events of default related to bankruptcy, insolvency, and receivership, all of our outstanding obligations will become immediately due and payable. Senior Notes We have senior notes in the aggregate principal amount of approximately 137.1 million as of September 30, 2024, which we refer to as the Senior Notes, that mature on April 1, 2026. The Senior Notes consist of (i) Series A Senior Notes

Table of Contents 
 due April 1, 2026 in an aggregate principal amount of approximately 79.5 million, which we refer to as the Series A Notes, and (ii) Series B Senior Notes due April 1, 2026 in the aggregate principal amount of approximately 57.6 million, which we refer to as the Series B Notes. On February 21, 2024, we amended the terms of the Senior Notes by entering into a First Amendment to Note Purchase Agreement, which we refer to as the NPA First Amendment, with the purchasers party thereto. The NPA First Amendment amended the Note Purchase Agreement dated October 24, 2017, which we refer to as the Original Note Purchase Agreement, to, among other things: (1) extend the maturity date of the Series A Notes from December 20, 2024 to April 1, 2026; (2) shorten the maturity date of the Series B Notes from December 20, 2027 to April 1, 2026; (3) increase the interest rate applicable to the Series A Notes from 4.49 per annum to 8.00 per annum; (4) increase the interest rate applicable to the Series B Notes from 4.76 per annum to 8.00 per annum; (5) provide that, if, as of March 31, 2025, the aggregate principal amount outstanding under the BMO Term Loan, the BofA Term Loan and the Senior Notes exceeds 200 million, the per annum interest rates applicable to the Series A Note and the Series B Notes will permanently increase by 1.00 from 8.00 per annum to 9.00 per annum; (6) require mandatory prepayments of the BMO Term Loan, the BofA Term Loan and the Senior Notes with net cash proceeds from the disposition of property, assets and equity issuances as follows: (a) 25.55556 to the BMO Term Loan; (b) 20.00000 to the BofA Term Loan; (c) 44.44444 to the Senior Notes; and (d) the remaining 10 to be retained by us; (7) require that, within 90 days of the February 21, 2024 effective date of the NPA First Amendment, certain of our subsidiaries guarantee the Senior Notes; (8) require that, within 90 days of the February 21, 2024 effective date of the NPA First Amendment, we pledge our equity interests in certain of our subsidiaries as collateral for the Senior Notes; and (9) conform all financial covenants and negative covenants in the Note Purchase Agreement with the BofA Credit Agreement and the BMO Credit Agreement. We refer to the Original Note Purchase Agreement, as amended by the NPA First Amendment, as the Note Purchase Agreement. On February 21, 2024, as part of the NPA First Amendment, we repaid an approximately 29.2 million portion of the Series A Notes. In addition, on February 21, 2024, as part of the NPA First Amendment, we repaid an approximately 21.2 million aggregate principal amount of the Series B Notes. On July 10, 2024, we repaid an approximately 7.2 million portion of the Series A Notes and an approximately 5.3 million portion of the Series B Notes from asset sale proceeds of a property located in Glen Allen, Virginia. As of September 30, 2024, approximately 79.5 million aggregate principal amount of the Series A Notes remained outstanding and approximately 57.6 million aggregate principal amount of the Series B Notes remained outstanding. As of September 30, 2024, the interest rate on the Series A Notes was 8.00 per annum and the interest rate on the Series B Notes was 8.00 per annum. As of December 31, 2023, the interest rate on the Series A Notes was 4.49 per annum and the interest rate on the Series B Notes was 4.76 per annum. The Note Purchase Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including limitations with respect to indebtedness, liens, investments, mergers and acquisitions, disposition of assets, use of net cash proceeds from the disposition of property, assets and equity issuances, mandatory prepayments, the requirement to have certain subsidiaries provide guarantees, the requirement to pledge our equity interests in certain subsidiaries as collateral, changes in business, certain restricted payments, repurchases and redemptions of our common stock, going concern qualifications to our financial statements, transactions with affiliates, certain restrictions on severance, retention and similar arrangements applicable to our executive officers, and real estate investment trust compliance requirements. In addition, the Note Purchase Agreement also restricts our ability to make quarterly dividend distributions that exceed 0.01 per share of our common stock; provided, however, that notwithstanding such restriction, we are permitted to make dividend distributions based on our good faith estimate of projected or estimated taxable income or otherwise as necessary to retain our status as a real estate investment trust, to meet the distribution requirements of Section 857 of the Internal Revenue Code or to eliminate any income or excise taxes to which we would otherwise be subject. The Note Purchase Agreement also contains financial covenants that require us to maintain a minimum tangible net worth, a maximum leverage ratio, a maximum secured leverage ratio, a maximum secured recourse leverage ratio, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, a maximum unencumbered leverage ratio, and minimum unsecured interest coverage. We were in compliance with the Note Purchase Agreement financial covenants as of September 30, 2024. Equity Offering From time to time, we may issue debt securities, common stock, preferred stock or depository shares under a registration statement to fund the acquisition of additional properties, to pay down any existing debt financing and for other

 corporate purposes. Stock Repurchase Program On June 23, 2021, we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized the repurchase of up to 50 million of the Company s common stock from time to time in the open market, privately negotiated transactions or other manners as permitted by federal securities laws. The repurchase authorization may be suspended or discontinued at any time. On February 10, 2023, we disclosed in a Current Report on Form 8-K that our Board of Directors had discontinued the repurchase authorization. Contingencies We may be subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of our business. Although occasional adverse decisions (or settlements) may occur, we believe that the final disposition of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. Sponsored REIT Loan The Sponsored REIT Loan is secured by a mortgage on the underlying property and has a current term of less than one year. We anticipate that the Sponsored REIT Loan will be repaid through cash flow from property operations or sale of the underlying property, although the actual amount and timing of any repayment is uncertain and will likely depend on prevailing market conditions at the time of any such sale. The Sponsored REIT Loan subjects us to credit risk. However, we believe that our position as asset manager of the Sponsored REIT helps mitigate that risk by providing us with unique insight and the ability to rely on qualitative analysis of the Sponsored REIT. Before making the Sponsored REIT Loan, we considered a variety of subjective factors, including the quality of the underlying real estate, leasing, the financial condition of the Sponsored REIT and local and national market conditions. These factors are subject to change and we do not apply a formula or assign relative weights to the factors. Instead, we make a subjective determination after considering such factors collectively. Additional information about the Sponsored REIT Loan outstanding as of September 30, 2024, is incorporated herein by reference to Note 2, Related Party Transactions and Investments in Non-Consolidated Entities - Management fees and interest income from loans , in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report. Other Consideration s We generally pay the ordinary annual operating expenses of our owned and consolidated properties from the rental revenue generated by the properties. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, the rental income exceeded the expenses for each individual property, with the exception of Monument Circle for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Monument Circle has approximately 214,000 square feet of rentable space comprised of both office and street level retail space. The office component comprises approximately 95 of the rentable space and had been net leased to a single corporate tenant, through December 31, 2018. The retail component comprises the remaining approximately 5 of the property s rentable space. Monument Circle had approximately 69,000 and 217,000 of rental income, and, 303,000 and 832,000 of operating expenses, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and was 4.1 leased to two retail tenants as of September 30, 2024. Monument Circle had approximately 70,000 and 207,000 of rental income, and, 304,000 and 830,000 of operating expenses, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, and was 4.1 leased to two retail tenants as of September 30, 2023. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations There have been no material changes to our contractual obligations and off-balance-sheet arrangements as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market Rate Risk We are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from our floating rate borrowing arrangements. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, if market rates on our outstanding borrowings under the BofA Term Loan and the BofA Revolver, respectively, subject to a floating rate increased by 10 at maturity, or approximately 80 and 85 basis points, respectively, over the current variable rate, the increase in interest expense would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately 0.5 million and 0.7 million, respectively. The interest rate on the BofA Term Loan as of September 30, 2024 and the BofA Revolver as of December 31, 2023, was SOFR plus an adjustment of 0.11448 plus 300 basis points, or 8.00 and 8.47 per annum, respectively. There was 61.7 million outstanding on the BofA Term Loan and 90 million drawn on the BofA Revolver as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. We do not believe that the interest rate risk on the BofA Term Loan is material as of September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, if market rates on our outstanding borrowings under the BMO Term Loan subject to a floating rate increased by 10 at maturity, or approximately 80 basis points over the current variable rate, the increase in interest expense would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately 0.6 million. The interest rate on the BMO Term Loan as of September 30, 2024 was SOFR plus an adjustment of 0.11448 plus 300 basis points, or 8.00 per annum. We do not believe that the interest rate risk on the BMO Term Loan is material as of September 30, 2024. The following table presents, as of September 30, 2024, our contractual variable rate borrowings under our BofA Term Loan, which matures on April 1, 2026, and under our BMO Term Loan Tranche B, which matures on April 1, 2026. 

Payment due by period (in thousands) Total 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 Thereafter BofA Term Loan 61,708 61,708 BMO Term Loan Tranche B 78,850 78,850 Total 140,558 140,558 Item 4. Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting No change in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II - OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings From time to time, we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of our business.
