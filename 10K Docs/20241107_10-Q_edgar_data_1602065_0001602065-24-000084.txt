 Argus WTI Midland Grade of oil that serves as a benchmark price for oil at Midland, Texas. Basin A large depression on the earth s surface in which sediments accumulate. Bbl or barrel One stock tank barrel, or 42 U.S. gallons liquid volume, used in this report in reference to crude oil or other liquid hydrocarbons. BO/d One barrel of crude oil per day. BOE One barrel of oil equivalent, with six thousand cubic feet of natural gas being equivalent to one barrel of oil. BOE/d BOE per day. Completion The process of treating a drilled well followed by the installation of permanent equipment for the production of natural gas or oil, or in the case of a dry hole, the reporting of abandonment to the appropriate agency. Crude oil Liquid hydrocarbons retrieved from geological structures underground to be refined into fuel sources. Development well A well drilled within the proved area of a natural gas or oil reservoir to the depth of a stratigraphic horizon known to be productive. Differential An adjustment to the price of oil or natural gas from an established spot market price to reflect differences in the quality and/or location of oil or natural gas. Fracturing The process of creating and preserving a fracture or system of fractures in a reservoir rock typically by injecting a fluid under pressure through a wellbore and into the targeted formation. Gross wells The total wells, as the case may be, in which a working interest is owned. Henry Hub Natural gas gathering point that serves as a benchmark price for natural gas futures on the NYMEX. Horizontal wells Wells drilled directionally horizontal to allow for development of structures not reachable through traditional vertical drilling mechanisms. MBbl One thousand barrels of crude oil and other liquid hydrocarbons. MBOE One thousand barrels of crude oil equivalent, determined using a ratio of six Mcf of natural gas to one Bbl of crude oil, condensate or natural gas liquids. MBOE/d One thousand BOE per day. Mcf One thousand cubic feet of natural gas. Mineral interests The interests in ownership of the resource and mineral rights, giving an owner the right to profit from the extracted resources. MMBtu One million British Thermal Units. MMcf Million cubic feet of natural gas. Net royalty acres Net mineral acres multiplied by the average lease royalty interest and other burdens. Oil and natural gas properties Tracts of land consisting of properties to be developed for oil and natural gas resource extraction. Operator The individual or company responsible for the exploration and/or production of an oil or natural gas well or lease.

 ii 

Table of Contents 

 Reserves The estimated remaining quantities of oil and natural gas and related substances anticipated to be economically producible, as of a given date, by application of development projects to known accumulations. In addition, there must exist, or there must be a reasonable expectation that there will exist, the legal right to produce or a revenue interest in the production, installed means of delivering oil and natural gas or related substances to the market and all permits and financing required to implement the project. Reserves are not assigned to adjacent reservoirs isolated by major, potentially sealing, faults until those reservoirs are penetrated and evaluated as economically producible. Reserves should not be assigned to areas that are clearly separated from a known accumulation by a non-productive reservoir (i.e., absence of reservoir, structurally low reservoir or negative test results). Such areas may contain prospective resources (i.e., potentially recoverable resources from undiscovered accumulations). Royalty interest An interest that gives an owner the right to receive a portion of the resources or revenues without having to carry any costs of development, which may be subject to expiration. Spud Commencement of actual drilling operations. Waha Hub Natural gas gathering point that serves as a benchmark price for natural gas at western Texas and New Mexico. WTI West Texas Intermediate, a light sweet blend of oil produced from fields in western Texas and is a grade of oil that serves as a benchmark for oil on the NYMEX.

 Prior to March 8, 2024, the Company was a controlled company under the rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (the Nasdaq Rules ). On March 8, 2024, the Company s parent, Diamondback, completed an underwritten pu blic offering in which it sold approximately million shares of the Company s Class A Common Stock (the Diamondback Offering ). Following the Diamondback Offering, Diamondback owned shares of the Company s Class A Common Stock and owned shares of the Company s Class B Common Stock, reducing its beneficial ownership to less than of the Company s total Common Stock outstanding. As such, the Company ceased to be a controlled company under the Nasdaq Rules. Prior to the Diamondback Offering, the Company s board of directors had a majority of independent directors and a standing audit committee comprised of all independent directors but had elected to take advantage of certain exemptions from corporate governance requirements applicable to controlled companies under the Nasdaq Rules and, until March 8, 2024, did not have a compensation committee or a committee of independent directors that selects director nominees. 
 
 Effective as of March 8, 2024, the Company s board of directors formed (i) the compensation committee for purposes of making certain executive and other compensation decisions, and (ii) the nominating and corporate governance committee for purposes of making certain nominating and corporate governance decisions, with each such committee s rights and obligations being subject to the terms and conditions of (x) the Company s certificate of incorporation, (y) such committee s charter as adopted by the board, and (z) the services and secondment agreement, dated as of November 2, 2023, pursuant to which Diamondback provides personnel and general and administrative services to us, including the services of the executive officers and other employees, substantially in the same manner as those provided to the Company by the former General Partner prior to the Conversion (the Services and Secondment Agreement ). 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, Diamondback beneficially owned approximately of the Company s total Common Stock outstanding.

The Company has and intends to continue to purchase shares of Class A Common Stock un der the repurchase program opportunistically with funds from cash on hand, free cash flow from operatio ns and potential l iquidity events such as the sale of assets. This repurchase program may be suspended from time to time, modified, extended or discontinued by the Company s board of directors at any time. 
 
 There were repurchases of Class A Common Stock during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 the Company repurchased, excluding excise tax, approximately million and million common units under the repurchase program, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, approximately million remains available under the repurchase program, excluding excise tax. 
 
 Cash Dividends 
 
 The board of directors of the Company has established a dividend policy, whereby the Operating Company distributes all or a portion of its available cash on a quarterly basis to its unitholders (including Diamondback, the Company and, following the TWR Acquisition completed on October 1, 2024, TWR IV). The Company in turn distributes all or a portion of the available cash it receives from the Operating Company to holders of its Class A Common Stock through base and variable dividends that take into account capital returned to stockholders via its stock repurchase program. The Company s available cash and the available cash of the Operating Company for each quarter is determined by the board of directors following the end of such quarter. 
 
 The cash available for distribution by the Operating Company, a non-GAAP measure, generally equals the Company s consolidated Adjusted EBITDA for the applicable quarter, less cash needed for income taxes payable, debt service, contractual obligations, fixed charges and reserves for future operating or capital needs that the board of directors of the Company deems necessary or appropriate, lease bonus income (net of applicable taxes), distribution equivalent rights payments, preferred dividends, and an adjustment for changes in ownership interests that occurred subsequent to the quarter, if any. For a detailed description of the Company s and the Operating Company s dividend policy, see Note 7 Stockholders Equity Cash Dividends in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 The percentage of cash available for distribution by the Operating Company pursuant to its distribution policy may change quarterly to enable the Operating Company to retain cash flow to help strengthen the Company s balance sheet while also expanding the return of capital program through the Company s stock repurchase program. The Company is not required to pay dividends to its Class A Common stockholders on a quarterly or other basis.

 Change in Ownership of Consolidated Subsidiaries 
 
 Non-controlling interest in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements represents Diamondback s ownership in the net assets of the Operating Company. Diamondback s relative ownership interest in the Operating Company can change due to its purchase or sale of the Company s Common Stock, the Company s public offerings of shares of Class A Common Stock, issuance of shares of Class A Common Stock or Operating Company units for acquisitions, share-based compensation, repurchases of shares of Class A Common Stock and distribution equivalent rights paid on the Company s Class A Common Stock. These changes in ownership percentage result in adjustments to non-controlling interest and stockholders equity, tax effected, but do not impact earnings.

 Effective tax rate 
 
 The Company s effective income tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 differed from the amounts computed by applying the United States federal statutory tax rate to pre-tax income for the periods primarily due to net income attributable to the non-controlling interest. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company maintained a partial valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets considered not more likely than not to be realized, based on its assessment of all available evidence, both positive and negative as required by applicable accounting standards. In March 2024, Diamondback converted approximately million shares of the Company s Class B Common Stock along with million Operating Company units into an equivalent number of shares of Class A Common Stock. In connection with this transaction, the Company recognized a million increase in its deferred tax asset and a million increase in its valuation allowance through additional paid-in capital. 
 
 The Company incurred excise tax on repurchases of Class A Common Stock during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and an amount of excise tax for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 On November 13, 2023, we converted from a Delaware limited partnership to a Delaware corporation. See Note 1 Organization and Basis of Presentation of the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of the Conversion. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented in this report as well as our audited financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our future plans, estimates, beliefs and expected performance. Actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those contained in these forward-looking statements due to a number of factors. See Part II. Item 1A. Risk Factors and Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements . 

Overview 
 
 We are a publicly traded Delaware corporation focused on owning and acquiring mineral and royalty interests in oil and natural gas properties primarily in the Permian Basin. We operate in one reportable segment. 

Recent Developments 
 
 TWR Acquisition 
 
 On October 1, 2024, we completed the TWR Acquisition for approximately 458.9 million in cash and 10.09 million Operating Company units, subject to transaction costs and customary post-closing adjustments. Additionally, up to 41.0 million in contingent consideration may be payable in January of 2026 based on the WTI 2025 Average. The mineral and royalty interests acquired in the TWR Acquisition represent approximately 3,067 net royalty acres located primarily in the Permian Basin. See Note 13 Subsequent Events of the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further details. 
 
 2024 Equity Offering 
 
 On September 13, 2024, we completed an underwritten public offering of approximately 11.50 million shares of our Class A Common Stock, which included 1.50 million shares issued pursuant to an option to purchase additional shares of Class A Common Stock granted to the underwriters, at a price to the public of 42.50 per share for total net proceeds of approximately 475.9 million , after the underwriters discount and transaction costs. 
 
 Q3 2024 Acquisitions 
 
 On September 3, 2024, we completed the Q Acquisition, which consisted of approximately 406 net royalty acres primarily in the Permian Basin for a purchase price of 113.6 million in cash, subject to transaction costs and customary post-closing adjustments, and contingent cash consideration of up to 5.4 million payable in January of 2026. 
 
 On September 3, 2024, we completed the M Acquisition, which consisted of approximately 267 net royalty acres primarily in the Permian Basin for a purchase price of 75.8 million in cash, subject to transaction costs and customary post-closing adjustments, and contingent cash consideration of up to 3.6 million payable in January of 2026. 
 
 See Note 4 Acquisitions and Divestitures of the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the acquisitions. 
 
 After giving effect to the Q Acquisition and M Acquisition (collectively, the Q M Acquisitions and the recently completed TWR Acquisition (together with the Q M Acquisitions, the Tumbleweed Acquisitions ), our footprint of mineral and royalty interests totals approximately 35,634 net royalty acres, approximately 54 of which are operated by Diamondback. 
 
 Cash Dividend Update 
 
 On August 1, 2024, our board of directors approved increasing our annual base dividend to 1.20 per share of Class A Common Stock beginning with our dividend payable for the second quarter of 2024. On October 31, 2024, we declared a combined base and variable cash dividend of 0.61 per share of Class A Common Stock and 0.73 per Operating Company unit 
 21 

Table of Contents 

payable in the fourth quarter of 2024. The dividend declared on the Operating Company units gives effect to the Operating Company units issued to TWR IV on October 1, 2024, as discussed above. 
 
 Commodity Prices 
 
 Prices for oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids are determined primarily by prevailing market conditions. Regional and worldwide economic activity, extreme weather conditions and other substantially variable factors influence market conditions for these products. These factors are beyond our control and are difficult to predict. OPEC and its non-OPEC allies, known collectively as OPEC+, continue to meet regularly to evaluate the state of global oil supply, demand and inventory levels and can heavily influence volatility in oil prices. During the nine months ended 2024 and 2023, WTI prices averaged 77.61 and 77.28 per Bbl, respectively, and Henry Hub prices averaged 2.22 and 2.58 per MMBtu, respectively. 
 
 For additional information around risks related to commodity prices, see Part II. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Commodity Price Risk . 

Guidance 
 
 We increased our production guidance for full year 2024 to give effect to the impact of acquisitions in the second half of the year. The following table presents our current estimates of certain financial and operating results for the full year, as well as production and cash tax guidance for the fourth quarter of 2024.

The expected timing of th ese line-of-sight wells is based primarily on permitting by third party operators or Diamondback s current expected completion schedule. Existing permits or active development of our royalty acreage does not ensure that those wells will be turned to production given th e volatility in oil prices.

 Royalty Income 
 
 Our royalty income is a function of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids production volumes sold and average prices received for those volumes. 
 
 Royalty income decreased by 7.3 million during the third quarter of 2024 compared to the second quarter of 2024. This net decrease consisted of a 15.3 million reduction attributable to lower average oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices received for our production during the third quarter of 2024 compared to the second quarter of 2024, partially offset by an increase of 8.0 million attributable to the 5 growth in production volumes. 
 
 Approximately 15 of the overall increase in production is attributable to the GRP Acquisition and approximately 11 is attributable to the Q M Acquisitions. The remainder of the growth is from new wells added between periods.

Production and Ad Valorem Taxes 
 
 The following table presents production and ad valorem taxes for the periods indicated : 
 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 June 30, 2024 Amount (In thousands) Per BOE Percentage of Royalty Income Amount (In thousands) Per BOE Percentage of Royalty Income Production taxes 10,351 2.28 5.0 10,597 2.45 5.0 Ad valorem taxes 4,762 1.05 2.3 4,604 1.07 2.1 Total production and ad valorem taxes 15,113 3.33 7.3 15,201 3.52 7.1 
 
 In general, production taxes are directly related to production revenues and are based upon current year commodity prices. Production taxes as a percentage of royalty income for the third quarter of 2024 were relatively consistent with the second quarter of 2024. 
 
 Ad valorem taxes are based, among other factors, on property values driven by prior year commodity prices. Ad valorem taxes in total and per BOE for the third quarter of 2024 were relatively consistent with the second quarter of 2024. 
 
 Depletion 
 
 The increase in depletion expense of 6.2 million for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the second quarter of 2024 consists primarily of (i) 3.7 million due to an increase in the depletion rate to 12.01 per BOE for the third quarter of 2024, resulting primarily from the addition of higher values of proved reserves from the Q M Acquisitions compared to 11.19 per BOE for the second quarter of 2024, and (ii) 2.5 million from growth in production volumes. 
 
 Derivative Instruments 
 
 The following table shows the net gain (loss) on derivative instruments and the net cash receipts (payments) on derivatives for the periods presented:

 See Note 10 Derivatives of the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of our open contracts at September 30, 2024. 
 
 Provision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes 
 
 The 4.2 million increase in income tax expense for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the second quarter of 2024 primarily resulted from additional income before income taxes being attributed to Viper Energy, Inc. in the third quarter of 2024 due to higher ownership interest in the Operating Company following the completion of the 2024 Equity Offering . See Note 9 Income Taxes of the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion of income tax expense. 
 
 Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Non-controlling Interest 
 
 The 5.2 million decrease in net income attributable to non-controlling interest for the third quarter of 2024 compared to the second quarter of 2024 is primarily due to (i) a decrease in net income, (ii) a decrease in Diamondback s ownership of our common stock in the first quarter of 2024 following the completion of the Diamondback Offering, and (iii) a decrease in Diamondback s ownership of our common stock in the third quarter of 2024 following the completion of the 2024 Equity Offering .

 Royalty Income 
 
 Our royalty income is a function of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids production volumes sold and average prices received for those volumes. 
 
 Royalty income increased 113.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. This net increase consisted of an additional 131.4 million in royalty income from the 27 growth in production, partially offset by a decrease of 17.6 million due to lower average natural gas and natural gas liquids prices received for our production during 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. 
 
 Approximately 85 of the overall increase in production is attributable to the GRP Acquisition, approximately 6 is attributable to the Drop Down and approximately 1 is attributable to the Q M Acquisitions. The remainder of the growth comes from new wells added between periods.

Lease Bonus Income Related Party 
 
 Lease bonus income from Diamondback decreased by 105.4 million due to receiving payment for three new leases covering approximately 85 acres in Martin County Texas, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to receiving payment for five new leases and two lease extensions covering approximately 13,341 acres in Martin, Midland, Pecos and Wheeler Counties, Texas, during the same period in 2023. See Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further details. 
 
 Production and Ad Valorem Taxes 
 
 The following table presents production and ad valorem taxes for the periods indicated : 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Amount (In thousands) Per BOE Percentage of Royalty Income Amount (In thousands) Per BOE Percentage of Royalty Income Production taxes 31,292 2.40 5.0 25,876 2.51 5.0 Ad valorem taxes 13,428 1.02 2.1 11,918 1.16 2.3 Total production and ad valorem taxes 44,720 3.42 7.1 37,794 3.67 7.3 
 
 In general, production taxes are directly related to production revenues and are based upon current year commodity prices. Production taxes as a percentage of royalty income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 remained consistent with the same period in 2023. 
 
 Ad valorem taxes are based, among other factors, on property values driven by prior year commodity prices. Ad valorem taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 increased by 1.5 million primarily due to an increase in the expected ad valorem tax rates for 2024 compared to the expected rates in the third quarter of 2023. 
 
 Depletion 
 
 The increase in depletion expense of 48.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 consisted primarily of (i) 27.2 million from growth in production volumes, and (ii) 21.3 million due to an increase in the depletion rate to 11.47 per BOE for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, resulting primarily from the addition of leasehold costs and reserves from the GRP Acquisition and the Q M Acquisitions compared to 9.84 per BOE for the same period in 2023.

 29 

Table of Contents 

The 7.5 million increase in general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 consists of (i) a 4.6 million increase in expenses billed by Diamondback as discussed below, (ii) approximately 1.9 million in legal expenses primarily related to the Diamondback Offering, and (iii) other individually insignificant changes. 
 
 Prior to 2024, we reimbursed Diamondback a flat quarterly fee for management and administrative services provided to us by Diamondback. Beginning in 2024, Diamondback began billing us for estimated actual salary and benefit costs incurred for services provided to us by seconded employees under the Services and Secondment Agreement during the quarter. 
 
 Derivative Instruments 
 
 The following table shows the net gain (loss) on derivative instruments and the net cash receipts (payments) on derivatives for the periods presented: 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (In thousands) Gain (loss) on derivative instruments 5,264 (30,685) Net cash receipts (payments) on derivatives (2,038) (10,019) 
 
 The change to a gain on derivative instruments from a loss on derivative instruments for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 is primarily due to an increase in the differential between prices for Waha Hub and Henry Hub resulting in a gain on our natural gas basis swaps in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a loss in 2023. See Note 10 Derivatives of the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of our open contracts at September 30, 2024. 
 
 Provision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes 
 
 The 3.0 million increase in income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 primarily resulted from additional income before income taxes being attributed to Viper Energy, Inc. in the third quarter of 2024 due to higher ownership interest in the Operating Company following the completion of the 2024 Equity Offering . See Note 9 Income Taxes of the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion of income tax expense. 
 
 Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Non-controlling Interest 
 
 The 50.6 million decrease in net income attributable to non-controlling interest for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 is primarily due to (i) a decrease in net income, (ii) a decrease in Diamondback s ownership of our common stock in the first quarter of 2024 following the completion of the Diamondback Offering, and (iii) a decrease in Diamondback s ownership of our common stock in the third quarter of 2024 following the completion of the 2024 Equity Offering . 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Overview of Sources and Uses of Cash 
 
 As we pursue our business and financial strategy, we regularly consider which capital resources, including cash flow, equity and debt financings are available to meet our future financial obligations and liquidity requirements. Our future ability to grow proved reserves will be highly dependent on the capital resources available to us. Our primary sources of liquidity have been cash flows from operations, proceeds from sales of non-core assets, equity and debt offerings and borrowings under the Operating Company s revolving credit facility. Our primary uses of cash have been dividends to our stockholders, Operating Company distributions to the holders of Operating Company units, repayments of debt, capital expenditures for the acquisition of our mineral and royalty interests in oil and natural gas properties, including the Tumbleweed Acquisitions and repurchases of our Class A Common Stock. At September 30, 2024, we had approximately 1.0 billion of liquidity consisting of 168.6 million in cash and cash equivalents and 850.0 million available under the Ope rating Company s revolving credit facility . See further discussion of changes in our sources of cash in Capital Resource s below. 
 
 30 

Table of Contents 

Our working capital requirements are supported by our cash and cash equivalents and the Operating Company s revolving credit facility. We may draw on the Operating Company s revolving credit facility to meet short-term cash requirements, or issue debt or equity securities as part of our longer-term liquidity and capital management program. Because of the alternatives available to us as discussed above, we believe that our short-term and long-term liquidity are adequate to fund not only our current operations, but also our near-term and long-term funding requirements including future acquisitions of mineral and royalty interests, dividends, debt service obligations, repayment of debt maturities, repurchases of our Class A Common Stock and one or more series of the Notes and any amounts that may ultimately be paid in connection with contingencies. 
 
 In order to mitigate volatility in oil and natural gas prices, we have entered into commodity derivative contracts as discussed further in Part II. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Commodity Price Risk . 
 
 Continued prolonged volatility in the capital, financial and/or credit markets due to the war in Ukraine, the Israel-Hamas war and other conflicts in the Middle East, and/or adverse macroeconomic conditions, including higher interest rates, global supply chain disruptions and actions taken by OPEC members and other exporting nations may limit our access to, or increase our cost of, capital or make capital unavailable on terms acceptable to us or at all. Although we expect that our sources of funding will be adequate to fund our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements, we cannot assure you that the needed capital will be available on acceptable terms or at all. 

Cash Flows 
 
 The following table presents our cash flows for the periods indicated: 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (In thousands) Cash flow data: 
 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities 461,700 492,397 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities (183,378) (176,749) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities (135,542) (187,013) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents 142,780 128,635 
 
 Operating Activities 
 
 Our operating cash flow is sensitive to many variables, the most significant of which are the volatility of prices for oil and natural gas and the volumes of oil and natural gas sold by our producers. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily driven by (i) a reduction in related party lease bonus income, (ii) an increase in cash paid for interest expense due to the issuance of our 7.375 Senior unsecured notes due 2031 in the fourth quarter of 2023, (iii) an increase in cash paid for taxes, and (iv) an increase in cash costs for production and ad valorem taxes and payments to Diamondback related to the change in reimbursement methodology under the Services and Secondment Agreement. These decreases in cash flow were offset by (i) an increase in royalty income, (ii) a decrease in cash paid for derivatives, and (iii) other changes in our working capital accounts. See Results of Operations for discussion of significant changes in our revenues and expenses. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 
 Net cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily related to the Q M Acquisitions and acquisitions of oil and natural gas interests from third parties, partially offset by proceeds from the divestiture of our non-Permian assets. 
 
 Net cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily related to acquisitions of oil and natural gas interests from third parties and in the Drop Down. 
 
 31 

Table of Contents 

Financing Activities 
 
 Net cash used in financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to 348.4 million of dividends paid to stockholders and net repayments of 263.0 million on the Operating Company s revolving credit facility, offset by proceeds of 475.9 million from the 2024 Equity Offering . 
 
 Net cash used in financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily resulted from distributions of 212.1 million and common unit repurchases of 67.2 million. These cash outflows were partially offset by net borrowings of 98.0 million under the Operating Company s revolving credit facility. 

Capital Resources 
 
 The Operating Company s Revolving Credit Facility 
 
 At September 30, 2024, the Operating Company s credit facility, which matures on September 22, 2028 , had an elected commitment amount of 850.0 million, with no outstanding borrowings and 850.0 million of availability. See Note 6 Debt of the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional discussion of our outstanding debt at September 30, 2024. 
 
 On October 1, 2024, we completed the TWR Acquisition as discussed in Note 13 Subsequent Events of the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements. Approximately 280.0 million of the cash consideration for this transaction was funded through borrowings under the Operating Company s credit facility, reducing the amount that remained available for future borrowings under this facility to 570.0 million as of October 1, 2024. 

Capital Requirements 
 
 Repurchases of Securities 
 
 Under our current common stock repurchase program, the board of directors has authorized us to acquire up to 750.0 million of our Class A Common Stock, excluding excise tax. As of September 30, 2024, 434.2 million remains avail able for use to repurchase shares under this repurchase program. 
 
 We may also from time to time opportunistically repurchase some of the outstanding Notes in open market purchases or in privately negotiated transactions. 
 
 Cash Dividends 
 
 The Operating Company will pay a cash distribution for the third quarter of 2024 in accordance with its distribution policy of 0.73 per Operating Company unit on November 21, 2024 to eligible holders of record at the close of business on November 14, 2024. The dividend declared on the Operating Company units gives effect to the Operating Company units issued to TWR IV on October 1, 2024, as discussed above in Recent Developments . 
 
 We will pay a cash dividend for the third quarter of 2024 in accordance with our dividend policy of 0.61 per share of Class A Common Stock on November 21, 2024 to eligible holders of record at the close of business on November 14, 2024. The dividend to stockholders consists of a base quarterly dividend of 0.30 per share of Class A Common Stock and a variable quarterly dividend of 0.31 per share of Class A Common Stock. Future base and variable dividends are at the discretion of the board of directors. 
 
 See Note 7 Stockholders' Equity of the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the repurchase program and dividends.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 We are exposed to market risk, including the effects of adverse changes in commodity prices and interest rates as described below. The primary objective of the following information is to provide quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks. The term market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in oil and natural gas prices and interest rates. The disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses, but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses. 
 
 Commodity Price Risk 
 
 Our major market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to the oil and natural gas production of our operators. Realized prices are driven primarily by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and prices for natural gas in the United States. Both crude oil and natural gas realized prices are also impacted by the quality of the product, supply and demand balances in local physical markets and the availability of transportation to demand centers. Pricing for oil and natural gas production has been historically volatile and unpredictable and the prices that our operators receive for production depend on many factors outside of our or their control, as discussed in Item 2. Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview of Sources and Uses of Cash . We cannot predict events that may lead to future price volatility and the near term energy outlook remains subject to heightened levels of uncertainty. 
 
 We historically have used fixed price swap contracts, fixed price basis swap contracts and costless collars with corresponding put and call options to reduce price volatility associated with certain of our royalty income as discussed in Note 10 Derivatives of the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 
 At September 30, 2024 , we had a net asset derivative position related to our commodity price derivatives of 4.6 million. Utilizing actual derivative contractual volumes under our contracts as of September 30, 2024, a 10 increase in forward curves associated with the underlying commodity would have decreased the net asset position by 2.6 million to approximately 2.0 million, while a 10 decrease in forward curves associated with the underlying commodity would have increased the net asset derivative position by 5.0 million to approximately 9.6 million. However, certain cash derivative gains or losses may be partially offset by a decrease or increase, respectively, in the actual sales value of production covered by the derivative instrument. 
 
 Credit Risk 
 
 We are subject to risk resulting from the concentration of royalty income in producing oil and natural gas interests and receivables with a limited number of significant purchasers and producers. We do not require collateral and the failure or inability of our significant purchasers to meet their obligations to us due to their liquidity issues, bankruptcy, insolvency or liquidation may adversely affect our financial results. Volatility in the commodity pricing environment and macroeconomic conditions may enhance our purchaser credit risk. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 
 We are subject to market risk exposure related to changes in interest rates on our indebtedness under the Operating Company s revolving credit facility. The terms of the credit facility provide for interest on borrowings at a floating rate equal to (i) term SOFR plus 0.10 Adjusted Term SOFR ), or (ii) an alternate base rate (which is equal to the greatest of the prime rate, the Federal Funds effective rate plus 0.50 , and 1-month Adjusted Term SOFR plus 1.00 ), in each case plus the applicable margin. The applicable margin ranges from 1.00 to 2.00 per annum in the case of the alternative base rate and from 2.00 to 3.00 per annum in the case of Adjusted Term SOFR, in each case depending on the amount of the loans outstanding in relation to the commitment, which is calculated using the least of the maximum credit amount, the aggregate elected commitment amount and the borrowing base. We are obligated to pay a quarterly commitment fee ranging from 0.375 to 0.500 per year on the unused portion of the commitment. As of September 30, 2024, we had no outstanding borrowings. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the weighted average interest rate on the Operating Company s revolving credit facility was 7.51 and 7.52 , respectively.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures . Under the direction of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have established disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. The disclosure controls and procedures are also intended to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) under our Exchange Act. Based upon our evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting . Management s assessment of, and conclusion on, the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of the entities acquired in the Q M Acquisitions on September 3, 2024. Under guidelines established by the SEC, companies are permitted to exclude acquisitions from their assessment of internal control over financial reporting during the first year of an acquisition while integrating the acquired company. The Company is in the process of integrating the entities acquired in the Q M Acquisitions and our internal controls over financial reporting. As a result of these integration activities, certain controls will be evaluated and may be changed. Except as noted above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the third quarter of 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, internal controls over financial reporting. 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 
 Due to the nature of our business, we are, from time to time, involved in routine litigation or subject to disputes or claims related to our business activities. In the opinion of our management, none of the pending litigation, disputes or claims against us, if decided adversely, will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. See Note 12 Commitments and Contingencies of the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 
 Our business faces many risks. Any of the risks discussed in this report and our other SEC filings could have a material impact on our business, financial position or results of operations. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also materially impair our business operations, financial condition or future results. 
 
 As of the date of this filing, we continue to be subject to the risk factors previously disclosed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 22, 2024, and in subsequent filings we make with the SEC. Except as discussed below, there have been no material changes in our risk factors from those described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 We may be unable to realize anticipated cash flows or other benefits from the Tumbleweed Acquisitions . 
 
 Our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits from the Tumbleweed Acquisitions will depend in part upon an assessment of several factors, including: 
 
 recoverable reserves; 
 future natural gas and oil prices and their appropriate differentials; 
 34 

Table of Contents 

existing and future production on the mineral and royalty acreage subject to the Tumbleweed Acquisitions and the operators plans with respect to such acreage; 
 any title defects; and 
 environmental and other regulatory, permitting and similar matters. 
 
 The accuracy of these assessments is inherently uncertain. In connection with these assessments, we have performed a review of the subject properties that we believe to be generally consistent with industry practices. Our review may not reveal all existing or potential problems or permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the assets to fully assess their deficiencies and potential recoverable reserves. Inspections will not always be performed on every well, and structural and environmental problems are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken. The integration process may be subject to delays or changed circumstances, and we can give no assurance that the acquired mineral and royalty interests will generate cash flow in accordance with our expectations. Significant acquisitions, including the Tumbleweed Acquisitions, and other strategic transactions may involve other risks that may cause our business to be adversely impacted, including: 
 
 diversion of our management s attention to evaluating and negotiating significant acquisitions and strategic transactions; and 
 the failure to realize the full benefit that we expect in estimated proved reserves, production volume or other benefits anticipated from an acquisition, or to realize these benefits within the expected time frame.

The amount of any such indemnification obligation of, or deemed distribution of cash to, a Member or former Member in respect of an imputed underpayment under Section 6225 of the Code shall be reduced to the extent that the Company receives a reduction in the amount of the imputed underpayment under Section 6225(c) of the Code which, in the determination of the Managing Member, is attributable to actions taken by, the tax status or attributes of, or tax information provided by or attributable to, such Managing Member or former Member pursuant to or described in Section 6225(c) of the Code. 
 (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Managing Member is authorized to take any action determined, in its discretion, to be necessary or appropriate to cause the Company and other Group Members to comply with any withholding requirements established under the Code or any other federal, state or local law including pursuant to Sections 1441, 1442, 1445 and 1446 of the Code. To the extent that the Company is required or elects to withhold and pay over to any taxing authority any amount resulting from the allocation of distribution of income or from a distribution to any Member (including by reason of Section 1446 of the Code), the amount withheld may at the discretion of the Managing Member be treated by the Company as a distribution of cash pursuant to Section 6.3 or Section 12.4(c) in the amount of such withholding from such Member.
