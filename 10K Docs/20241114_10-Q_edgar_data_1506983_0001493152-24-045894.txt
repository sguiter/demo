was determined based on a rating model using a debt discount rate of which represented the Company s applicable rate of risk.
The fair value of the June 27 Warrants was determined by using Black-Scholes pricing model taking into account, inter alia, expected stock
price volatility of and risk-free interest rate of . The amount allocated to June 27 Warrants was classified as a component
of permanent equity (as their terms permit the holders to receive a fixed number of shares of common stock upon exercise for a fixed exercise
price). 
 
 The

 Convertible Promissory Notes 

On
 July 18, 2024, the Company entered into a series of convertible promissory notes with three directors, and one member of the
 Company s executive management (the July 18 Investors ), providing for the private placement of unsecured
 convertible promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of 
 (the July 18 Notes and each a July 18 Note ). 
 
 The
 July 18 Notes bear simple interest at a rate of 
 per annum. Interest on the outstanding principal will accrue and, unless converted earlier as set forth below, be due and payable on
 (i) the 12-month anniversary of the date hereof, or (ii) the closing date of a Qualified Financing, as defined herein (the
 Maturity Date ). 
 
 Except
 regarding the conversion of the July 18 Notes as discussed below, the Company may not prepay the July 18 Notes without the written
 consent of the July 18 Investors. If not sooner repaid, all outstanding principal and accrued but unpaid interest on the July 18
 Notes (the July 18 Note Balance ), as of the close of business on the day immediately preceding the date of the closing
 of the next issuance and sale of capital stock of the Company, in a single transaction or series of related transactions, to
 investors resulting in gross proceeds to the Company of at least 
 (excluding indebtedness converted in such financing) (a Qualified Financing ), will automatically be converted into
 that number of shares of equity securities of the Company sold in the Qualified Financing equal to the number of shares calculated
 by dividing (X) the July 18 Note Balance by (Y) an amount equal to the price per share or other unit of equity securities issued in
 such Qualified Financing, and otherwise on the same terms as the security issued in the Qualified Financing, provided that the
 conversion price per share shall not be lower than . 
 
 Upon
 the occurrence of an Event of Default (as defined below), each July 18 Investors may, by written notice to the Company, declare the
 July 18 Note to be due immediately and payable with respect to the July 18 Note Balance. An Event of Default means (i)
 failure by the Company to pay the July 18 Note Balance on the Maturity Date, (ii) voluntary bankruptcy, or (iii) involuntary
 bankruptcy. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default specified in clause (iii) above, the July 18 Note Balance shall automatically
 and immediately become due and payable, in all cases without any action on the part of any July 18 Investors. 
 
 Upon initial date, the management measured the fair value of the embedded
conversion feature which is accounted for as embedded derivative liability. The difference between the total gross cash proceeds received
and the fair value of the embedded conversion feature is allocated to July 18 Notes that are measured at amortized cost under which in
subsequent periods the Company recognizes a discount expense over the economic life of the July 18 Notes based on the effective interest
rate method. However, the fair value of the embedded derivative liability related to the conversion feature was determined by the management
at an insignificant amount since upon closing of a Qualified Financing the conversion will be done based on market conditions (i.e. conversion
price will be equal to the fair value of the share upon conversion) and thus all proceeds received of were allocated to the July
18 Notes.

amount of the July 18 Notes during the period of nine months ended September 30, 2024:

 convertible promissory note in the aggregate principal amount of 
 (the July 30 Note ). The July 30 Note is not convertible until and unless approved at a meeting of the Company s
 stockholders (the Stockholder Approval ). 

The
July 30 Note bears simple interest at a rate of 
per annum and is due and payable in cash on earlier of: . The July 30 Note is secured by a first-priority security interest on all Company s assets. 

Except
regarding the conversion of the July 30 Note or a Sale Transaction as discussed below, the Company may not prepay the July 30 Note
without the written consent of the July 30 Holder. If Stockholder Approval is obtained, the July 30 Note 
per share for a period of 5 consecutive trading days, will automatically convert at a price equal to the 5 daily Volume Weighted
Average Price VWAP of the Common Stock (subject to adjustment for any stock split, stock dividend, reverse stock
split, combination or similar transaction). 

Upon
Sale Transaction on or prior to the Maturity Date, the Company will repay the July 30 Holder, at the July 30 Holder s
election, as follows: 

Upon
the occurrence of an Event of Default (defined below), the July 30 Holder may, by written notice to the Company, declare the Note to
be due immediately and payable with respect to the July 30 Note balance. An Event of Default means ,
(iii) voluntary bankruptcy, or (iv) involuntary bankruptcy. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default specified in clause (iii)
above, the July 30 Note balance shall automatically and immediately become due and payable, in all cases without any action on the
part of the July 30 Holder. 

Each
July 30 Warrant becomes exercisable 12 months after its issuance and has term of 
 years. The July 30 Warrants are exercisable for
cash only and have no price-based antidilution. The first July 30 Warrant is for 
 shares at 
 per share. The second July 30 Warrant is for
 
 shares at 
 per share. The third July 30 Warrant is for 
 shares at

At
the initial date, the Company has issued two instruments that include (i) a financial instrument that is considered as host 
which comprised of July 30 Note and two embedded derivative financial instruments (i.e. an embedded conversion feature and an embedded
redemption feature to receive cash equals to of July 30 Note balance upon Sale Transaction) and (ii) three series of detachable
warrants. At the initial date, the Company is required to estimate the fair value of both two instruments and allocate the total gross
proceeds received between them based on that relative fair value identified. The fair value of the embedded derivative financial instruments
(i.e. the conversion right and the redemption right) should be bifurcated from the host instrument and remeasured on recurring basis
at each reporting period under marked to market approach, the July 30 Note is accounted for under carrying amount whereby discount and
interest expenses are recorded over the economic life of the July 30 Note based on the effective interest rate method and the July 30
Warrants are classified into equity without any further subsequent measurement.

In
 consideration for the sale of the Purchased Assets to the Company, at the Closing Date, the Company paid to Seller cash
 in the amount of one dollar and obligated to issue up to shares of Common Stock to be issued based upon specified performance
 milestones as set forth in the Agreement (the Purchase Price ). In addition, if upon the final issuance, the aggregate
 shares represent less than of the then outstanding Common Stock of the Company, the final issuance will include such

1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

Overview 

We
are a medical device company focused on the design, development and commercialization of novel technologies for use by people with diabetes.
We are currently developing an Implantable CBGM for those with Type 1 diabetes and insulin-dependent Type 2 diabetes. 

The
Company was founded with a mission to develop Glucotrack , a non-invasive glucose monitoring device designed to help people with diabetes
and pre-diabetics obtain glucose level readings without the pain, inconvenience, cost and difficulty of conventional (invasive) spot
finger stick devices. The first generation Glucotrack, which successfully received CE Mark approval, obtained glucose measurements via
a small sensor clipped onto one s earlobe. A limited release beta test in Europe and the Middle East demonstrated the need for
an updated product with improved accuracy and human factors. As the glucose monitoring landscape rapidly moved away from point-in-time
measurement to continuous measurement since then, the Company recently determined that it would focus its efforts on developing its Implantable
CBGM. As such, we have since withdrawn our CE Mark for Glucotrack and are no longer pursuing commercialization of this product or development
of any further iterations. 

The
Company is currently developing an Implantable CBGM for use by Type 1 diabetes patients as well as insulin-dependent Type 2
patients. Implant longevity is key to the success of such a device. We have continued to evolve our sensor chemistry following our
successful in-vitro feasibility study demonstrating that a minimum two-year implant life is highly probable with the current sensor
design. Recently we announced a 3-year longevity is feasible leveraging both in-vitro and in-silico test results. We have also
completed four animal studies with evolving prototype systems, all four of which consistently demonstrated a simple implant
procedure, good functionality, and safety. The Company has also successfully demonstrated continuous glucose sensing in the
epidural space via two additional animal trials, both of which demonstrated a simple implant procedure, good functionality, and
safety. This latter approach is of importance for patients with painful diabetic neuropathy contemplating spinal cord
stimulation therapy for their condition. The results of these animal trials were recently presented in poster form at the American Diabetes Association, the
Diabetes Technology Society, and the DiabetesMine annual conferences. 

A regulatory submission has been made for a first in human study. This will be an acute study intended to demonstrate
device performance and safety. All preparatory clinical activities are complete and the study is expected to initiate in Q4 2024, pending
regulatory approval. In parallel, the Company is also preparing for a long-term clinical trial expected to begin in late Q2 2024. As part
of this effort, the Company is working towards ISO13485 certification, an internationally agreed-upon standard of quality system requirements
for the design, production, distribution, and sale of medical devices. The Company has successfully completed the first audit and is scheduled
to complete the second audit in December 2024. A successful second audit results in certification of compliance to the standard, which
is recognized and accepted by the FDA, the European Union, and many other geographies worldwide. 

We believe our technology, if successful, has the potential to be more accurate, more
convenient and have a longer duration than other implantable glucose monitors that are either in the market or currently under
development.

per share for aggregate gross proceeds of 500,000 to certain members of our executive management, Board of Directors and existing shareholders. 

On
April 26, 2024, we held our Annual Meeting of Shareholders (the Annual Meeting under which our stockholders approved,
inter alia, the following proposals: (i) adoption of our 2024 Equity Incentive Plan; (ii) approved of an amendment to Article IV of our
Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, to effect a reverse stock split of the Company s Common Stock at a ratio of between one-for-five
and one-for-thirty, with such ratio to be determined at the sole discretion of the Board of Directors. Following the Annual Meeting,
on April 30, 2024, the Board of Directors approved a one-for-five reverse split of our issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock
(the Reverse Stock Split ). On May 17, 2024, we filed a Certificate of Amendment to the Company s Certificate of Incorporation
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware which effected the Reverse Stock Split. 

On
June 27, 2024, the Board of Directors approved us to enter into note and warrant purchase agreements with certain investors, providing
for the private placement of unsecured promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of 100,000 (the Notes and warrants
(the Warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 300,000 shares of our Common Stock. The closing of the private placement
occurred on July 1, 2024. The Notes bear simple interest at the rate of 3 per annum and are due and payable in cash on the earlier of:
(a) twelve months from the date of the Note; or (b) the date we raise third-party equity capital in an amount equal to or in excess of
 1,000,000 (the Maturity Date ). We may prepay the Notes at any time prior to the Maturity Date without penalty. If an event
of default occurs, the then-outstanding principal amount of the Notes plus any unpaid accrued interest will accelerate and become immediately
payable in cash. Each Warrant has an exercise price of 4.95 per share. The Warrants are immediately exercisable and have a five-year
term. 

On
July 18, 2024, we entered into a series of convertible promissory notes with certain investors which including three of our directors and one member of our executive management, providing for the private placement
of unsecured convertible promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of 360,000 (the Notes and each a
 Note ). The Notes bear simple interest at the rate of 8 per annum and are due and payable in cash on the earlier of:

computed on the basis of a 365-day year. 

On
July 30, 2024, we entered into a convertible promissory note and three warrant agreements (the Warrants with an
existing investor (the Holder ), providing for the private placement of a secured convertible promissory note in the
aggregate principal amount of 4,000,000 (the Note ). The Note was not convertible until and the approval at a meeting
of our stockholders. The Note bears simple
interest at the rate of 8 per annum and is due and payable in cash on the earlier of: (i) 12 months anniversary of Note, or (ii)
the date of closing of a Sale Transaction (as defined above) (the Maturity Date ). The Note is secured by a
first-priority security interest on all our assets. Each Warrant becomes exercisable 12 months after its issuance and has term of 10
years. The Warrants are exercisable for cash only and have no price-based antidilution. The first Warrant is for 2,133,334 shares at
 1.875 per share. The second Warrant is for 1,523,810 shares at 2.625 per share. The third Warrant is for 1,185,186 shares at
 3.375 per share. 

On August 23, 2024, two of the June 27 Investors entered into conversion agreements with us, pursuant to which we
agreed to convert the principal amount, plus any accrued but unpaid interest pursuant to each of the June 27 Notes, totalling approximately
 20,076 each, held by the Investors to Common Stock at a conversion price of 1.02 per share. On October 15, 2024, we issued 19,682 shares
of common stock for each of the two of the June 27 Investors in respect of each respective debt converted. In satisfaction of the debt,
we also issued to each of the two June 27 Investors three warrants (each an August 23 Warrant ). Each August 23 Warrant becomes
exercisable on August 16, 2025 and has term of 10 years. The August 23 Warrants are exercisable for cash only and have no price-based
antidilution. The first August 23 Warrant is for 10,707 shares of Common Stock and is exercisable at 1.875 per share. The second August
23 Warrant is for 7,648 shares of Common Stock, exercisable at 2.625 per share. The third August 23 Warrant is for 5,948 shares of Common
Stock, exercisable at 3.375 per share. 

On September 5, 2024, one of the June 27 Investors and July 18 Investors entered into a conversion agreement with
us, pursuant to which we agreed to convert outstanding board fees and the principal amount, plus any accrued but unpaid interest pursuant
to the June 27 Investor s June 27 Note, totalling 259,300, held by the Investor to Common Stock at a conversion price of 1.02
per share. On October 15, 2024, we issued 254,226 shares of common stock for the June 27 Investor in respect of the Debt converted. In
satisfaction of the debt, we issued to the July 18 Investor three warrants (each an September 5 Warrant ). Each September
5 Warrant becomes exercisable on August 16, 2025 and has term of 10 years. The September 5 Warrants are exercisable for cash only and
have no price-based antidilution. The first September 5 Warrant is for 138,299 shares of Common Stock and is exercisable at 1.875 per

The
summary of our significant accounting policies is included under Item 7 - Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations of our fiscal 2023 Form 10-K. An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate
to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, if different estimates reasonably
could have been used, or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements. There
have been no material changes to the critical accounting policies and estimates as filed in such report.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

To
date, we have not generated any revenues and have experienced net losses and negative cash flows from our activities. 

Since
our incorporation, we have devoted substantially all our resources to research and product development and providing general and administrative
support for these activities. Since our incorporation, we have incurred significant losses and negative cash flows from operations. During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred a net loss of approximately 12.5 million and used 9.0 million of cash in our
operations. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately 122.7 million. We expect to continue to incur significant
and increasing losses and do not expect positive cash flows from operations for the foreseeable future, and our net losses may fluctuate
significantly from period to period depending on the timing of and expenditures on our research and development activities. 

As
of September 30, 2024, the balance of cash and cash equivalents of approximately 346,000, together with the net proceeds in total
amount of 8,873 which expected to be received upon closing of a public offering through registration statements on Form S-1 on
November 14, 2024, is insufficient for the Company to realize its business plans for the twelve-month period subsequent to the
reporting period. 

Results
of Operations 

The
following discussion of our operating results explains material changes in our results of operations for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2024 compared with the same periods ended September 30, 2023. The discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial
statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report. 

Consolidated
Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 

Research
and development expenses 

Research
and development expenses were approximately 2.1 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, as compared to approximately
 1.7 million for the prior-year period. The increase is attributable to ramping up product development actives. 

Research
and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel-related expenses, materials, animal trials, production labor
and other expenses. We expect research and development expenses to increase in 2025 and beyond, primarily due to hiring additional
personnel, as well clinical trials for the Glucotrack CBGM; however, we may adjust or allocate the level of our research and development
expenses based on available financial resources and based on our commercial needs, including the FDA registration process, specific requirements
from customers, development of new Glucotrack CBGM models and others. 

Marketing
expenses 

Marketing
expenses were approximately 0.1 million for the three-month period ended September 30,
2024, as compared to 0 for the prior-year period. This increase is primarily attributable
to business development personnel and professional marketing services. 

General
and administrative expenses 

General
and administrative expenses were approximately 1.1 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, as compared to approximately
 0.5 million for the prior-year period. The increase is attributable to professional fees we accrued during the period. 

General
and administrative expenses consist primarily of professional services, salaries, consulting fees, insurance, travel expenses and other
related expenses for executive, finance and administrative personnel, including stock-based compensation expenses. Other general and
administrative costs and expenses include facility-related costs not otherwise included in research and development costs and expenses,
and professional fees for legal and accounting services. 

24 

Finance (income)
expenses net 

Finance
expenses, net was approximately 1.9 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, as compared to finance income of
approximately 0.001 million for the prior-year period. This increase was primarily due to 1.5 million in revaluation expenses
incurred from settlement of financial liabilities and 0.3 million in discount amortization and interest expenses. 

Net
Loss 

Net
loss was approximately 5.1 million for the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, as compared to approximately 2.2 million for
the prior-year period. The increase in net loss is attributable primarily to the increase in our operating expenses, as described above. 

Consolidated
Results of Operations for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 

Research
and development expenses 

Research
and development expenses were approximately 7.8 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, as compared to approximately
 3.0 million for the prior-year period. The increase is attributable to professional fees we accrued during the period. 

Research
and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel-related expenses, materials, animal trials and other expenses.
We expect research and development expenses to increase in 2025 and beyond, primarily due to hiring additional personnel,
as clinical trials for the Glucotrack CBGM; however, we may adjust or allocate the level of our research and development expenses based
on available financial resources and based on our commercial needs, including the FDA registration process, specific requirements from
customers, development of new Glucotrack CBGM models and others. 

Marketing
expenses 

Marketing
expenses were approximately 0.3 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, as compared
to 0 for the prior-year period. This increase is primarily attributable to business development
personnel and professional marketing services. 

General
and administrative expenses 

General
and administrative expenses were approximately 2.6 million for the nine-month period ended September
 30, 2024, as compared to approximately 1.7 million for the prior-year period. The increase is attributable to professional fees
we accrued during the period. 

General
and administrative expenses consist primarily of professional services, salaries, consulting fees, insurance, travel expenses and other
related expenses for executive, finance and administrative personnel, including stock-based compensation expenses. Other general and
administrative costs and expenses include facility-related costs not otherwise included in research and development costs and expenses,
and professional fees for legal and accounting services. 

Finance
(income) expenses, net 

Finance
expenses, net was approximately 1.8 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, as compared to finance income, net
of approximately 0.002 million for the prior-year period. This increase was primarily due to 1.5 million in revaluation expenses
incurred from settlement of financial liabilities and 0.3 million in discount amortization and interest expenses. 

Net
Loss 

Net
loss was approximately 12.5 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024,
as compared to approximately 4.7 million for the prior-year period. The increase in net loss is attributable primarily to the increase
in our operating expenses, as described above. 

25 

Cash
Flows for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 

Operating
Activities 

Net
cash used in operating activities for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 9.0 million primarily due to
the net loss of approximately 12.5 million offset by non-cash charges of 2.3 million and an increase in working capital excluding cash
of 1.2 million. Net cash used in operating activities for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2023 was approximately 4.1 million
primarily due to the net loss of 4.7 million. 

Investing
Activities 

Net
cash used in investing activities was 0.1 million and 0 for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Net
cash used in investing activities primarily reflects the purchasing of fixed assets. 

Financing
Activities 

Net
cash provided by financing activities was approximately 5.0 million and 8.7 million for the nine-month periods ended September 30,
2024 and 2023, respectively. Net cash provided by financing activities primarily reflects the proceeds received from private placement
transaction in 2024 versus net proceeds received upon completion of public offering. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

As
of September 30, 2024, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K. 

Critical
Accounting Policies 

This
Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations discuss our financial statements, which have
been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S. GAAP ).
In connection with the preparation of our financial statements, we are required to make assumptions and estimates about future events
and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, expenses and the related disclosures. We base our assumptions,
estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time
our condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared. On a regular basis, management reviews the accounting policies, assumptions,
estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, because
future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates,
and such differences could be material. 

Going
Concern Uncertainty 

The
development of the implantable continuous glucose sensor product is expected to require substantial further expenditures. We remain dependent
upon external sources for financing our operations. Since inception, we have incurred substantial accumulated losses and negative operating
cash flow and have a significant accumulated deficit. We do not have any committed external source of funds or other support for our
development efforts, and we cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Until we can
generate sufficient revenue to finance our cash requirements, which we may never do, we expect to finance our future cash needs through
a combination of public or private equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, government funding, strategic alliances, licensing
arrangements, and other marketing or distribution arrangements, any of which may include terms that may adversely affect our stockholders 
rights. If we are unable to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts or on acceptable terms, we may have to significantly delay,
scale back or discontinue our development or commercialization initiatives. Any of the above events could significantly harm our business,
prospects, financial condition and results of operations and cause the price of our common stock to decline. We believe that our cash on hand as of September 30, 2024, together with
the net proceeds expected to be received upon closing of a public offering through registration statements on Form S-1 on November 14,
2024, will not provide sufficient working capital to fund its current operations and animal trial program
for the development of its Implantable CGM for a period of twelve-months subsequent to the reporting period.

Item
4. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our
management, with the participation of our Principal Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of
our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September
30, 2024 (the Evaluation Date ). Based on such evaluation, those officers have concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date,
our disclosure controls and procedures are ineffective in recording, processing, summarizing and reporting, on a timely basis, information
required to be included in periodic filings under the Exchange Act and that such information is not accumulated and communicated to management,
including our principal executive and financial officers, in a manner sufficient to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure,
due to the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting related to lack of sufficient internal accounting personnel,
segregation of duties, and lack of sufficient internal controls (including IT general controls) that encompass the Company as a whole
with respect to entity and transactions level controls in order to ensure complete documentation of complex and non-routine transactions
and adequate financial reporting. 

Management
has identified corrective actions to remediate such material weaknesses, which includes hiring additional employees and engaging in external
financial reporting consultants. Management intends to implement procedures to remediate such material weaknesses during the fiscal year
2025; however, the implementation of these initiatives may not fully address any material weaknesses that we may have in our internal
control over financial reporting. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART
II - OTHER INFORMATION 

Item
1. Legal Proceedings 

From
time to time in the ordinary course of business, the Company may be subject to various claims, charges, and litigation. At September
30, 2024, except as described in the preceding paragraph, the Company did not have any pending claims, charges or litigation that were
expected to have a material adverse impact on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

Item
1A. Risk Factors. 

You
should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A., Risk Factors in our Annual Report for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2023, which could materially affect our business, financial position, or future results of operations. The risks described
in our Annual Report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties
not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business, financial position,
or future results of operations. We may disclose changes to such factors or disclose additional factors from time to time in our future
filings with the SEC. The risk factor set forth below supplements and updates the risk factors previously disclosed and should be read
together with the risk factors described in our Annual Report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 and with any risk factors we
may include in subsequent periodic filings with the SEC. 

We
may fail to select or capitalize on the most scientifically, clinically or commercially promising or profitable product candidates. 

Given
the current momentum for continuous glucose monitoring CGM in the diabetes market, we have announced our decision to
reset our priorities, improve our commercial outlook and refine our business strategy to focus on our implantable CGM technology. Should
our efforts to focus on CGM not be successful, we will need to further evaluate our business strategy and, as a result, our Board of
Directors may decide that it is in the best interest of our stockholders to dissolve our Company and liquidate our assets or otherwise
modify our strategy in the future. In this regard, we may, from time to time, focus our product development efforts on different product
candidates or may delay, suspend or terminate the future development of a product candidate at any time for strategic, business, financial
or other reasons. As a result of changes in our strategy, we have and may in the future change or refocus our existing product development,
commercialization and manufacturing activities. This could require changes in our facilities and our personnel. Any product development
changes that we implement may not be successful. In particular, we may fail to select or capitalize on the most scientifically, clinically
or commercially promising or profitable product candidates. Our decisions to allocate our research and development, management and financial
resources toward particular product candidates may not lead to the development of viable commercial products and may divert resources
from better opportunities. Similarly, our decisions to delay or terminate product development programs may also prove to be incorrect
and could cause us to miss valuable opportunities.

Our
failure to maintain compliance with Nasdaq s continued listing requirements could result in the delisting of our Common Stock. 

Our
common stock is currently listed for trading on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC. We must satisfy the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq,
to maintain the listing of our common stock on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC. 

On
May 26, 2023, we received notice from the Staff indicating that, based upon the closing bid price of our common stock for the prior 30
consecutive business days, we were not currently in compliance with the requirement to maintain a minimum bid price of 1.00 per share
for continued listing on Nasdaq as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the Bid Price Rule ). We had 180 days from
May 26, 2023, or through November 22, 2023, to regain compliance with the Bid Price Rule. 

On
November 24, 2023, we received a second letter from Nasdaq notifying the Company that it had been granted an additional 180 calendar
days, or until May 20, 2024 (the Extended Compliance Period ), to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement
in accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A). 

On
May 21, 2024, we received a third letter from Nasdaq (the Letter notifying us that it had not regained compliance with
the Minimum Bid Price Requirement during the Extended Compliance Period. The Letter also notified us that our Form 10-Q for the period
ended March 31, 2024, indicates that we no longer meet the 2,500,000 minimum stockholders equity requirement for continued listing
set forth under Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) (the Minimum Stockholders Equity Requirement ). Pursuant to Listing Rule
5810(d)(2), the failure to comply with the Minimum Stockholders Equity Requirement has become an additional and separate basis
for delisting. 

Because
we were under review for failure to meet the Minimum Bid Price Requirement, we were not eligible to submit a plan to regain compliance.
Accordingly, unless we would request an appeal of this determination by May 28, 2024, trading of our common stock would be suspended
at the opening of business on May 30, 2024, and a Form 25-NSE would be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ).
We timely requested a hearing before a Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the Panel ). The hearing request would result in a stay of
any suspension or delisting action pending the hearing. On August 5, 2024, we received the decision of the Panel, and they granted us
an extension to November 18, 2024 to regain compliance with the Minimum Stockholders Equity Requirement. 

On
May 17, 2024, in order to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement, we filed a Certificate of Amendment to the Company s
Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware which effected, as of 4:30 p.m. Eastern Time, on May
17, 2024, a one-for-five Reverse Stock Split of our issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock. 

In
the event that we are unable to regain and sustain compliance with all applicable requirements for continued listing on the Nasdaq, our
Common Stock may be delisted from Nasdaq. If our Common Stock were delisted from Nasdaq, trading of our common stock would most likely
take place on an over-the-counter market established for unlisted securities, such as the OTCQB or the Pink Market maintained by OTC
Markets Group Inc. An investor would likely find it less convenient to sell, or to obtain accurate quotations in seeking to buy, our
common stock on an over-the-counter market, and many investors would likely not buy or sell our common stock due to difficulty in accessing
over-the-counter markets, policies preventing them from trading in securities not listed on a national exchange or other reasons. In
addition, as a delisted security, our common stock would be subject to SEC rules as a penny stock, which impose additional
disclosure requirements on broker-dealers. The regulations relating to penny stocks, coupled with the typically higher cost per trade
to the investor of penny stocks due to factors such as broker commissions generally representing a higher percentage of the price of
a penny stock than of a higher-priced stock, would further limit the ability of investors to trade in our common stock. In addition,
delisting would materially and adversely affect our ability to raise capital on terms acceptable to us, or at all, and may result in
the potential loss of confidence by investors, suppliers, customers and employees and fewer business development opportunities. For these
reasons and others, delisting would adversely affect the liquidity, trading volume and price of our common stock, causing the value of
an investment in us to decrease and having an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including
our ability to attract and retain qualified employees and to raise capital. 

We
rely on third parties to manufacture and supply our product. 

We
do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for clinical or commercial production of Glucotrack CBGM, other than a prototype lab.
We have no experience in medical device manufacturing and lack the resources and the capability to manufacture the Glucotrack CBGM on
a commercial scale. 

If
our manufacturing partners are unable to produce our products in the amounts, timing or pricing that we require, we may not be able to
establish a contract and obtain a sufficient alternative supply from another supplier on a timely basis and in the quantities or pricing
we require. We expect to depend on third-party contract manufacturers for the foreseeable future. 

Glucotrack
CBGM does, and our future product candidates, if any, likely will require precise, high quality manufacturing. Any of our contract manufacturers
will be subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and other non-U.S. regulatory authorities to ensure strict compliance
with quality system regulations, including current good manufacturing practices and other applicable government regulations and corresponding
standards. If our contract manufacturers fail to achieve and maintain high manufacturing standards in compliance with quality system
regulations, we may experience manufacturing errors resulting in patient injury or death, product recalls or withdrawals, delays or interruptions
of production or failures in product testing or delivery, delay or prevention of filing or approval of marketing applications for our
products, cost overruns or other problems that could seriously harm our business. 

29 

Any
performance failure on the part of our contract manufacturers could delay clinical development or regulatory clearance or approval of
our product candidates or commercialization of our future product candidates, depriving us of potential product revenue and resulting
in additional losses. In addition, our dependence on a third-party for manufacturing may adversely affect our future profit margins.
Our ability to replace an existing manufacturer may be difficult because the number of potential manufacturers is limited, and the FDA
must approve any replacement manufacturer before it can begin manufacturing our product candidates. Such approval would require additional
non-clinical testing and compliance inspections. It may be difficult or impossible for us to identify and engage a replacement manufacturer
on acceptable terms in a timely manner, or at all. 

Item
2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 

(a)
Except as disclosed below, during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, there were no unregistered sales of our securities that were
not reported in a Current Report on Form 8-K. 

On
August 23, 2024, two investors entered into conversion agreements (the Conversion Agreements with the Company, pursuant
to which the Company agreed to convert the principal amount, plus any accrued but unpaid interest pursuant to two outstanding promissory
notes, totalling 20,076 each (the Debt ), held by the Investors to Common Stock at a conversion price of 1.02 per share. 

Also
in satisfaction of the Debt and pursuant to the Conversion Agreement, the Company issued to each of the two Investors three warrants
(each an August 23 Warrant ). Each August 23 Warrant becomes exercisable on August 16, 2025, and has term of 10 years. The
August 23 Warrants are exercisable for cash only and have no price-based antidilution. The first August 23 Warrant is for 10,707 shares
of Common Stock and is exercisable at 1.875 per share. The second August 23 Warrant is for 7,648 shares of Common Stock, exercisable
at 2.625 per share. The third August 23 Warrant is for 5,948 shares of Common Stock, exercisable at 3.375 per share. 

The
August 23 Warrants and the shares issued in satisfaction of the Debt were issued in reliance on the exemption from registration requirements
thereof provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act. The Company relied on
this exemption from registration based in part on representations made by the investors.
