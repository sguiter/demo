 Non-Consumer Portfolio. The credit quality of dealer financing receivables is evaluated based on our internal dealer risk rating analysis. We use a proprietary model to assign each dealer a risk rating. This model uses historical dealer performance data to identify key factors about a dealer that we consider most significant in predicting a dealer s ability to meet its financial obligations. We also consider numerous other financial and qualitative factors of the dealer s operations, including capitalization and leverage, liquidity and cash flow, profitability, and credit history with ourselves and other creditors. 
 
 Dealers are assigned to one of four groups according to risk ratings as follows: 
 
 Group I strong to superior financial metrics; 
 Group II fair to favorable financial metrics; 
 Group III marginal to weak financial metrics; and 
 Group IV poor financial metrics, including dealers classified as uncollectible.

 days past due. Accounts may be restored to accrual status only when a customer settles all past-due deficiency balances and future payments are reasonably assured. For receivables in non-accrual status, subsequent financing revenue is recognized only to the extent a payment is received. Payments are generally applied first to outstanding interest and then to the unpaid principal balance. 
 
 Loan Modifications. Consumer and non-consumer receivables that have a modified interest rate and/or a term extension (including receivables that were modified in reorganization proceedings pursuant to the U.S. Bankruptcy Code) are typically considered to be loan modifications. We do not grant modifications to the principal balance of our receivables. If a receivable is modified in a reorganization proceeding, all payment requirements of the reorganization plan need to be met before remaining balances are forgiven.

 Charge-offs on finance receivables include uncollected amounts related to principal, interest, late fees, and other allowable charges. Recoveries on finance receivables previously charged off as uncollectible are credited to the allowance for credit losses. In the event we repossess the collateral, the receivable is charged off and the collateral is recorded at its estimated fair value less costs to sell and reported in Other assets on our consolidated balance sheets.

Item 1. Financial Statements (Continued) 
 
 FORD MOTOR CREDIT COMPANY LLC AND SUBSIDIARIES 
 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

NOTE 12. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
 
 Commitments and contingencies primarily consist of guarantees and indemnifications as well as litigation and claims. 
 
 Guarantees and Indemnifications 

The maximum potential payments under these guarantees and limited indemnities totaled million and million at December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, respectively. Of these values, million and million at December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, respectively, were counter-guaranteed by Ford to us. There were no recorded liabilities related to guarantees and limited indemnities at December 31, 2023 or September 30, 2024. 
 
 In some cases, we have guaranteed debt and other financial obligations of outside third parties and unconsolidated affiliates, including Ford. Expiration dates vary, and guarantees will terminate on payment and/or cancellation of the underlying obligation. A payment by us would be triggered by failure of the third party to fulfill its obligation covered by the guarantee. In some circumstances, we are entitled to recover from a third party amounts paid by us under the guarantee. 
 
 In the ordinary course of business, we execute contracts involving indemnifications standard in the industry and indemnifications specific to a transaction, such as the sale of a business. These indemnifications might include and are not limited to claims relating to any of the following: environmental, tax, and shareholder matters; intellectual property rights; governmental regulations and employment-related matters; dealer and other commercial contractual relationships; and financial matters, such as securitizations. Performance under these indemnities generally would be triggered by a breach of contract claim brought by a counterparty or a third-party claim. While some of these indemnifications are limited in nature, many of them do not limit potential payment. Therefore, we are unable to estimate a maximum amount of future payments that could result from claims made under these unlimited indemnities. 
 
 Litigation and Claims 
 
 Various legal actions, proceedings, and claims (generally, matters are pending or may be instituted or asserted against us. These include, but are not limited to, matters arising out of governmental regulations; tax matters; alleged illegal acts resulting in fines or penalties; financial services; employment-related matters; dealer and other contractual relationships; investor matters; and financial reporting matters. Certain of the pending legal actions are, or purport to be, class actions. Some of the matters involve or may involve claims for compensatory, punitive, or antitrust or other treble damages in very large amounts, sanctions, assessments, or other relief, which, if granted, would require very large expenditures. 
 
 The extent of our financial exposure to these matters is difficult to estimate. Many matters do not specify a dollar amount for damages, and many others specify only a jurisdictional minimum. To the extent an amount is asserted, our historical experience suggests that in most instances the amount asserted is not a reliable indicator of the ultimate outcome. 
 
 We accrue for matters when losses are deemed probable and reasonably estimable. In evaluating matters for accrual and disclosure purposes, we take into consideration factors such as our historical experience with matters of a similar nature, the specific facts and circumstances asserted, the likelihood that we will prevail, and the severity of any potential loss. We reevaluate and update our accruals as matters progress over time. 

22 

Item 1. Financial Statements (Continued) 
 
 FORD MOTOR CREDIT COMPANY LLC AND SUBSIDIARIES 
 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

NOTE 12. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES (Continued) 
 
 For nearly all matters where our historical experience with similar matters is of limited value (i.e., non-pattern matters ), we evaluate the matters primarily based on the individual facts and circumstances. For non-pattern matters, we evaluate whether there is a reasonable possibility of a material loss in excess of any accrual that can be estimated. It is reasonably possible that some of the matters for which accruals have not been established could be decided unfavorably and could require us to pay damages or make other expenditures. We do not reasonably expect, based on our analysis, that such matters would have a material effect on future financial statements for a particular year, although such an outcome is possible. 
 
 As noted, the litigation process is subject to many uncertainties, and the outcome of individual matters is not predictable with assurance. Our assessments are based on our knowledge and experience, but the ultimate outcome of any matter could require payment substantially in excess of the amount that we have accrued and/or disclosed.

 Volume and Mix Volume and Mix are primarily reflected within Net financing margin on the consolidated income statements. 
 Volume primarily measures changes in net financing margin driven by changes in average net receivables excluding the allowance for credit losses at prior period financing margin yield (defined below in financing margin) at prior period exchange rates. Volume changes are primarily driven by the volume of new and used vehicles sold and leased, the extent to which we purchase retail financing and operating lease contracts, the extent to which we provide wholesale financing, the sales price of the vehicles financed, the level of dealer inventories, Ford-sponsored special financing programs available exclusively through us, and the availability of cost-effective funding. 
 Mix primarily measures changes in net financing margin driven by period-over-period changes in the composition of our average net receivables excluding the allowance for credit losses by product within each region. 
 
 Financing Margin Financing Margin is reflected within Net financing margin on the consolidated income statements. 
 Financing margin variance is the period-over-period change in financing margin yield multiplied by the present period average net receivables excluding the allowance for credit losses at prior period exchange rates. This calculation is performed at the product and country level and then aggregated. Financing margin yield equals revenue, less interest expense and scheduled depreciation for the period, divided by average net receivables excluding the allowance for credit losses for the same period. 
 Financing margin changes are driven by changes in revenue and interest expense. Changes in revenue are primarily driven by the level of market interest rates, cost assumptions in pricing, mix of business, and competitive environment. Changes in interest expense are primarily driven by the level of market interest rates, borrowing spreads, and asset-liability management. 
 
 Credit Loss Credit Loss is reflected within Provision for credit losses on the consolidated income statements. 
 Credit loss is the change in the provision for credit losses at prior period exchange rates. For analysis purposes, management splits the provision for credit losses into net charge-offs and the change in the allowance for credit losses. 
 Net charge-off changes are primarily driven by the number of repossessions, severity per repossession, and recoveries. Changes in the allowance for credit losses are primarily driven by changes in historical trends in credit losses and recoveries, changes in the composition and size of our present portfolio, changes in trends in historical used vehicle values, and changes in forward looking macroeconomic conditions. For additional information, refer to the Critical Accounting Estimates - Allowance for Credit Losses section of Item 7 of Part II of our 2023 Form 10-K Report. 
 
 Lease Residual Lease Residual is reflected within Depreciation on vehicles subject to operating leases on the consolidated income statements. 
 Lease residual measures changes to residual performance at prior period exchange rates. For analysis purposes, management splits residual performance primarily into residual gains and losses, and the change in accumulated supplemental depreciation. 
 Residual gain and loss changes are primarily driven by the number of vehicles returned to us and sold, and the difference between the auction value and the depreciated value (which includes both base and accumulated supplemental depreciation) of the vehicles sold. Changes in accumulated supplemental depreciation are primarily driven by changes in our estimate of the expected auction value at the end of the lease term and changes in our estimate of the number of vehicles that will be returned to us and sold. Depreciation on vehicles subject to operating leases includes early termination losses on operating leases due to customer default events. For additional information, refer to the Critical Accounting Estimates Accumulated Depreciation on Vehicles Subject to Operating Leases section of Item 7 of Part II of our 2023 Form 10-K Report. 
 
 Exchange Reflects changes in EBT driven by the effects of converting functional currency income to U.S. dollars.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) 

 Other Primarily includes Operating expenses , Other revenue , Insurance expenses, and Other income/(Loss), net on the consolidated income statements at prior period exchange rates. 
 Changes in operating expenses are primarily driven by salaried personnel costs, facilities costs, and costs associated with the origination and servicing of customer contracts. 
 In general, other income/(loss) changes are primarily driven by changes in earnings related to market valuation adjustments to derivatives (primarily related to movements in interest rates), which are included in unallocated risk management, and other miscellaneous items. 
 
 In addition, the following definitions and calculations apply to the charts contained in Item 2 of this Report: 
 
 Cash (as shown in the Funding and Liquidity section) Cash and cash equivalents, Marketable securities , and restricted cash reported on Ford Credit s consolidated balance sheets, excluding amounts related to insurance activities. 
 
 Debt (as shown in the Key Metrics and Leverage tables) Debt on Ford Credit s consolidated balance sheets. Includes debt issued in securitizations and payable only out of collections on the underlying securitized assets and related enhancements. Ford Credit holds the right to receive the excess cash flows not needed to pay the debt issued by, and other obligations of, the securitization entities that are parties to those securitization transactions. 
 
 Earnings Before Taxes Reflects Income before income taxes as reported on our consolidated income statements. 
 
 Loss-to-Receivables LTR Ratio (as shown in Credit Loss tables) LTR ratio is calculated using net charge-offs divided by average finance receivables, excluding unearned interest supplements and the allowance for credit losses. 
 
 Reserve as a of EOP Receivables Ratio (as shown in the Credit Loss tables) The reserve as a percentage of EOP receivables ratio is calculated as the credit loss reserve amount, divided by end of period EOP finance receivables, excluding unearned interest supplements and the allowance for credit losses. 
 
 Return on Equity ROE (as shown in the Key Metrics table) Reflects return on equity calculated by annualizing net income for the period and dividing by monthly average equity for the period. 
 
 Securitization and Restricted Cash (as shown in the Liquidity table) Securitization cash is held for the benefit of the securitization investors (for example, a reserve fund). Restricted cash primarily includes cash held to meet certain local governmental and regulatory reserve requirements and cash held under the terms of certain contractual agreements. 
 
 Securitizations (as shown in the Public Term Funding Plan table) Public securitization transactions, Rule 144A offerings sponsored by Ford Credit, and widely distributed offerings by Ford Credit Canada. 
 
 Term Asset-Backed Securities (as shown in the Funding Structure table) Obligations issued in securitization transactions that are payable only out of collections on the underlying securitized assets and related enhancements. 
 
 Total Net Receivables (as shown in the Key Metrics and Financial Condition tables) Includes finance receivables (retail financing and wholesale) sold for legal purposes and net investment in operating leases included in securitization transactions that do not satisfy the requirements for accounting sale treatment. These receivables and operating leases are reported on Ford Credit s consolidated balance sheets and are available only for payment of the debt issued by, and other obligations of, the securitization entities that are parties to those securitization transactions; they are not available to pay the other obligations of Ford Credit or the claims of Ford Credit s other creditors. 
 
 Unallocated Other (as shown in the Segment Results table) Items excluded in assessing segment performance because they are managed at the corporate level, including market valuation adjustments to derivatives and exchange-rate fluctuations on foreign currency-denominated transactions.

 The following table shows the factors that contributed to third quarter 2024 EBT (in millions): 
 Change in EBT by Causal Factor Third quarter 2023 EBT 358 Volume / Mix 37 Financing margin 201 Credit loss (26) Lease residual (66) Exchange 1 Other 39 Third quarter 2024 EBT 544 
 
 Our third quarter 2024 EBT of 544 million was 186 million higher than a year ago, explained primarily by higher financing margin and higher receivables, offset partially by lower expected auction values and higher return rates on existing operating leases. ROE was 14.1 , 6.3 percentage points higher than a year ago, driven by higher net income. Total net receivables were 142.2 billion, 15.9 billion or 13 higher than a year ago, explained primarily by higher consumer and non-consumer financing and a larger lease portfolio. The third quarter 2024 U.S. LTR ratio of 57 basis points increased from a year ago and U.S. auction values in the third quarter of 2024 decreased 1 year over year. At the end of the third quarter of 2024, we had 29.6 billion in net liquidity.

 Financing Shares and Contract Placement Volume 
 
 Our focus is on supporting Ford and Lincoln dealers and customers. This includes going to market with Ford and our dealers to support vehicle sales with financing products and marketing programs. Ford s marketing programs may encourage or require Ford Credit financing and influence the financing choices customers make. As a result, our financing share, volume, and contract characteristics vary from period to period as Ford s marketing programs change . 
 
 The following table shows our retail financing and operating lease share of new Ford and Lincoln brand sales, wholesale financing share of new Ford and Lincoln brand vehicles acquired by dealers (in percent), and contract placement volume for new and used vehicles (in thousands) in several key markets:

 Financial Condition 
 
 Our receivables, including finance receivables and operating leases, were as follows (in billions): 
 September 30, 2023 December 31, 2023 September 30, 2024 Net Receivables United States and Canada Segment Consumer financing 60.2 62.2 67.2 Non-Consumer financing 21.7 25.4 28.8 Net investment in operating leases 20.1 20.1 20.9 Total United States and Canada Segment 102.0 107.7 116.9 Europe Segment Consumer financing 11.0 11.7 12.7 Non-Consumer financing 8.0 8.3 7.9 Net investment in operating leases 0.2 0.3 0.3 Total Europe Segment 19.2 20.3 20.9 All Other Segment Consumer financing 3.5 3.6 2.9 Non-Consumer financing 1.6 1.6 1.5 Net investment in operating leases Total Other Segment 5.1 5.2 4.4 Total net receivables 126.3 133.2 142.2 
 
 At September 30, 2023, December 31, 2023, and September 30, 2024, total net receivables includes consumer receivables before allowance for credit losses of 45.2 billion, 46.0 billion, and 48.7 billion, respectively, and non-consumer receivables before allowance for credit losses of 17.7 billion, 21.3 billion, and 23.7 billion, respectively, that have been sold for legal purposes in securitization transactions but continue to be reported in our consolidated financial statements. In addition, at September 30, 2023, December 31, 2023, and September 30, 2024, total net receivables includes net investment in operating leases of 10.6 billion, 11.2 billion, and 13.3 billion, respectively, that have been included in securitization transactions but continue to be reported in our consolidated financial statements. The receivables and net investment in operating leases are available only for payment of the debt issued by, and other obligations of, the securitization entities that are parties to those securitization transactions; they are not available to pay the other obligations or the claims of our other creditors. We hold the right to receive the excess cash flows not needed to pay the debt issued by, and other obligations of, the securitization entities that are parties to those securitization transactions. For additional information on our securitization transactions, refer to the Securitization Transactions and On-Balance Sheet Arrangements sections of Item 7 of Part II of our 2023 Form 10-K Report and Note 6 of our Notes to the Financial Statements herein. 
 
 Total net receivables at September 30, 2024 were 15.9 billion and 9.0 billion higher compared with September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2023, respectively, explained primarily by higher consumer and non-consumer financing and a larger lease portfolio. 
 
 Our operating lease portfolio was 15 of total net receivables at September 30, 2024. Leasing is an important product, and our leasing strategy balances sales, share, residuals, and long-term profitability. Operating leases in the United States and Canada represent 99 of our total operating lease portfolio.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) 

 Credit Risk 
 
 Credit risk is the possibility of loss from a customer s or dealer s failure to make payments according to contract terms. Credit losses are a normal part of a lending business, and credit risk has a significant impact on our business. We manage the credit risk of our consumer (retail financing) and non-consumer (dealer financing) receivables to balance our level of risk and return using our consistent underwriting standards, effective proprietary scoring system (discussed below), and world-class servicing. The allowance for credit losses (also referred to as the credit loss reserve) represents our estimate of the expected credit losses inherent in our finance receivables for the lifetime of those receivables as of the balance sheet date. The allowance for credit losses is estimated using a combination of models and management judgment and is based on such factors as historical loss performance, portfolio quality, receivable levels, and forward-looking macroeconomic scenarios. The adequacy of our allowance for credit losses is assessed quarterly and the assumptions and models used in establishing the allowance are evaluated regularly. 
 
 Most of our charge-offs are related to retail financing. Net charge-offs are affected by the number of vehicle repossessions, the unpaid balance outstanding at the time of repossession, the auction price of repossessed vehicles, and other amounts owed. We also incur credit losses on our dealer financing, but default rates for these receivables historically have been substantially lower than those for retail financing. 
 
 In purchasing retail financing contracts, we use a proprietary scoring system that measures credit quality using information from sources including the credit application, proposed contract terms, credit bureau data, and other information. After a proprietary risk score is generated, we decide whether to purchase a contract using a decision process based on a judgmental evaluation of the applicant, the credit application, the proposed contract terms, credit bureau information (e.g., FICO score), proprietary risk score, and other information. Our evaluation emphasizes the applicant s ability to pay and the applicant s creditworthiness with a focus on payment, affordability, applicant credit history, and stability as key considerations. While FICO is a part of our scoring system, our models enable us to more effectively determine the probability that a customer will pay than using credit scores alone. When we originate business, our models project expected losses and we price accordingly. We ensure the business fits our risk appetite. 
 
 For additional information on our allowance for credit losses and the quality of our receivables, see Note 4 of our Notes to the Financial Statements. 
 
 United States Origination Metrics 
 
 The following table shows United States retail financing and operating lease average placement FICO and higher risk portfolio mix metrics. Also shown are extended term mix and United States retail financing average placement terms. 
 Third Quarter First Nine Months 2023 2024 2023 2024 Origination Metrics Retail lease average placement FICO 757 755 755 756 Retail lease higher risk portfolio mix 4 3 4 4 Retail greater than or equal to 84 months placement mix 8 9 8 7 Retail average placement term (months) 63 65 62 65 
 
 Our third quarter 2024 average placement FICO score decreased compared with the same period a year ago and remains strong. We support customers across the credit spectrum. Our higher risk business, as classified at contract inception, represents 3 of our portfolio and has been stable for over 15 years. 
 
 During the third quarter of 2024, our average retail financing placement term was higher compared to a year ago. Retail financing contract mix of 84 months and longer in the third quarter increased compared to a year ago and continue to be a small part of our business. We remain focused on managing the trade cycle building customer relationships and loyalty while offering financing products and terms that customers want. Our origination and risk management processes deliver robust portfolio performance.

 United States Retail Financing Credit Losses 
 
 The following table shows the primary drivers of credit losses in the United States retail financing business, which comprised 71 of our worldwide consumer finance receivables at September 30, 2024.

 __________ 
 (a) The expected difference between the amount a customer owes when the finance contract is charged off and the amount received, net of expenses, from selling the repossessed vehicle. 
 (b) See Definitions and Information Regarding Causal Factors section for calculation. 
 
 Repossession ratio increased from a year ago. From 2017 through 2019, full year repossession ratio averaged 1.26 . Loss severity increased from a year ago, reflecting higher average amount financed as well as lower auction values. Third quarter 2024 LTR ratio of 0.57 increased from a year ago, reflecting increased loss severity and higher repossessions. From 2017 through 2019, full year LTR ratio averaged 0.56 .

 (a) See Definitions and Information Regarding Causal Factors section for calculation. 
 
 Our worldwide credit loss metrics remain strong. Net charge-offs and the worldwide LTR ratio in the third quarter of 2024 increased from a year ago. 
 
 Our credit loss reserve is based on such factors as historical loss performance, portfolio quality, receivables level, and forward-looking macroeconomic scenarios. Our credit loss reserve reflects lifetime expected losses as of the balance sheet date and is adjusted accordingly based on our assessment of the portfolio and economic trends and conditions. Our credit loss reserve at September 30, 2024 is lower than a year ago, reflecting improvement in the macroeconomic outlook, offset partially by an increase in consumer receivables. See Note 4 of our Notes to the Financial Statements for more information.

 Residual Risk 
 
 Leasing is an important product that many customers want and value, and operating lease customers also are more likely to buy or lease another Ford or Lincoln vehicle. We manage our lease share with an enterprise view to support sales, protect residual values, and manage the trade cycle. Ford Credit and Ford work together under a leasing strategy that considers share, term, model mix, geography, and other factors. 
 
 We are exposed to residual risk on operating leases and similar balloon payment products where the customer may return the financed vehicle to us. Residual risk is the possibility that the amount we obtain from returned vehicles will be less than our estimate of the expected residual value for the vehicle. We estimate the expected residual value by evaluating recent auction values, return volumes for our leased vehicles, industry wide used vehicle prices, marketing incentive plans, and vehicle quality data. For operating leases, changes in expected residual values impact depreciation expense, which is recognized on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease. 
 
 For additional information on our residual risk on operating leases, refer to the Critical Accounting Estimates Accumulated Depreciation on Vehicles Subject to Operating Leases section of Item 7 of Part II of our 2023 Form 10-K Report. 
 
 United States Ford and Lincoln Brand Operating Leases 
 
 The following table shows share of Ford and Lincoln brand retail financing and operating lease sales, placement volume, and residual performance metrics for our United States operating lease portfolio, which represents 74 of our total net investment in operating leases at September 30, 2024.

 __________ 
 (a) Source: J.D. Power PIN. 
 (b) 36-month off-lease auction values; quarterly amounts at Q3 2024 mix; YTD amounts at 2024 YTD mix. 
 
 Our United States operating lease share of retail sales in the third quarter of 2024 was higher compared with a year ago and remains below the industry average. Our third quarter 2024 total lease placement volume was up compared with a year ago, reflecting higher Ford Credit lease share and higher Ford retail sales. 
 
 Lease return volume and return rate in the third quarter of 2024 were higher than a year ago. Our third quarter 2024 36-month off-lease auction values were down 1 from the prior year. We are planning for full-year 2024 auction values to continue to decline consistent with industry and third-party estimates. We expect return rates to increase as auction values decline. As of September 30, 2024, electric vehicles comprised about 7 of our U.S. operating leases and similar balloon payment products where the customer may return financed vehicles to us.

 Credit Ratings 
 
 Our short-term and long-term debt is rated by four credit rating agencies designated as nationally recognized statistical rating organizations NRSROs by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ): DBRS, Fitch, Moody s, and S P. 
 
 In several markets, locally recognized rating agencies also rate us. A credit rating reflects an assessment by the rating agency of the credit risk associated with a corporate entity or particular securities issued by that entity. Rating agencies ratings of us are based on information provided by us and other sources. Credit ratings assigned to us from all of the NRSROs are closely associated with their opinions on Ford. Credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold securities and are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating agency may have different criteria for evaluating company risk and, therefore, ratings should be evaluated independently for each rating agency. 
 
 There have been no rating actions taken by these NRSROs since the filing of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. 
 
 The following table summarizes certain of the credit ratings and outlook presently assigned by these four NRSROs:

 Funding and Liquidity 
 
 We remain well capitalized with a strong balance sheet and funding diversified across platforms and markets, and ended the third quarter of 2024 with 29.6 billion of liquidity, up 3.9 billion from year-end. We continue to have robust access to capital markets, completing 29 billion of public term issuances through October 25, 2024. 
 
 Key elements of our funding strategy include: 
 
 Maintain strong liquidity and funding diversity; 
 Prudently access public markets; 
 Continue to leverage retail deposits in Europe; 
 Flexibility to increase asset-backed securities mix as needed; preserving assets and committed capacity; 
 Target financial statement leverage of 9:1 to 10:1; and

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) 

 Liquidity 
 
 We define available liquidity as cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (excluding amounts related to insurance activities) and committed capacity (which includes our asset-backed facilities and unsecured credit facilities), less utilization of liquidity. Utilization of liquidity is the amount funded under our liquidity sources and also includes the cash required to support securitization transactions and restricted cash. Net liquidity available for use is defined as available liquidity plus certain adjustments as shown in the table below. 
 
 The following table shows our liquidity sources and utilization (in billions): 
 September 30, 2023 December 31, 2023 September 30, 2024 Liquidity Sources Cash 11.6 10.9 8.6 Committed asset-backed facilities 42.3 42.9 44.6 Other unsecured credit facilities 2.4 2.4 1.8 Total liquidity sources 56.3 56.2 55.0 Utilization of Liquidity Securitization and restricted cash (2.9) (2.8) (3.1) Committed asset-backed facilities (25.8) (27.5) (22.5) Other unsecured credit facilities (0.7) (0.4) (0.1) Total utilization of liquidity (29.4) (30.7) (25.7) Available liquidity 26.9 25.5 29.3 Other adjustments 0.1 0.2 0.3 Net liquidity available for use 27.0 25.7 29.6 
 
 Our net liquidity available for use will fluctuate quarterly based on factors including near-term debt maturities, receivable growth and decline, and timing of funding transactions. At September 30, 2024, our net liquidity available for use was 29.6 billion, 3.9 billion higher than year-end 2023, primarily reflecting strong access to public funding markets resulting in lower utilization of committed asset-backed facilities. At September 30, 2024, our liquidity sources totaled 55.0 billion, down 1.2 billion from year-end 2023, primarily explained by lower cash due to higher receivables. 
 
 Cash. At September 30, 2024, our cash totaled 8.6 billion, compared with 10.9 billion at year-end 2023. In the normal course of our funding activities, we may generate more proceeds than are required for our immediate funding needs. These excess amounts are held primarily in highly liquid investments, which provide liquidity for our anticipated and unanticipated cash needs and give us flexibility in the use of our other funding programs. Our cash primarily includes United States Department of Treasury obligations, federal agency securities, bank time deposits with investment-grade institutions, investment-grade commercial paper, debt obligations of a select group of non-U.S. governments, non-U.S. governmental agencies, supranational institutions, non-U.S. central banks, and money market funds that carry the highest possible ratings. 
 
 The average maturity of these investments ranges from overnight to six months, and is adjusted based on market conditions and liquidity needs. We monitor our cash levels and average maturity on a daily basis. Cash includes restricted cash and amounts to be used only to support our securitization transactions of 2.8 billion and 3.1 billion at December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, respectively. 
 
 Material Cash Requirements. Our material cash requirements include: (1) the purchase of retail financing and operating lease contracts from dealers and providing wholesale financing for dealers to finance new and used vehicles; and (2) debt repayments (for additional information on debt, see the Aggregate Contractual Obligations table in Item 7 and Note 9 of the Notes to the Financial Statements in our 2023 Form 10-K Report). In addition, subject to approval by our Board of Directors, shareholder distributions may require the expenditure of a material amount of cash. Moreover, we may be subject to additional material cash requirements that are contingent upon the occurrence of certain events, e.g., legal contingencies, uncertain tax positions, and other matters. 
 
 We plan to utilize our liquidity (as described above) and our cash flows from business operations to fund our material cash requirements. 

35 

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) 

 Committed Capacity. At September 30, 2024, our committed capacity totaled 46.4 billion, compared with 45.3 billion at December 31, 2023. Our committed capacity is primarily comprised of committed asset-backed facilities from bank-sponsored commercial paper conduits and other financial institutions and committed unsecured credit facilities with financial institutions. 
 
 Committed Asset-Backed Facilities. We and our subsidiaries have entered into agreements with a number of bank-sponsored asset-backed commercial paper conduits and other financial institutions. Such counterparties are contractually committed, at our option, to purchase from us eligible retail financing receivables or to purchase or make advances under asset-backed securities backed by retail financing or wholesale finance receivables or operating leases for proceeds of up to 44.6 billion 27.7 billion of retail financing, 10.2 billion of operating leases, and 6.7 billion of wholesale financing) at September 30, 2024. In the United States, we are able to obtain funding within two days of our unutilized capacity in some of our committed asset-backed facilities. These committed facilities have varying maturity dates, with 15.2 billion having maturities within the next twelve months and the remaining balance having maturities through third quarter 2026. We plan capacity renewals to protect our global funding needs and to optimize capacity utilization. 
 
 Our ability to obtain funding under these facilities is subject to having a sufficient amount of eligible assets as well as our ability to obtain interest rate hedging arrangements for certain facilities. At September 30, 2024, 22.5 billion of these commitments were in use and we had 0.2 billion of asset-backed capacity that was in excess of eligible receivables. These programs are free of material adverse change clauses, restrictive financial covenants (for example, debt-to-equity limitations and minimum net worth requirements), and generally, credit rating triggers that could limit our ability to obtain funding. However, the unused portion of these commitments may be terminated if the performance of the underlying assets deteriorates beyond specified levels. Based on our experience and knowledge as servicer of the related assets, we do not expect any of these programs to be terminated due to such events. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, FCE Bank plc FCE had liquidity of 249 million (equivalent to 334 million) in the form of eligible collateral available for use in the monetary policy programs of the Bank of England. In addition, Ford Bank GmbH Ford Bank had liquidity of 347 million (equivalent to 388 million) in the form of eligible collateral available for use in the monetary policy programs of the European Central Bank. 
 
 Unsecured Credit Facilities . At September 30, 2024, we and our subsidiaries had 1.8 billion of contractually committed unsecured credit facilities with financial institutions, including the FCE syndicated credit facility (the FCE Credit Agreement and Ford Bank s syndicated credit facility (the Ford Bank Credit Agreement ). At September 30, 2024, 1.7 billion was available for use. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, all 685 million (equivalent to 918 million) was available for use under the FCE Credit Agreement and all 210 million (equivalent to 235 million) was available for use under the Ford Bank Credit Agreement. Both the FCE Credit Agreement and Ford Bank Credit Agreement mature in 2027. 
 
 Both the FCE Credit Agreement and Ford Bank Credit Agreement contain certain covenants, including an obligation for FCE and Ford Bank to maintain their ratio of regulatory capital to risk-weighted assets at no less than the applicable regulatory minimum. The FCE Credit Agreement requires the support agreement between FCE and Ford Credit to remain in effect (and enforced by FCE to ensure that its net worth is maintained at no less than 500 million). The Ford Bank Credit Agreement requires a guarantee of Ford Bank s obligations under the agreement, provided by Ford Credit, to remain in effect. In addition, both the FCE Credit Agreement and the Ford Bank Credit Agreement include certain sustainability-linked targets, pursuant to which the applicable margin may be adjusted if Ford achieves, or fails to achieve, the specified targets. Ford outperformed the 2023 targets for all three of the sustainability-linked metrics. 
 
 Funding and Liquidity Risks 
 
 Our funding plan is subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, including disruption in the capital markets, that could impact both unsecured debt and asset-backed securities issuance and the effects of regulatory changes on the financial markets. Refer to the Funding and Liquidity Risks section of Item 7 of Part II of our 2023 Form 10-K Report for more information.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) 

 Leverage 
 
 We use leverage, or the debt-to-equity ratio, to make various business decisions, including evaluating and establishing pricing for finance receivable and operating lease financing, and assessing our capital structure. We refer to our shareholder s interest as equity. 
 
 The following table shows the calculation of our financial statement leverage (in billions): 
 September 30, 2023 December 31, 2023 September 30, 2024 Leverage Calculation Debt 122.9 129.3 136.7 Equity 12.6 13.4 14.0 Financial statement leverage (to 1) 9.7 9.7 9.7 
 
 We plan our leverage by considering market conditions and the risk characteristics of our business. At September 30, 2024, our financial statement leverage was 9.7:1. We target financial statement leverage in the range of 9:1 to 10:1. 
 
 During the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, we paid 175 million and 325 million, respectively, in cash distributions to our parent. 

Outlook 
 
 We now expect full year 2024 EBT of about 1.6 billion.

 Cautionary Note on Forward-Looking Statements 
 
 Statements included or incorporated by reference herein may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are based on expectations, forecasts, and assumptions by our management and involve a number of risks, uncertainties, and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those stated, including, without limitation: 
 
 Ford is highly dependent on its suppliers to deliver components in accordance with Ford s production schedule and specifications, and a shortage of or inability to acquire key components or raw materials, such as lithium, cobalt, nickel, graphite, and manganese, can disrupt Ford s production of vehicles; 
 To facilitate access to the raw materials and other components necessary for the production of electric vehicles, Ford has entered into and may, in the future, enter into multi-year commitments to raw material and other suppliers that subject Ford to risks associated with lower future demand for such items as well as costs that fluctuate and are difficult to accurately forecast; 
 Ford s long-term competitiveness depends on the successful execution of Ford+; 
 Ford s vehicles could be affected by defects that result in recall campaigns, increased warranty costs, or delays in new model launches, and the time it takes to improve the quality of Ford s vehicles and services could continue to have an adverse effect on Ford s business; 
 Ford may not realize the anticipated benefits of existing or pending strategic alliances, joint ventures, acquisitions, divestitures, or business strategies; 
 Ford may not realize the anticipated benefits of restructuring actions and such actions may cause Ford to incur significant charges, disrupt its operations, or harm its reputation; 
 Operational information systems, security systems, vehicles, and services could be affected by cybersecurity incidents, ransomware attacks, and other disruptions and impact Ford and Ford Credit as well as their suppliers and dealers; 
 Ford s production, as well as Ford s suppliers production, and/or the ability to deliver products to consumers could be disrupted by labor issues, public health issues, natural or man-made disasters, adverse effects of climate change, financial distress, production difficulties, capacity limitations, or other factors; 
 Failure to develop and deploy secure digital services that appeal to customers could have a negative impact on Ford s business; 
 Ford s ability to maintain a competitive cost structure could be affected by labor or other constraints; 
 Ford s ability to attract, develop, grow, and reward talent is critical to its success and competitiveness; 
 Ford s new and existing products and digital, software, and physical services are subject to market acceptance and face significant competition from existing and new entrants in the automotive and digital and software services industries, and its reputation may be harmed if it is unable to achieve the initiatives it has announced; 
 Ford s results are dependent on sales of larger, more profitable vehicles, particularly in the United States; 
 With a global footprint and supply chain, Ford s results and operations could be adversely affected by economic or geopolitical developments, including protectionist trade policies such as tariffs, or other events; 
 Industry sales volume can be volatile and could decline if there is a financial crisis, recession, public health emergency, or significant geopolitical event; 
 Ford may face increased price competition or a reduction in demand for its products resulting from industry excess capacity, currency fluctuations, competitive actions, or other factors, particularly for electric vehicles; 
 Inflationary pressure and fluctuations in commodity and energy prices, foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and market value of Ford or Ford Credit s investments, including marketable securities, can have a significant effect on results; 
 Ford and Ford Credit s access to debt, securitization, or derivative markets around the world at competitive rates or in sufficient amounts could be affected by credit rating downgrades, market volatility, market disruption, regulatory requirements, or other factors; 
 The impact of government incentives on Ford s business could be significant, and Ford s receipt of government incentives could be subject to reduction, termination, or clawback; 
 Ford Credit could experience higher-than-expected credit losses, lower-than-anticipated residual values, or higher-than-expected return volumes for leased vehicles; 
 Economic and demographic experience for pension and other postretirement employee benefit plans (e.g., discount rates or investment returns) could be worse than Ford has assumed; 
 Pension and other postretirement liabilities could adversely affect Ford s liquidity and financial condition; 
 Ford and Ford Credit could experience unusual or significant litigation, governmental investigations, or adverse publicity arising out of alleged defects in products, services, perceived environmental impacts, or otherwise; 
 Ford may need to substantially modify its product plans and facilities to comply with safety, emissions, fuel economy, autonomous driving technology, environmental, and other regulations; 
 Ford and Ford Credit could be affected by the continued development of more stringent privacy, data use, data protection, and artificial intelligence laws and regulations as well as consumers heightened expectations to safeguard their personal information; and 
 Ford Credit could be subject to new or increased credit regulations, consumer protection regulations, or other regulations.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued) 

 We cannot be certain that any expectation, forecast, or assumption made in preparing forward-looking statements will prove accurate, or that any projection will be realized. It is to be expected that there may be differences between projected and actual results. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of their initial issuance, and we do not undertake any obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. For additional discussion, see Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2023 Form 10-K Report, as updated by our subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K. 

Accounting Standards Issued But Not Yet Adopted 
 
 For a discussion of recent accounting standards, see Note 2 of our Notes to the Financial Statements. 

ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 
 In our 2023 Form 10-K Report, we discuss in greater detail our market risk, counterparty risk, credit risk, residual risk, liquidity risk, and operating risk. 
 
 To provide a quantitative measure of the sensitivity of our pre-tax cash flow to changes in interest rates, we use interest rate scenarios that assume a hypothetical, instantaneous increase or decrease of one percentage point in all interest rates across all maturities (a parallel shift ), as well as a base case that assumes that all interest rates remain constant at existing levels. Maturing assets and liabilities are also instantaneously reinvested, capturing 100 of any hypothetical change in interest rates. The differences in pre-tax cash flow between these scenarios and the base case over a 12 month period represent an estimate of the sensitivity of our pre-tax cash flow. Under this model, we estimate that at September 30, 2024, all else constant, such a decrease in interest rates would decrease our pre-tax cash flow by 103 million over the next 12 months, compared with a decrease of 78 million at December 31, 2023. In reality, new assets and liabilities may not immediately capture changes in interest rates, and interest rate changes are rarely instantaneous, parallel, or move exactly the one percentage point assumed in our analysis. As a result, the actual impact to pre-tax cash flow could be higher or lower than the results detailed above. 

ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. Cathy O Callaghan, our President and Chief Executive Officer CEO ), and Eliane S. Okamura, our Chief Financial Officer CFO ), Treasurer and Executive Vice President, Strategy, have performed an evaluation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures, as that term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended Exchange Act ), as of September 30, 2024, and each has concluded that such disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our periodic reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified by SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the CEO and CFO to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting . There were no changes in internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 39 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION
