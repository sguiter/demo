 NOTES
TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

(the Reverse Stock Split of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock, which Articles of Amendment
became effective on August 1, 2024. The Reverse Stock Split became effective at 4:01 pm Eastern Time on August 1, 2024, and our common
stock began trading on a split-adjusted basis at the open of trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market on August 2, 2024. Upon effectiveness
of the Reverse Stock Split, every seventy (70) shares of our common stock issued and outstanding were automatically reclassified and
combined into one share of our common stock, without any change in the par value per share. Additionally, equitable adjustments corresponding
to the Reverse Stock Split ratio were made to (i) the exercise prices of and number of shares of common stock underlying the Company s
public and private warrants in accordance with their terms, (ii) the number of shares of common stock underlying the Company s
outstanding equity awards in accordance with their terms, and (iii) the number of shares of common stock issuable under the Company s
equity incentive plan. No fractional shares were issued in connection with the Reverse Stock Split. Any stockholder who would otherwise
be entitled to receive a fractional share instead became entitled to receive one whole share of Common Stock in lieu of such fractional
share. Following the Reverse Stock Split, we had shares of our common stock outstanding, which includes shares of our
common stock that were issued for rounding up fractional shares resulting from the Reverse Stock Split. All share and per share data
in the accompanying financial statements have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the effect of the Reverse Stock Split. 

and of revenues, respectively.
For the three and six months ended October 31, 2023, the Company had one customer that constituted and of revenues, and a second
customer that constituted and of revenues, and a third customer that constituted and of revenues, respectively. 

of the money raised on the funding portal. The transaction price is determined based on the
amount the Company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for transferring the promised services to the customer. The transaction
price in the contract is allocated to each distinct performance obligation in an amount that represents the relative amount of consideration
expected to be received in exchange for satisfying each performance obligation. Revenue is recognized when performance obligations are
satisfied. The Company usually bills its customers before it provides any services and begins performing services after the first payment
is received. Contracts are typically one year or less. For larger contracts, in addition to the initial payment, the Company may allow
for progress payments throughout the term of the contract. 

Judgments
and Estimates 

The
estimation of variable consideration for each performance obligation requires the Company to make subjective judgments. The Company enters
into contracts with customers that regularly include promises to transfer multiple services, such as digital marketing, web-based videos,
offering statements, and professional services. For arrangements with multiple services, the Company evaluates whether the individual
services qualify as distinct performance obligations. In its assessment of whether a service is a distinct performance obligation, the
Company determines whether the customer can benefit from the service on its own or with other readily available resources, and whether
the service is separately identifiable from other services in the contract. This evaluation requires the Company to assess the nature
of each individual service offering and how the services are provided in the context of the contract, including whether the services
are significantly integrated, highly interrelated, or significantly modify each other, which may require judgment based on the facts
and circumstances of the contract. 

When
agreements involve multiple distinct performance obligations, the Company allocates arrangement consideration to all performance obligations
at the inception of an arrangement based on the relative standalone selling prices (SSP) of each performance obligation. Where the Company
has standalone sales data for its performance obligations which are indicative of the price at which the Company sells a promised service
separately to a customer, such data is used to establish SSP. In instances where standalone sales data is not available for a particular
performance obligation, the Company estimates SSP by the use of observable market and cost-based inputs. The Company continues to review
the factors used to establish list price and will adjust standalone selling price methodologies as necessary on a prospective basis. 

Service
Revenue 

Service
revenue from subscriptions to the Company s game website is recognized over time on a ratable basis over the contractual subscription
term beginning on the date that the platform is made available to the customer. Payments received in advance of subscription services
being rendered are recorded as a deferred revenue. Professional services revenue is recognized over time as the services are rendered. 

When
a contract with a customer is signed, the Company assesses whether collection of the fees under the arrangement is probable. The Company
estimates the amount to reserve for uncollectible amounts based on the aging of the contract balance, current and historical customer
trends, and communications with its customers. These reserves are recorded as operating expenses against the contract assets. 

Contract
Assets 

Contract
assets are recorded for those parts of the contract consideration not yet invoiced but for which the performance obligations are completed.
The revenue is recognized when the customer receives services. Contract assets are included in other current assets in the consolidated
balance sheets and will be recognized during the succeeding twelve-month period. 

Deferred
Revenue 

Deferred
revenues represent billings or payments received in advance of revenue recognition and are recognized upon transfer of control. Balances
consist primarily of annual plan subscription services and professional services not yet provided as of the balance sheet date. Deferred
revenues that will be recognized during the succeeding twelve-month period are recorded as current deferred revenues in the consolidated
balance sheets, with the remainder recorded as other non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. 

Costs
to Obtain a Customer Contract 

Sales
commissions and related expenses are considered incremental and recoverable costs of acquiring customer contracts. These costs are capitalized
as other current or non-current assets and amortized on a straight-line basis over the life of the contract, which approximates the benefit
period. The benefit period was estimated by taking into consideration the length of customer contracts, technology lifecycle, and other
factors. All sales commissions are recorded as consulting fees within the Company s consolidated statement of operations. 

Remaining
Performance Obligations 

The
Company s subscription terms are typically less than one year. All of the Company s revenues in the three and six months
ended October 31, 2024, which amounted to and , respectively, are considered contract revenues. Contract revenue as
of October 31, 2024 and April 30, 2024, which has not yet been recognized, amounted to and , respectively, and is recorded on
the balance sheet as deferred revenue. The Company expects to recognize revenue on all of its remaining performance obligations over
the next 12 months. 

Disaggregation
of Revenue 

Revenue
is from U.S.-based companies with no notable geographical concentrations in any area. A distinction exists in revenue source; revenues
are either generated online or from consulting services.

postponed the first installment payment for 18 months, and the first payment became due on . The monthly payments of

and obligations to the SBA. The June Loan was personally guaranteed by the Company s Chief Financial Officer. 

The

Equity securities at fair value 

Under
the Fair Value Measurements Topic of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, we base fair value on the price that would be received
to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. It is
our policy to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when developing fair value measurements,
in accordance with the fair value hierarchy. Fair value measurements for assets and liabilities where there exists limited or no observable
market data and, therefore, are based primarily upon management s own estimates, are often calculated based on current pricing
policy, the economic and competitive environment, the characteristics of the asset or liability and other such factors. Therefore, the
results cannot be determined with precision and may not be realized in an actual sale or immediate settlement of the asset or liability.
Additionally, there may be inherent weaknesses in any calculation technique, and changes in the underlying assumptions used.

There
can be no assurances that we will be able to achieve a level of revenues adequate to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or
additional financing through private placements, public offerings and/or bank financing necessary to support our working capital requirements.
The Company has turned its focus to its funding portal business, which generates cash revenues and has seen a growth in revenues on a
quarter-to-quarter basis in fiscal 2025. The Company plans to continue operating with lower fixed overhead amounts and seeks to raise
money from private placements, public offerings and/or bank financing. The Company s management has determined, based on its recent
history and the negative cash flow from operations, that it is unlikely that its plan will sufficiently alleviate or mitigate, to a sufficient
level, the relevant conditions or events noted above. To the extent that funds generated from any private placements, public offerings
and/or bank financing, if available, are insufficient, the Company will have to raise additional working capital. No assurance can be
given that additional financing will be available, or if available, will be on acceptable terms. These conditions raise substantial doubt
about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Accordingly, the Company s management has concluded that there
is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the issuance date of these
financial statements. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to achieve its business plan objectives or be able to achieve
or maintain cash-flow-positive operating results. If the Company is unable to generate adequate funds from operations or raise sufficient
additional funds, the Company may not be able to repay its existing debt, continue to operate its business network, respond to competitive
pressures or fund its operations. As a result, the Company may be required to significantly reduce, reorganize, discontinue or shut down
its operations. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from this uncertainty.

Overview 

Netcapital
Inc. is a fintech company with a scalable technology platform that allows private companies to raise capital online from accredited and
non-accredited investors. We give investors the opportunity to access investments in private companies. We believe our model is disruptive
to traditional private equity investing and is based on Title III, Reg CF of the JOBS Act. In addition, we have recently expanded our
model to include Regulation A Reg A offerings. We generate fees from listing private companies on our funding portal
located at www.netcapital.com. We generate fees from listing private companies on netcapital.com. We also generate fees from advising

We
provide private company investment access to accredited and non-accredited investors through our online portal (www.netcapital.com),
which is operated by our wholly owned subsidiary Netcapital Funding Portal, Inc. The Netcapital funding portal charges a 5,000 engagement
fee and a 4.9 portal fee for capital raised at closing, and beginning in fiscal year 2024, a 1 success fee paid for with equity of
the funding portal customer. In addition, the portal generates fees for other ancillary services, such as rolling closes. Netcapital
Advisors generates fees and equity stakes from consulting in select portfolio Portfolio Companies and non-portfolio clients.
With respect to its services for Reg A offerings, Netcapital Advisors charges a monthly flat fee for each month the offering is listed
on the netcapital.com website as well as a nominal administrative flat fee for each investor that is processed to cover out-of-pocket
costs. 

We
generated revenues of 312,755, with costs of service of 30,001, in the six months ended October 31, 2024 for a gross profit of 282,754

13 and 17 offerings hosted on the Netcapital funding platform in fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively terminated their listings without

that have utilized the funding portal to facilitate their offerings, which equity was received as payment for services.

invest from almost anywhere in the world, at any time, with just a few clicks. Securities offerings on the portal are accessible through

Broker-Dealer
Business 

Our
recently formed wholly owned subsidiary, Netcapital Securities Inc. has received approval from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority FINRA to become a FINRA-member broker dealer. We believe that by having a registered broker-dealer, it may create opportunities
to expand the Company s revenue base by hosting and generating additional fees from Reg A and Reg D offerings on the Netcapital
platform, earning additional fees in connection with offerings that may result from the introduction of clients to other FINRA broker-dealers
and expanding our distribution capabilities by leveraging strategic partnerships with other broker-dealers to distribute offerings of
issuers that utilize the Netcapital platform to a wider range of investors in order to maximize market penetration and optimize capital
raising efforts.

At-The-Market
Agreement 

On
August 23, 2024, we entered into an At The Market Offering Agreement (the ATM Agreement with Wainwright to sell shares
of our common stock, par value 0.001 per share, (the Shares having an aggregate sales price of up to 2,100,000, from
time to time, through an at the market offering program under which Wainwright acted as sales agent. The sales of the Shares
made under the ATM Agreement were made by any method permitted by law deemed to be an at the market offering as defined
in Rule 415 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. We paid Wainwright a commission rate equal to 3.0 of the aggregate
gross proceeds from each sale of Shares. From August 23, 2024 through October 29, 2024, the Company sold 1,122,693 shares of its common

Regained
Compliance with Nasdaq Continued Listing Requirements 

On
August 19, 2024, we received a notice from The Nasdaq Stock Market, LLC Nasdaq ), dated August 19, 2024, informing us that
we had regained compliance with Nasdaq s Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the Bid Price Rule for continued listing on The
Nasdaq Capital Market, as the bid price of our common stock closed at or above 1.00 per share for a minimum of 10 consecutive business
days since August 2, 2024. 

As
previously disclosed on a Current Report on Form 8-K filed by us, Nasdaq had previously notified us on September 1, 2023 that we were
not in compliance with the Bid Price Rule because our common stock failed to maintain a minimum bid price of 1.00 per share for 30 consecutive
business days. Further as of July 22, 2024, Nasdaq determined that that our securities had a closing bid price of 0.10 or less for ten
consecutive trading days and as a result, Nasdaq delivered written notice to the Company on July 23, 2024 under which it advised us that
Nasdaq has determined to delist our securities from The Nasdaq Capital Market. We requested a hearing to appeal Nasdaq s delisting
determination, but since the Company has regained compliance with Nasdaq s continued listing requirements as described above, the
hearing was cancelled.

Comparison
of the Three Months Ended October 31, 2024 and 2023 

Our
revenues for the three months ended October 31, 2024, decreased by 1,871,130, or approximately 92 , to 170,528, as compared to 2,041,658
during the three months ended October 31, 2023. The decrease in revenues was attributed to the lack of consulting service revenue in
the quarter ended October 31, 2024, as compared to revenue of 1,516,667 for consulting services for equity securities and 62,000 for
consulting revenue in the three months ended October 31, 2023. In fiscal 2025, management has focused on establishing a broker-dealer
subsidiary so that the Company may have additional sources of revenue, and we have not been pursuing the equity-based revenue contracts.

2023, consisting of portal fees of 317,206, listing fees of 145,500 and equity fees of 0. The decrease in revenues was primarily attributed
to a decrease in dollars invested in issuers listed on the funding portal, which decreased to 2,052,547 from the quarter ended October
31, 2024 from 6,288,508 for the quarter ended October 31, 2023. In the three months ended October 31, 2024, dollars invested were approximately

On
May 24, 2024, the Company entered into inducement offer letter agreements with certain investors that held certain outstanding Series
A-2 warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 204,572 shares of our common stock with an exercise price of 17.50 per share, originally
issued in December 2023 at a reduced exercise price of 10.85 per share (which reduced exercise price was granted to all holders on Series
A-2 warrants by the board on May 24, 2024) in partial consideration for the Company s agreement to issue in a private placement
(i) new Series A-3 common stock purchase warrants to purchase up to 253,947 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of 8.74
per share and (ii) new Series A-4 common stock purchase warrants to purchase up to 253,947 shares of our common stock at an exercise
price of 8.74 per share for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately 2.2 million from the exercise of the existing warrants, before
deducting placement agent fees and other expenses payable by the Company. The Series A-3 Warrants and Series A-4 Warrants are exercisable
beginning on the effective dates of stockholder approval of the issuance with such warrants expiring on (i) the five year anniversary
of the initial exercise date for the Series A-3 Warrants and (ii) the eighteen month anniversary of the initial exercise date for the
Series A-4 Warrants. This transaction closed on May 29, 2024. Wainwright was the exclusive agent for the transaction for which we paid
them a cash fee equal to 7.5 from the exercise of the Series A-2 warrant at the reduced exercise price and a management fee equal to
1.0 of such aggregate gross proceeds. We also issued warrants to designees of H.C. Wainwright to purchase up to 19,048 shares of our
common stock at an exercise price of 10.93 per share. 

On
August 23, 2024, we entered into an At The Market Offering Agreement (the ATM Agreement with Wainwright to sell shares
of our common stock, par value 0.001 per share, (the Shares having an aggregate sales price of up to 2,100,000, from
time to time, through an at the market offering program under which Wainwright acted as sales agent. The sales of the Shares
made under the ATM Agreement were made by any method permitted by law deemed to be an at the market offering as defined
in Rule 415 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. We paid Wainwright a commission rate equal to 3.0 of the aggregate
gross proceeds from each sale of Shares. From August 23, 2024 through October 29, 2024, the Company sold 1,122,693 shares of its common
stock pursuant to the ATM Agreement for gross proceeds of 2,099,667. No additional Shares will be sold under this ATM Agreement. Net
proceeds amounted to approximately 2,029,000. 

We
believe that our existing cash investment balances, our anticipated cash flows from operations and liquidity sources including 
 o ffering of equity and/or
debt securities and/or the sale of equity positions in certain portfolio companies for which we provide marketing and strategic advice
may not be sufficient to meet our working capital and expenditure requirements for the next 12 months. Consequently, beginning in November
2023, we laid off some employees, and took other steps to reduce operating expenses. We plan to continue operating with lower
fixed overhead amounts and seek to raise money from private placements, public offerings and/or bank financing. Our management has determined,
based on its recent history and the negative cash flow from operations, that it is unlikely that its plan will sufficiently alleviate
or mitigate, to a sufficient level, the relevant conditions or events noted above. To the extent that funds generated from any private
placements, public offerings and/or bank financing, if available, are insufficient, we will have to raise additional working capital.
No assurance can be given that additional financing will be available, or if available, will be on acceptable terms. Accordingly, the
Company s management has concluded that these conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
There can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve our business plan objectives or be able to achieve or maintain cash-flow-positive
operating results. If we are unable to generate adequate funds from operations or raise sufficient additional funds, we may not be able
to repay our existing debt, continue to operate our business network, respond to competitive pressures or fund our operations. As a result,
we may be required to significantly reduce, reorganize, discontinue or shut down our operations .

Disclosure Controls and Procedures. 

The
Company s management, with the participation of the Principal Executive Officer (the PEO and Principal Financial
Officer (the PFO ), has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined
in SEC Rule 13a-15(e)) as of October 31, 2024. Based on that evaluation, the PEO and the PFO concluded that, as of October 31, 2024 such

(b)
Management s Assessment of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Management

the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. 

Under
the supervision and with the participation of management, including the PEO and the PFO, the Company s management has evaluated
the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2023, based on the criteria established in a report
entitled 2013 Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission 
and the interpretive guidance issued by the Commission in Release No. 34-55929. Based on this evaluation, the Company s management

PART
II OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM
1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. 

We
are currently not involved in any litigation that we believe could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results
of operations. There is no action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation before or by any court, public board, government agency,
self-regulatory organization or body pending or, to the knowledge of the executive officers of our company or any of our subsidiaries,
threatened against or affecting our company, our common stock, any of our subsidiaries or of our companies or our subsidiaries 
officers or directors in their capacities as such, in which an adverse decision could have a material adverse effect. 

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS. 

Risk
factors that affect our business and financial results are discussed in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors, in our Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the year ended April 30, 2024 as filed with the SEC on July 29, 2024 Annual Report ). There have been
no material changes in our risk factors from those previously disclosed in our Annual Report , except
as discussed below . You should carefully consider the risks described in our Annual Report, which could materially affect our
business, financial condition or future results. The risks described in our Annual Report are not the only risks we face. Additional
risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our
business, financial condition, and/or operating results. If any of the risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, and/or
results of operations could be negatively affected. 

Our
financial situation creates doubt whether we will continue as a going concern. 

At
October 31, 2024, we had negative working capital of 2,615,585 and for the six months ended October 31, 2024, we had an operating loss
of 4,747,671 and net cash used in operating activities amounted to 3,451,087. There can be no assurances that we will be able to achieve
a level of revenues adequate to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or additional financing through private placements, public
offerings and/or bank financing necessary to support our working capital requirements. Our management has turned our focus to our funding
portal business, and we plan to use our funding portal experience to build a broker-dealer business, initially for Regulation A and Regulation
D offerings. We plan to continue to seek to raise money from private placements, public offerings and/or bank financing. Our management
has determined, based on its recent history and the negative cash flow from operations, that it is unlikely that its plan will sufficiently
alleviate or mitigate, to a sufficient level, the relevant conditions or events noted above. To the extent that funds generated from
any private placements, public offerings and/or bank financing, if available, are insufficient, we will have to raise additional working
capital. No assurance can be given that additional financing will be available, or if available, will be on acceptable terms. Accordingly,
our management has concluded that these conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. There can
be no assurance that we will be able to achieve our business plan objectives or be able to achieve or maintain cash-flow-positive operating
results. If we unable to generate adequate funds from operations or raise sufficient additional funds, we may not be able to repay our
existing debt, continue to operate our business network, respond to competitive pressures or fund our operations. As a result, we may
be required to significantly reduce, reorganize, discontinue or shut down our operations. 

Our
business and operations could be negatively affected if we become subject to any securities litigation or shareholder activism, which
could cause us to incur significant expense, hinder execution of business and growth strategy and impact our stock price. 

In
the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities, securities class action litigation has
often been brought against that company. Shareholder activism, which could take many forms or arise in a variety of situations, has been
increasing recently. Volatility in the stock price of our Common Stock or other reasons may in the future cause us to become the target
of securities litigation or shareholder activism. Securities litigation and shareholder activism, including potential proxy contests,
could result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and the attention and resources of our board of directors (our
 Board from our business. Additionally, such securities litigation and shareholder activism could give rise to perceived
uncertainties as to our future, adversely affect our relationships with service providers and make it more difficult to attract and retain
qualified personnel. Also, we may be required to incur significant legal fees and other expenses related to any securities litigation
and activist shareholder matters. Further, our stock price could be subject to significant fluctuation or otherwise be adversely affected
by the events, risks and uncertainties of any securities litigation and shareholder activism. 

A
significant portion of our total assets are held in equity securities of early-stage companies, which securities are illiquid and subject
to volatility, which factors could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 

Payment
related to the consulting and advisory services provided by Netcapital Advisors is often made through equity stakes from such customers.
As of October 31, 2024 and April 30, 2024, approximately 25.4 million and 25.3 million, respectively, of our holdings are issued by
companies whose securities do not trade on public markets. The securities issued are typically in private companies with no established
trading market for their securities, that often have limited operating histories, limited operating cash, and negative cash flows. Additionally,
these securities are primarily restricted, and are subject to legal holding periods pursuant to Rule 144 or other applicable exemptions.
The stock price of such issuers is often volatile, unpredictable, and with limited liquidity, and the value of such securities on the
date of receipt compared to the date when we are able to legally sell the securities may decrease significantly. The value ascribed to
our assets in our financial statements as of a particular date may be materially greater than or less than the value that would be realized
if our assets were to be liquidated as of such date. Accordingly, the value of such holdings may change over time due to factors that
we do not control, such as issuance of securities by such companies at lower prices or other market factors. One such example of a change
in value occurred in the period ended January 31, 2024, we recognized an unrealized loss of approximately 2.7 million on the value of
our equity securities due to the decline in value of a single issuer, which represented an impairment of more than 80 of the previous
value of our holdings in such issuer, which resulted in a reduction of our retained earnings. Changes to the value of our holdings could
have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 

Our
ability to have our securities traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market is subject to us meeting applicable listing criteria. 

We
are currently listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market, LLC Nasdaq ), a national securities exchange. Nasdaq requires companies
desiring to list their common stock to meet certain listing criteria including total number of shareholders: minimum stock price, total
value of public float, and in some cases total shareholders equity and market capitalization. Our failure to meet such applicable
listing criteria could prevent us from listing our common stock on the Nasdaq. In the event we are unable to have our shares traded on
Nasdaq, our common stock could potentially trade on the OTCQX or the OTCQB, each of which is generally considered less liquid and more
volatile than the Nasdaq. Our failure to have our shares traded on the Nasdaq could make it more difficult for you to trade our shares,
could prevent our common stock trading on a frequent and liquid basis and could result in the value of our common stock being less than
it would be if we were able to list our shares on the Nasdaq. 

- 30 - 

As
previously disclosed on a Current Report on Form 8-K filed by us, Nasdaq had previously notified us on September 1, 2023 that we were
not in compliance with the Nasdaq s Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) the Bid Price Rule because it failed to maintain a minimum
bid price of 1.00 per share for 30 consecutive business days. Further as of July 22, 2024, Nasdaq determined that that our securities
had a closing bid price of 0.10 or less for ten consecutive trading days and as a result, Nasdaq delivered written notice to the Company
on July 23, 2024 under which it advised us that Nasdaq has determined to delist our securities from The Nasdaq Capital Market. We requested
a hearing to appeal Nasdaq s delisting determination. On August 19, 2024, we received a notice from The Nasdaq Stock Market, LLC Nasdaq ), dated August 19, 2024, informing us that we had regained compliance with the Bid Price Rule for continued
listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market, as the bid price of our common stock closed at or above 1.00 per share for a minimum of 10 consecutive
business days since August 2, 2024. As a result of our demonstrated compliance with Nasdaq s continued listing requirements, such
aforementioned hearing was cancelled. 

Although
our common stock is currently listed on Nasdaq, we may not be able to continue to meet the exchange s minimum listing requirements
or those of any other national exchange. The Listing Rules of Nasdaq require listing issuers to comply with certain standards in order
to remain listed on its exchange. If, for any reason, we should fail to maintain compliance with these listing standards and Nasdaq should
delist our securities from trading on its exchange and we are unable to obtain listing on another national securities exchange, a reduction
in some or all of the following may occur, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our shareholders: 

the
 liquidity of our common stock; 

the
 market price of our common stock; 

our
 ability to obtain financing for the continuation of our operations; 

the
 number of institutional and general investors that will consider investing in our common stock; 

the
 number of investors in general that will consider investing in our common stock; 

the
 number of market makers in our common stock; 

the
 availability of information concerning the trading prices and volume of our common stock; and 

the
 number of broker-dealers willing to execute trades in shares of our common stock. 

Regulatory
and legal uncertainties could harm our business. 

The
securities businesses are heavily regulated. Firms in financial service industries have been subject to an increasingly regulated environment
over recent years, and penalties and fines sought by regulatory authorities have increased accordingly. Our funding portal and proposed
broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulations. Regulatory bodies include, but are not limited to, the SEC, FINRA, and
the Nasdaq Stock Market. Our mode of operation and profitability may be directly affected by additional legislation changes in rules
promulgated by various government agencies and self-regulatory organizations that oversee our businesses, and changes in the interpretation
or enforcement of existing laws and rules. Noncompliance with applicable laws or regulations could result in sanctions being levied against
us, including fines and censures, suspension or expulsion from a certain jurisdiction or market or the revocation or limitation of licenses.
Noncompliance with applicable laws or regulations could adversely affect our reputation,
prospects, revenues and earnings. In addition, changes in current laws or regulations or in governmental policies could adversely affect
our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Stock
 exchanges, other self-regulatory organizations and state securities commissions can censure, fine, issue
cease-and-desist orders, suspend or expel a funding portal, broker-dealer or any of its officers or employees. Our ability to comply
with all applicable laws and rules is largely dependent on our internal systems to ensure compliance, as well as our ability to attract
and retain qualified compliance personnel. We could be subject to disciplinary or other actions in the future due to claimed noncompliance,
which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. To continue to operate, we
may have to comply with the regulatory controls of each jurisdiction in which we conduct, or intend to conduct business, the requirements
of which may not be clearly defined.

Legal
Proceedings 

From
time to time, we may become involved in litigation or regulatory proceedings in the ordinary course of our business, including litigation
or regulatory proceedings that could be material to our business. 

In
addition, the securities industry is highly regulated and many aspects of our business involve substantial risk of liability. In past
years, there has been an increasing incidence of litigation involving the securities industry, including class action suits that generally
seek substantial damages, including in some cases punitive damages. Compliance problems that are reported to federal, state and provincial
regulators, exchanges or other self-regulatory organizations by dissatisfied customers are investigated by such regulatory bodies, and,
if pursued by such regulatory body or such customers, may rise to the level of arbitration or disciplinary action. We are also subject
to periodic regulatory audits and inspections for various federal, self-regulatory and state regulators. Any such audits and inspections
could require significant amounts of management time, result in the diversion of significant operational resources, require us to change
our business practices or products, result in sanctions being levied against us, including fines and censures, suspension or expulsion
from a certain jurisdiction or market or the revocation or limitation of licenses, result in negative publicity, or otherwise harm our
business and financial results. 

Pending
Regulatory Inquiries 

Our
businesses are heavily regulated by state and federal regulatory agencies as well as the Nasdaq Stock Market and FINRA. In the current
era of heightened regulatory scrutiny of financial institutions, we have incurred increased compliance costs, along with the industry
as a whole. Increased regulation also creates increased barriers to entry. 

We
receive many regulatory inquiries each year in addition to being subject to frequent regulatory examinations. The great majority of these
inquiries do not lead to fines or any further action against us. We are generally the subject of regulatory inquiries regarding subjects
including, but not limited to: anti-money laundering, compliance, registration, record-keeping, and other topics of recent regulatory
interest. We have procedures for evaluating whether potential regulatory fines are probable, estimable and material and for updating
its contingency reserves and disclosures accordingly. In the current climate, we expect that we may, from time to time, be subject to
regulatory fines on various topics on an ongoing basis, as other regulated financial services businesses do. The amount of any fines,
and when and if they will be incurred, typically is impossible to predict given the nature of the regulatory process.
