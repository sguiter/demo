As a result of the Distribution, Xperi became an independent, publicly-traded company and its common stock is listed under the symbol XPER on the New York Stock Exchange.

Refer to Notes 6 Divestitures and 14 Subsequent Events for details concerning an asset sale transaction related to Perceive. 
 Unaudited Interim Financial Statements The accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC for interim financial information. The amounts as of December 31, 2023 have been derived from the Company s annual audited consolidated financial statements included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed on March 1, 2024 (the Form 10-K ). Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted in accordance with such rules and regulations. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which consist of normal recurring adjustments, necessary to state fairly the financial position of the Company and its results of operations and cash flows as of and for the periods presented. These unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Form 10-K. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2024 or any future period and the Company makes no representations related thereto.

customer accounted for or more of total revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, whereas customer accounted for 10 or more of total revenue in the other comparative periods presented . As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, customer accounted for 10 or more of the Company s net balance of accounts receivable. As described in Note 6 Divestitures , in the first quarter of 2024, the Company received a note receivable and deferred consideration from Tobii AB Tobii as part of the consideration for divesting its AutoSense in-cabin safety business and related imaging solutions (the AutoSense Divestiture ). Both of these instruments are potentially exposed to credit risk arising from default on repayment from Tobii. The credit risk associated with the note receivable is mitigated by establishing a floating lien and security interest in certain of Tobii s assets, rights, and properties, whereas the deferred consideration is not secured by any collateral. The Company uses certain techniques, such as internally generated cash flow projections on the principal and interest of each instrument, to determine the likelihood that the note receivable or deferred consideration will be repaid. Further, the Company assesses each instrument for credit losses and provides a reserve when full payment on the instruments may not occur as expected. Based on the results of the internally generated cash flow projections, the Company expects Tobii to make full payment on both instruments in accordance with the underlying agreement. Accordingly, allowance for credit losses was recorded as of September 30, 2024.

of total revenue for all periods presented. The Company actively monitors and enforces its technology licenses, including seeking appropriate compensation from customers that have under-reported royalties owed under a license agreement and from third parties that utilize the Company s technologies without a license. As a result of these activities, the Company may, from time to time, recognize revenue from periodic compliance audits of licensees for underreporting royalties incurred in prior periods, or from settlements of license disputes. These settlements and recoveries may cause revenue to be higher than expected during a particular reporting period and such settlements and recoveries may not occur in subsequent periods. The Company recognizes revenue from settlements 

13 

Disaggregation of Revenue The Company s revenue that is recognized over time consists primarily of per unit royalties, per-subscriber per-month or monthly license fees, single performance obligations satisfied over time, and NRE services. Revenue that is recognized at a point in time consists primarily of fixed fee or minimum guarantee licensing contracts, hardware products, advertising and settlements/recoveries.

million and million, respectively. impairments to the carrying amount of the Company s non-marketable equity securities were recognized in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Derivatives Instruments The Company uses a foreign exchange hedging strategy to hedge local currency expenses and reduce variability associated with anticipated cash flows. The Company s derivative financial instruments consist of foreign currency forward contracts. The maturities of these instruments are generally less than twelve months. Fair values for derivative financial instruments are based on prices computed using third-party valuation models. All the significant inputs to the third-party valuation models are observable in active markets. Inputs include current market-based parameters such as forward rates, yield curves and credit default swap pricing. Cash Flow Hedges The Company designates certain foreign currency forward contracts as hedging instruments pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification ASC No. 815 Derivatives and Hedging . The effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivatives are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss AOCL in stockholders equity and reclassified into earnings on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations (Unaudited) in the period upon which the hedged transactions are settled.

The fair value of the note receivable, including accrued interest, and the deferred consideration resulting from the AutoSense Divestiture (as described in Note 6 Divestitures were estimated based on an income and market approach with valuation inputs such as the U.S. Treasury constant maturity yields, comparable bond yields, and credit spreads over the term of the same or similarly issued instruments. They are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of the Company s debt (as described in Note 8 Debt) was estimated based on an income and market approach with valuation inputs such as the U.S. Treasury constant maturity yields, comparable bond yields, and credit spreads over the term of the same or similarly issued instruments.

AutoSense In-cabin Safety Business and Related Imaging Solutions In December 2023, the Company entered into a definitive agreement with Tobii in connection with the AutoSense Divestiture. The AutoSense Divestiture represented a equity sale transaction of two of the Company s wholly-owned subsidiaries and was expected to streamline the Company s business to further focus its business on entertainment-related products and services. All of the assets and liabilities associated with the AutoSense Divestiture were classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2023. On January 31, 2024, the AutoSense Divestiture was completed for total consideration of million, comprised of million of cash, a note receivable from Tobii (the Tobii Note of million, and deferred consideration (as described under Deferred Consideration below) totaling million, which was estimated to have a fair value of million based on a present value factor as of January 31, 2024. The million of cash included in the total consideration represents the cash balance that was transferred to Tobii upon completion of the AutoSense Divestiture to support operations during the transition and was subsequently returned to the Company, and as such, this amount is included in the assets sold as of January 31, 2024 and in the total consideration received. As previously disclosed in the Form 10-K, Tobii was required to pay the Company the acquired closing cash balance, less certain adjustments, promptly following the completion of the AutoSense Divestiture.

Contingent Consideration The earnout represents potential incremental cash consideration, and the payment is contingent upon the achievement of certain targeted shipments, between January 1, 2024 and December 31, 2030, of qualified automotive products featuring the AutoSense in-cabin safety technology and the related imaging solutions. At the closing date of the AutoSense Divestiture, the Company elected to apply the gain contingency guidance under ASC 450 Contingencies , as it could not reasonably estimate shipment amounts. As a result, the Company deferred the recognition of the contingent consideration until it becomes realized or realizable.

The vesting criteria for RSUs has historically been the passage of time or meeting certain performance-based objectives, and continued service through the vesting period over three or for time-based awards or for performance-based awards. As of September 30, 2024 , there were approximately million shares reserved for future grants under the 2022 EIP. Employee Stock Purchase Plans In connection with the Separation and on October 1, 2022, the Company adopted the Xperi Inc. 2022 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (as amended, the 2022 ESPP ). The 2022 ESPP originally provided consecutive overlapping offering periods, with four purchase periods that were generally six months in length, commencing on each December 1 and June 1 during the term of the 2022 ESPP. The 2022 ESPP was subsequently amended, and commencing December 1, 2023, the length of the offering periods was reduced from to and the employee s maximum participant contribution was reduced from to of the employee s after-tax base earnings and commissions up to the limit imposed by the Internal Revenue Service. The accumulated deductions will be applied to the purchase of shares on each semi-annual purchase date. The purchase price per share will equal of the fair market value per share on the start date of the offering period or, if lower, of the fair market value per share on the semi-annual purchase date. The 2022 ESPP includes a reset provision if the fair market value per share of the Company s common stock on any purchase date during an offering period is less than the fair market value per share on the start date of the -month offering period. Upon occurrence of the reset, the existing offering period will automatically terminate and a new -month offering period will begin on the next business day. All participants in the terminated offering will be transferred to the new offering period. The reset provision under the 2022 ESPP was triggered on May 31, 2024, and it was considered a modification in accordance with ASC 718 Stock Based Compensation , with the incremental fair value of million to be recognized on a straight-line basis over the new -month offering period. On May 31, 2024, the Company issued shares under the 2022 ESPP, net of shares withheld to satisfy withholding tax requirements for certain employees, for aggregate net proceeds of million. As of September 30, 2024, there were million shares reserved for future issuance under the 2022 ESPP.

Performance-Based Awards From time to time, the Company may grant performance-based restricted stock units PSU to senior executives, certain employees, and consultants. The value and the vesting of such PSUs are generally linked to one or more performance goals or certain market conditions determined by th e Company, in each case on a specified date or dates or over any period or periods determined by the Company, and may range from to of the grant. For PSUs subject to market conditions, the fair value per award is fixed at the grant date and the amount of compensation expense is not adjusted during the performance period regardless of changes in the level of achievement of the market condition. The Company uses the closing trading price of its common stock on the date of grant as the fair value of awards or RSUs and PSUs that are based on Company-designated performance targets. For PSUs that are based on market conditions (the market-based PSUs ), fair value is estimated by using a Monte Carlo simulation on the date of grant.

The income tax expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily related to foreign withholding taxes, foreign income taxes, U.S. federal income taxes, and state income taxes. As of September 30, 2024, gross unrecognized tax benefits of million decreased by million compared to December 31, 2023. Of the total decrease, million related to the AutoSense Divestiture completed in January 2024, and million related to the settlement of an Ireland tax claim. Of the million gross unrecognized tax benefits, million would affect the effective tax rate, if recognized. The Company is unable to reasonably estimate the timing of the long-term payments or the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease. It is the Company s policy to classify accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes. Recognition of interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits was immaterial for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheets ; expense for these leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Variable lease payments are expensed as incurred and are not included within the lease liability and right-of-use assets calculation. The Company subleases certain real estate to third parties. The sublease portfolio consists of operating leases for previously exited office space. Certain subleases include variable payments for operating costs. The subleases are generally co-terminus with the head lease, or shorter. Subleases do not include any residual value guarantees or restrictions or covenants imposed by the leases. Income from subleases is recognized as a reduction to selling, general and administrative expenses. Due to the change in how the office facilities were being used, a significant decrease in the expected market price of the operating lease right-of-use ROU assets, and expected delays in subleasing the office facilities based on the condition of the commercial real estate market, the Company recorded impairment charges of million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to reduce the carrying amount of certain operating ROU assets and property and equipment, including related leasehold improvements. There were impairment charges recorded in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.

Indemnifications In the normal course of business, the Company provides indemnifications of varying scopes and amounts to certain of its licensees, customers, and business partners against claims made by third parties arising from the use of the Company's products, intellectual property, services or technologies. The Company cannot reasonably estimate the possible range of losses that may be incurred pursuant to its indemnification obligations, if any. Variables affecting any such assessment include, but are not limited to: the scope of the contractual indemnification obligation; the nature of the third party claim asserted; the relative merits of the third party claim; the financial ability of the third party claimant to engage in protracted litigation; the number of parties seeking indemnification; the nature and amount of damages claimed by the party suing the indemnified party; and the willingness of such party to engage in settlement negotiations. The Company has received requests for indemnification, but to date none has been material and no liability has been recorded in the Company s financial statements. As permitted under Delaware law, the Company has agreements whereby it indemnifies its officers and directors for certain events or occurrences while the officer or director is, or was, serving at the Company s request in such capacity.

Revenue increased by 2.5 million, or 2 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase of 21.4 million in Pay-TV revenue, driven largely by higher core guide product revenue due to the timing and duration of minimum guarantee MG contracts that were executed and continued growth in IPTV Solutions revenue, partially offset by declines in consumer hardware and subscription revenue, and an increase of 2.1 million in Connected Car revenue driven principally by increases in Audio Solutions and AutoStage revenue, partially offset by the impact of the AutoSense Divestiture. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of 15.4 million in Consumer Electronics revenue resulting from declines in MG contract revenue and market-based softness in certain end products, and a decrease of 5.6 million in Media Platform middleware solutions revenue primarily due to the timing and duration of MG contracts that were renewed in the third quarter of 2023.

Revenue decreased by 12.8 million, or 3 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decline of 40.6 million in Consumer Electronics revenue due to the AutoSense Divestiture as well as fewer MG revenue contracts due to the timing and duration of MG contracts up for renewal, and a decrease of 6.8 million in Media Platform revenue driven principally by lower advertising revenue associated with our core Pay-TV products and lower MG revenue from our middleware solutions platform. These decreases were partially offset by an increase of 20.6 million in Pay-TV revenue driven largely by higher MG revenue in core guide products and continued growth in IPTV Solutions revenue, and an increase of 14.0 million in Connected Car revenue as a result of higher Audio Solutions and AutoStage revenue, coupled with settlements executed, all of which was partially offset by the impact of the AutoSense Divestiture, during the first nine months of 2024.

Cost of Revenue, Excluding Depreciation and Amortization of Intangible Assets 
 Cost of revenue, excluding depreciation and amortization of intangible assets, consists primarily of employee-related costs, royalties paid to third parties, hardware product-related costs, content costs, hosting fees, maintenance costs and an allocation of facilities costs, as well as service center and other expenses related to providing our offerings, and non-recurring engineering NRE services. 
 Cost of revenue, excluding depreciation and amortization of intangible assets, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 27.5 million, as compared to 26.4 million in the same period of the prior year, an increase of 1.1 million, or 4 . The increase was primarily attributable to increases in Media Platform costs in the third quarter of 2024. 
 Cost of revenue, excluding depreciation and amortization of intangible assets, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 86.2 million, as compared to 85.1 million in the same period of the prior year, an increase of 1.1 million, or 1 . The increase was primarily attributable to higher delivery costs related to an increase in NRE revenue as well as an increase in Media Platform costs, partially offset by lower costs incurred in connection with advertising revenue in the first nine months of 2024. 
 Research and Development 
 Research and development expenses consist primarily of employee-related costs, stock-based compensation expense, engineering consulting expenses associated with new product and technology development, product commercialization, quality assurance and testing costs, as well as other costs related to patent applications and examinations, materials, supplies, and an allocation of facilities costs. Other than certain software development costs that are capitalized, all research and development costs are expensed as incurred. 
 Research and development expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 53.6 million, as compared to 56.4 million in the same period of the prior year, a decrease of 2.8 million, or 5 . The decrease was primarily driven by lower research and development spend in the AutoSense in-cabin safety business and related imaging solutions following the AutoSense Divestiture, a reduction in expenses related to the Perceive subsidiary, decreases in stock-based compensation and bonus expenses, and an increase in capitalized costs for internal-use software in the third quarter of 2024. These decreases were partially offset by certain one-time compensation and retention expenses associated with the Perceive Transaction as well as severance charges incurred during the third quarter of 2024. 
 Research and development expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 149.2 million, as compared to 167.0 million in the same period of the prior year, a decrease of 17.8 million, or 11 . The decrease was primarily driven by lower research and development spend in the AutoSense in-cabin safety business and related imaging solutions following the AutoSense Divestiture, a reduction in expenses related to the Perceive subsidiary, decreases in stock-based compensation and bonus expenses, and an increase in capitalized costs for internal-use software in the first nine months of 2024.

 Selling expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs (including stock-based compensation expense) for sales and marketing personnel engaged in sales and licensee support, marketing programs, public relations, promotional materials, travel, and trade show expenses. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs 
 33 

(including stock-based compensation expense) for management, information technology, finance and legal personnel, legal fees and related expenses, facilities costs, and professional services. Our general and administrative expenses, other than facilities-related expenses and fringe benefits, are not allocated to other expense line items. 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 56.5 million, as compared to 59.6 million in the same period of the prior year, a decrease of 3.1 million, or 5 . The decrease was primarily attributable to reduced employee headcount as well as decreases in stock-based compensation and bonus expenses, partially offset by an increase in certain one-time transaction costs related to the Perceive Transaction in the third quarter of 2024. 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 165.9 million, as compared to 173.9 million in the same period of the prior year, a decrease of 8.0 million, or 5 . The decrease was primarily attributable to reduced employee headcount as well as decreases in stock-based compensation and bonus expenses, partially offset by an increase in certain one-time transaction costs primarily related to the AutoSense Divestiture and the Perceive Transaction in the first nine months of 2024. 
 Stock-based Compensation

We recognized stock-based compensation expense from restricted stock units and purchases made under our employee stock purchase plan. Stock-based compensation expense decreased by 2.4 million and 6.4 million, or 13 and 12 , for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods of the prior year, respectively. The decreases were primarily driven by lower expense for performance-based restricted stock units, and reduced employee headcount during each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Depreciation Expense 
 We recognized depreciation expense for certain equipment, capitalized internal-use software, leasehold improvements, and buildings and improvements. Depreciation expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 2.9 million, as compared to 4.2 million in the same period of the prior year, a decrease of 1.3 million, or 31 . The decrease was primarily due to certain fixed assets becoming fully depreciated over the past 12 months. 
 Depreciation expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 9.8 million, as compared to 12.5 million in the same period of the prior year, a decrease of 2.7 million, or 22 . The decrease was primarily due to certain fixed assets becoming fully depreciated over the past 12 months. 
 Amortization Expense 
 We recognized amortization expense for certain intangible assets we acquired in business combinations that are recognized separately from goodwill. Amortization expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 10.9 million, as compared to 14.7 million in the same period of the prior year, a decrease of 3.8 million, or 26 . The decrease was primarily due to certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized over the past 12 months. 
 Amortization expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 33.0 million, as compared to 44.3 million in the same period of the prior year, a decrease of 11.3 million, or 26 . The decrease was primarily due to certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized over the past 12 months. 
 34 

As a result of intangible assets we acquired in previous mergers and acquisitions, we anticipate that amortization expenses will continue to be a significant expense over the next several years. See Note 7 Intangible Assets, Net of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) for additional detail. 
 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 
 As a result of optimizing our global real estate footprint and subleasing certain offices following the Spin-Off (as defined in Note 1 Description Of Business And Summary Of Significant Accounting Policies ), we recorded non-cash impairment charges of 0 and 1.1 million to reduce the carrying amount of certain operating lease right-of-use ROU assets and property and equipment, including related leasehold improvements, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. We determined that we may not be able to fully recover the carrying amount of the leased offices due to how the offices were being used, a significant decrease in the expected market price of the ROU assets, and expected delays in subleasing the office facilities based on the condition of the commercial real estate leasing market. 
 We did not record any asset impairment charge for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Gain on Divestiture 
 As previously disclosed, we completed the AutoSense Divestiture on January 31, 2024 and streamlined our business, further enhancing our focus on entertainment markets. Upon the completion of the AutoSense Divestiture, we recognized a gain of 22.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Refer to Note 6 Divestitures of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) for additional information. 
 We did not recognize any gain on divestiture in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Provision for Income Taxes 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded an income tax expense of 2.9 million and 16.4 million on a pretax loss of 16.9 million and 47.4 million, respectively, which resulted in an effective tax rate of (17.1) and (34.7) , respectively. The income tax expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily related to foreign withholding taxes, foreign income taxes, U.S. federal income taxes, and state income taxes. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recorded an income tax expense of 9.7 million and 14.5 million on a pretax loss of 32.4 million and 99.9 million, respectively, which resulted in an effective tax rate of (29.9) and (14.5) , respectively. The income tax expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily related to foreign withholding taxes, foreign income taxes, U.S. federal income taxes, and state income taxes. 
 The need for a valuation allowance requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more-likely-than-not that deferred tax assets are recoverable. Such assessment is required on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis. In making such assessment, significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified. After considering both positive and negative evidence to assess the recoverability of our net deferred tax assets, we determined that it was unlikely that we would realize our federal, certain state and certain foreign deferred tax assets given the substantial amount of tax attributes that will remain unutilized to offset reversing deferred tax liabilities. We intend to continue maintaining a full valuation allowance on our federal deferred tax assets until there is sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of these allowances. Release of the valuation allowance would result in the recognition of certain federal deferred tax assets and a decrease to income tax expense for the period the release is recorded. The exact timing and amount of the valuation allowance release depends on the level of profitability that we are able to achieve.

Our primary liquidity and capital resources are our cash and cash equivalents on hand. Cash and cash equivalents were 72.7 million at September 30, 2024, a decrease of 81.7 million from 154.4 million, including 12.3 million classified as held for sale in connection with the AutoSense Divestiture, as of December 31, 2023. This decrease resulted primarily from cash used in operations of 56.6 million, 10.0 million in repurchases of common stock, 6.6 million in payments of withholding taxes on net share settlement of equity awards and 12.4 million of capital expenditures, including capitalized internal-use software costs, offset by 4.3 million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan ESPP ). In addition, in October 2024, we completed the Perceive Transaction and received a cash payment of 68.0 million from the Buyer. 
 For information about our material cash requirements, see Liquidity and Capital Resources in Part II, Item 7 of our Form 10-K. Our cash requirements have not changed materially since December 31, 2023. 
 Stock Repurchase Program 
 In April 2024, our Board of Directors (the Board authorized the repurchase of up to 100.0 million of our common stock (the Program ). Under the Program, we may make repurchases, from time to time, through open market purchases, block trades, privately negotiated transactions, accelerated share repurchase transactions, or other means. We may also, from time to time, enter into Rule 10b5-1 plans to facilitate repurchases under the Program. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased a total of approximately 1.1 million shares of common stock at an average price of 8.92 per share for a total cost of 10.0 million. As of September 30, 2024, the total remaining amount available for repurchase was 90.0 million. We expect to continue to fund the repurchase program from cash and cash equivalents, including from the net proceeds of the Perceive Transaction. Repurchases under the Program may not enhance the value of our common stock. 
 Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
 Net cash used in operating activities was 56.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to our net loss of 63.8 million being further adjusted by 55.6 million of changes in operating assets and liabilities driven principally by an increase of 43.5 million in unbilled contracts receivable, and 22.9 million of a non-cash gain recognized from the AutoSense Divestiture, partially offset by non-cash items such as stock-based compensation expense of 45.3 million, amortization of intangible assets of 33.0 million, and depreciation expense of 9.8 million. 
 Net cash used in operating activities was 20.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to our net loss of 114.4 million being further adjusted by 14.7 million of changes in operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by non-cash items such as depreciation expense of 12.5 million, amortization of intangible assets of 44.3 million, stock-based compensation expense of 51.7 million, and an asset impairment charge of 1.1 million. 
 Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 12.9 million and 9.6 million for nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which was primarily related to capital expenditures, including capitalized internal-use software. 
 Capital Expenditures 
 Our capital expenditures for property and equipment consist primarily of purchases of computer hardware and software, capitalized internal-use software, information systems, and production and test equipment. We expect capital expenditures in 2024 to be approximately 20.0 million. These expenditures are expected to be paid with existing cash and cash equivalents. 
 36 

There can be no assurance that current expectations will be realized, and plans are subject to change upon further review of our capital expenditure needs. 
 Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 12.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, due to 10.0 million in repurchases of common stock under the Program and 6.6 million in payment of withholding taxes related to net share settlement of equity awards, partially offset by 4.3 million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our ESPP. 
 Net cash provided by financing activities was 1.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, due to 5.9 million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our ESPP, partially offset by the payment of 4.4 million in withholding taxes related to net share settlement of equity awards. 
 Short-Term Debt 
 In connection with the acquisition of Vewd Software Holdings Limited Vewd on July 1, 2022, we issued a senior unsecured promissory note (the Promissory Note to the sellers of Vewd in the principal amount of 50.0 million, of which 50.0 million was outstanding at September 30, 2024. Indebtedness outstanding under the Promissory Note bears an interest rate of 6.00 per annum, subject to potential adjustments as described in Note 8 Debt to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report. The Promissory Note matures on July 1, 2025. We may, at any time and on any one or more occasions, prepay all or any portion of the outstanding principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, under the Promissory Note without premium or penalty. In addition, the Promissory Note has mandatory prepayment provisions upon certain change of control or asset sale events. 
 Short-Term Liquidity/Financings 
 We believe our current cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our needs for at least the next 12 months from the issuance date of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report. As the Promissory Note (see Short-Term Debt matures on July 1, 2025, we expect to use a portion of the proceeds from the Perceive asset sale and may also access the capital markets for additional funding to make full payment on the maturity date. 
 As we assess growth strategies, we may need to supplement our cash and cash equivalents with outside sources. As part of our liquidity strategy, we will continue to monitor our earnings and cash flow as well as our ability to access the capital markets in light of those levels. 
 Poor financial results, unanticipated expenses, unanticipated acquisitions of technologies or businesses or unanticipated strategic investments could give rise to additional financing requirements sooner than we expect. Equity or debt financing may not be available when needed or, if available, equity or debt financing may not be on terms satisfactory to us. 
 We may supplement our short-term liquidity needs with access to capital markets, if necessary, and strategic cost savings initiatives. Our access to capital markets may be constrained and our cost of borrowing may increase under certain business and market conditions, and our liquidity is subject to various risks including the risks identified in Risk Factors included in Part I, Item 1A of our Form 10-K. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no significant changes in our critical accounting estimates. For a discussion of our critical accounting estimates, see Part II, Item 7 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Form 10-K. 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitati ve Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 
 There have been no material changes to our exposure to market risk since December 31, 2023. For a discussion of our market risk, see Part II, Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in our Form 10-K. 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted pursuant to the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of such date. 
 Change in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act, during the last fiscal quarter covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 38 

PART II - OTH ER INFORMATION 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 In the normal course of our business, we are involved in legal proceedings. In the past, we have litigated to enforce the terms of license agreements, determine infringement or validity of intellectual property rights, and defend ourselves or our customers against claims of infringement or breach of contract. We expect to continue to be involved in similar legal proceedings in the future. Although considerable uncertainty exists, our management does not anticipate that the disposition of these matters will have a material effect on our results of operations, consolidated financial position or liquidity. However, the disposition, costs, or liabilities could be material to our results of operations in the period recognized. 
 Item 1A. Ri sk Factors 
 Except as set forth below, there were no material changes to the risk factors previously disclosed in Part 1, Item 1A. of our Form 10-K. 
 Our stock repurchase program may not be fully consummated, may not enhance long-term stockholder value, may increase the volatility of our stock prices and, as we implement it, will diminish our cash reserves. 
 Pursuant to the Program adopted in April 2024, we may repurchase of up to 100.0 million of our common stock, from time to time, through open market purchases, block trades, in privately negotiated transactions, accelerated share repurchase transactions, or by other means. Since the inception of the Program, we have repurchased an aggregate of approximately 1.1 million shares of common stock at a total cost of 10.0 million at an average price of 8.92 per share of common stock. The volume, timing, and manner of any repurchases will be determined at our discretion, subject to general market conditions, as well as our management of capital, general business conditions, other investment opportunities, regulatory requirements, and other factors. The Program does not have an expiration date and does not obligate us to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares, or to do so in any particular manner. Further, repurchases under the Program could affect our share trading prices or increase their volatility, and any repurchases will reduce our cash reserves. We are under no legal obligation to repurchase any shares, and if we do not do so or if we commence repurchases and then suspend or terminate them, the trading prices of our stock may decrease and their volatility increase. We may not in the future have cash and cash equivalents sufficient to fund all potential repurchases under the Program. Even if we complete the Program, we may not be successful in our goal of enhancing stockholder value. As we use our cash resources in the Program, we have less cash to fund our operations and pursue other opportunities that may provide value to stockholders. 
 We face risks associated with financial instruments we hold. 
 We hold financial instruments that potentially subject us to significant concentrations of credit risk, which instruments consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, unbilled contracts receivable, a note receivable and deferred consideration from the AutoSense Divestiture. We maintain cash and cash equivalents with large financial institutions, and at times, the deposits have exceeded and may exceed the federally insured limits. Our evaluation process as to accounts receivable and unbilled contracts receivable may fail to detect or prevent credit risks. In addition, in connection with the AutoSense Divestiture, we hold a 27.7 million note receivable from Tobii, who also owes us 15.0 million in deferred consideration and may become obligated to make earnout payments to us contingent upon the future success of the divested AutoSense in-cabin safety business. The note is payable in three annual installments commencing on April 1, 2027, and matures on April 1, 2029. Payments of the deferred consideration are due in four annual installments commencing in February 2028, and any contingent consideration would be payable in 2031. Accordingly, although we carry the note receivable and the deferred consideration on our balance sheet, we are not entitled to receive any payment associated with these assets in the near term and we face credit risk until the obligations are fully paid. Our receipt of payments for the note receivable, deferred consideration, and any earned contingent consideration will depend on Tobii s then-available liquidity and capital resources. If we determine it is appropriate to impair any of the financial instruments we hold, our financial position and results of operations would be adversely affected.

 Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities . 
 Not applicable. 
 Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures . 
 Not applicable. 
 Item 5. Other Information . 
 
 (a) 	On November 5, 2024, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Employment and Severance Agreement (the Amended and Restated Employment Agreement with Jon E. Kirchner, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and President, effective as of November 6, 2024 (the Effective Date ). The Amended and Restated Employment Agreement replaces Mr. Kirchner s existing employment agreement, which was set to expire in June 2025. 
 The Amended and Restated Employment Agreement has an initial term expiring on the three year anniversary of the Effective Date, with an automatic 12 month extension. The term of the Amended and Restated Employment Agreement will automatically be extended for 18 months following a change in control of the Company if the term would otherwise have expired during such 18-month period. 
 The Amended and Restated Employment Agreement sets forth Mr. Kirchner s compensation, including his current annual base salary of 750,000 and his annual target bonus of 100 of his base salary. 
 Other than the extension of the term, the Amended and Restated Employment Agreement provides for substantially the same terms, including severance benefits, as applied under Mr. Kirchner s existing employment agreement. 
 The foregoing description of the Amended and Restated Employment Agreement does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by, the full text of the Amended and Restated Employment Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1, which agreement is incorporated herein by reference. 
 (b) 	None. 
 (c) 	Securities Trading Arrangements of Directors and Section 16 Officers.

To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld in accordance with this Section 1.5 , such amounts shall be paid to the applicable Tax Authority or Governmental Body, and shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of whom such deduction and withholding were made. At or prior to the Closing, and at such time thereafter as reasonably requested by Buyer, Seller shall provide Buyer a duly executed copy of any IRS Form W-9, W-8, or W-4 and any other certificates or forms, as applicable, with respect to Seller, Seller Parent, or any other Persons, in order to allow Buyer to meet its withholding and information reporting obligations under Applicable Law. Buyer shall not have any obligation after the Closing to pay any amount under this Agreement to Seller or any other Persons receiving payment if Seller or such other Person has not provided any IRS Form W-8, W-9, or W-4, any clearance certificate or any other certificates or forms that Buyer may reasonably request in order to satisfy withholding and information reporting obligations under Applicable Law. 
 1.6	Non-Assignability of Purchased Assets 
 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, to the extent that the sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance, or delivery or attempted sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance, or delivery to Buyer of any Purchased Assets or any Claim or right or any benefit arising thereunder or resulting therefrom is prohibited by Applicable Law or would require any governmental or third-party authorizations, approvals, consents, or waivers, and such authorizations, approvals, consents, or waivers have not been obtained prior to the Closing, the Closing may proceed without the sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance, or delivery of such Purchased Asset if agreed in writing between Buyer and Seller. Following the Closing, Seller shall use reasonable best efforts, and cooperate with Buyer, to obtain promptly all such authorizations, approvals, consents, or waivers. Pending 
 - 8 - 

such authorizations, approvals, consents, or waivers, the parties shall cooperate with each other in any mutually agreeable, reasonable, and lawful arrangements designed to provide Buyer the benefits of use of such Purchased Asset that it would have obtained had such Purchased Asset been sold, assigned, transferred, conveyed, or delivered to Buyer at the Closing. Once authorization, approval, consent, or waiver for the sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance, or delivery of any such Purchased Asset not sold, assigned, transferred, conveyed, or delivered at the Closing is obtained, Seller shall assign, transfer, convey, and deliver such Purchased Asset (and any associated Assumed Liabilities) to Buyer at no additional cost. To the extent that any such Purchased Asset cannot be assigned, transferred, conveyed, or delivered and the full benefits of use of any such Purchased Asset cannot be provided to Buyer following the Closing pursuant to this Section 1.6 , then Buyer and Seller shall enter into such reasonable and lawful arrangements (including subleasing, sublicensing, or subcontracting) to provide the parties hereto the economic and operational equivalent, to the extent permitted, of the assignment, transfer, conveyance, and delivery of such Purchased Asset.

 Unless the board of directors shall otherwise determine, meetings of stockholders shall be presided over by the chief executive officer, to the extent he or she is a member of the board of directors, or in his or her absence or at his or her direction by the chair of the board, if any, or in the absence or at the direction of either of the foregoing persons by a chairperson, who shall be a director or officer of the corporation, designated by the board of directors. The secretary shall act as secretary of the meeting, but in his or her absence the chairperson of the meeting may appoint any person to act as secretary of the meeting. The board of directors of the corporation may adopt by resolution such rules and regulations for the conduct of any meeting of the stockholders as it shall deem appropriate. Except to the extent inconsistent with any rules and regulations adopted by the board of directors, the chair of any meeting of stockholders shall determine the order of business and the procedure at the meeting, including such regulation of the manner of voting and the conduct of business. 
 2.11	VOTING 
 The stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.14 of these bylaws, subject to the provisions of Sections 217 and 218 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (relating to voting rights of fiduciaries, pledgers and joint owners of stock and to voting trusts and other voting agreements). 
 Unless otherwise required by law or provided in the certificate of incorporation, each stockholder shall be entitled to one vote, in person or by proxy, for each share of capital stock held by such stockholder. 
 2.12	WAIVER OF NOTICE 
 Notice of any meeting need not be given to any stockholder who shall, either before or after the meeting, submit a waiver of notice or who shall attend such meeting, except when the stockholder attends for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Any stockholder waiving notice of a meeting shall be bound by the proceedings of the meeting in all respects as if due notice thereof had been given. 
 2.13	NO STOCKHOLDER ACTION BY WRITTEN CONSENT WITHOUT A MEETING 
 Any action required to be taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders of the corporation, or any action that may be taken at any annual or special meeting of such stockholders, must be taken at an annual or special meeting of stockholders of the corporation, with prior notice and with a vote, and may not be taken by a consent in writing. 
 11 

2.14	RECORD DATE FOR STOCKHOLDER NOTICE; VOTING 
 In order that the corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the board of directors may fix, in advance, a record date, which shall not be more than sixty (60) nor less than ten (10) days before the date of such meeting, nor more than sixty (60) days prior to any other action. If the board of directors so fixes a record date to determine the stockholders entitled to notice of any meeting of stockholders, such date shall also be the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting unless the board of directors determines, at the time it fixes such record date, that a later date on or before the date of the meeting shall be the date for making such determination. 
 If the board of directors does not so fix a record date: 
 (a)	The record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held. 
 (b)	The record date for determining stockholders for any other purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the board of directors adopts the resolution relating thereto. 
 A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the board of directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting as provided in Section 2.9 hereof. 
 2.15	PROXIES 
 Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders may authorize another person or persons to act for him by proxy as permitted by law, as amended, filed in accordance with the procedure established for the meeting, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. A copy, facsimile transmission, or other reliable reproduction of the proxy authorized by this Section 2.15 may be substituted for or used in lieu of the original writing or electronic transmission for any and all purposes for which the original writing or electronic transmission could be used, provided that such copy, facsimile transmission, or other reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of the entire original writing or electronic transmission. A proxy shall be irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable and if, and only as long as, it is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to support an irrevocable power. Any stockholder directly or indirectly soliciting proxies from other stockholders must use a proxy card color other than white, which shall be reserved for the exclusive use by the board of directors. 
 12 

ARTICLE III. DIRECTORS 
 3.1	POWERS 
 Subject to the provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware and any limitations in the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws relating to action required to be approved by the stockholders or by the outstanding shares, the business and affairs of the corporation shall be managed and all corporate powers shall be exercised by or under the direction of the board of directors. 
 3.2	NUMBER OF DIRECTORS 
 The board of directors shall consist of not less than five (5) and not more than nine (9) directors as fixed from time to time by resolution of the board of directors. Each director shall hold office until a successor is duly elected and qualified or until the director s earlier death, resignation, disqualification, or removal. 
 No reduction of the authorized number of directors shall have the effect of removing any director before that director s term of office expires. 
 3.3	ELECTION, QUALIFICATION AND TERM OF OFFICE OF DIRECTORS 
 Directors shall be elected at each annual meeting of the stockholders or special meeting in lieu thereof, and each director, including a director elected to fill a vacancy or newly created directorship, shall serve until his or her successor is duly elected and qualified or until his or her death, resignation or removal. 
 Each director to be elected by the stockholders shall be elected by the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast with respect to such director by the shares represented and entitled to vote therefor at a meeting of the stockholders for the election of directors at which a quorum is present (an Election Meeting ); provided, however, that if the board of directors determines that the number of nominees exceeds the number of directors to be elected at such meeting (a Contested Election ), whether or not the election becomes an uncontested election after such determination, each of the directors to be elected at the Election Meeting shall be elected by the affirmative vote of a plurality of the votes cast by the shares represented and entitled to vote at such meeting with respect to the election of such director. 
 For purposes of this Section 3.3 , a majority of the votes cast means that the number of votes cast for a candidate for director exceeds the number of votes cast against that director (with abstentions and broker non-votes not counted as votes cast as either for or against such director s election). In an election other than a Contested Election, stockholders will be given the choice to cast votes for or against the election of directors or to abstain from such vote and shall not have the ability to cast any other vote with respect to such election of directors. In a Contested Election, stockholders will be given the choice to cast for or withhold votes for the election of directors and shall not have the ability to cast any other vote with respect to such election of directors. In the event an Election Meeting involves the election of directors by separate 
 13 

votes by class or classes or series, the determination as to whether an election constitutes a Contested Election shall be made on a class by class or series by series basis, as applicable. The board of directors has established procedures under which any director who is not elected shall offer to tender his or her resignation to the board of directors. 
 Newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors or any vacancies in the board of directors resulting from death, resignation, retirement, disqualification, or removal from office may be filled only by a majority vote of the directors then in office even though less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director, and not by the stockholders. In the event of a vacancy in the board of directors, the remaining directors, except as otherwise provided by law, may exercise the powers of the full board of directors until the vacancy is filled. 
 Elections of directors need not be by written ballot. There shall be no right with respect to shares of stock of the corporation to cumulate votes in the election of directors. 
 3.4	PLACE OF MEETINGS; MEETINGS BY TELEPHONE 
 The board of directors of the corporation may hold meetings, both regular and special, either within or outside the State of Delaware. 
 Unless otherwise restricted by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, members of the board of directors, or any committee designated by the board of directors, may participate in a meeting of the board of directors, or any committee, by means of conference telephone or other communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other, and such participation in a meeting shall constitute presence in person at the meeting. 
 3.5	REGULAR MEETINGS 
 Regular meetings of the board of directors may be held without notice at such time and at such place as shall from time to time be determined by the board. 
 3.6	SPECIAL MEETINGS; NOTICE 
 Special meetings of the board for any purpose or purposes may be called at any time by the chair of the board, the president, the secretary or a majority of the total number of directors constituting the board of directors. 
 Notice of the time and place of special meetings shall be given in person or by telephone, mail addressed to such director at such director s address as it appears on the records of the corporation, facsimile, email, or by other means of electronic transmission. Notice is to be provided at least twenty-four (24) hours before the time of the holding of the meeting, unless the notice is mailed. If the notice is mailed, it shall be deposited in the United States mail at least four (4) days before the time of the holding of the meeting. Any oral notice given personally or by telephone may be communicated either to the director or to a person at the office of the director who the person giving the notice has reason to believe will promptly communicate it to the director. The notice need not specify the purpose or the place of the meeting, if the meeting is to be held at the principal executive office of the corporation. 
 14 

3.7	QUORUM 
 At all meetings of the board of directors, a majority of the authorized number of directors shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business and the act of a majority of the directors present at any meeting at which there is a quorum shall be the act of the board of directors, except as may be otherwise specifically provided by statute or by the certificate of incorporation. If a quorum is not present at any meeting of the board of directors, then the directors present thereat may adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum is present. At least twenty-four (24) hours notice of any adjourned meeting of the board of directors shall be given to each director whether or not present at the time of the adjournment, unless the notice is mailed, in which case it shall be deposited in the United States mail at least four days before the time of the holding of the meeting. 
 A meeting at which a quorum is initially present may continue to transact business notwithstanding the withdrawal of directors, if any action taken is approved by at least a majority of the required quorum for that meeting. 
 3.8	WAIVER OF NOTICE 
 Whenever notice is required to be given under any provision of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware or of the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, a waiver thereof, in writing signed by, or by electronic transmission by, the person entitled to notice, whether before or after such notice is required, shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the directors, or members of a committee of directors, need be specified in any waiver of notice unless so required by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws. 
 3.9	ORGANIZATION 
 At each regular or special meeting of the board of directors, the chair of the board or, in his or her absence, the lead independent director or, in his or her absence, another director or officer selected by the board of directors shall preside. The secretary shall act as secretary at each meeting of the board of directors. If the secretary is absent from any meeting of the board of directors, an assistant secretary of the corporation shall perform the duties of secretary at such meeting; and in the absence from any such meeting of the secretary and all assistant secretaries of the corporation, the person presiding at the meeting may appoint any person to act as secretary of the meeting. 
 3.10	BOARD ACTION BY WRITTEN CONSENT WITHOUT A MEETING 
 Unless otherwise restricted by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, any action required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of the board of directors, or of any committee thereof, may be taken without a meeting if all members of the board or committee, as the case may be, consent thereto in writing or by electronic transmission. 
 15 

3.11	FEES AND COMPENSATION OF DIRECTORS 
 Unless otherwise restricted by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, the board of directors shall have the authority to fix the compensation of directors. No such compensation shall preclude any director from serving the corporation in any other capacity and receiving compensation therefor. 
 3.12	REMOVAL AND RESIGNATION OF DIRECTORS 
 Any director may resign at any time by notice given in writing or by electronic transmission to the corporation. Any resignation shall take effect at the time specified in that notice or upon the happening of an event specified therein, and if no time or event is specified, at the time of its receipt; and, unless otherwise specified in that notice, the acceptance of the resignation shall not be necessary to make it effective. When one or more directors so resigns and the resignation is effective at a future date or upon the happening of an event to occur on a future date, a majority of the directors then in office, including those who have so resigned, shall have power to fill such vacancy or vacancies, the vote thereon to take effect when such resignation or resignations shall become effective, and each director so chosen shall hold office as provided in Section 3.3 . 
 3.13	CHAIR OF THE BOARD 
 The chair of the board, if appointed, shall, if present, preside at meetings of the board of directors and exercise and perform such other powers and duties as may from time to time be assigned to him or her by the board of directors or as may be prescribed by these bylaws.

 ARTICLE IV. COMMITTEES 
 4.1	COMMITTEES OF DIRECTORS 
 The board of directors may, by resolution passed by a majority of the whole board or as specified in these bylaws, designate one or more committees, with each committee to consist of one or more of the directors of the corporation. The board may designate one or more directors as alternate members of any committee, who may replace any absent or disqualified member at any meeting of the committee. If a member of a committee shall be absent from any meeting, or disqualified from voting thereat, the remaining member or members present at the meeting and not disqualified from voting, whether or not such member or members constitute a quorum, may unanimously appoint another member of the board of directors to act at the meeting in the place of any such absent or disqualified member. Any such committee, to the extent provided in the resolution of the board of directors or in these bylaws, shall have and may exercise all the powers and authority of the board of directors in the management of the business and affairs of the corporation, and may authorize the seal of the corporation to be affixed to all papers that may require it; but no such committee shall have the power or authority to (i) approve or adopt, or recommend to the stockholders, any action or matter expressly required by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware to be submitted to stockholders for approval, or (ii) adopt, amend or repeal any bylaw of the corporation. 
 16

 Any officer may resign at any time by giving written notice to the corporation. Any resignation shall take effect on the date of the receipt of that notice or at any later time specified in that notice; and, unless otherwise specified in that notice, the acceptance of the resignation shall not be necessary to make it effective.

ARTICLE VI. INDEMNITY 
 6.1	INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS 
 The corporation shall, to the maximum extent and in the manner permitted by applicable law as it presently exists or may hereafter be amended, indemnify and hold harmless each of its directors and officers against expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines, settlements, and other amounts actually and reasonably incurred in connection with any proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative, arising by reason of the fact that such person is or was an agent of the corporation. For purposes of this Section 6.1 , a director or officer of the corporation includes any person (i) who is or was a director or officer of the corporation, (ii) who is or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise or (iii) who was a director or officer of a corporation which was a predecessor corporation of the corporation or of another enterprise at the request of such predecessor corporation. Notwithstanding this Section 6.1 , the corporation shall be required to indemnify a director or officer in connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) commenced by such person only if the commencement of such proceeding (or part thereof) by the person was authorized in the specific case by the board of directors. 
 6.2	INDEMNIFICATION OF OTHERS 
 The corporation shall have the power, to the extent and in the manner permitted by applicable law as it presently exists or may hereafter be amended, to indemnify and hold harmless each of its employees and agents (other than directors and officers) against expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines, settlements and other amounts actually and reasonably incurred in connection with any proceeding, arising by reason of the fact that such person is or was an agent of the corporation. For purposes of this Section 6.2 , an employee or agent of the corporation (other than a director or officer) includes any person (i) who is or was an employee or agent of the corporation, (ii) who is or was serving at the request of the corporation as an employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise or (iii) who was an employee or agent of a corporation which was a predecessor corporation of the corporation or of another enterprise at the request of such predecessor corporation. 
 6.3	PAYMENT OF EXPENSES IN ADVANCE 
 Expenses incurred in defending any action or proceeding for which indemnification is required pursuant to Section 6.1 or for which indemnification is permitted pursuant to Section 6.2 following authorization thereof by the board of directors shall be paid by the corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the indemnified party to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that the indemnified party is not entitled to be indemnified as authorized in this Article VI . 
 6.4	INDEMNITY NOT EXCLUSIVE 
 The indemnification provided by this Article VI shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights which those seeking indemnification may be entitled under any bylaw, agreement, vote of

stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in an official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office, to the extent that additional rights to indemnification are authorized in the certificate of incorporation.

 6.6	CONFLICTS 
 No indemnification or advance shall be made under this Article VI , except where such indemnification or advance is mandated by law or the order, judgment or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction, in any circumstance where it appears: 
 (a)	that it would be inconsistent with a provision of the certificate of incorporation, these bylaws, a resolution of the stockholders or an agreement in effect at the time of the accrual of the alleged cause of the action asserted in the proceeding in which the expenses were incurred or other amounts were paid, which prohibits or otherwise limits indemnification; or 
 (b)	that it would be inconsistent with any condition expressly imposed by a court in approving a settlement. 
 ARTICLE VII. RECORDS AND REPORTS 
 7.1	MAINTENANCE AND INSPECTION OF RECORDS 
 Any records administered by or on behalf of the corporation in the regular course of its business, including its stock ledger, books of account, and minute books, may be maintained on any information storage device, method, or one or more electronic networks or databases (including one or more distributed electronic networks or databases); provided that the records so kept can be converted into clearly legible paper form within a reasonable time, and, with respect to the stock ledger, the records so kept comply with Section 224 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.

 The officer who has charge of the stock ledger of a corporation shall prepare and make, no later than the tenth (10th) day before each meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders 
 21 

entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder; provided, that the corporation shall not be required to include electronic mail addresses or other electronic contact information on such list.

In the event that the corporation determines to make the list available on an electronic network, the corporation may take reasonable steps to ensure that such information is available only to stockholders of the corporation. Except as provided by applicable law, the stock ledger of the corporation shall be the only evidence as to who are the stockholders entitled to examine the stock ledger and the list of stockholders or to vote in person or by proxy at any meeting of stockholders. 
 ARTICLE VIII. GENERAL MATTERS 
 8.1	CHECKS 
 From time to time, the board of directors shall determine by resolution which person or persons may sign or endorse all checks, drafts, other orders for payment of money, notes or other evidences of indebtedness that are issued in the name of or payable to the corporation, and only the persons so authorized shall sign or endorse those instruments. 
 8.2	EXECUTION OF CORPORATE CONTRACTS AND INSTRUMENTS 
 The board of directors, except as otherwise provided in these bylaws, may authorize any officer or officers, or agent or agents, to enter into any contract or execute any instrument in the name of and on behalf of the corporation; such authority may be general or confined to specific instances. Unless so authorized or ratified by the board of directors or within the agency power of an officer, no officer, agent or employee shall have any power or authority to bind the corporation by any contract or engagement or to pledge its credit or to render it liable for any purpose or for any amount. 
 8.3	STOCK CERTIFICATES 
 The shares of a corporation shall be represented by certificates; provided that the board of directors of the corporation may provide by resolution or resolutions that some or all of any or all classes or series of its stock shall be uncertificated shares that may be evidenced by a book-entry system maintained by the registrar of such stock. Any such resolution shall not apply to shares represented by a certificate until such certificate is surrendered to the corporation. Every holder of stock represented by certificates shall be entitled to have a certificate signed by, or in the name of the corporation by the chair or vice chair of the board of directors, or the president or vice president, and by the secretary or an assistant secretary, or the treasurer, if there be one, of such corporation representing the number of shares registered in certificate form. Any or all of the signatures on the 
 22 

certificate may be a facsimile. In case any officer, transfer agent or registrar who has signed or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a certificate has ceased to be such officer, transfer agent or registrar before such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the corporation with the same effect as if he were such officer, transfer agent or registrar at the date of issue. 
 8.4	SPECIAL DESIGNATION ON CERTIFICATES 
 If the corporation is authorized to issue more than one class of stock or more than one series of any class, then the powers, the designations, the preferences and the relative, participating, optional or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights shall be set forth in full or summarized on the face or back of the certificate that the corporation shall issue to represent such class or series of stock; provided, however, that, except as otherwise provided in Section 202 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, in lieu of the foregoing requirements there may be set forth on the face or back of the certificate that the corporation shall issue to represent such class or series of stock a statement that the corporation will furnish without charge to each stockholder who so requests the powers, the designations, the preferences and the relative, participating, optional or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights. 
 8.5	LOST CERTIFICATES 
 Except as provided in this Section 8.5 , no new certificates for shares shall be issued to replace a previously issued certificate unless the latter is surrendered to the corporation and canceled at the same time. The corporation may issue a new certificate of stock or uncertificated shares in the place of any certificate theretofore issued by it, alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed, and the corporation may require the owner of the lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, or his legal representative, to give the corporation a bond sufficient to indemnify it against any claim that may be made against it on account of the alleged loss, theft or destruction of any such certificate or the issuance of such new certificate or uncertificated shares. 
 8.6	CONSTRUCTION; DEFINITIONS

In no event shall Executive be entitled to any reimbursement payments after the last day of Executive s taxable year following the taxable year in which the expense was incurred. This section shall only apply to in-kind benefits and reimbursements that would result in taxable compensation income to Executive.

Section 2000, et seq .; the Americans with Disabilities Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq .; the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, 29 U.S.C. 701 et seq .; the Civil Rights Act of 1866, and the Civil Rights Act of 1991; 42 U.S.C. Section 1981, et seq .; the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, as amended, 29 U.S.C. Section 621, et seq . (the ADEA ); the Equal Pay Act, as amended, 29 U.S.C.

(vi) Claims based on Executive s right to file a charge with or participate in a charge by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, or any other local, state or federal administrative body or government agency that is authorized to enforce or administer laws related to employment, against the Company for discrimination (with the understanding that Executive s release of claims herein bars Executive from recovering such monetary relief from the Company or any Company Releasee for any alleged discriminatory treatment); 

(vii) Claims Executive may have to vested or earned compensation and benefits; and 

(viii) Executive s rights under Section 6(b) of the Agreement. 

(b) EXECUTIVE ACKNOWLEDGES THAT HE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF AND IS FAMILIAR WITH THE PROVISIONS OF CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE SECTION 1542, WHICH PROVIDES AS FOLLOWS: 

A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS THAT THE CREDITOR OR RELEASING PARTY DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE AND THAT, IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER, WOULD HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR OR RELEASED PARTY.

 (c) Executive acknowledges that Executive is entitled to have twenty-one (21) days time in which to consider this Release. Executive further acknowledges that the Company has advised him that he is waiving his rights under the ADEA, and that Executive has the right to and should consult with an attorney of his choice before signing this Release, and Executive has had sufficient time to consider the terms of this Release. Executive represents and acknowledges that if Executive executes this Release before twenty-one (21) days have elapsed, Executive does so knowingly, voluntarily, and upon the advice and with the approval of Executive s legal counsel (if any), and that Executive voluntarily waives any remaining consideration period. 

(d) Executive understands that after executing this Release, Executive has the right to revoke it within seven (7) days after his execution of it. Executive understands that this Release will not become effective and enforceable unless the seven (7) day revocation period passes and Executive does not revoke the Release in writing.

2. No Assignment . Executive represents and warrants to the Company Releasees that there has been no assignment or other transfer of any interest in any Claim that Executive may have against the Company Releasees. Executive agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company Releasees from any liability, claims, demands, damages, costs, expenses and attorneys fees incurred as a result of any such assignment or transfer from Executive. 

3. Severability . In the event any provision of this Release is found to be unenforceable by an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction, such provision shall be deemed modified to the extent necessary to allow enforceability of the provision as so limited, it being intended that the patties shall receive the benefit contemplated herein to the fullest extent permitted by law. If a deemed modification is not satisfactory in the judgment of such arbitrator or court, the unenforceable provision shall be deemed deleted, and the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not be affected thereby. 

4. Interpretation: Construction . The headings set forth in this Release are for convenience only and shall not be used in interpreting this Agreement. This Release has been drafted by legal counsel representing the Company, but Executive has participated in the negotiation of its terms. Furthermore, Executive acknowledges that Executive has had an opportunity to review and revise the Release and have it reviewed by legal counsel, if desired, and, therefore, the normal rule of construction to the effect that any ambiguities are to be resolved against the drafting party shall not be employed in the interpretation of this Release. Either party s failure to enforce any provision of this Release shall not in any way be construed as a waiver of any such provision, or prevent that party thereafter from enforcing each and every other provision of this Release.
