 Notes
to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 

 (Unaudited) 

Since
we commenced operations in 2015, we have generated significant losses. We incurred net cash outflows from operations of 
million and 
million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company had an accumulated deficit as of September
30, 2024 of 
million. The Company s primary sources of liquidity are its cash collected from the sales of its products, and cash flows from
financing transactions. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 
million, compared to 
million as of December 31, 2023. 

As a result of our losses and projected cash needs,
the Company s management has determined that substantial doubt exists about our ability to continue as a going concern for at least
twelve months from the issuance date of these financial statements. The Company s ability to continue as a going concern is contingent
upon successful execution of management s plans over the next twelve months to improve the Company s liquidity and
profitability, which includes without limitation: 

Expanding the commercialization of Ameluz in the United
States while decreasing discretionary expenses. 
 
 Actively pursuing additional capital through the issuance of equity securities,
debt or the sale of assets. 
 
 Controlling expenses and limiting capital expenditures. 
 
 Realizing the benefit of the reduced cost of inventory in line with the
terms of the Second A R Ameluz LSA. 

Management
believes that the implementation of such plans will provide the opportunity for the Company to continue as a going concern. However,
no assurance can be given that the Company will be successful in these efforts and the substantial doubt will be alleviated. 

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and
satisfaction of liabilities in the ordinary course of business. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to
the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might result
from the outcome of the uncertainties described above.

Investment,
related party 

As
of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company held as an investment, (as adjusted for a reverse stock split on May 14,
2024) and , respectively, common shares of Biofrontera, AG, a company who holds a greater than five percent of our Common Stock
and is traded on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. The fair values of these investments were determined with Level 1 inputs through references
to quoted market prices. 

Warrant
Liabilities 

The
warrant liabilities are comprised of (i) outstanding warrants to purchase shares of Common Stock originally issued in a private
placement on May 16, 2022, as amended on November 2, 2023 to extend the expiration date until November 2, 2028 and revise the exercise
price to per share (the 2022 Purchase Warrants ), (ii) warrants to purchase shares of Common Stock issued
on July 26, 2022, as amended on November 2, 2023 to extend the expiration date until November 2, 2028 and revise the exercise price to
 per share (the 2022 Inducement Warrants ), and (iii) warrants to purchase shares of Common Stock issued
on November 2, 2023 expiring following the date of issuance and with an exercise price of per share the 2023
Purchase Warrants ). 

The
2022 Purchase Warrants, the 2022 Inducement Warrants and the 2023 Purchase Warrants were accounted for as liabilities as these warrants
provide for a redemption right in the case of a fundamental transaction which fails the requirement of the indexation guidance under
ASC 815-40. The warrant liabilities are re-measured at each balance sheet date until their exercise or expiration, and any change in
fair value is recognized in the Company s consolidated statement of operations. 

The
fair value for the Level 3 2022 Purchase Warrants, 2022 Inducement Warrants and the 2023 Purchase Warrants was estimated using a Black-Scholes-Merton BSM model. Certain inputs utilized in our BSM model may fluctuate in future periods based upon factors which are outside
of the Company s control. A significant change in one or more of these inputs used in the calculation of the fair value may cause
a significant change to the fair value of our warrant liabilities which could also result in material non-cash gain or loss being reported
in our consolidated statement of operations. The fair value of these warrants was determined using the BSM option pricing model based
on the following assumptions for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024: fair value of the underlying common stock of 
to , expected volatility of to , risk free rate of to , remaining contractual term of to years and
a dividend yield of . The expected life of the warrants is assumed to be equivalent to their remaining contractual term. 

The
warrants to purchase shares of Series B-3 Convertible Preferred Stock, par value per share (the 2024 Preferred Warrants ),
were also accounted for as liabilities, as they were redeemable in the event of a change in control, which was not solely within the
control of the Company (see Note 12. Stockholders Equity ). The 2024 Preferred Warrants were issued in the first quarter
of 2024 and exercised prior to the end of the second quarter of 2024. The fair value for the Level 3 2024 Preferred Warrants was estimated
utilizing a probability weighted average approach, which incorporated two scenarios. In scenario one, the warrant value was based on
the underlying value of the convertible preferred stock, using an option-pricing model backsolve that solved for the value of our publicly
traded equity on the valuation date to obtain the valuation date fair value of the Series B-3 Convertible Preferred Stock, then applied
the Series B-3 Convertible Preferred Stock value into the BSM model equation to determine the value of the Series B-3 convertible warrants.
In scenario two, the warrant value was based on the underlying value of the publicly traded common equity value. Scenario two assumes
the preferred stock will be converted into Common Stock prior to a liquidity event. A simple BSM model was utilized to value the warrant
under scenario two, using the closing price of our Common Stock as an input to the model. 

The
BSM model used the following range of inputs and assumptions for the 2024 Preferred Warrants at the issuance date of February 22, 2024,
for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and at the exercise date of May 13, 2024: (i) expected stock price volatility of to ;
(ii) risk-free interest rate of ; to ; (iii) expected life of the warrants of to years; and (iv) dividend yield
of .

asset for the anticipated replacement from the licensor to other assets, related party, as the recalled lots of Ameluz 
products were to be replaced by the Ameluz Licensor at no additional cost in accordance with the Ameluz License and Supply Agreement
(the Ameluz LSA ). As of July 23, 2024, we have received the full amount of the replacement inventory for the recalled Ameluz .

The
Xepi license intangible asset was recorded at acquisition-date fair value of million and was amortized on a straight-line
basis over the useful life of years. Amortization expense was million for each of the three-month periods ended September 30,
2024 and 2023 and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

During
the third quarter of 2024, the Company committed to a plan to sell its Xepi product line and determined that the intangible asset
meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale in accordance with ASC 360-10-45-9. The Company has entered into a letter
of intent and expects to complete the sale within the next six to twelve months and as such has classified the asset as held
for sale under current assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The carrying amount of the asset at the time of
classification was 
million, which was the lower of its carrying value or estimated fair value less cost to sell. No gain or loss was recognized in the
Statement of Operations upon classification as an asset held for sale and the related revenue and expenses associated with the asset
were de-minimus. This divestiture does not represent a strategic shift that will have a major effect on our consolidated results of
operations and therefore is not being reported as
discontinued operations. 

million of the Company s cash balances were in excess of FDIC limits. The Company has
not experienced any losses on these accounts and management does not believe that the Company is exposed to any significant risks with
respect to these accounts. 

Restricted

cash was recorded in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet.

As
a result of the termination of the Loan Agreement, the Company recognized a million loss related to prepayment fees and the write-off
of deferred financing costs, in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Loan
Facilities 

On
December 21, 2023, we entered into credit facilities with two different lenders (the Loans ), each pursuant to a
Business Loan and Security Agreement providing for a term loan in the principal amount of .
Each of the Loans was evidenced by a Secured Promissory Note, effective as of December 21, 2023 and required the Company to make
weekly payments of principal and interest in the amount of approximately 
through , the maturity date. There were approximately 
million related issuance costs, recognized as a debt discount (contra liability against the debt balance), that were amortized as
interest expense over the life of the loan using the effective interest method. The Company recognized minimal discount amortization
and interest expense during the three months ended September 30, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company
recognized discount amortization and interest expense of 
million and 
million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 the Company had repaid both Loans. 

Interest
expense was recognized using the effective interest method, such that a constant effective interest rate was applied to the carrying
amount of the debt at the beginning of each period until maturity.

Also,
in connection with the Second A R Ameluz LSA, the Company entered into a Release of Claims, with the Ameluz Licensor, dated February
13, 2024, pursuant to which the Company agreed to release the Ameluz Licensor from all claims and liabilities arising out of or relating
to any failure by the Ameluz Licensor to perform certain obligations under the Second A R Ameluz LSA with respect to clinical trials
for which the Company assumed responsibility under the Second A R Ameluz LSA.

shares of Common Stock and shares of preferred stock,
par value per share. 

On
February 19, 2024, the Company entered into the Preferred Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue and sell,
in a private placement (the Offering ), (i) shares of Series B-1 Convertible Preferred Stock, par value per

Preferred Stock, par value per share (the Series B-3 Preferred Stock for an aggregate offering price of million.
Each share of Series B-1 Preferred Stock was sold for per share and the consideration for each 2024 Preferred Warrant was

conversion price of Series B Preferred Stock is per share of Common Stock, such that each Series B share is convertible into
 shares of the Common Stock. The net proceeds received were approximately million, after deducting fees paid to the placement
agent and other offering expenses payable by the Company. 

On
February 22, 2024, concurrent with the closing of the Offering, in exchange for the conversion of shares of Series B-1 Preferred
Stock, the Company issued shares of common stock. Pursuant to the Certificate, upon the Company s stockholders 
May 2024 approval of an increase in the authorized shares of Common Stock Stockholder Approval ), the remaining shares
of Series B-1 Preferred Stock automatically converted into Series B-2 Preferred Stock (as a conversion to common stock would have caused
the holders to exceed their respective beneficial ownership limitations), with shares of common stock issuable upon conversion
of the Series B-2 Preferred Stock. Also, following the Stockholder Approval, upon any liquidation event, the assets of the Company available
for distribution to its stockholders will be distributed among the holders of the shares of Series B Preferred Stock and Common Stock,
pro rata, based on the number of shares held by each such holder, treating for this purpose, all shares of Series B Preferred Stock as
if they had been converted to Common Stock. With the removal of the liquidation preference to Series B Preferred, the requirement for
mezzanine classification was eliminated and the Series B Preferred Stock is classified as permanent equity as of September 30, 2024. Note 13. Redeemable Preferred Stock. 

On
May 13 and 14, 2024, of the 
2024 Preferred Warrants, 
were exercised to purchase shares of the Company s Series B-3 Convertible Preferred stock, par value 
per share, for net proceeds of 
million, net of fees paid to the placement agent, while two warrants expired due to non-issuance of fractional shares. All 2024
Preferred Warrants issued in the Offering have now been exercised or expired, with 
shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the 
shares of Series B-3 Convertible Preferred Stock. As of September 30, 2024 following the conversion of shares of Series B-2 Preferred Stock and shares of Series
B-3 Preferred Stock into Common Stock, there were shares of Series B Preferred issued and outstanding. 

Pursuant
to the Preferred Purchase Agreement, the Company is entitled to appoint two independent directors designated by Rosalind Advisors, Inc

combination or other similar recapitalization. Following the Stockholder Approval, each share of Series B-1 Preferred Stock was automatically
converted into either Common Stock or, to the extent the conversion would cause a holder to exceed its beneficial ownership limitation,
shares of Series B-2 Preferred Stock.

including a change of control transaction, or Deemed Liquidation Event, as defined in the Certificate of Designation (any such event,
a Liquidation ), the assets of the Company available for distribution to its stockholders shall be distributed among
the holders of the shares of Series B Preferred Stock and Common Stock, pro rata based on the number of shares held by each such holder,

Issuance
of Common Stock Pursuant to the Exercise of 2023 Pre-Funded Warrants and Conversion of Series B-1 Preferred Stock 

On
January 8, 2024 and February 2, 2024, an investor exercised and pre-funded warrants to purchase the Company s common
stock, par value per share (the Pre-Funded Warrants ), respectively, and purchased a total of shares of
common stock at an exercise price of per share, resulting in negligible net proceeds. 

years for stock options issued. On June 12, 2024, the stockholders of the Company approved an amendment to the
Biofrontera Inc. 2021 Omnibus Incentive Plan to increase the number of shares authorized for issuance by shares, from 
shares to shares. As of September 30, 2024, there were shares available for future awards under the amended 2021
Plan. 

Non-qualified
stock options 

We
maintain the 2021 Plan for the benefit of our officers, directors and employees. Employee stock options granted under the 2021 Plan generally
vest in equal annual installments over three years and are exercisable for a period of up to ten years from the grant date. Non-employee
director options vest in equal monthly installments following the date of grant and will be fully vested on the one-year anniversary
of the date of grant. All stock options are exercisable at a price as set by the Company at the time of the grant but shall not be less
than the market value of the common shares underlying the option on the grant date. 

The
Company recognizes the grant-date fair value of share-based awards granted as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the
requisite service period. The fair value of stock options is estimated at the time of grant using the BSM option pricing model, which
requires the use of inputs and assumptions such as the fair value of the underlying stock, exercise price of the option, expected term,
risk-free interest rate, expected volatility and dividend yield. The Company elects to account for forfeitures as they occur. 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company granted options. The fair value of each option was estimated
on the grant date of July 12, 2024 using the BSM option pricing model with the following assumptions: fair value of the underlying unit
of , expected volatility of , risk free rate of , term ranging from years to years, and a dividend yield of zero. 

Share-based
compensation expense for stock options for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately million and 
million, respectively, and was recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses, with a negligible amount recorded as research
and development on the accompanying consolidated statement of operations. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, share-based
compensation expense of million and million, respectively, was recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses.

Legal
proceedings 

At
each reporting date, the Company evaluates whether or not a potential loss amount or a potential range of loss is probable and reasonably
estimable under the provisions of FASB ASC Topic 450, Contingencies . The Company expenses as incurred the legal costs related
to such legal proceedings. 

Legal
Claims 

On
September 13, 2023, Biofrontera was served with a complaint filed by DUSA Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, Inc. Sun ), and Sun Pharmaceutical Industries LTD in which DUSA alleges i) breach of contract, ii) violation of the Lanham
Act, and iii) unfair trade practices under Massachusetts law. All claims stem from allegations that Biofrontera has promoted its Ameluz 
product in a manner that is inconsistent with its approved FDA labeling. Though this complaint was originally filed in the U.S.
District Court for the District of Massachusetts, this matter has been transferred by agreement of the parties to the U.S. District
Court for the District of New Jersey. In March of 2024, Biofrontera Company filed a partial motion to dismiss
the Lanham Act and Massachusetts statutory claims, which was denied on October 15, 2024. Biofrontera subsequently answered Sun s
complaint and filed counterclaims alleging i) violation of the Lanham Act, ii) deceptive trade practices under Georgia law, and iii) trade
libel/product disparagement. 

Separately,
on June 26, 2024 and June 27, 2024, Sun filed two complaints against Biofrontera, Biofrontera AG, Biofrontera Pharma, and
Biofrontera Bioscience with the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts and the International Trade
Commission, respectively, both alleging infringement of two patents held by Sun. The complaint filed in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts has been held in abeyance
pending the completion of the case before the International Trade Commission. 

Discovery
is ongoing in the above-referenced matters. The Company denies the claims brought by Sun and intends to defend them vigorously. Based on the Company s assessment of the facts underlying the above claims, the uncertainty of litigation and the
preliminary stage of the case, the Company cannot estimate the possibility of a material loss, nor the potential range of loss that
may result from either action. If the final resolution of the matter is adverse to the Company, it could have a material impact on
the Company s financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. 

shares of Series B Convertible Preferred were converted into shares of common stock. 

On
November 11, 2024, the Company entered into an amended and restated employment agreement with Hermann Luebbert, its Chief Executive Officer
and Chairman. The amended and restated agreement (a) requires that Mr. Luebbert deliver a waiver and release of claims in a form reasonably
acceptable to the Company prior to Mr. Luebbert receiving any severance payment; and (b) increases the amount of severance payment payable
to Mr. Luebbert if his employment is terminated within 3 months prior to or 12 months after a Change in Control (as defined
therein). 

The
foregoing description of the amended and restated employment agreements does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety

Overview 

We
are a U.S.-based biopharmaceutical company commercializing a portfolio of pharmaceutical products for the treatment of dermatological
conditions with a focus on photodynamic therapy PDT and topical antibiotics. The Company s licensed products are
used for the treatment of actinic keratoses AKs ), which are pre-cancerous skin lesions, as well as impetigo, a bacterial
skin infection. Our subsidiary, Discovery, was formed on February 9, 2022, as a German presence that manages our clinical trial work
and facilitates our relationship with Biofrontera Pharma and Biofrontera Bioscience (together, the Ameluz Licensor ),
both of which are related parties as they are wholly owned subsidiaries of Biofrontera AG. 

Our
principal licensed product is Ameluz , which is a prescription drug approved for use in combination with PDT (when
used together, Ameluz PDT using the BF-RhodoLED and the RhodoLED XL
lamps (the RhodoLED Lamps ). In the United States, the PDT treatment is used for the lesion-directed
and field-directed treatment of AKs of mild-to-moderate severity on the face and scalp. AKs are premalignant lesions of the skin
that can potentially develop into skin cancer (squamous cell carcinoma) if left untreated. International treatment guidelines list
PDT as the gold standard for treating AK, especially multiple AKs and the surrounding photodamaged skin. 1 We
are currently selling Ameluz for this indication in the U.S. under an exclusive license and supply agreement, the
Second Amended and Restated License and Supply Agreement, effective as of February 13, 2024 with the Ameluz Licensor (the
 Second A R Ameluz LSA ). 

Effective
June 1, 2024, we assumed control of all clinical trials relating to Ameluz in the United States, allowing for more effective
cost management and direct oversight of trial efficiency. Our research and development R D program is focused on
label expansion for Ameluz as well as supporting PDT growth by improving the capabilities of our RhodoLED 
Lamps to better fulfill the needs of dermatologists. Our goal is to improve the effectiveness of our commercial team by allowing sales
representatives to carry approved devices with them allowing for easier product demonstrations and evaluations. 

In
October 2024, the FDA approved the Company s Supplemental New Drug Application to increase the maximally approved dosage of Ameluz 
 from one to three tubes per treatment. This approval allows healthcare professionals greater flexibility in addressing larger or
multiple treatment areas for patients undergoing PDT for AK on the face and scalp, leading to greater convenience for both healthcare
providers and their patients. In combination with the RhodoLED XL Lamp, providers can now treat a patient s
face more efficiently. Additionally, the change to the label and the RhodoLED XL are both foundational to support trunk
and extremities which we expect to add to the label in the next couple years. 

Also, in October 2024, the Company received results
in its Phase III trial evaluating its drug-device therapy, Ameluz with the BF-RhodoLED lamp, as a treatment for
superficial basal cell carcinoma sBCC ). The primary endpoint was a composite of complete clinical and histological
clearance of one preselected main target BCC lesion per patient 12 weeks after the start of the last PDT cycle.
According to the phase III ALA-BCC-CT013 study, Ameluz -PDT achieved 65.5 success, compared to 4.8 success achieved with
placebo-PDT. Complete histological clearance was seen in 75.9 of these lesions in the Ameluz arm, compared to 19.0 with
placebo. Complete clinical clearance was achieved in 83.4 of patients treated with Ameluz compared to 21.4 with placebo. 

Effective
with the Second A R Ameluz LSA, the price we pay per unit, based on certain percentages of the anticipated net selling price, (the
 Transfer Price of Ameluz was reduced from 50 to 25 for all purchases through 2025. Starting on January
1, 2026, until 2032 there will be stepwise increases in the Transfer Price from 25 to 35 for sales related to AK and, if approved by
the Food and Drug Administration (the FDA ), basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. The Transfer Price for sales
related to acne, another indication currently in development, will remain at 25 indefinitely. The Transfer Price covers the cost of
goods, royalties on sales, and services including all regulatory efforts, agency fees, pharmacovigilance, and patent administration.
The reduced LSA Transfer Price will allow the Company to finance the R D activities assumed as of June 1, 2024, and continue our
commercial growth trajectory. 

Our
second prescription drug licensed product in our portfolio is Xepi (ozenoxacin cream, 1 ), a topical non-fluorinated
quinolone that inhibits bacterial growth. Currently, no antibiotic resistance against Xepi is known and it has been specifically
approved by the FDA for the treatment of impetigo, a common skin infection, due to Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes. It
is approved for use in the United States in adults and children 2 months and older. Our exclusive license and supply agreement, as amended Xepi LSA ), with Ferrer that we assumed on March 25, 2019 through our acquisition of Cutanea Life Sciences, Inc. Cutanea enables us to market and sell this product in the United States. The Company has generated limited revenue from sales of Xepi due to third-party manufacturing delays that have hampered
our commercialization of the product. Ferrer is now in the process of qualifying a new contract manufacturer. If the new contract manufacturer
is qualified, we believe that it will be able to supply enough of the Xepi product line to meet market demand for as
long as we maintain it. 

However,
in the third quarter of 2024, the Company reached the decision to divest its Xepi product line and determined that it met the held
for sale accounting criteria. The Company has entered into a letter of intent and expects to complete the sale within the next six
to twelve months. The related intangible asset is presented as held for sale under current assets in the Condensed Consolidated
Balance Sheets. See Note 7. Assets Held for Sale , for additional information.

Our
principal objective is to increase the sales of our licensed products in the United States. The key elements of our strategy include
the following: 

expanding
 our sales in the United States of Ameluz in combination with the RhodoLED Lamps for the treatment
 of minimally to moderately thick AKs of the face and scalp and positioning Ameluz to be the standard of care in the
 United States by growing our dedicated sales and marketing infrastructure in the United States; 

leveraging
 the potential for future approvals and label extensions of our portfolio products that are in the pipeline for the U.S. market through
 the license and supply agreements with our Licensors; and 

opportunistically
 adding complementary products or services to our portfolio by acquiring or licensing IP to further leverage our commercial infrastructure
 and customer relationships. 

We
devote a substantial portion of our cash resources to the commercialization of our licensed products, Ameluz and the
RhodoLED Lamps. We have financed our operating and capital expenditures through cash proceeds generated from our product
sales, our line of credit, short-term debt and proceeds received in equity financings. 

We
believe that important measures of our results of operations include product revenue, operating income (loss) and adjusted EBITDA (a
non-U.S GAAP measure as defined below). Our sole source of product revenue is sales of products that we license from certain related
and unrelated companies. Our long-term financial objectives include consistent revenue growth and expanding operating margins. Accordingly,
we are focused on licensed product sales expansion to drive revenue growth and improve operating efficiencies, including effective resource
utilization, information technology leverage, and overhead cost management. 

Key
factors affecting our performance 

As
a result of a number of factors, our historical results of operations may not be comparable to our results of operations in future periods,
and our results of operations may not be directly comparable from period to period. Set forth below is a brief discussion of the key
factors impacting our results of operations. 

Seasonality 

Because
traditional photodynamic therapy treatments using a lamp are performed more frequently during the winter, our revenue is subject to some
seasonality and has historically been higher during the first and fourth quarters than during the second and third quarters. 

Supply
Chain 

While
our Licensors take reasonable precautions to ensure the successful production of our commercially licensed products, their contract
manufacturers may experience a myriad of business difficulties (i.e., workforce instability, supply chain issues, erosion of
customer base, etc.) that could impact their financial solvency. We have historically experienced delays in delivery times of our
RhodoLED Lamps due to supply chain issues and there is a possibility that there may be additional supply chain
challenges, or our orders are fulfilled at a slower rate than expected. Despite these historic and possible future delays, we expect
total revenues will not be significantly impacted (i.e., we experience less growth than expected vs. declining sales) since the
majority of our revenues are from sales of Ameluz and we have RhodoLED Lamps on hand and on order.
We continue to monitor the impacts of the supply chain on our business and are focused on ensuring the stability of the supply
chains for Ameluz and RhodoLED Lamps.

Components
of Our Results of Operations 

Product
Revenue, net 

We
generate product revenues through the third-party sales of our licensed products Ameluz , RhodoLED Lamps
and to a much lesser extent Xepi covered by our exclusive license and supply agreements with our Licensors . Revenues
from product sales are recorded net of discounts, rebates and other incentives, including trade discounts and allowances, product returns,
government rebates, and other incentives such as patient co-pay assistance. Revenue from the sales of our RhodoLED Lamps
and Xepi are relatively insignificant compared with revenues generated through our sales of Ameluz . 

The
primary factors that determine our revenue derived from our licensed products are: 

the
 level of orders generated by our sales force; 

the
 level of prescriptions and institutional demand for our licensed products; and 

unit
 sales prices. 

Related
Party Revenues 

Prior
to June 1, 2024, the date on which we took over clinical trials, we generated insignificant related party revenue in connection with
an agreement with Biofrontera Bioscience to provide BF-RhodoLED lamps and associated services for the clinical trials
performed by Biofrontera Bioscience. In the future, we do not expect to receive related party revenue regarding lamps and associated
services for clinical trials. 

Cost
of Revenues, Related Party 

Cost
of revenues, related party, is comprised of purchase costs of our licensed products, Ameluz and RhodoLED Lamps
from Biofrontera Pharma and insignificant inventory adjustments due to scrapped, expiring and excess products. 

The
Transfer Price we paid for inventory purchased through February 12, 2024, was based on the Ameluz LSA as amended on October 8, 2021,
under which the price paid per unit was based upon our sales history. The purchase price we paid the Ameluz Licensor for Ameluz 
 was determined in the following manner: 

fifty
 percent of the anticipated net selling price per unit until we generate 30 million in revenue from sales of the products we license
 from the Ameluz Licensor during a given Commercial Year (as defined in the Ameluz LSA); 

forty
 percent of the anticipated net selling price per unit for all revenues we generate between 30 million and 50 million from sales
 of the products we license from the Ameluz Licensor; and 

thirty
 percent of the anticipated net selling price per unit for all revenues we generate above 50 million from sales of the products we
 license from the Ameluz Licensor. 

Effective
February 12, 2024, the Second A R Ameluz LSA, among other things, was amended to change the Transfer Price to 25 of the anticipated
net selling price per unit through 2025 and then increasing over time pursuant to the schedule set forth in the Second A R Ameluz
LSA to a maximum of 35 of the anticipated net selling price starting in 2032, subject to a minimum dollar amount per unit. We expect
to see an impact from the change in the transfer pricing under the Second A R Ameluz LSA in the fourth quarter as we receive
product under the new pricing. 

Cost
of Revenues, Other 

Cost
of revenues, other, is comprised of purchase costs of our licensed product, Xepi , third-party logistics and distribution
costs including packaging, freight, transportation, shipping and handling costs, and inventory adjustment due to expiring Xepi 
 products.

Selling,
General and Administrative Expense 

Selling,
general and administrative expenses consist principally of costs associated with our sales force, commercial support personnel, personnel
in executive and other administrative functions, and medical affairs professionals. Other selling, general and administrative expenses
include marketing, trade, and other commercial costs necessary to support the commercial operation of our licensed products and professional
fees for legal, consulting and accounting services. Selling, general and administrative expenses also include the amortization of our
intangible assets and our legal settlement expenses. 

Selling,
General and Administrative Expenses, Related Party 

Selling,
general and administrative expenses, related party, relate to the services provided by our significant stockholder, Biofrontera AG, primarily
for regulatory support and pharmacovigilance. These expenses are charged to us based on costs incurred plus 6 in accordance with the
Amended and Restated Master Contact Services Agreement entered into on December 2021 (the 2021 Services Agreement ). The
2021 Services Agreement enables us to continue relying on Biofrontera AG and its subsidiaries for various services it has historically
provided to us, including regulatory and pharmacovigilance support for as long as we deem necessary. We currently have statements of
work in place regarding regulatory affairs, medical affairs, pharmacovigilance, and investor relations services, and are continuously
assessing the other services historically provided to us by Biofrontera AG to determine (i) if they will be needed, and (ii) whether
they can or should be obtained from other third-party providers. 

Research
and Development 

Effective
June 1, 2024, we took control of all clinical trials for Ameluz in the Unites States, allowing for more effective cost
management and direct oversight of trial efficiency. Our R D expenses include costs directly attributable to the clinical development
of Ameluz , including personnel-related expenses, the cost of services provided by outside contractors, including services
related to the Company s clinical trials, facilities, depreciation, and other direct and allocated expenses. Along with our Ameluz 
 clinical trials, our R D program also aims to improve the capabilities of our RhodoLED Lamps to better fulfill
the needs of dermatologists and improve the effectiveness of our commercial team by letting sales representatives carry approved devices
with them, allowing for easier product demonstrations and evaluations. All costs associated with research and development are expensed
as incurred. 

Change
in Fair Value of Warrant Liabilities 

For
warrants that are classified as liabilities, the Company records the fair value of the warrants at each balance sheet date and records
changes in the estimated fair value as a non-cash gain or loss in the consolidated statements of operations until the warrants are exercised,
expire or other facts and circumstances lead the warrant liabilities to be reclassified to stockholders equity or deficit. 

Change
in Fair Value of Investment, Related Party 

Our
investments are comprised of equity securities in shares of Biofrontera AG, which are initially recorded at cost, plus transaction costs,
and subsequently measured at fair value, based on quoted market prices, with the gains and losses reported in the Company s consolidated
statement of operations. For the investments held in foreign currencies, the change in fair value attributable to changes in foreign
exchange rates is included in gains and losses in the consolidated statement of operations. 

Loss
on Debt Extinguishment 

On
May 8, 2023, the Company entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (the Loan Agreement with MidCap Business Credit LLC,
providing us with a revolving line of credit in the aggregate principal amount of up to 6.5 million. Effective as of January 4, 2024,
we voluntarily terminated the Loan Agreement and recognized a 0.3 million loss on debt extinguishment upon the early termination related
to prepayment fees and the write-off of deferred financing costs. 

Interest
Income (Expense), net 

Interest
expense, net, primarily consists of interest on our debt instruments, offset by immaterial amounts of interest income earned on our cash
balances at financial institutions and financing of customer purchases of BF-RhodoLED lamps. 

28 

Other
Income (Expense), net 

Other
income (expense), net primarily includes (i) gain (loss) on return of leased assets and (ii) gain (loss) on foreign currency transactions. 

Income
Taxes 

As
a result of the net losses we have incurred in each fiscal year since inception, we have recorded no provision for federal income taxes
during such periods. Income tax expense incurred relates to state income taxes.

Revenue, net 

Net
product revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 0.1 million, or 1.5 as compared to the three months ended
September 30, 2023. This increase was driven by 0.6 million increase from sales of devices, specifically RhodoLED XL
Lamp, since its launch in June 2024, offset by net decrease in sales of Ameluz of 0.5 million. The decrease of Ameluz sales in units
in the three months ended September 30, 2024 was impacted by the delayed shipment of about 4,600 units at the end of September 2024 due
to Hurricane Milton, which forced office closures and shipping delays through the Southeast. All shipments were delivered, and revenue for
these sales have been recognized in October 2024.

of Revenues, Related Party 

Cost
of revenues, related party for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 0.3 million, or 6.8 as compared to the three
months ended September 30, 2023. This was driven by an increase of 0.5 million due to the increase in RhodoLED XL product
revenue, partially offset by a decrease of 0.2 million, due to decrease in sales of Ameluz . We expect to see an impact
from the change in the transfer pricing under the Second A R Ameluz LSA in the fourth quarter as we are receiving product under the
new pricing. 

Selling,
General and Administrative Expenses 

Selling,
general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 0.2 million, or 2.3 as compared to the
three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by a 0.5 million decrease in general business administration
expenses, as well as a decrease of non-personnel sales and marketing expenses of 0.2 million, and a 0.3 million decrease in personnel
costs due to change in headcount and reduced severance, which was offset by a 0.8 million increase in legal expenses related to the
complaints filed by DUSA Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, Inc., and Sun Pharmaceutical Industries LTD (collectively
 SUN with the International Trade Commission ITC and the US District Court for the district of Massachusetts. 

Research
and Development Expenses 

R D
expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 0.6 million as compared to the three months ended September 30,
2023. The increase was attributable to our assumption of all clinical trial activities for Ameluz in the United States
effective June 1, 2024, allowing for more effective cost management and direct oversight of trial efficiency. This increase to R D
expenses should be offset by a reduction in the Transfer Price of Ameluz from 50 to 25 for all future purchases made
in 2024 and 2025. No such inventory purchases were made as of September 30, 2024. The following table summarizes our research and development

Change
in Fair Value of Warrant Liabilities 

The
change in fair value of warrant liabilities was 0.7) million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 0.6 million
for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The change in fair value of warrant liabilities was driven primarily by changes in the
quoted market price of the common stock. From June 30, 2024 to September 30, 2024, the underlying value of the Company s Common
Stock increased, leading to a corresponding increase in the value of warrant liabilities and additional expense recognized on the statements
of operations. From June 30, 2023 to September 30, 2023, the market price decreased, causing a decrease in the value of warrant liabilities,
and a gain in in the statement of operations. 

30 

Change
in Fair Value of Investment, Related Party 

As
of December 31, 2023, the Company had transferred substantially all of its investment in Biofrontera AG to Maruho in exchange for the
release of certain obligations, in accordance with the Settlement Agreement and Mutual Release (the Release ), dated December
27, 2023. As a result, during the third quarter of 2024, the net balance of our investment in Biofrontera AG was minimal as was the related
change in fair value.

product revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 1.3 million, or 5.6 as compared to the nine months ended

months ended September 30, 2024, as well as an increase in
device sales of 0.6 million due to the launch of the RhodoLED XL Lamp in June 2024. This was offset by a sales
volume decrease of approximately 0.5 million of Ameluz driven by the office closures and shipping delays associated
with Hurricane Milton. As mentioned above, these delayed shipments have been delivered and revenue recognized in the fourth

Selling,
general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 4.3 million, or 14.3 as compared to
the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by a 1.7 million decrease in legal costs due to the
settlement with Biofrontera AG in April 2023, a 1.3 million decrease of non-personnel sales and marketing expenses due to a lower
level of marketing activities in general, a 0.6 million decrease in general business administration, and a net
decrease of 0.6 million in personnel expenses, partially offset by costs relating to the complaints filed by SUN.

Change
in Fair Value of Warrant Liabilities 

The
change in fair value of warrant liabilities was 1.3 million for nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 2.0 million for
the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change in fair value of warrant liabilities was driven primarily by a decrease in the underlying
value of the Company s Common Stock paired with a higher population of warrants outstanding for the nine months ended September
30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Change
in Fair Value of Investment, Related Party 

As
of December 31, 2023, the Company had transferred substantially all of its investment in Biofrontera AG to Maruho in exchange for the
release of certain obligations, in accordance with the Release. As a result, during the third quarter of 2024, the net balance of our
investment in Biofrontera AG was minimal as was the related change in fair value. 

Loss
on Debt Extinguishment 

Effective
as of January 4, 2024, we voluntarily terminated the Loan Agreement with Midcap Business Credit LLC. The Company recognized a 0.3 million
loss on debt extinguishment upon the early termination of the Loan Agreement related to prepayment fees and the write-off of deferred
financing costs. 

32 

Interest
income (expense), net 

The
increase of interest expense of 1.7 million was driven by the interest and debt discount recognized on the loans issued on December
21, 2023, for an aggregate principal balance of 4.0 million. The loans required the Company to make weekly payments of principal and
interest in the amount of approximately 0.2 million through July 5, 2024, the maturity date. Interest expense was recognized using the
effective interest method, such that a constant effective interest rate was applied to the carrying amount of the debt at the beginning
of each period until maturity. 

Net
Loss to Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation for the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 

We
define adjusted EBITDA as net income or loss before interest income and expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, and other
non-operating items from our statements of operations as well as certain other items considered outside the normal course of our operations
specifically described below. Adjusted EBITDA is not a presentation made in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our definition of adjusted EBITDA
may vary from the use of similarly-titled measures by others in our industry due to the potential inconsistencies in the method of calculation
and differences due to items subject to interpretation. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income or loss,
operating income/(loss), cash flows from operating activities or any other performance measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP
as measures of operating performance or liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered
in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP. 

Loss
on debt extinguishment: Effective as of January 4, 2024, we voluntarily terminated the Loan Agreement and recognized a 0.3 million
loss on debt extinguishment upon the early termination of the loan. We exclude the impact of this loss as it is attributed to the prepayment
fee, which is considered non-recurring, and the write-off of deferred financing costs, which is considered non-cash. 

Change
in fair value of contingent consideration: Pursuant to a share purchase agreement with Maruho, the profits from the sale of Cutanea
products were to be shared equally between Maruho and Biofrontera until 2030. The fair value of the contingent consideration was determined
to be 6.5 million on the acquisition date and was re-measured at each reporting date. We exclude the historical impact of the change
in fair value of contingent consideration as this is non-cash. We were relieved of our obligations relating to the contingent consideration
under the Release. As such, our results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were not impacted by the
change in fair value. 

Change
in fair value of warrant liabilities: The warrants issued in conjunction with our private placement offerings and registered public
offerings are accounted for as liabilities in accordance with ASC 815-40. The warrant liabilities are measured at fair value at inception
and on a recurring basis, with changes in fair value presented within the consolidated statement of operations. We exclude the impact
of the change in fair value of warrant liabilities as this is non-cash. 

Change
in fair value of investment, related party: The Company accounts for its investment, related party in accordance with ASC 321, Investments
 Equity Securities . Equity securities, which are comprised of investments in common stock, are initially recorded at cost,
plus transaction costs, and subsequently measured at fair value, based on quoted market prices, with the gains and losses reported in
the Company s consolidated statement of operations. For the investments held in foreign currencies, the change in fair value attributable
to changes in foreign exchange rates is included in gains and losses in the consolidated statement of operations. We exclude the impact
of the realized gain as this is non-recurring and the unrealized change in fair value of investments is excluded as this is non-cash. 

Legal
settlement expenses : To measure operating performance, we exclude legal settlement expenses. We do not expect to incur these types
of legal expenses on a recurring basis and believe the exclusion of such amounts allows management and the users of the financial statements
to better understand our financial results. 

Stock-Based
Compensation : To measure operating performance, we exclude the impact of costs relating to share-based compensation. Due to the subjective
assumptions and the variety of award types, we believe that the exclusion of share-based compensation expense, which is non-cash, allows
for more meaningful comparisons of our operating results to peer companies. Share-based compensation expense can vary significantly based
on the timing, size and nature of awards granted. 

Expensed
issuance costs: To measure operating performance, we exclude the portion of issuance costs allocated to our warrant liabilities.
We do not expect to incur this type of expense on a recurring basis and believe the exclusion of these costs allows management and the
viewers of the financial statements to better understand our financial results. 

33 

Adjusted
EBITDA margin is adjusted EBITDA for a particular period expressed as a percentage of revenues for that period. 

We
use adjusted EBITDA to measure our performance from period to period and to compare our results to those of our competitors. In addition
to adjusted EBITDA being a significant measure of performance for management purposes, we also believe that this presentation provides
useful information to investors regarding financial and business trends related to our results of operations and that when non-U.S. GAAP
financial information is viewed with U.S. GAAP financial information, investors are provided with a more meaningful understanding of
our ongoing operating performance.

EBITDA 

Adjusted
EBITDA decreased from 3.9) million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 4.6) million for the three months ended September
30, 2024. The decrease was primarily driven by an increase in R D expenses of 0.6 million. 

Adjusted
EBITDA increased from 15.8) million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 13.9) million for the nine months ended September
30, 2024. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily driven by a decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses of 3.2
million, due primarily to a decreased level of marketing activities and savings in legal expenses. This is partially offset by an increase
in R D expense of 1.3 million. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Pursuant
to the requirements of the Financial Accounting Standards Board s Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 205-40,
Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, management must evaluate whether there are
conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going
concern for one year from the date the consolidated financial statements are issued. This evaluation does not take into consideration
the potential mitigating effect of management s plans that have not been fully implemented or are not within control of the Company
as of the date the financial statements are issued. When substantial doubt exists under this methodology, management evaluates whether
the mitigating effect of its plans sufficiently alleviates substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going
concern. The mitigating effect of management s plans, however, is only considered if both (1) it is probable that the plans will
be effectively implemented within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued, and (2) it is probable that the plans,
when implemented, will mitigate the relevant conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue
as a going concern within one year after the date that the consolidated financial statements are issued. 

Since
we commenced operations in 2015, we have generated significant losses. We incurred net cash outflows from operations of 9.3 million
and 16.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company had an accumulated deficit as of September
30, 2024 of 116.0 million. The Company s primary sources of liquidity are its cash collected from the sales of its products, and
cash flows from financing transactions. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 2.9 million, compared to 1.3
million as of December 31, 2023.

a result of our losses and projected cash needs, the Company s management has determined that substantial doubt exists about our
ability to continue as a going concern for at least twelve months from the issuance date of these financial statements. The Company s
ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon successful execution of management s intended plan over the next twelve
months to improve the Company s liquidity and profitability, which includes without limitation: 

Expanding
 the commercialization of Ameluz in the United States while decreasing discretionary
 expenses. 
 
 Actively
 pursuing additional capital through the issuance of equity securities, debt or the sale of
 assets. 
 
 Controlling
 expenses and limiting capital expenditures. 
 
 Realizing
 the benefit of the reduced cost of inventory in line with the terms of the Second A R
 Ameluz LSA. 

The company believes that the implementation of such plans will provide
the opportunity for the Company to continue as a going concern. However, no assurance can be given that the Company will be successful
in these efforts and will depend on several factors, including executing
on its sales plan and planned cost reductions within the time period needed, as well as other possible challenges and unforeseen circumstances.
A lack of execution or unforeseen circumstances may require the Company to raise additional capital or debt which may not be available
on acceptable terms, or at all, which could result in a material adverse effect on the Company, as well as its business, financial condition,
results of operations, growth prospects and financial statements. 

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction
of liabilities in the ordinary course of business. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability
and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from the outcome of the
uncertainties described above.

Accounting
Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates 

Our
management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements,
which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation
of the financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires the use of estimates and assumptions by management that affect the
value of assets and liabilities, as well as contingent assets and liabilities, as reported on the balance sheet date, and revenues and
expenses arising during the reporting period. The main areas in which assumptions, estimates and the exercising of a degree of judgment
are appropriate relate to contingent consideration, fair value measurements, valuation of intangible assets and impairment assessment,
and stock compensation. Estimates are based on historical experience and other assumptions that are considered appropriate in the circumstances.
They are continuously reviewed but may vary from the actual values. 

Our
significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , to
our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in our Form 10-K. 

Critical
Accounting Estimates 

A
summary of our critical accounting estimates is discussed in the section entitled Critical Accounting Estimates in Item
7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Form 10-K. There were no material
changes to our critical accounting estimates for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, except for the following: 

The
warrants for convertible preferred stock issued in conjunction with our private placement offering conducted pursuant to the securities
purchase agreements entered into on February 19, 2024 with institutional investors were accounted for as liabilities in accordance with
ASC 815-40 and are presented within warrant liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. The warrant liabilities are measured
at fair value at inception and on a recurring basis, with changes in fair value presented within the consolidated statement of operations.
Due to the uncertainty of the how the convertible preferred warrants would ultimately settle, the Company used a probability-weighted
approach along with a Black-Scholes-Merton BSM model equation to estimate the fair value of the preferred warrants under
different scenarios. While we believe these assumptions were reasonable, the manner or timeframe in which the warrants ultimately settle
may differ. The BSM model also considers several variables and assumptions in estimating the fair value of financial instruments, including
the per-share fair value of the underlying common stock, exercise price, expected term, risk-free interest rate, expected stock price
volatility over the expected term, and expected annual dividend yield. Certain inputs utilized in our BSM pricing model may fluctuate
in future periods based upon factors which are outside of the Company s control. A significant change in one or more of these inputs
used in the calculation of the fair value may have caused a significant change to the fair value of our warrant liability which could
also have resulted in material non-cash gain or loss being reported in our consolidated statement of operations. 

Off-balance
Sheet Arrangements 

Other
than those items reflected in Note 17. Commitments and Contingencies we did not have during the periods presented, and we do not
currently have, any other off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in the rules and regulations of the SEC. 

Emerging
Growth Company Status 

The
Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 permits an emerging growth company such as us to take advantage of an extended
transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies until those standards would otherwise
apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of such extended transition period, which means that when an accounting
standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we will adopt the new or revised
standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard and will do so until such time that we either (i) irrevocably
elect to opt out of such extended transition period or (ii) no longer qualify as an emerging growth company. 

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

As
a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide the information required by this Item. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our
management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated, as of the end of the period
covered by this Form 10-Q, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act )). Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance
level. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the most recent fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 that
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule
13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act).

PART
II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item
1. Legal Proceedings 

For
information regarding legal proceedings in which we are involved, (see Note 17. Commitments and Contingencies under the subsection
titled Legal Proceedings in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q). 

Item
1A. Risk Factors 

As
a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide disclosure pursuant to this item in this Form 10-Q. However, as of the date
of this Quarterly Report, other than as set forth below, there have been no material changes with respect to those risk factors previously
disclosed under Risk Factors included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, as
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 15, 2024 (the Form 10-K ). The following should be carefully
considered, together with other information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our Form 10-K, and our other filings with the SEC
before making investment decisions regarding our common stock. 

There is substantial doubt about our ability
to continue as a going concern. 

In connection with our assessment
of going concern considerations under applicable accounting standards, the Company s management has determined that substantial
doubt exists about our ability to continue as a going concern through approximately one year from the date the unaudited condensed financial
statements included in Item 1. Financial Statements were issued. The future viability of the Company is dependent on its
ability to continue to execute its growth plan and raise additional capital or find alternative methods of financing to fund its operations.
There can be no guarantee that the actions presently being taken by the Company will be successful in raising additional capital or finding
alternative methods of financing. If the Company is not successful in these endeavors, it would likely have a material adverse effect
on the Company s business, results of operations and financial condition. 

For additional discussion of the risks and uncertainties that affect our
business, see Item 1A. Risk Factors included in our Form 10-K.

Further,

During
his period of employment hereunder, the Executive shall further be entitled to (a)leave by reason of physical or mental disability or
incapacity, (b) participation in medical and life insurance, pension, disability and other fringe benefit plans as the Company may make

and reasonable expenses necessarily incurred by his in the performance of his obligations hereunder, subject to such reasonable substantiation
requirements as may be imposed by the Company to all employees of the Company, unless otherwise agreed to by the Board of Directors. 

6. CONFIDENTIAL
 INFORMATION AND PROPRIETARY INTERESTS 

Executive
acknowledges that he has received and will continue to receive Company s Confidential Information. Executive recognizes that all
such Confidential Information is and shall remain the sole property of the Company, free of any rights of Executive, and acknowledges
that the Company has a vested interest in assuring that all such Confidential Information remains secret and confidential. Therefore,
Executive agrees that during or after the expiration of his term of employment with the Company, the Executive shall not communicate
or divulge to, or use for the benefit of, any individual, association, partnership, trust, corporation or other entity except the Company,
any Confidential Information received by the Executive by virtue of his employment, without first being in receipt of the Company s
written consent to do so. 

For
the purposes of this Agreement, the term Confidential Information means: 

a. All
 information developed or used by the Company or its associates relating to business operations,
 including but not limited to customer lists, purchase orders, supplier or distributor information,
 financial data, pricing information and price lists, business plans, marketing strategies,
 personnel records, and all books, records, manuals, advertising materials, catalogues, correspondences,
 mailing lists, production data, and purchasing materials; and 

b. All
 proprietary information of the company (or any records related to the same), including but
 not limited to all trade secrets, inventions, processes, procedures, research records, market
 surveys or marketing know-how, trademarks, copyrights, patents, and patent applications. 

The
term Confidential Information shall not include information that is or becomes generally known to the public other than
as a result of a disclosure by Executive in violation of this Agreement, or by any other employee of the Company subject to confidentiality
obligations. 

3 

7. NON-COMPETITION/NON-SOLICITATION 

During
the term of his employment hereunder and for the one (1) year period following the termination hereof for any reason other than (a) the
Company s discontinuance of activities; or (b) an adjudication of the Company s material breach of any of its obligations
set forth in Sections 1, 2,4, and 5 inclusive, the Restricted Period the Executive shall not, without prior written consent
by the Board of Directors of the Company, directly or indirectly, engage in or become an owner of, render any service to, enter the employment
of, or represent or solicit for any business which competes with any activity of the Company conducted at any time during the Executive s
period of employment and which is located in the United States. The parties expressly agree that the duration and geographical area of
the restrictive covenant are reasonable. 

The
covenant shall be construed as an agreement independent of any other provision herein; and the existence of any claim or cause of action
of the Executive against the Company regardless of how arising, shall not constitute a defense to the enforcement by the Company or its
terms. If any portion of the covenant is held by a court to be unenforceable with respect either to its duration or geographical area,
for whatever reason, it shall be considered divisible both as to time and geographical area, resulting in an intended requirement that
the longest lesser period of time or largest lesser geographical area found by such court to be a reasonable restriction shall remain
an effective restrictive covenant, specifically enforceable against the Executive. 

Notwithstanding
any statement contained in this Section to the contrary, legal or beneficial ownership by the Executive of a less than five percent (5 interest in a competitive corporation the stock of which is publicly traded on a stock exchange or by means of an electronic dealer quotation
system, shall not of itself be deemed to constitute a breach by the Executive of the terms hereof. 

Additionally,
during the Executive s employment with the Company and thereafter during the Restricted Period, the Executive shall not, and shall
not permit any third party subject to Executive s direction or control to, directly or indirectly, (i) call upon, accept business
from, or solicit the business of any Person who is, or who had been at any time during the preceding twelve months, a customer of the
Company, (ii) otherwise divert or attempt to divert any business from the Company, (iii) interfere with the business relationships between
the Company and any of its customers, suppliers or others with whom they have business relationships or (iv) recruit or otherwise solicit
or induce, or enter into or participate in any plan or arrangement to cause, any Person who is an employee of, or otherwise performing
services for, the Company to terminate his employment or other relationship with the Company, or hire any Person who has left the employ
of or ceased providing services to the Company during the Restricted Period. 

8. REMEDIES
 FOR BREACH OF EXECUTIVE OBLIGATIONS 

The
parties to the agreement agree that the services of the Executive are of a personal, specific, unique and extraordinary character and
cannot be readily replaced by the Company. They further agree that in the course of performing his services, the Executive will have
access to various types of proprietary information of the Company, which, if released to others or used by the Executive other than for
the benefit of the Company, in either case without the Company s written consent, could cause the Company to suffer irreparable
injury. Therefore, the obligation of the Executive established under Section 6 and Section 7 hereof shall be enforceable both at law
and in equity, by injunction, specific performance, damages or other remedy; and the right of the Company to obtain any such remedy shall
be cumulative and not alternative and shall not be exhausted by any one or more uses thereof. Any adjudication against Executive by the
Company shall be in accordance with the laws of Massachusetts and Massachusetts employee rights. 

4 

9. MODIFICATION
 AND TERMINATION

 the parties, and in its present form consists of the entire Agreement between and amongst
 the parties.

 notice to the other party. The Agreement may be terminated by the Company upon the occurrence
 of any one of the following events: (a) the death of the Executive; (b) the occurrence to
 Executive of a physical or mental disability which, in the judgment (reasonably exercised)

 immediately following the occurrence of such disability); or (c) a determination by the Board
 of Directors that there is Cause (as described in section d below) to terminate
 Executive s employment. 

c. By
 Death or Disability. In the event of the Executive s death, his base compensation
 otherwise due for the succeeding period of time but no less than three (3) full calendar
 months following his death shall be paid to his designated beneficiary, or to his estate
 if no beneficiary has been designated. In the event of his disability the Executive shall
 be paid his compensation for the succeeding period of time but no less than three (3) months.
 Thereafter for the succeeding three (3) months shall be treated as being on an authorized
 unpaid leave of absence. 

d. For
 Cause. For purposes of the Agreement, the term Cause shall include,
 but not be limited to (i) the Executive s willful misconduct or gross negligence; (ii)
 his conscious disregard of his obligations hereunder or of any other duties reasonably assigned
 to him by the Board of Directors; (iii) his repeated conscious violation of any provision
 of the law, the Company s By-Laws or of its other stated policies, standards, practices,
 regulations or procedures; (iv) his commission of any act involving moral turpitude; (v)

5 

e. Continued
 Effectiveness of Certain Obligations. No termination or expiration of the Agreement,
 whether consummated by action of either party or by operation of the terms hereof, shall
 relieve the Executive from his continued performance of the obligations established under
 Sections 6 and 7 hereof. 

f. Resignation
 as an Officer or Director. Immediately upon any termination of Executive s
 employment for any reason, Executive shall be deemed to have resigned any position he may
 then hold as an officer of the Company and/or as a fiduciary of any Company benefit plan. 

10. Change
 of Control 

If
Executive s termination of employment occurs within 3 months prior to or 12 months after a Change in Control as defined
in this Section and such termination is by the Company without Cause, Executive would be entitled to receive, in lieu of
the severance amount described in Section 4 but subject to the same requirement concerning Executive s execution and delivery of
a Release, a severance amount equal to twenty-four full months of Executive s standard compensation, which consists of (i) Executive s
then-current base salary, and (ii) Executive s target annual bonus (using the target annual bonus for the then-current fiscal year
as the basis for this calculation). In addition, subject to the Executive s copayment of premium amounts at the active employees 
rate, the Executive may continue to participate in the Company s group health, dental and vision program for 12 months; provided,
however, that the continuation of health benefits under this Section shall reduce and count against the Executive s rights under
COBRA. 

For
the purpose of this Agreement, a Change in Control shall mean the occurrence of any of the following events: 

a. The
 approval by stockholders of the Company of: 

1. Any
 consolidation or merger of the Company in which the company is not the continuing or surviving
 corporation, or 

2. A
 sale, lease, exchange or other transfer (in one transaction or a series of related transactions)
 of all or substantially all the assets of the Company to a party which is not controlled

 group, corporation or other entity (a Person is the beneficial owner, directly
 or indirectly, of 50 or more of the outstanding stock of the Company, or 

2. The
 actual knowledge by the Company of facts, on the basis of which any person is required to
 file such a report on schedule 13D, or an amendment to such a report, with the SEC (or would
 be required to file such a report or amendment upon the lapse of the applicable period of
 time specified in Section 13(d) of the 1934 Act) disclosing that such a person is the beneficial
 owner, directly or indirectly, of 50 or more of the outstanding stock of the Company; 

6 

c. The
 purchase by any person (as defined in Section 13(d) of the 1934 Act), corporation or other
 entity, other than the Company or a wholly owned subsidiary or the parent company of the
 Company, of shares pursuant to a tender or exchange offer, to acquire any stock of the Company
 (or securities convertible into stock) for cash, securities or any other consideration provided
 that, after consummation of the offer, such person, group, corporation or other entity is
 the beneficial owner (as defined in rule 13d-3 under the 1934 Act), directly or indirectly,
 of 50 or more of the outstanding stock of the Company (calculated as provided in paragraph

d. The
 combination or merger of the Company with another company in which the Company is the surviving
 corporation but, immediately after the combination, the shareholders of the Company immediately
 prior to the combination do not hold, directly or indirectly, more than 50 of the voting

 such shareholders, but not from the voting stock of the combined company, any shares received

 other company in exchange for stock of such other company). 

11. INDEBTEDNESS
