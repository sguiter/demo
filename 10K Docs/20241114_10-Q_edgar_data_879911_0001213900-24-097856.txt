Guarantees 

The company agrees to indemnify
its officers and directors for certain events or occurrences arising as a result of the officers or directors serving in such capacity.
The maximum amount of future payments that the company could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited.
However, the company maintains a director s and officer s liability insurance policy that limits its exposure and enables
it to recover a portion of any future amounts paid. As a result, it believes the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements
is minimal because of its insurance coverage, and it has not recognized any liabilities for these agreements as of September 30, 2024

The motion was partially granted as to the separate claim for violation of NYRPC 1.7 and 1.8 because the court found that it was duplicative
of the malpractice claim. The parties completed discovery, and the court has approved a summary judgment briefing schedule proposed by
the parties. The parties have each filed their motions for summary judgment. No trial date has been set. 

On July 26, 2023, the company
filed a complaint in the Superior Court of the State of Delaware against Gusrae Kaplan Nusbaum PLLC and Ryan Whalen, for malicious prosecution
of a federal securities fraud lawsuit which was filed by these defendants against the company and certain of its directors, attorneys
and their law firms and an outside consultant, in July 2019 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.
The complaint filed by the company alleges that the claims by these defendants against it were frivolous and prosecuted for the improper
purpose of hindering the company s prosecution of a then pending case against George Farley, the company s former CEO, which
was later settled. The complaint further alleges that the defendants prosecuted their claim with malice causing the company damages valued
in excess of million. On September 11, 2023, Gusrae, Kaplan Nusbaum and Mr. Whalen filed a motion to dismiss the complaint.
On October 25, 2023, the company filed an opposition to the motion. The court heard oral argument on the motion on January 19, 2024, and
took the motion under submission. On April 16, 2024, the court granted the motion on the grounds of lack of personal jurisdiction over
the defendants. The company filed a Notice of Appeal with the Supreme Court of the State of Delaware on May 2, 2024. The company filed
its Opening Brief on July 17, 2024. On October 8, 2024, the Clerk of the Delaware Supreme Court notified the parties that the court would
hear oral arguments in the case on December 4, 2024, and that the hearing would be en banc or in front of
the entire court, rather than a panel. 

As with any litigation, the
company cannot predict the outcome with certainty, but the company expects to provide further updates on the status of the litigation
as circumstances warrant. 

The company may, from time
to time, be involved in legal proceedings arising from the normal course of business. 

Related Party 

In January 2023, the company
made a tax-deductible donation to Silicon Valley Defense Group (SVDG), a 501(c)(3) organization of which Christopher Donaghey,
our Chief Financial and Operating Officer, is a founder and member of the Board of Directors. As its objective, SVDG seeks to align
and connect the people, capital, and ideas that will ensure allied democracies retain a durable techno-security advantage. 

shares of common stock upon exercise of warrants at an exercise price of per

Applied Energetics, Inc.,
(sometimes referred to as the company is a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware.
Our executive office is located at 9070 S. Rita Road, Suite 1500, Tucson, Arizona 85747, (520) 628-7415. www. appliedenergetics.com 

Applied Energetics, Inc.,
specializes in the development and manufacture of advanced high-performance lasers and optical systems and integrated guided energy systems
for prospective defense, national security, industrial, biomedical, and scientific customers worldwide. 

Technology, Capabilities, and Patents 

Applied Energetics, Inc. is
recognized as a global leader in developing the next generation optical sources exhibiting ever-increasing output energy, peak power and
frequency agility while also providing decreased size, weight, and cost of these systems for customers. Applied Energetics utilizes patented,
dual-use technologies to advance critical industries. Leveraging our proprietary fiber-based architecture and wavelength- and pulse-agility
capability, our Ultrashort Pulse (USP) technology can enable users to achieve specific effects across different use cases with an unmatched
blend of size, weight, and power attributes. While initially designed to meet the emerging needs and priorities for the national security
community, our directed energy technology also has commercial applications in both the biomedical and advanced manufacturing industries. 

The Applied Energetics scientific
team is continuously innovating with an eye toward expanding our patent portfolio to cover these technological breakthroughs and further
enhance our suite of solutions for threat disruption for the Department of Defense, the intelligence community, and for commercial, biomedical
and space applications with optical sources operating from the deep ultraviolet to the far infrared portions of the electromagnetic spectrum. 

16 

Applied Energetics has developed,
successfully demonstrated and holds all crucial intellectual property rights to a dynamic directed energy technology called Laser Guided
Energy (LGE and Laser Induced Plasma Channel (LIPC ). LGE and LIPC are technologies that can be used in a new generation of
high-tech directed energy systems. Applied Energetics LGE and LIPC technologies are wholly owned by Applied Energetics and protected
by one or more of Applied Energetics 25 issued patents and 11 Government Sensitive Patent Applications (GSPA). These GSPA s
are held under secrecy orders of the US government, providing the company with extended protection rights. 

The company also has nine
pending patent applications. We continue to file patent applications as we deem appropriate to protect our intellectual property and enhance
our competitive advantage. 

Applied Energetics 
directed energy technologies are vastly different from conventional directed energy systems, i.e. Applied Energetics proprietary
fiber-based architecture is a key differentiator for our most recent technology demonstrators. Compared with traditional continuous wave
laser technologies with their larger footprints, AE s architecture enables orders of magnitude size-weight-power reductions on all
deliverables, creating powerful, dual-use and agile systems that can fit a host of platforms while delivering very high-intensity, ultrashort
pulses of light to the required target. This unique directed energy solution allows extremely high peak power and energy, with target
and effects tunability, and is effective against a wide variety of potential targets. 

Applied Energetics 
unique optical fiber-based laser architectures also enable unmatched wavelength agility as well as pulse duration agility. Using innovative
and highly specialized frequency shifting techniques, wavelengths can be custom tuned from the deep ultraviolet to the far infrared. In
addition, temporal outputs can be adjusted from continuous wave to sub-picoseconds. The technology enables the customer to adjust the
lasers operating parameters, ultimately creating more flexibility to change wavelength and pulse width. This feature allows for
optimization of laser performance for defense or commercial applications. 

Our proprietary USP laser
technology provides a significantly more compact solution than current continuous wave laser platforms while still delivering high peak
power. Continuous wave laser systems are typically used to heat a target and, during continuous illumination, this heat transfer leads
to melting or charring of the material. Using continuous wave output powers that now exceed 100 kilowatts (1kW = 1000 watts), it can take
anywhere from seconds to minutes to impact a target. By contrast, Applied Energetics has delivered USP lasers to national security users
that exceed five terawatts (1 TW = 1 trillion watts) in peak power, with the difference being that this peak power from a USP laser is
delivered in a pulse that is less than a trillionth of a second. During this short pulse duration, and having such a high peak intensity,
near-instantaneous ablation of the surface of the threat takes place. The net results of our innovative USP approaches are highly effective
lasers with mountable footprints that require only a fraction of the size and weight of other-directed energy technologies. 

As Applied Energetics looks
toward the future, our corporate strategic roadmap builds upon the significant value of the company s USP laser capabilities and
key intellectual property, including LGE and LIPC, to offer our prospective partners, co-developers and system integrators a variety of
next-generation ultrashort pulse and frequency-agile optical sources, from the ultraviolet to the far infrared portion of the electromagnetic
spectrum, to address numerous challenges within the national security, biomedical, and advanced manufacturing market sectors. 

Recent Developments 

Effective
October 28, 2024, Applied Energetics entered into a Memorandum of Understand (MOU) with a U.S.-based directed energy systems integrator
to further the development and deployment of Applied Energetics ultrashort pulsed laser (USPL) technology for defense and national
security applications. The MOU outlines key areas of cooperation, including joint research and development, integration of Applied Energetics 
USPL technologies into an existing high-energy laser directed energy platform, and the exploration of new opportunities to enhance both
companies product portfolios. The MOU sets out the framework for the collaboration, however, it is not a definitive agreement
with commercial terms and timelines. The company intends to provide additional information upon approval of the systems integrator counterparty. 

On July 3, 2024, Applied Energetics,
Inc. exercised its option to lease more than 5,000 square feet of additional space at the University of Arizona Tech Park to support the
company s investment in a new Battle Lab and laser manufacturing capacity to ensure it has the critical infrastructure in place
to fulfill both current and possible future priority U.S. military programs. With this expansion, the Company will occupy, in the aggregate,
approximately 26,000 sq. ft. of space at the Arizona Tech Park. The company took the option to lease this additional space under the June
7, 2023, amendment (the 2023 Amendment to its Lease Agreement with Campus Research Corporation, as Landlord. 

17 

The new space is a high bay,
light industrial facility that is expected to host Applied Energetics Battle Lab to support laser system testing against relevant
targets and emerging threats. The Battle Lab is expected to enable technology maturation and be the venue for customer and partner demonstrations
under realistic and controlled conditions. The facility, as planned, will also provide the capability to manufacture, integrate, and test
advanced lasers as Applied Energetics makes its anticipated transition of its technology to the next stage of its lifecycle. 

During July 2024, the company s
Board of Directors, in consultation with counsel, embarked on a comprehensive review and revision to the company s By-laws resulting,
on July 17, 2024, in the board s adoption of the company s First Amended and Restated By-laws. The amended By-laws update
several provisions to reflect the company s current business, operations and conduct of its corporate affairs as well as changes
in Delaware law, including, without limitation conduct of stockholder meetings, titles and functions of officers, board classification,
indemnification, and conduct of remote stockholder meetings. A few revisions are ministerial such as that pertaining to the company s
address of record in the State of Delaware. 

Effective March 12, 2024, the grant previously awarded to Applied Energetics,
Inc. from a U.S. Department of Defense customer has been transitioned into a contract. The original grant had a two-year period of performance.

Ongoing Business Development Activities 

Over the past few years, we
have submitted multiple proposals to, and attended briefings with, various defense and other government agencies who have expressed an
interest in our technology and applications. We believe that our efforts in this area of development have begun to produce results. In
addition to the contracts which we have been awarded, our team has been invited to, and completed, multiple briefings focused on our capabilities
and submissions. We intend to continue developing and submitting proposals and to be available to attend on-site briefings. We have also
engaged in discussions with private entities and academic institutions with the objective of possibly collaborating on one or more projects.
Some of these could result in further customer agreements or other opportunities to grow our business. 

Applied Energetics was a founding
consortium member of the Tech Hub proposal submitted under the title of Tulsa Hub for Equitable and Trustworthy Autonomy (THETA). On October
23, 2023, President Biden announced the designation of the inaugural 31 Tech Hubs and the THETA program was one of the 31entities selected
as part of the historic 500 million investment in economic competitiveness and national security. The proposal submitted specifies that
THETA will emphasize the development of UAS and counter-UAS (CUAS), artificial intelligence (AI), and cybersecurity technologies. On July
2, 2024, the Biden-Harris administration and the US EDA announced the award of approximately 51 million to the THETA consortium. Applied
Energetics is looking forward to contributing to the CUAS portion of the THETA program. 

For fiscal year 2025, which
started on October 1, 2024, the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) was delayed and has not yet been approved. The NDAA sets defense
spending policies, and the appropriations bills fund government spending. This impacts all proposals under review by the Department of
Defense. On September 26, 2024, President Biden signed a Continuing Resolution (CR), HR 9747, which extended the government operations
through December 20, 2024. No new start programs can be approved for funding until the Defense Appropriations Bill is passed for FY25. 

Strategic Plan and Analysis 

The core of our strategy has
been to continue growing our management and science teams with highly qualified individuals. This has driven our recruitment efforts in
the areas of R D, science, modeling and simulation, marketing and finance. We are also contemplating adding members to our Board of
Directors and our Board of Advisors. Our board and leadership team have worked to align key innovations with our roadmap to encourage
and enable internal filing for a broad, strategic, and robust intellectual property portfolio and continue surveying the literature for
acquisitions of parallel intellectual property to that end. We also intend to pursue strategic corporate acquisitions in related fields
and technology. The company s management continues to explore any favorable equity financing opportunities. 

Our goal with the Applied
Energetics Strategic Plan is to increase the energy, peak power and frequency agility of USP optical sources while decreasing the size,
weight, and cost of these systems. We are in the process of developing this breadth of very high peak power USP lasers and additional
optical sources that have a very broad range of applicability for threat disruption for the Department of Defense, commercial, and biomedical
applications, such as biophotonic illumination and imaging. Although the historical market for Applied Energetics LGE and USP technology
is the U.S. Government, the USP technologies are expected to provide numerous platforms for commercial additive and subtractive manufacturing
and biomedical and imaging markets, creating a substantially larger market for our products to address. Since 2020, the Applied Energetics
team has been able to develop partnership and teaming arrangements with the three leading laser and optics institutes in the United States,
namely, the University of Arizona, the University of Central Florida, and the University of Rochester Laboratory for Laser Energetics.
Our desire is to work on programs jointly where the strengths of each organization can assist in escalating knowledge and delivery of
systems to the government sponsors and to train the next generation of scientists and engineers to work in the directed energy fields. 

19 

We have continued to execute
our business development plans, further our research and development program and submit filings for intellectual property and proposals
for grants and contracts. During the past several years, we continued to submit proposals and have been engaged in meetings on a continuous
basis with various agencies and departments both remotely and in person in Washington, DC and at various other government facilities.
Having received a significant research grant and several contracts during the past two fiscal years, we believe the interest in our technology
and applications remains high, and we continue to submit proposals for all appropriate opportunities and share our vision of the disruptive
capabilities of USP optical sources for both near- and far-term threats and dual-use commercial applications. 

Through our analysis of the
market, and in discussions with potential customers, we remain convinced that customers are becoming more receptive and interested in
directed energy technologies. According to the US Department of Defense fiscal budgets from 2017 through 2023, its directed energy spending
grew from approximately 500 million in 2017 to over 1.695 billion in 2023, an increase of nearly 240 . Market analysis and projections
have estimated that this directed energy sector is anticipated to reach 17.8billion globally by 2028. We continue to be optimistic about
our future and the growing opportunities in directed energy applications, especially since this growth to nearly 1.7 B annually is being
accomplished without a recognized Program of Record (POR) for directed energy platforms. We believe that once these technologies are funded
in production for a POR or are approved to be integrated on fielded platforms in volumes to effect threat reduction, these DOD budgets
for directed energy will grow exponentially larger to support the technology insertion. The Applied Energetics team anticipates a continuation
of strong funding for the directed energy community. With our existing patent portfolio, and through further advancements of our technologies,
we believe we have the substantial building blocks needed to become a significant and successful developer in the USP marketplace. 

Our research and development
programs depend on our ability to procure the necessary optical and fabricated materials, components, electronics and other supplies.
A significant, prolonged increase in inflation could negatively impact on the cost of materials and components, which could be a particular
problem with respect to our fixed fee contracts. Within the current geopolitical context, there are ongoing embargos of exports from some
global suppliers of various materials that are used in electronics and some diode and laser materials, which can have negative effects
on technology supply chains. We continuously monitor potential supply chain issues and supplier liquidity and work with our supply base
to ensure adequate sources of materials at reasonable costs. In some instances, we depend upon a single source of supply, but we are developing
multiple sources, both internal to AE and externally where possible to mitigate the risk. In some cases, we must comply with specific
procurement requirements, which can limit the suppliers and subcontractors we may utilize.

cash flows from operations of approximately 3,734,000 and may incur additional future losses due to the possible reduction in government
contract activity and the expenses discussed under Results of Operations. In their report accompanying our financial statements for the
year ended December 31, 2023, our independent auditors stated that our financial statements were prepared assuming that we would continue
as a going concern and that they have substantial doubt as to our ability to do so for one year from the date the financial statements
are issued based on our recurring losses from operations and need to raise additional capital. The financial statements do not include
any adjustments relating to the recoverability of assets and the amount or classification of liabilities that might be necessary should
the company be unable to continue as a going concern.

At September 30, 2024, the company had total current assets of 2,025,823
and total current liabilities of 888,684 resulting in a working capital surplus of 1,137,139. At September 30, 2024, we had 1,608,241
of cash and cash equivalents, an increase of 288,715 from 1,319,526 at December 31, 2023. 

During the first nine months of 2024, the net cash outflow from operating
activities was 3,734,000. This amount was comprised primarily of our net loss of 7,047,014 offset by non-cash stock-based compensation
expense of 2,855,676, depreciation and amortization of 161,167, amortization of ROU assets of 152,192 and amortization of prepaid assets
of 167,035, and cash used from changes in assets and liabilities of 23,056) from the increase in accounts receivable of 377,349 and
accrued expenses and compensation of 33,855 offset by the net decrease in prepaids and deposits of 56,534 operating lease liabilities
of 127,428, deferred revenue of 288,690 and an increase in accounts payable of 38,392. 

During the first nine months
of 2024, the net cash outflow from investing activities was 55,435. This was for the purchase of equipment. 

During the first nine months
of 2024, the net cash inflow from financing activities was 4,078,150. This amount consisted of 4,171,601 in proceeds from stock subscriptions,
 83,499 from the exercise of options and warrants, which were offset by 82,299 of tax withholdings related to the share settlement of
RSUs, offset by 94,651 from the repayments on notes payable. 

Based on the company s
current business plan, we believe our cash balance as of the date of this report, along with revenue from our government contracts, will
be sufficient to meet the company s anticipated cash requirements for the near term. However, we cannot be certain that the current
business plan will be achievable. 

The company s existence
depends upon management s ability to develop profitable operations. Management is devoting substantially all of its efforts to developing
its business and raising capital, as needed, and cannot be certain that these efforts will be successful. Management s business
development efforts may not result in profitable operations. To fund its research and development and marketing efforts, the company s
management continues to explore possible financing opportunities through discussions with investment bankers and private investors. The
company may not be successful in its effort to secure additional financing on terms it considers favorable. The accompanying consolidated
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result should the company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

On May 10, 2024, the company
completed the placement of 1,896,182 shares of its common stock, par value, 0.001 per share, in a private sale to individual purchasers
at a price of 2.20 per share, for aggregate proceeds in the amount of 4,171,601. All of the purchasers are accredited, sophisticated
investors, and the issuance of the shares was not in connection with any public offering in accordance with Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities
Act of 1933. 

ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our management, with the participation
of our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures
as of September 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures
as of September 30, 2024, are not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities
and Exchange Commission rules and forms. 

Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting 

There was no change in our
internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report, which has materially affected, or is
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

On January 15, 2021, the company
filed a complaint in the United States District Court, Southern District of New York, against Gusrae, Kaplan Nusbaum and Ryan Whalen
for malpractice and breach of New York Rules of Professional Conduct by both parties as former counsel to the company. On May 28, 2021,
Gusrae, Kaplan Nusbaum and Mr. Whalen filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. On June 25, 2021, the company filed an opposition
to the motion. On July 13, 2021, Gusrae Kaplan Nusbaum and Mr.Whalen filed their reply brief. On March 30, 2022, United States Magistrate
Judge Debra Freeman signed an order denying the motion of GKN and Mr. Whalen to dismiss the company s claim for malpractice and
for rescission of the shares-for-fees agreement under which GKN and Whalen received 1,242,710 shares of the company s common stock.
The motion was partially granted as to the separate claim for violation of NYRPC 1.7 and 1.8 because the court found that it was duplicative
of the malpractice claim. The parties completed discovery, and the court approved a summary judgment briefing schedule proposed by the
parties. The parties have each filed their motions for summary judgment. No trial date has been set. 

On July 26, 2023, the company
filed a complaint in the Superior Court of the State of Delaware against Gusrae Kaplan Nusbaum PLLC and Ryan Whalen, for malicious prosecution
of a federal securities fraud lawsuit which was filed by these defendants against the company and certain of its directors, attorneys
and their law firms and an outside consultant, in July 2019 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.
The complaint filed by the company alleges that the claims by these defendants against it were frivolous and prosecuted for the improper
purpose of hindering the company s prosecution of a then pending case against George Farley, the company s former CEO, which
was later settled. The complaint further alleges that the defendants prosecuted their claim with malice causing the company damages valued
in excess of 40 million. On September 11, 2023, Gusrae, Kaplan Nusbaum and Mr. Whalen filed a motion to dismiss the complaint.
On October 25, 2023, the company filed an opposition to the motion. The court heard oral argument on the motion on January 19, 2024, and
took the motion under submission. On April 16, 2024, the court granted the motion on the grounds of lack of personal jurisdiction over
the defendants. The company filed its Opening Brief on July 17, 2024. On October 8, 2024, the Clerk of the Delaware Supreme Court notified
the parties that the court would hear oral arguments in the case on December 4, 2024, and that the hearing would be en banc 
or in front of the entire court, rather than a panel. 

As with any litigation, the
company cannot predict the outcome with certainty, but the company expects to provide further updates on the status of the litigation
as circumstances warrant. 

The company may, from time
to time, be involved in legal proceedings arising from the normal course of business.
