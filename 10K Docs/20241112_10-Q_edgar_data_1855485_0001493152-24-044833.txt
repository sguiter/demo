 NOTES
TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 (Unaudited) 

The
Company is subject to risks and uncertainties common to early-stage companies in the biotechnology industry, including, but not limited
to, possible failure of preclinical studies or clinical trials, the need to obtain marketing approval for its product candidates, development
by competitors of new technological innovations, dependence on key personnel, protection of proprietary technology, compliance with government
regulations, the need to successfully commercialize and gain market acceptance of any of the Company s products that are approved
and the ability to secure additional capital to fund operations. Product candidates currently under development will require significant
additional research and development efforts, including extensive preclinical and clinical testing, and regulatory approval prior to commercialization.
These efforts require significant amounts of additional capital, adequate personnel and infrastructure, and extensive compliance-reporting
capabilities. Even if the Company s drug development efforts are successful, it is uncertain when, if ever, the Company will realize
significant revenue from product sales. 

Reverse
Stock Split 

On
July 10, 2024, the Company filed a First Certificate of Amendment to its Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware to effect a of the shares of the Company s common
stock, par value per share Common Stock ), effective on July 15, 2024 (the Reverse Stock Split ).
As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, every ten shares of issued and outstanding Common Stock were automatically combined into one
issued and outstanding share of Common Stock, without any change in the par value per share. No fractional shares were issued as a result
of the Reverse Stock Split, and any fractional shares that would otherwise have resulted from the Reverse Stock Split were rounded up
to the next whole number. The number of authorized shares of Common Stock under the Company s Second Amended and Restated Certificate
of Incorporation, as amended, remained unchanged. 

All
references to share and per share amounts for all periods presented in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have
been retrospectively restated to reflect this Reverse Stock Split. All rights to receive shares of common stock under outstanding securities,
including but not limited to, warrants, options, and restricted stock units RSUs were adjusted to give effect to the
reverse stock split. Furthermore, proportionate adjustments were made to the per share exercise price and the number of shares of Common
Stock that may be purchased upon exercise of outstanding stock options granted by the Company, and the number of shares of Common Stock
reserved for future issuance under the Company s 2023 Equity Incentive Plan. 

Liquidity
and Going Concern 

The
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization
of assets and settlement of liabilities in the normal course of business, and do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible
future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the
outcome of this uncertainty. 

The
Company has experienced recurring losses from operations and negative cash flows from operating activities, has a significant accumulated
deficit and expects to continue to incur net losses into the foreseeable future. The Company had an accumulated deficit of million
at September 30, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company used million for operating activities. As of
September 30, 2024, the Company had cash of million and restricted cash of million. Management expects operating losses and
negative cash flows to continue for the foreseeable future. 

On
December 10, 2023, the Company entered into a Standby Equity Purchase Agreement (the SEPA with YA II PN, Ltd., a Cayman
Island exempt limited partnership Yorkville ). Pursuant to the SEPA, the Company will have the right, but not the obligation,
to sell to Yorkville up to million of its shares of Common Stock, par value per share, at the Company s request any
time during the 36 months following the execution of the SEPA. Subject to certain conditions set forth in the SEPA, including payment
of an additional commitment fee, the Company will have the right to increase the commitment amount under the SEPA by an additional 
million. See Note 11 and Note 12.

On
May 31, 2024, the Company entered into an inducement offer letter agreement (the May Inducement Offer with nine (9) holders
of the Company s existing Series B unit purchase warrants Series B Warrants and Series C unit purchase warrants Series C Warrants and together with the Series B Warrants, the Existing Warrants ), which Existing Warrants
were originally issued on April 18, 2024 and had an exercise price of (see Note 8). Following the closing of the May Inducement
Offer, such warrant holders immediately exercised some or all of their respective outstanding Existing Warrants to purchase up to an
aggregate of shares of the Company s Common Stock, Series B-1 Warrants to purchase up to shares of common stock
and Series C-1 Warrants to purchase up to shares of Common Stock, at a reduced exercise price of . In consideration for
the immediate exercise of some or all of the Existing Warrants for cash, the Company agreed to issue unregistered new Series D common
stock purchase warrants Series D Warrants to purchase up to shares of Common Stock (see Note 8). The Company
received gross proceeds of million in cash from the exercise of the Existing Warrants pursuant to the May Inducement Offer, prior
to deducting placement agent fees and offering expenses. 

On
July 26, 2024, the Board of Directors of the Company approved the Subscription Agreement dated July 28, 2024 (the Subscription

of million. 

On

investor (the Investor ), a related-party, into Nova Cell, a subsidiary of the Company, in exchange for the issuance of
 shares of Nova Cell s shares of common stock to the Investor, representing of Nova Cell s current fully-diluted
capitalization. 

On
October 11, 2024, the Company entered into an At The Market Offering Agreement (the Sales Agreement with Ladenburg Thalmann
 Co. Inc. (the Ladenburg ), under which the Company may, from time to time, in its sole discretion, issue and sell

On
October 23, 2024, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with certain institutional investors (the Purchasers ),
pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue to the Purchasers, (i) in a registered offering, shares of the Company s

The shares were offered by the Company pursuant to a shelf registration statement on Form S-3, which was declared effective by the Securities
Exchange Commission on October 10, 2024. See Note 12. 

Management
estimates that based on the Company s liquidity resources, there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue
as a going concern within 12 months from the date of issuance of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. The accompanying
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis of the Company continuing to operate in the normal
course of business and does not reflect any adjustments to the assets and liabilities related to the substantial doubt of its ability
to continue as a going concern. 

Management s
ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to raise additional funding. Management s plans to raise additional
capital through public or private equity or debt financings to fulfill its operating and capital requirements for at least 12 months
from the date of the issuance of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. However, the Company may not be able to secure
such financing in a timely manner or on favorable terms, if at all. Furthermore, if the Company issues equity securities to raise additional
funds, its existing stockholders may experience dilution, and the new equity securities may have rights, preferences and privileges senior
to those of the Company s existing stockholders. 

Risks
and Uncertainties 

Changes
in economic conditions, including rising interest rates, public health issues, lower consumer confidence, volatile equity capital markets,
ongoing supply chain disruptions and the impacts of geopolitical conflicts, may affect the Company s operations. 

(see Note 1 and Note 8). Under the rules of determining whether an entity is a VIE, the Company has
a controlling financial interest and is deemed to be the primary beneficiary of Nova Cell and therefore consolidates Nova Cell s
financial statements. Since the Company owns less than of Nova Cell, the Company records net loss attributable to noncontrolling
interest in its condensed consolidated statements of operations equal to the percentage of the economic or ownership interests retained
in Nova Cell by the noncontrolling party. 

Calidi
Cure LLC Calidi Cure ), a Delaware limited liability company formed in June 2023, was a special purpose vehicle entity
that was solely managed and operated by Allan J. Camaisa, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Company.
Calidi Cure was created for the sole purpose of supporting the Series B Convertible Preferred Stock financing arrangement for Calidi
and had no other operations, whereby the historical level of equity in Calidi Cure was not sufficient to permit the entity to finance
its activities without additional subordinated financial support provided by other parties. Accordingly, it was determined that Calidi
Cure was a VIE and the Company was the primary beneficiary. As such, the Company consolidated Calidi Cure into its unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements. Calidi Cure was dissolved on July 17, 2024, and was no longer in existence as of September 30, 2024. 

The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments,
necessary for a fair presentation of the Company s financial condition and results of operations. All material intercompany accounts
and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 

Restricted cash included within prepaid expenses and other current assets 

Restricted cash included within other noncurrent assets

purchased under financing leases, The Company depreciates the equipment based on the shorter of the useful life of the equipment or the
term of the lease, ranging from to years, depending on the nature and classification of the financing lease. Maintenance and repairs
are expensed as incurred whereas significant renewals and betterments are capitalized. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed
of, the cost and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective accounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected
in the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. 

For
operating leases, the Company recognizes right-of-use ROU assets and lease liabilities for leases with terms greater
than 12 months in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet, while leases with terms of 12 months or less are not capitalized.
ROU assets represent the right to use an underlying asset during the lease term and lease liabilities represent the obligation to make
lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present
value of lease payments over the lease term. As most leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses an incremental borrowing
rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The Company uses the
implicit rate when it is readily determinable. The operating lease ROU asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease
incentives. Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise
that option. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company discloses the amortization
of ROU assets and operating lease payments as a net amount, Amortization of right-of-use assets and liabilities, 
on the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. 

Finance
leases are included in machinery and equipment, and in finance lease liabilities, current and noncurrent, in the unaudited condensed
consolidated balance sheets. 

See
Note 11 for the San Diego Office lease which commenced on March 1, 2023, and was accounted for as an operating lease in accordance with
ASC 842. 

ASC
820 establishes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the last
unobservable, that may be used to measure fair value, which are as follows: 

Level 1: 
 Quoted
 prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities; 

Level 2: 
 Inputs
 other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted market prices for similar assets or liabilities;
 quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data
 for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities; and 

Level 3: 
 Unobservable
 inputs in which there is little or no market data and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities, which
 require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions. 

When
quoted market prices are available in active markets, the fair value of assets and liabilities is estimated within Level 1 of the valuation
hierarchy. If quoted prices are not available, then fair values are estimated by using pricing models, quoted prices of assets and liabilities
with similar characteristics, or discounted cash flows, within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. In cases where Level 1 or Level 2
inputs are not available, the fair values are estimated by using inputs within Level 3 of the hierarchy. See Note 3 for fair value measurements.

Proceeds
from the CIRM grant are recognized over the period necessary to match the related research and development expenses when it is probable
that the Company has complied with the CIRM conditions and will receive the proceeds pursuant to the milestones defined in the grant
as reimbursement of those expenditures. The CIRM grant proceeds, if any, received in advance of having incurred the related research

Diluted
net loss per share is computed using the more dilutive of (a) the two-class method or (b) the if-converted method and treasury stock
method, as applicable. In periods in which Calidi reports a net loss attributable to common stockholders, diluted net loss per share
attributable to common stockholders is the same as basic net loss per share attributable to common stockholders since dilutive common
shares are not assumed to have been issued if their effect is anti-dilutive. Diluted net loss per share is equivalent to basic net loss
per share for the periods presented herein because common stock equivalent shares from the outstanding warrants, earnout shares, convertible
notes, stock option awards, restricted stock units, and contingently issuable warrants were antidilutive. 

For
purposes of calculating basic and diluted net loss per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the reported net
loss was increased by approximately and million, respectively, related to a deemed dividend resulting from the May Inducement
Offer (see Note 1 and Note 8).

proceedings 

Terminated
Physician Agreement Matter 

On
July 19, 2016, the Company entered into a Partnership Agreement between certain physicians (the Physicians , as one of the
 partners and Calidi for the Physicians to provide certain services to Calidi. In connection with the Partnership Agreement,
Calidi granted the Physicians stock options as consideration for those services pursuant to Calidi s Equity Incentive Plan (the
 Plan ). The Partnership Agreement was deemed terminated on March 21, 2018. Pursuant to the terms of the stock option agreements
and the Plan, the Physicians had three months from the termination date to exercise their vested stock options before those options would
automatically expire and cancel unexercised, while all unvested stock options are forfeited immediately on the termination date. The
Physicians did not elect to exercise any of their vested options thereby resulting in full cancellation of those options in accordance
with the Plan. 

On
March 14, 2022, the Physicians filed a lawsuit against Calidi in San Diego Superior Court, seeking, among other claims, declaratory relief
and claiming that the stock options granted to them pursuant to the Partnership Agreement, have not expired and remain exercisable by
the Physicians. The Physicians are claiming in vested stock options to be valid and exercisable, even though the Physicians have
not provided any services to Calidi since the March 2018 termination date. 

On
December 6, 2022, Calidi and the Physicians participated in mediation in San Diego, California. In order to attempt to settle all claims
and avoid a costly trial, Calidi offered the Physicians shares of Calidi common stock valued at per share and options
to purchase common stock at an exercise price of per share in full settlement of the claims. As of December 31, 2022, the Company
estimated this offer of settlement to be valued at approximately million and all settleable in noncash consideration, which was
rejected. At the mediation, the Physicians were demanding million options to purchase common stock at per share, million
options to purchase common stock at per share, plus shares of common stock, which amounts to an aggregate claims value
of approximately million as of December 31, 2022. The mediation was terminated without settlement and the Company went to trial
with a preliminary trial date set for March 8, 2024 in San Diego Superior Court. On March 24, 2023, the Company initiated an arbitration
proceeding with the American Health Lawyers Association seeking declaratory relief under Delaware law, specifically to determine that
the Partnership Agreement was terminated in 2018, which is not a matter before the San Diego Superior Court. The arbitration was stayed
by the Superior Court, pending the related civil action. Based on the stay, the Company has moved for a judgment on the pleadings to
be heard in January 2024. 

On
February 5, 2024, the Company entered into a settlement agreement and mutual release (the Settlement Agreement with Dr.
Elliot Lander, Saralee Berman, as Trustee of the Mark Howard Berman and Saralee Turrell Berman Living Trust, successor in interest to
the Estate of Dr. Mark Berman, and Cell Surgical Network, Inc. (the physicians in connection with the dispute outlined
above. 

Pursuant
to the Settlement Agreement, as consideration for a full release and discharge of claims, and dismissal of claims by the parties, the
Company agreed to provide to the physicians the following: (a) the issuance of restricted shares of common stock (the Restricted
Shares and (b) the issuance of warrants to purchase Restricted Shares, which (i) has an exercise price equal to ;
and (ii) are exercisable for years after the date of issuance of the warrants, subject to the terms set forth in such warrant (the
 Warrant ). In addition, the physicians were granted piggy-back rights with respect to the Restricted Shares and any shares
issued pursuant to any Warrants Warrant Shares that were granted by the Settlement Agreement. However, the Company has
the right to refuse to register the Restricted Shares and Warrant Shares if it determines, in their sole discretion based on commercially
reasonable grounds, that the inclusion of the Restricted Shares and Warrant Shares pursuant to piggy-back rights will adversely affect
our ability to raise capital from such registration statement. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had settled all outstanding amounts
of the settlement. 

Former
Chief Accounting Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer 

On
November 15, 2023, Tony Kalajian, the Company s prior chief accounting officer and interim chief financial officer, filed a complaint
in the Superior Court of the State of California County of San Diego against the Company, Mr. Camaisa, the Company s Chief Executive
Officer, and Ms. Pizarro, the Company s Chief Administrative Office and Chief Legal Officer, alleging constructive discharge of
Mr. Kalajian s position of interim Chief Financial Officer and defamation by the Company, Mr. Camaisa and Ms. Pizarro in connection
with Mr. Kalajian s alleged discharge. Mr. Kalajian is seeking million in damages under his employment contract, damages to
be proven at trial, punitive damages, and attorney s fees. The Company intends to vigorously defend itself and will seek recovery
of a million bonus Mr. Kalajian approved to be paid to himself without first obtaining proper authorization by the Company s
board of directors. 

On
May 1, 2024, Mr. Kalajian filed a complaint in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of San Diego against the Company
alleging intentional conversion and violation of Section 158 of the Delaware General Corporations Code due to the Company s failure
to remove a restrictive legend from shares of the Company s Common Stock. Mr. Kalajian is seeking compensatory damages to
be proven at trial, punitive damages and attorney s fees, and an order requiring removal of the restrictive legend from his share
certificates. The Company intends to vigorously defend itself.

L icense
Agreements with Northwestern University 

On
June 7, 2021, the Company entered into a License Agreement with Northwestern University Northwestern (the Northwestern
Agreement for the exclusive commercialization rights to the investigational new drug IND and data generated from
Northwestern s phase 1 clinical trial treating brain tumor patients with an engineered oncolytic adenovirus delivered by neural
stem cells NSC-CRAd-S-pk7 ). Under the Northwestern Agreement, among other rights, Northwestern granted to the Company
a worldwide, twelve-year exclusivity for the commercial development of NSC-CRAd-S-pk7 or other oncolytic viruses for therapeutic and
preventive uses in oncology and a right of reference to Northwestern s IND application which relates to the treatment of newly
diagnosed HGG. 

Pursuant
to the Northwestern Agreement, the Company agreed to a best-efforts commitment to fund up to million towards a phase 2 clinical trial
of NSC-CRAd-S-pk7 or other oncolytic viruses. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Northwestern Agreement, Northwestern may become
entitled to receive contingent payments from the Company based on, if any (i) sublicense royalty payments of double-digit percentage
for any sublicensing revenue that the Company earns and, (ii) in the event of an assignment or transfer of licensed data, with the consent
of Northwestern, a small percentage of the fair market value of any consideration received. 

On
October 14, 2021, the Company entered into a Material License Agreement with Northwestern to license the NSC-CRAd-S-pk7 oncolytic virus
materials which the Company intends to use to continue advancing its research, development and commercialization efforts of the NNV1
and NNV2 programs. 

As
of the date of issuance of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, it is not probable that the Company will make
these payments, if any at all. The Company will record the contingent payments if and when they become payable, in accordance with the
applicable guidance. 

License
Agreement with City of Hope and the University of Chicago 

On
July 22, 2021, the Company entered into an Exclusive License Agreement with City of Hope COH and the University of Chicago
(the City of Hope Agreement for patents covering cancer therapies using an oncolytic adenovirus loaded into allogeneic
neural stem cells for treatment of HGG. Pursuant to the City of Hope Agreement, COH transferred its IND to the Company for the commercial
development of a licensed product, as defined in the City of Hope Agreement. This agreement grants to the Company commercial exclusivity
in using neural stem cells with the adenovirus known as CRAd-S-pk7 for oncolytic virotherapy. 

The
City of Hope Agreement provides for the Company to pay royalties in low single digit percentage of net sales generated for any product
of the licensed patents for specific periods, and to pay up to million if certain milestones are achieved during the clinical trials
and post commercialization of the licensed product. 

As
of the date of the issuance of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, it is not probable that the Company will
make these payments. The Company will record the contingent payments if and when they become payable, in accordance with the applicable
guidance. 

Indemnification 

In
the normal course of business, the Company may provide indemnification of varying scope under the Company s agreements with other
companies or consultants, typically the Company s clinical research organizations, investigators, clinical sites, suppliers and
others. Pursuant to these agreements, the Company will generally agree to indemnify, hold harmless, and reimburse the indemnified parties
for losses and expenses suffered or incurred by the indemnified parties arising from claims of third parties. Indemnification provisions
could also cover third party infringement claims with respect to patent rights, copyrights, or other intellectual property pertaining
to the Company. The Company s office and laboratory facility leases also will generally contain indemnification obligations, including
obligations for indemnification of the lessor for environmental law matters and injuries to persons or property of others, arising from
the Company s use or occupancy of the leased property. The term of these indemnification agreements will generally continue in
effect after the termination or expiration of the particular research, development, services, lease, or other agreement to which they
relate. The potential future payments the Company could be required to make under these indemnification agreements will generally not
be subject to any specified maximum amounts. Historically, the Company has not been subject to any claims or demands for indemnification.
The Company also maintains various liability insurance policies that limit the Company s financial exposure. As a result, the Company s
management believes that the fair value of these indemnification agreements is minimal. Accordingly, the Company has not recorded any
liabilities for these agreements as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The
following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with (i) our unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the
period ended September 30, 2024 (this Quarterly Report ). This information should also be read in conjunction with our audited
consolidated financial statements and related notes included in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 Form

Company
Overview 

We
are a clinical-stage immuno-oncology company that is developing innovative stem cell-based and enveloped platforms for the delivery and
potentiation of oncolytic virotherapies to treat cancer. Our pipeline includes off-the-shelf product candidates designed to protect oncolytic
viruses from being quickly inactivated by the patient s immune system and target tumor sites. Once approved by the FDA, this improved
delivery, both localized and systemic, and increased potency will enable us to develop treatments that target various types of cancer
at different stages of progression. Our goal is to create therapies that work on any tumor, regardless of its genetic profile (universal
treatments). In addition to direct targeting and killing cancer cells, our oncolytic virotherapies have shown signs of changing the tumor
immune environment to induce strong anti-tumor immunity that could lead to better cancer treatment and prevent tumor recurrence. 

CLD-101
(NeuroNova Platform) for Newly Diagnosed High Grade Glioma HGG (also referred to as NNV1 as to
the indication). CLD-101 is our product candidate utilizing our NeuroNova Platform targeting HGG. Prior to our licensing
agreement with Northwestern University, an open-label, investigator sponsored, Phase 1, dose- escalation clinical trial for NNV1 in
patients with newly diagnosed high-grade gliomas was completed. This clinical trial demonstrated that single administration of
CLD-101 was well tolerated in patients with newly diagnosed HGG. Subject to funding, Northwestern University anticipates to commence
a Phase 1b clinical trial during the first quarter of 2025. This trial will explore the final dosing regimen for NNV1, including the
feasibility of repeated dosing in newly diagnosed HGG. Extensive biomarker analysis will be performed on tumor biopsies and blood
samples to determine viral distribution, specific tumor targeting and induction of anti-tumor immunity. 

CLD-101
for Recurrent HGG (also referred to as NNV2 as to the recurrent HGG indication). A phase 1 study evaluating the safety
and feasibility of administering repeated doses of CLD-101 intracerebrally to patients with recurrent high-grade gliomas began treatment
in May 2023. The study is being run by our partner, City of Hope, and started enrolling cohort 4 in January 2024. Clinical data from
patients with recurrent HGG treated with repeated doses of CLD-101 is planned to support the start of a trial of repeated doses in newly
diagnosed HGG. 

CLD-201
(SuperNova for Advanced Solid Tumors (triple-negative breast cancer TNBC ), head neck squamous cell carcinoma
(HNSCC), and advanced soft tissue sarcoma (also referred to as SNV1 ). SNV1 is our first internally developed pre-clinical
product candidate utilizing our SuperNova Delivery Platform. Based on our pre-clinical studies, we believe SNV1 has therapeutic
potential for the treatment of multiple solid tumors such as head and neck cancer, triple-negative breast cancer and melanoma. We have
held a pre-IND meeting with FDA to discuss the filing of our IND application for the clinical development of CLD-201. We anticipate commencing
a Phase 1 clinical trial for SNV1 during the first half of 2025. 

CLD-301
(AAA) for Multiple Indications. We are also currently engaged in early discovery research involving Adult Allogeneic Adipose-derived AAA stem cells for various indications and therapies. These AAA stem cells are theoretically multipotent, differentiating
along the adipocyte, chondrocyte, myocyte, neuronal, and osteoblast lineages, and may have the ability to serve in other capacities,
such as providing hematopoietic support and gene transfer with potential applications for repair and regeneration of acute and chronically
damaged tissues. Pre-clinical studies involving toxicity and efficacy will be needed before an IND application may be filed with the
FDA. 

Our
subsidiary Nova Cell, Inc. Nova Cell was formed to be a technology service provider that develops innovative stem cell-based
products using our cellular manufacturing process. Through Nova Cell we anticipate expanding potential uses from oncology to other fields
that require regenerative medical applications, such as cosmetics, orthopedics, auto-immune diseases, and various other therapies. 

CLD-400
(RTNova) for Lung cancer and Metastatic Solid Tumors, our pre-clinical program involving enveloped oncolytic viruses (discovery phase),
builds upon our experience of using cells to protect, potentiate and deliver virotherapies. CLD-400 program is derived from research
from prior pre-clinical CLD-202 program. RTNova consists of an engineered vaccinia virus enveloped by a cell membrane, that is potentially
capable of targeting lung cancer and advanced metastatic disease due to its increased ability to survive in the bloodstream. Metastatic
solid tumors involve cancer cells that break away from where they first formed (primary cancer) and travel through the blood or lymph
system to form new tumors, known as metastatic tumors, in other parts of the body. In preclinical studies, RTNova has shown early signs
of its resistance to human humoral immunity and capability to target multiple distant and diverse tumors and transform their microenvironments
leading to their elimination. In addition, the program has shown potential synergistic effects with other immunotherapies, including
cell therapies, to attack and eliminate disseminated solid tumors.

Since
inception, our operations have focused on organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital, acquiring and developing
our technology, establishing our intellectual property portfolio, identifying potential product candidates and undertaking preclinical
studies and manufacturing. We do not have any products approved for sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales. We have
funded our operations primarily through private sales of common stock, convertible preferred stock, contingently convertible and convertible
promissory notes, term loans, lines of credit, and Simple Agreements for Future Equity SAFE ). These investments have included
and have been made by various related parties, including our largest investor and Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of
Directors. 

Since
inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. Our net loss was 5.1 million and 18.1 million for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2024, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 117.6 million. We expect to continue
to incur significant and increasing expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future, as we advance our current and future product
candidates through preclinical and clinical development, manufacture drug product and drug supply, seek regulatory approval for our current
and future product candidates, maintain and expand our intellectual property portfolio, hire additional research and development and
business personnel and operate as a public company. 

Changes
in economic conditions, including rising interest rates, public health issues, including the COVID-19 pandemic and its aftereffects,
lower consumer confidence, volatile equity capital markets and ongoing supply chain disruptions and the impacts of geopolitical conflicts,
may also affect our business. 

We
will not generate revenue from product sales unless and until we successfully complete clinical development and obtain regulatory approval
for our product candidates. In addition, if we obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates and do not enter into a third-party
commercialization partnership, we expect to incur significant expenses related to developing our commercialization capability to support
product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution activities. 

As
a result, we will need substantial additional funding to support our continuing operations and pursue our growth strategy. Until we can
generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through a combination of public or private
equity offerings and debt financings or other sources, such as potential collaboration agreements, strategic alliances and licensing
arrangements. We may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other agreements or arrangements when needed on acceptable
terms, or at all. Our inability to raise capital or enter into such agreements as, and when needed, could have a material adverse effect
on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

Based
on our operating plan, we believe we do not have sufficient cash on hand to support current operations for at least one year from the
date of issuance of our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as of, and for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2024. We have concluded that this circumstance raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. See Note
1 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. In addition, we will be required to raise additional capital through
the issuance of our equity securities to support our operations which will have an ownership and economic dilutive effect to our current
shareholders who purchased their shares of common stock at prices above our current trading price, and such capital raising may adversely
affect the price of our common stock. Further, the sale of or the perception of a sale of a substantial number of our common stock by
certain selling securityholders pursuant to another registration statement filed with the SEC will adversely affect the price of our
common stock due to our limited trading volume and adversely affect the share price that we may obtain in future financings and may adversely
affect our ability to conduct and complete future financings.

The
FLAG Merger and Related Transactions 

On
September 12, 2023, FLAG consummated a series of transactions that resulted in the merger of FLAG Merger Sub Inc., a Nevada corporation
and a wholly-owned subsidiary of FLAG Merger Sub and Calidi pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, as amended,
dated as of January 9, 2023. Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, the business combination was effected through the merger
of Merger Sub with and into Calidi, with Calidi surviving such merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of FLAG. Historical common share amounts
of Calidi have been retroactively restated based on the conversion ratio of approximately 0.04 (the Conversion Ratio ).
Following the consummation of the business combination, FLAG was renamed Calidi Biotherapeutics, Inc. 

As
a result of the Business Combination, all outstanding stock of Calidi were cancelled in exchange for the right to receive newly issued
shares of Common Stock (also referred to as New Calidi Common Stock ), par value 0.0001 per share, and all outstanding
options to purchase Calidi stock were assumed by Calidi. The total consideration received by Calidi Security Holders at the Closing of
the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement is the newly issued shares of Common Stock and securities convertible or exchangeable
for newly issued shares of Common Stock with an aggregate value equal 250.0 million, plus an adjustment of 23.8 million pursuant to
the net debt adjustment provisions of the Merger Agreement by reason of the Series B Financing. As a result, the Calidi Security Holders
received an aggregate of 2,737,560 shares of Common Stock as Merger Consideration. 

As
additional consideration, each Calidi stockholder was entitled to earn, on a pro rata basis, up to 1,800,000 Escalation Shares. During
the Escalation Period, Calidi Stockholders may be entitled to receive up to 1,800,000 Escalation Shares with incremental releases of
450,000 shares upon the achievement of each share price hurdle if the trading price of Common Stock is 120.00, 140.00, 160.00, and
 180.00, respectively, for a period of any 20 days within any 30-consecutive-day trading period. The Escalation Shares have been placed
in escrow and are outstanding from and after the Closing, subject to cancellation if the applicable price targets are not achieved. While
in escrow, the shares will be non-voting. 

Holders
of FLAG Class A Common Stock who did not redeem their shares obtained their pro rata portion of an additional 8,585 Non-Redeeming Continuation
Shares issued at Closing. At the Closing, Calidi Security Holders own approximately 76 of the outstanding shares of New Calidi Common
Stock.

Components
of Operating Results 

Research
and Development Expenses 

Research
and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for our research and development activities, including our product candidate
discovery efforts, preclinical studies and clinical trials under our research programs, which include: 

personnel
 and related expenses, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expense for our research and development personnel; 

costs
 of funding research performed by third parties that conduct research and development and preclinical and clinical activities on our
 behalf; 

costs
 of manufacturing drug product and drug supply related to our current or future product candidates; 

costs
 of conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates; 

consulting
 and professional fees related to research and development activities, including equity-based compensation to non-employees; 

costs
 of maintaining our laboratory, including purchasing laboratory supplies and non-capital equipment used in our preclinical studies; 

49 

costs
 related to compliance with clinical regulatory requirements; 

facility
 costs and other allocated expenses, which include expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities, insurance, depreciation and other
 supplies; and 

fees
 for maintaining licenses and other amounts due under our third-party licensing agreements. 

Research
and development costs are expensed as incurred. Costs for certain activities are recognized based on an evaluation of the progress to
completion of specific tasks using data such as information provided to us by our vendors and analyzing the progress of our preclinical
and clinical studies or other services performed. Significant judgment and estimates are made in determining the accrued expense balances
at the end of any reporting period. 

We
track external research and development costs on a program-by-program basis beginning, with respect to each program, upon our internal
nomination of a candidate in that program for further preclinical and clinical development. External costs include fees paid to consultants,
contractors and vendors, including contract manufacturing organizations CMOs ), and clinical research organizations CROs ),
in connection with our preclinical, clinical and manufacturing activities and license milestone payments related to candidate development. 

The
successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain. We cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing, and estimated
costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete development of our current or future product candidates. We are also unable to
predict when, if ever, material net cash inflows will commence from the sale of our product candidates, if they are approved. This is
due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing product candidates, including the uncertainty of: 

the
 scope, rate of progress, and expenses of our ongoing research activities as well as any preclinical studies and clinical trials and
 other research and development activities; 

establishing
 an appropriate safety profile; 

successful
 enrollment in and completion of clinical trials; 

whether
 our product candidates show safety and efficacy in our clinical trials; 

receipt
 of marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities; 

establishing
 commercial manufacturing capabilities or making arrangements with third-party manufacturers; 

obtaining
 and maintaining patent and trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity for our product candidates; 

commercializing
 product candidates, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others; and 

continued
 acceptable safety profile of the products following any regulatory approval. 

A
change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of our current and future product candidates would significantly
change the costs and timing associated with the development of those product candidates. 

Research
and development activities are central to our business model. Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have
higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage
clinical trials. We expect research and development costs to increase significantly for the foreseeable future as we commence clinical
trials and continue the development of our current and future product candidates. However, we do not believe that it is possible at this
time to accurately project expenses through commercialization. There are numerous factors associated with the successful commercialization
of any of our product candidates, including future trial design and various regulatory requirements, many of which cannot be determined
with accuracy at this time based on our stage of development. Additionally, future commercial and regulatory factors beyond our control
will impact our clinical development programs and plans. 

50 

General
and Administrative Expenses 

General
and administrative expenses include salaries and other compensation-related costs, including stock-based compensation. Other significant
costs include professional service and consulting fees including legal fees relating to intellectual property and corporate matters,
accounting fees, recruiting costs and costs for consultants utilized to supplement our personnel, insurance costs, travel costs, facility
and office-related costs not included in research and development expenses and depreciation and amortization. 

We
anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as our business expands to support expected growth
in research and development activities, including our future clinical programs. These increases will likely include increased costs related
to the hiring of additional personnel and fees to outside service providers, among other expenses. We also anticipate continued expenses
associated with being a public company, including costs for audit, legal, regulatory and tax-related services related to compliance with
the rules and regulations of the SEC, and listing standards applicable to companies listed on a national securities exchange, director
and officer insurance premiums, and investor relations costs. In addition, if we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates
and do not enter into a third-party commercialization collaboration, we expect to incur significant expenses related to building a sales
and marketing team to support product sales, marketing and distribution activities. 

Other
Income or Expenses, Net 

Other
income or expenses, net, primarily includes the changes in fair value of debt instruments, warrants, and derivatives. The changes in
the fair value of these instruments are recorded in change in fair value of debt, other liabilities, and derivatives, and change in fair
value of debt, other liabilities, and derivatives related party, included as a component of other income or expenses, net, in
the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. 

At
the closing of the FLAG Merger, all convertible instruments outstanding were converted into Calidi Common Stock immediately prior the
closing of the FLAG Merger and are no longer outstanding as of the Closing date. 

Interest
expense primarily consists of amortization of discounts on convertible and term notes, including from related parties, and other interest
expense incurred from financing leases and other obligations. 

Other
income also includes grant income generated from a grant awarded to us by the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine CIRM in December 2022. Proceeds from the CIRM grant are recognized over the period necessary to match the related research and development
expenses when it is probable that we have complied with the CIRM conditions and will receive the proceeds pursuant to the milestones
defined in the grant as reimbursement of those expenditures. Any CIRM grant proceeds received in advance of having incurred the related
research and development expenses are recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and recognized as other income on our
unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations when the related research and developments expenses are incurred. 

Income
Taxes 

Since
inception, we have incurred net operating losses primarily for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes and have not reflected any
benefit of such net operating loss carryforwards for any periods presented in this Form 10-Q. The income tax provision in the periods
presented is entirely attributable to amounts recorded from StemVac operations, our wholly-owned German subsidiary that provides research
and development services to us under a cost-plus development agreement.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

S ources
of Liquidity 

Since
inception, we have funded our operations primarily through sales of common stock, convertible preferred stock, contingently convertible
and convertible promissory notes, term loans, lines of credit, and SAFEs. These investments have also been made by and included various
related parties, including our largest investor and Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Directors. 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had a cash balance of 1.9 million and restricted cash of 0.2 million. Our debt and liability obligations
as of September 30, 2024 include 7.3 million in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities, including related
party amounts, 3.3 million in operating lease liabilities, 2.9 million in term notes payable, including related party amounts, 1.8
million in convertible notes payable, 0.6 million in promissory notes, 0.2 million in related party bridge loans payable, 0.2 million
in finance lease liabilities, and 0.2 million in warrant liabilities, including related party amounts. 

Reverse
Stock Split 

On
July 10, 2024, we filed a First Certificate of Amendment to Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary
of State of Delaware to effect a 1-for-10 reverse stock split of the shares of Calidi s common stock, par value 0.0001 per share,
effective on July 15, 2024 (the Reverse Stock Split ). As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, every ten shares of issued
and outstanding our Common Stock was automatically combined into one issued and outstanding share of our Common Stock, without any change
in the par value per share. No fractional shares were issued as a result of the Reverse Stock Split, and any fractional shares that would
otherwise have resulted from the Reverse Stock Split were rounded up to the next whole number. The number of authorized shares of Common
Stock under our Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, remained unchanged. 

53 

All
references to share and per share amounts for all periods presented in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have
been retrospectively restated to reflect this Reverse Stock Split. 

On
April 18, 2024, we closed on a public offering of securities pursuant to that certain securities purchase agreement dated April 16, 2024
entered into by and among Calidi and certain purchasers (the April Public Offering ). In connection with the April public
offering, Calidi sold an aggregate of 1,323,250 Common Stock Units and 196,500 Pre-Funded Warrant PFW Units at an effective
combined purchase price of 4.00 per Common Stock Unit or PFW Unit for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately 6.1 million before
deducting placement agent fees and offering expenses payable by Calidi. The securities offered and sold in the public offering were registered
pursuant to registration statement on Form S-1, as amended, filed with the SEC and declared effective on April 15, 2024. 

Warrant
Inducement 

On
May 31, 2024, we entered into an inducement offer letter agreement (the May Inducement Offer with nine (9) holders of
the Calidi s existing Series B unit purchase warrants Series B Warrants and Series C unit purchase warrants Series
C Warrants and together with the Series B Warrants, the Existing Warrants ), which Existing Warrants were originally
issued on April 18, 2024 and had an exercise price of 6.00 (see Note 8). Following the closing of the May Inducement Offer, such warrant
holders immediately exercised some or all of their respective outstanding Existing Warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 1,069,800
shares of Calidi s common stock, Series B-1 Warrants to purchase up to 267,300 shares of common stock and Series C-1 Warrants to
purchase up to 802,500 shares of Common Stock, at a reduced exercise price of 2.00. In consideration for the immediate exercise of some
or all of the Existing Warrants for cash, we agreed to issue unregistered new Series D common stock purchase warrants Series
D Warrants to purchase up to 1,069,800 shares of Common Stock (see Note 8). We received gross proceeds of 2.1 million in cash
from the exercise of the Existing Warrants pursuant to the May Inducement Offer, prior to deducting placement agent fees and offering
expenses. 

Subscription
Agreements 

On
July 26, 2024, the Board of Calidi approved the Subscription Agreement dated July 28, 2024 entered with an accredited investor, a related-party.
Pursuant to the Agreement, we sold to the Investor and the investor purchased, (i) 698,812 shares of Common Stock at a purchase price
of 1.431 per share; and (ii) warrants to purchase 600,000 shares of the Calidi s common stock at an exercise price of 1.90, for
an aggregate purchase price of 1.0 million. 

Strategic
Investment into Nova Cell 

On
July 26, 2024, the Board and the Audit Committee of Calidi s Board approved a strategic investment of approximately 2.0 million
by the investor, a related-party, into Nova Cell, in exchange for the issuance of 7,500,000 shares of Nova Cell s shares of common
stock to the investor, representing 25 of Nova Cell s current fully-diluted capitalization. 

2024
Bridge Loan 

On
January 19, 2024, Calidi received approximately 0.2 million in aggregate proceeds from the issuance of certain bridge loans (the 2024
Bridge Loan ), which mature one year from the issuance date and bear simple interest of 12 per annum. As consideration for the
2024 Term Loans, Calidi issued an aggregate of 893 shares of restricted common stock to the Lender. 

As
of September 30, 2024, the total carrying value of the 2024 Bridge Loan, including accrued interest and net of debt discount, was 0.2
million. 

54 

Convertible
Promissory Notes 

On
January 26, 2024, Calidi entered into a convertible promissory note purchase agreement (the 2024 Purchase Agreement with
an accredited investor for a loan in the principal amount of 1.0 million (the 2024 Convertible Note Loan ). In connection
with the Convertible Note Loan, Calidi issued a one-year convertible promissory note evidencing the aggregate principal amount of 1.0
million under the Loan, which accrues at a 12.0 simple interest rate per annum (the 2024 Convertible Note ). 

The
2024 Convertible Note also provides the investor a voluntary right to convert all, but not less than all, the Principal Amount and accrued
interest into shares of the Calidi s common stock at a conversion rate equal to a 10 discount to the 10-day VWAP as determined
immediately before January 26, 2024. In addition, upon such voluntary conversion by the investor, the investor will be entitled to a
warrant for 50 of the number of shares of Calidi s common stock issued upon the Note conversion at an exercise equal to 120 of
the Conversion Price (the 2024 Note Warrant ). In the event Calidi consummates a public offering prior to the maturity date
of the 2024 Convertible Note, the 2024 Convertible Note and accrued interest will be subject to a mandatory conversion into the equity
securities of Calidi issued and sold to investors in such public offering, equal to the price per share of the equity security sold to
other purchasers and subject to similar terms and conditions of such public offering, except that such equity securities received under
a mandatory conversion will be restricted securities. 

On
April 18, 2024, pursuant to the April Public Offering, Calidi s 1.0 million convertible note, inclusive of outstanding principal
and accrued interest, was automatically converted into shares of Common Stock Unit shares, with terms identical to those sold in the
April Public Offering. As of that date, the convertible note was no longer outstanding. 

Convertible
Promissory Notes and Unasserted Claim Settlement 

On
March 8, 2024, Calidi entered into settlement agreement Settlement Agreement with an investor who previously enter into
a series of related agreements including (i) an agreement with Calidi Cure to fund the purchase of Calidi Series B Preferred Stock; (ii)
a Non-Redemption Agreement with Calidi; (iii) an OTC Equity Prepaid Forward Purchase Agreement with Calidi; and (iv) a Subscription Agreement
with Calidi (items (i) through (iv) collectively the Supplemental Funding Agreements for the purpose of satisfying the
 Minimum Cash Condition required under the Business Combination agreement between First Light Acquisition Group, Inc., and
Calidi Biotherapeutics, Inc., a Nevada corporation among others. Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, (i) the investor purchased a 2.0
million convertible note from Calidi for cash and (ii) Calidi issued to the investor a 1.5 million convertible note in consideration
for the settlement of all claims related to the Supplemental Funding Agreements. The 2.0 million convertible note and 1.5 million convertible
note are collectively herein referred to as the Convertible Notes . The Convertible Notes bear semiannual interest at 10.0 
per annum and each mature on March 8, 2028, unless due earlier due to an event of a default. After the earlier of 180 days or the effective
date of a registration statement registering Calidi s common stock underlying the Convertible Notes, Calidi may prepay the Convertible
Notes, including any interest earned thereon, without penalty. The Convertible Notes provide the investor a right to convert in whole
or in part , the Principal Amount (as defined in the Convertible Notes) and accrued interest earned thereon into shares of Calidi s
common stock at an initial note conversion price equal to 94.0 of the 10-day VWAP ending the business day preceding execution of the
Convertible Notes, subject to a reset note conversion price equal to 94.0 of 10-day VWAP ending on the thirtieth (30th) day after the
effective date of the registration statement registering the common stock underlying the Convertible Notes. In the event Calidi completes
a financing (i) of at least 8 million in an offering registered with the SEC; or (ii) of at least 2 million with a non-affiliated purchaser
at an effective price of at least 150.0 of the initial note conversion price, then the Convertible Notes will be subject to mandatory
conversion at the lower of the initial note conversion price and reset note conversion price. 

On
April 14, 2024, the 1.5 million convertible note agreement was amended to include a mandatory prepayment of the entire convertible note
upon the closing of a public offering of Calidi s securities registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission in which Holder
participates in an amount equal to the principal amount of the convertible note. All other terms and conditions remained substantially
unchanged. 

On
April 19, 2024, the 1.5 million convertible note was paid in full upon the closing of a public offering by Calidi, in which the Holder
participated in an amount equal to the principal amount of the convertible note. As of that date, the convertible note was no longer
outstanding. 

55

Funding
Requirements 

We
expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we continue our research and development,
initiate clinical trials, and seek marketing approval for our current and any of our future product candidates. In addition, if we obtain
marketing approval for any of our current or our future product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses
related to product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution, which costs we may seek to offset through entry into collaboration
agreements with third parties. Furthermore, we expect to continue to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company.
Accordingly, we will need to obtain substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations. If we are unable to
raise capital when needed or on acceptable terms, we would be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs
or future commercialization efforts. 

Based
on our current operating plan, available cash and additional access to capital discussed above under the Liquidity and
Capital Resources section, we believe we do not have sufficient cash on hand to support current operations for at least
one year from the date of issuance of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2024 appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. Based on our existing cash and cash equivalents as of
November 8, 2024, we will need to raise substantial additional capital to finance our operations, which cannot be assured. We have concluded that this
circumstance raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for at least one year from the date that our
aforementioned unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements were issued. See Note 1 to our unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-Q for additional information on our assessment. 

Our
future capital requirements will depend on a number of factors, including: 

the
 costs of conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials; 

the
 costs of manufacturing; 

62 

the
 scope, progress, results and costs of discovery, preclinical and clinical development, laboratory testing, and clinical trials for
 product candidates we may develop, if any; 

the
 costs, timing, and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates; 

our
 ability to establish and maintain collaborations on favorable terms, if at all; 

the
 achievement of milestones or occurrence of other developments that trigger payments under any license or collaboration agreements
 we might have at such time; 

the
 costs and timing of future commercialization activities, including product sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution, for
 any of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval; 

the
 amount of revenue, if any, received from commercial sales of our product candidates, should any of our product candidates receive
 marketing approval; 

the
 costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, obtaining, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights,
 and defending intellectual property-related claims; 

our
 headcount growth and associated costs as we expand our business operations and research and development activities; 

the
 continuing impacts of the recent COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical conflicts; and 

the
 costs of operating as a public company. 

Our
existing cash will not be sufficient to complete development of CLD-101 and CLD-201. Accordingly, we will be required to obtain further
funding to achieve our business objectives. 

Until
such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of public
or private equity offerings and debt financings or other sources, such as potential collaboration agreements, strategic alliances and
licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, ownership
interests may be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that could adversely affect
the rights as a common stockholder. Additional debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include restrictive covenants
that limit our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends,
that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. If we raise funds through potential collaborations, strategic alliances
or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams,
research programs or product candidates, or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional
funds when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts
or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves. 

Critical
Accounting Estimates 

The
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation
of our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts
of assets, liabilities and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We review our estimates on an ongoing
basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances,
the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ
from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

Our
significant accounting policies and estimates are described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. The accounting estimates that are most critical to a full understanding
and evaluation of our reported financial results are described in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations in Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. There were no material
changes to our critical accounting estimates during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We
did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined under SEC rules. 

We
enter into agreements in the normal course of business with vendors for preclinical and clinical studies, preclinical and clinical supply
and manufacturing services, professional consultants for expert advice, and other vendors for other services for operating purposes.
These contracts do not contain any minimum purchase commitments and are cancelable at any time by us, generally upon 30 days prior written
notice, and therefore we believe that our non-cancelable obligations under these agreements are not material. 

In
addition, we have entered into license and royalty agreements for intellectual property with certain parties. Such arrangements require
ongoing payments, including payments upon achieving certain development, regulatory and commercial milestones, receipt of sublicense
income, as well as royalties on commercial sales. Payments under these arrangements are expensed as incurred and are recorded as research
and development expenses. We paid amounts under such agreements at the time of execution and pay annual fees. We have not paid any royalties
under these agreements to date. We have not included the annual license fee payments contractual obligations because the license agreements
are cancelable by us and therefore, we believe that our non-cancelable obligations under these agreements are not material. We have not
included potential royalties or milestone obligations because they are contingent upon the occurrence of future events and the timing
and likelihood of such potential obligations are not known with certainty. For further information regarding these agreements and amounts
that could become payable in the future under these agreements, please see the section entitled Business License Agreements 
within our prospectus, dated October 6, 2023, filed with the SEC. 

Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

We
are not currently exposed to significant market risk related to changes in interest rates because we do not have any cash equivalents
or interest-bearing investments at this time. Our debt typically contains a fixed interest rate or is issued to certain lenders, including
related party lenders, with other equity instruments, such as warrants, in lieu of a stated cash interest rate. However, for debt that
we have issued that is variable and fluctuates with changes in interest rates, an immediate one percentage point change in market interest
rates would not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. 

We
are not currently exposed to significant market risk related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates; however, we have employees
and are contracted with and may continue to contract with foreign vendors that are located in Europe, particularly in Germany, where
we operate through our wholly-owned subsidiary, StemVac GmbH. In October 2022, we also formed Calidi Biotherapeutics Australia Pty Ltd,
a wholly-owned subsidiary in Australia, for purposes of operating in that country for a portion of our planned clinical trial activities
for our SNV1 program. Our operations may be subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in the future. 

Inflation
generally affects us by increasing our cost of labor. We do not believe that inflation had a material effect on our business, financial
condition or results of operations during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

Emerging
Growth Company and Smaller Reporting Company Status 

We
are an emerging growth company, EGC ), under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, (the JOBS
Act ). Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an EGC can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section
7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. Thus, an EGC can delay the adoption of certain
accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to avail ourselves of the delayed
adoption of new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, we will be subject to the same requirements to adopt new or revised accounting
standards as private entities. 

64 

As
an EGC, we may also take advantage of certain exemptions and reduced reporting requirements under the JOBS Act. Subject to certain conditions,
as an EGC: 

we
 are presenting only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of related Management s Discussion and Analysis
 of Financial Condition and Results of Operations; 

we
 will avail ourselves of the exemption from providing an auditor s attestation report on our internal control over financial
 reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act; 

we
 will avail ourselves of the exemption from complying with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight
 Board PCAOB ), regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor s report providing additional
 information about the audit and the financial statements, known as the auditor discussion and analysis; 

we
 are providing reduced disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements; and 

we
 will not require nonbinding advisory votes on executive compensation or stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments. 

We
will remain an EGC until the earliest of (i) December 31, 2026, (ii) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross
revenues of 1.235 billion or more, (iii) the date on which we have issued more than 1 billion in non-convertible debt during the previous
rolling three-year period, or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended, (the Exchange Act ). 

We
are also a smaller reporting company, and may continue to be a smaller reporting company after this offering if either
(i) the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than 250 million or (ii) our annual revenue is less than 100 million
during the most recently completed fiscal year and the market value of our stock held by non-affiliates is less than 700 million. 

If
we are a smaller reporting company at the time we cease to be an EGC, we may continue to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements
that are available to smaller reporting companies. Specifically, as a smaller reporting company we may choose to present only the two
most recent fiscal years of audited financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and, similar to EGCs, smaller reporting companies
have reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation. 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements 

Other
than as disclosed in Note 2 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-Q, we do
not expect that any recently issued accounting standards will have a material impact on our financial statements or will otherwise apply
to our operations. 

ITEM
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKS 

We
are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required
under this item.

ITEM
4. Controls and Procedures. 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our
management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered
by this report. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange
Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company
in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods
specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange
Act is accumulated and communicated to Calidi s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers,
or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes
that any disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving
their objectives. Our disclosure controls and procedures have been designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives. 

Based
on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were
effective at a reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2024. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required
by paragraph (d) of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that materially affected,
or were reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 

PART
II OTHER INFORMATION 

Item
1. Legal Proceedings. 

Legal
proceedings 

We
are subject to litigation and contingencies in the ordinary course of its business, including those related to its business, business
transactions, employee-related matters, and other matters. See Item 3-Legal Proceedings to our Form 10-K for the year ended December
31, 2023. Other than the matters discussed below, we are not currently party to any other material legal proceedings that occurred during
the quarter ended September 30, 2024. 

Former
Chief Accounting Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer 

On
May 1, 2024, Tony Kalajian, the Company s prior chief accounting officer and interim chief financial officer, filed a complaint
in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of San Diego against the Company alleging intentional conversion and violation
of Section 158 of the Delaware General Corporations Code due to the Company s failure to remove a restrictive legend from 13,943
shares of the Company s Common Stock. Mr. Kalajian is seeking compensatory damages to be proven at trial, punitive damages and
attorney s fees, and an order requiring removal of the restrictive legend from his share certificates. The Company intends to vigorously
defend itself. 

Item
1A. Risk Factors 

Investing
in our common stock is highly speculative and involves risks. You should carefully consider the additional risk factors below as well
as the risk factors described in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors in our Form 10-K and any updates to those risk factors or
new risk factors contained in any registration statements that we filed or file with the SEC. Certain factors may have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. You should carefully consider the following risks, together with
all of the other information contained in this report and Form 10-K, in the sections titled Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking
Statements and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and our
financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Any of the following risks could
have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, or prospects and could cause the trading price of our
common stock to decline, which would cause you to lose all or part of your investment. Our business, financial condition, operating results,
or prospects could also be harmed by risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material. 

66 

We
have insufficient cash to continue our operations for the next 12 months and our continued operations are dependent on us raising capital
and these conditions give rise to substantial doubt over the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 1.9 million in cash and restricted cash of 0.2 million, an accumulated deficit of
approximately 117.6 million, and a working capital deficit of approximately 9.4 million. We believe that our existing cash and
cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024, and our anticipated expenditures and commitments for the next twelve months, will not
enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for the twelve months from September 30, 2024. Based
on our existing cash and cash equivalents as of November 8, 2024, we believe we have insufficient cash to continue operations
through November 2024, unless we raise additional short-term capital. These conditions give rise to substantial doubt over the
Company s ability to continue as a going concern. We will need to raise additional capital to support our operations and
execute our business plan. We will be required to pursue sources of additional capital through various means, including debt or
equity financings. Newly issued securities may include preferences, superior voting rights, and the issuance of warrants or other
convertible securities that will have additional dilutive effects. Further, the sale of or the perception of the sale of a
substantial number of our common stock by selling securityholders pursuant to a registration statement filed with the SEC will
adversely affect the price of our common stock due to our limited trading volume. In addition, the sale of a substantial number of
our common stock by such selling securityholders will adversely affect the share price that we may obtain in future financings and
may adversely affect our ability to conduct and complete future financings. We cannot assure that additional funds will be available
when needed from any source or, if available, will be available on terms that are acceptable to us and may cause existing
shareholders both book value and ownership dilution. Further, we may incur substantial costs in pursuing future capital and/or
financing, including investment banking fees, legal fees, accounting fees, printing and distribution expenses and other costs. We
may also be required to recognize non-cash expenses in connection with certain securities we may issue, such as convertible notes
and warrants, which will adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. Our ability to obtain needed financing
may be impaired by such factors as the weakness of capital markets, and the fact that we have not been profitable, which could
impact the availability and cost of future financings. If the amount of capital we are able to raise from financing activities is
not sufficient to satisfy our capital needs, we may have to reduce our operations accordingly. 

Sales
and issuances of our common stock or other securities would result in dilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholder and could
cause our share price to fall. 

If
we sell additional shares of our common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities, existing stockholders may be materially
diluted by subsequent sales and new investors could gain rights, preferences, and privileges senior to existing holders of our common
stock. In addition, the resale, or perceived potential resale, of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market
could adversely affect the market price for our common stock We will need to raise capital in order to fund our business objectives.
In addition, pursuant to our obligations under certain registration rights agreements, we have registered on other registration statement
filed with the SEC (1) 2,039,382 shares of common stock, 191,217 warrants to purchase our common stock, and 191,217 shares of common
stock issuable upon exercise of the private warrants; (2) agreed to register 20,000 shares of our common stock and 40,000 shares of common
stock underlying warrants in connection with a settlement agreement with certain physicians related to stock options; and (3) registered
a number of common stock underlying certain Series A, B and C warrants issued in connection with our public offering that closed on April
18, 2024. 

Until
such time that it is no longer effective, the registration statement registering such securities will permit the resale of these shares.
In addition, securityholders may also sell their shares pursuant to an exemption available under the securities laws. The sale of new
securities or the resale, or perceived potential resale, of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could
adversely affect the market price for our common stock and make it more difficult for other shareholders to sell their holdings at times
and prices that they determine are appropriate. 

67 

Our
stockholders are subject to significant dilution upon the occurrence of certain events which could result in a decrease in our stock
price. 

As
of November 7, 2024, we had approximately 12.5 million shares of our common stock reserved or designated for future issuance
upon the exercise of outstanding options or warrants, or upon conversion of our existing convertible note. Future sales of substantial
amounts of our common stock into the public and the issuance of the shares reserved for future issuance, in payment of our term debt,
and/or in exchange for outstanding warrants will be dilutive to our existing stockholders and could result in a decrease in our stock
price. 

Item
2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 

Unregistered
Sales of Equity Securities 

Subscription
Agreement 

Effective
July 28, 2024, we entered into a subscription agreement with an accredited investor and issued 698,812 shares of Common Stock to the
investor on September 26, 2024. 

Settlement
of Liabilities 

On
September 26, 2024, the Company settled a legal settlement by issuing 20,000 shares of Common Stock and settled certain liabilities by
issuing 120,847 shares of Common Stock. 

The
securities described above were issued in reliance upon an exemption from registration pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities
Act or Rule 506 of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act. Each investor acquired such securities for investment purposes
without a view to distribution and had access to information concerning us and our business prospects, as required by the Securities
Act. In addition, there was no general solicitation or advertising for the purchase of our securities. Our securities were sold only
to accredited investors, as defined in the Securities Act with whom we had a direct personal preexisting relationship, and after a thorough
discussion. Each certificate contained a restrictive legend as required by the Securities Act. Finally, our stock transfer agent has
been instructed not to transfer any of such securities, unless such securities are registered for resale or there is an exemption with
respect to their transfer.
