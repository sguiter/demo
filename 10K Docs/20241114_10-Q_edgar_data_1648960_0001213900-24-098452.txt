CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains certain
forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ),
and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). Any statements in this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q about our expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, assumptions or future events or performance are not historical
facts and are forward-looking statements. These statements are often, but not always, made through the use of words or phrases such as
 believe, will, expect, anticipate, estimate, intend, 
 plan and would. For example, statements concerning financial condition, possible or assumed future results
of operations, growth opportunities, industry ranking, plans and objectives of management, markets for our common stock and future management
and organizational structure are all forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance. They involve
known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions that may cause actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements
to differ materially from any results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by any forward-looking statement. 

Any forward-looking statements are qualified in
their entirety by reference to the risk factors discussed throughout our Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with the SEC on March 29,
2024. Some of the risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from estimates or projections
contained in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: 

our business strategies; 

the timing of regulatory submissions; 

our ability to obtain and maintain regulatory approval of our existing product candidates and any other product candidates we may develop, and the labeling under any approval we may obtain; 

risks related to market acceptance of products; 

intellectual property risks; 

risks associated to our reliance on third party organizations; 

our competitive position; 

our industry environment; 

our anticipated financial and operating results, including anticipated sources of revenues; 

assumptions regarding the size of the available market, benefits of our products, product pricing and timing of product launches; 

management s expectation with respect to future acquisitions; 

statements regarding our goals, intentions, plans and expectations, including the introduction of new products and markets; 

our cash needs and financing plans. 

The foregoing list sets forth some, but not all,
of the factors that could affect our ability to achieve results described in any forward-looking statements. You should read this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q and the documents that we reference herein and have filed as exhibits our Annual Report on Form 10-K, completely and
with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from what we expect. You should assume that the information
appearing in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q is accurate as of the date hereof. Because the risk factors referred to in our Annual
Report on Form 10-K, as filed with the SEC on March 29, 2024, could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed
in any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf, you should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements.
Further, any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made, and except as required by law, we undertake no
obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the statement is made or
to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. New factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict which
factors will arise. In addition, we cannot assess the impact of each factor on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination
of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. We qualify all the information
presented in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and particularly our forward-looking statements, by these cautionary statements.

On October 29, 2024 (the Closing Date 
and measurement date), Dragon entered into and closed on a Share Exchange Agreement (the Share Exchange Agreement with
(i) RPM Interactive, Inc., a Florida corporation incorporated on August 23, 2024; and (ii) the shareholders of RPM Interactive. Pursuant
to the Share Exchange Agreement, Dragon acquired of the shares of RPM Interactive in exchange for shares of Dragon s
common stock. RPM Interact is a web publishing company that leverages generative AI systems to offer consumers entertaining gaming apps
and podcasting offerings in the sports, finance, entertainment and politics categories. These shares were valued at , or 
per share, on the measurement date based on recent sales of shares of Dragon s common stock and. Pursuant to ASU 2017-01 and ASC
805, Dragon analyzed the Exchange Agreement and the business of RPM Interactive to determine if Dragon acquired a business or acquired
assets. Other than owning certain in-development software technologies, RPM Interactive had no operations or no employees and was not
considered a business. Based on this analysis, it was determined that Dragon acquired an asset. No goodwill was recorded since the Exchange
Agreement was accounted for as an asset purchase. In accordance with ASC 805, the fair value of the assets acquired is based on either
the fair value of the consideration given or the fair value of the assets acquired, whichever is more clearly evident, and thus, more
reliably measurable. Dragon used the market price of the common shares issued of as the fair value of the assets
acquired since this value was more clearly evident, and thus, more reliable measurable than the fair value of the assets. This acquisition
was treated as an asset acquisition under ASC 805 Business Combinations since RPM Interactive did not meet the definition
of a business under ASC 805. ASC 805 requires the use of the relative fair value method for asset acquisitions to allocate the purchase
price, however, since only a single software asset was acquired, the entire purchase price shall be allocated to this asset. 

Following the sale of Dragon s common stock
and Share Exchange Agreement above, the Company retains approximately ownership of Dragon.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

You should read the following discussion and
analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our unaudited consolidated financial statements and the related
notes appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the audited financial statements and related notes for the year ended
December 31, 2023 included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities Exchange Commission, or SEC. In addition to historical
information, this discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual
results may differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are
not limited to, those identified below, and those discussed in the section titled Risk Factors included elsewhere in this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. All amounts in this report are in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise noted. 

Overview 

We are a blockchain, cybersecurity, and social
media company that not only focuses on protecting privacy on personal devices, but also protects user information after it is shared with
others. We believe that one s right to privacy should not end the moment they click send , and that we all deserve
the same right to privacy online that we enjoy in our own living rooms. Our flagship product, DatChat Messenger Private Social Network,
is a privacy platform and mobile application that gives users the ability to communicate with the privacy and protection they deserve.
Recently, we have expanded our business and product offerings to include the co-development of a mobile-based social and gaming metaverse,
known as Habytat , as well as the development of Museum, a social network and multi-media storage platform for consumers
and enterprises. 

DatChat Messenger Private Social Network 

Our platform allows users to exercise control
over their messages and posts, even after they are sent. Through our application, users can delete messages that they have sent, on their
own device and the recipient s device as well. There is no set time limit within which they must exercise this choice. A user can
elect at any time to delete a message that they previously sent to a recipient s device. 

The application also enables users to hide secret
and encrypted messages behind a cover, which messages can only be unlocked by the recipient and which are automatically destroyed after
a fixed number of views or fixed amount of time. Users can decide how long their messages last on the recipient s device. The application
also includes a screen shot protection system, which makes it virtually impossible for the recipient to screenshot a message or picture
before it gets destroyed. In addition, users can delete entire conversations at any time, making it like the conversation never even happened. 

In addition to the foregoing, the application
also provides users with the ability to connect via an encrypted live video chat that also is designed to prevent screenshots or screen
grabs. The application integrates with iMessage, making private messages potentially available to hundreds of millions of users. 

Habytat 

In June 2022, we formed a majority owned subsidiary,
Dragon Interact, Inc. (formerly, SmarterVerse, Inc.) Dragon ). In August 2022, we launched the Habytat , a
virtual space that blends real world and virtual realities into one, in real time, using emerging technology like virtual and augmented
reality, to create a highly immersive 3D environment. Habytat is supported by proprietary artificial intelligence AI and
utilizes a machine learning engine to develop more realistic looking content, daily rewards, games, and new utilities that are designed
to further enhance the user experience in an engaging way. Our goal is to leverage our patents and develop new technology that leads to
more people joining and seeing the value in the metaverse. Currently, the development agreement is not active. 

Each Habytat user is granted user rights to use
a designated piece of virtual property in Geniuz City, the first world within Habytat, through the minting and issuance of a unique NFT.
Geniuz City is designed to be a near photo-realistic world based on Miami s Wynwood arts district and its surrounding areas. Geniuz
City enables users to visit art galleries, explore the town, interact with other users, take selfies with famous landmarks, customize
their properties and enjoy the culture of Geniuz City. 

Users will be able to customize their virtual
property to represent their personal style and taste. Users will then be able to accumulate reward points when they visit and interact
with such virtual property or invite others to join Habytat, and such rewards can be used to enhance, expand, and improve their virtual
property. The official in-world currency of Habytat is the Nirad, which can be earned through participation on the DatChat
Social Network+ or Habytat and used to upgrade properties and experiences in Habytat. 

25 

Mobile Metaverse 

In May 2023, we launched the open mobile metaverse,
Habytat 1.0, as part of our mission to democratize access to the metaverse. We hope that by making Habytat available via mobile devices
and offering free ownership of virtual land and homes, that Habytat will break down obstacles that previously limited participation, such
as the necessity for expensive virtual reality VR gear or metaverse properties. We have assembled a team of over twenty
game developers, graphic artists and back-end developers to create Habytat 1.0. 

HabyPets 

In August 2023, we launched a series of novel
AI-powered pets called HabyPets. HabyPets provides an interactive experience within the Habytat world, creating a more immersive
and personal experience for users. Supported by Habytat s proprietary AI and machine learning engine, HabyPets grow over time from
playful companions to mature adult pets. Similar to real-life pets, these AI pets can be trained by users via a range of behavioral commands,
replicating the natural progression of real pets over time. These include, but are not limited to, catching frisbees, playing with toys,
engaging in tug of war, and even participating in thrilling races with other pets at the park. By actively engaging with their pets, users
can establish a connection and provide proper care for their virtual companions, fostering a realistic experience within the Habytat metaverse. 

Myseum 

We are currently developing Myseum, 
a platform that will allow users to create a personal museum designed to easily share pictures, videos and documents utilizing planned
features, such as creating instant sharing spaces at family gatherings, time released video messages, multi-tiered social media, and secure
family document storage and sharing. Currently, Myseum is scheduled to launch in the second half of 2024 and will encompass features and
social networking technology designed to unlock and share digital media. 

Spin-off and Name Change 

In January 2024, we announced plans to spin-off
the Habytat platform business into a new standalone public company pursuant to a distribution of the Dragon shares as further discussed
below. As of the date of this Quarterly Report, we currently own approximately 45.5 of Dragon, the entity that owns and operates the
Habytat platform business. This marked a significant step forward in our corporate strategy to reposition the Company as a pureplay social
media ecosystem centered around our Myseum assets. 

In February 2024, Dragon changes its name from
 SmarterVerse, Inc. name to Dragon Interactive Corporation . 

In February 2024, Darin Myman was appointed as
President of Dragon. 

On August 7, 2024, Dragon filed a Certificate
of Amendment with the State of Nevada to change its name from Dragon Interactive Corporation to Dragon Interact,
Inc . 

If the share distribution proceeds, it is currently
contemplated that our shareholders will maintain their current shares in the Company and receive a pro-rata distribution of a portion
of our shares of Dragon. The proposed share distribution remains subject to approval by our board of directors as well as other customary
conditions, including the filing and effectiveness of either a Form S-1 or Form 10 registration statement with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission and obtaining of any other required regulatory approvals. Upon consummation of the proposed distribution, Dragon would
become a standalone public company with plans to list on a national stock exchange. No assurance can be given that the spin-off and/or
the distribution will occur as anticipated or at all. 

Recent Events 

On January 16, 2024, we entered into an underwriting
agreement with EF Hutton LLC, as the representative of the underwriters named therein, relating to an underwritten public offering of
382,972 shares of our common stock and pre-funded warrants to purchase up 590,000 shares of our common stock for net proceeds of approximately
 1.4 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by the Company, which closed
on January 16, 2024. As of the date of this report, this agreement has been terminated.

Basis of Presentation 

The financial statements contained herein have
been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (the U.S. GAAP and the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

Critical Estimates 

This management s discussion and analysis
of financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S.
GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements,
and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported period. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we base our estimates on historical
experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these
estimates if conditions differ from our assumptions. While our significant accounting policies and significant estimates are more fully
described in Note 1 in the Notes to Financial Statements , we believe the following estimates are critical to the process
of making significant judgments and estimates in preparation of our consolidated financial statements. 

Capitalized internal-use software costs 

Costs incurred to develop internal-use software
including Metaverse software development, are expensed as incurred during the preliminary project stage. Internal-use software development
costs are capitalized during the application development stage, which is after: (i) the preliminary project stage is completed; and (ii)
management authorizes and commits to funding the project and it is probable the project will be completed and used to perform the function
intended. Capitalization ceases at the point the software project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use, and after
all substantial testing is completed. Upgrades and enhancements are capitalized if it is probable that those expenditures will result
in additional functionality. Amortization is provided for on a straight-line basis over the expected useful life of the internal-use software
development costs and related upgrades and enhancements. When existing software is replaced with new software, the unamortized costs of
the old software are expensed when the new software is ready for its intended use. Software development costs incurred during the nine
months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were expensed since the Metaverse software development project is in the preliminary project
stage. Such costs are included in research and development costs on the accompanying consolidated statement of operations. 

Variable interest entities 

Pursuant to ASC 810-10-25-22 , an entity
is defined as a VIE if it either lacks sufficient equity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support,
or it is structured such that the holders of the voting rights do not substantively participate in the gains and losses of the entity.
When determining whether an entity that meets the definition of a business qualifies for a scope exception from applying VIE guidance,
the Company considers whether: (i) it has participated significantly in the design of the entity, (ii) it has provided more than half
of the total financial support to the entity, and (iii) substantially all of the activities of the VIE are conducted on its behalf. A
VIE is consolidated by its primary beneficiary, the party that has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the
VIE s economic performance and has the right to receive benefits or the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could be
potentially significant to the VIE. The primary beneficiary assessment must be re-evaluated on an ongoing basis. 

Based on the Company s analysis, on February
14, 2023, Metabizz, LLC, a Florida corporation, and Metabizz SAS, a company incorporated under the laws of Columbia (collectively Metabizz ),
were determined to be VIE entities in accordance with ASC 810-10-25-22 because the equity owners in Metabizz did not have the characteristics
of a controlling financial interest and the initial equity investments in these entities may be or were insufficient to meet or sustain
its operations without additional subordinated financial support from DatChat. The equity owners of Metabizz had only a nominal equity
investment at risk, and the Company absorbed or received a majority of the entity s expected losses or benefits. The Company participated
significantly in the design of Metabizz. The Company provided working capital advances to Metabizz to allow Metabizz to fund its day-to-day
obligations. Substantially all of the activities of Metabizz were conducted for the Company s benefit, as evidenced by the fact
that the operations of Metabizz consisted of development of software and technologies to be used by Dragon and the Company provided working
capital to Metabizz to pay employees and independent contractors to perform the development services on behalf of the Company. Repayment
of the working capital advances is not guaranteed by the equity owner of Metabizz and creditors of Metabizz do not have recourse against
the Company. Accordingly, the Company was required to consolidate the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of Metabizz using the
fair value method. Additionally, the managing partner of Metabizz was also the Chief Innovation Officer of Dragon. Since Metabizz, LLC
and Metabizz SAS were considered VIE s, any noncontrolling interest eliminated in consolidation. In connection with the initial
consolidation of Metabizz, on February 14, 2023 (the initial consolidation date), the Company recorded a gain on initial consolidation
of variable interest entities of 42,737. 

27 

On March 31, 2024, based on the Company s
analysis, the Company deconsolidated Metabizz, LLC and Metabizz SAS. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company ceased
doing business with Metabizz, LLC and Metabizz SAS and will pay technology professionals directly. In connection with the deconsolidation
of Metabizz, LLC and Metabizz SAS, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a gain on deconsolidation of
 107. 

On August 27, 2024, the Company entered into an
Asset Purchase Agreement with the Seller, pursuant to which it acquired from Seller the Assets (See Note 1) in consideration for the transfer
by the Company of 8,000,000 restricted shares of common stock of Dragon Interact, Inc., a majority-owned subsidiary of the Company. Accordingly,
as of September 30, 2024, the Company owns 45.5 of Dragon. On August 27, 2024, based on the Company s analysis, the Company determined
that Dragon met the definition of a VIE under the VIE model, which provides for situations in which control may be demonstrated other
than by the possession of voting rights in Dragon. Based on Company s analysis, the Company continues to have the power to direct
the activities of Dragon that most significantly impact Dragon s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of Dragon
that could potentially be significant to Dragon or the right to receive benefits from Dragon that could potentially be significant to
Dragon. 

Stock-based compensation 

Stock-based compensation is accounted for based
on the requirements of the Share-Based Payment Topic of ASC 718, Compensation Stock Compensation ASC 718 ),
which requires recognition in the financial statements of the cost of employee, non-employee and director services received in exchange
for an award of equity instruments over the period the employee, non-employee or director is required to perform the services in exchange
for the award (presumptively, the vesting period). ASC 718 also requires measurement of the cost of employee, non-employee, and director
services received in exchange for an award based on the grant-date fair value of the award. The fair value of each option granted is estimated
as of the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model, net of actual forfeitures. The fair value is amortized as
compensation cost on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the awards, which is generally the vesting period. The
Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model includes various assumptions, including the fair market value of our common stock, expected
life of stock options, the expected volatility, and the expected risk-free interest rate, among others. These assumptions reflect our
best estimates, but they involve inherent uncertainties based on market conditions generally outside of our control. As a result, if other
assumptions had been used, stock-based compensation expense, as determined in accordance with authoritative guidance, could have been
materially impacted. Furthermore, if we use different assumptions on future grants, stock-based compensation expense could be materially
affected in future periods.

As of September 30, 2024, we had working capital of 4,226,065, including cash of 632,497 and short-term investments of 3,919,697. These
factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for a period of twelve months from the issuance date
of this report. Management cannot provide assurance that we will ultimately achieve profitable operations or become cash flow positive
or raise additional debt and/or equity capital. We are seeking to raise capital through additional debt and/or equity financings to fund
our operations in the future. Although we have historically raised capital from sales of common shares, there is no assurance that it
will be able to continue to do so. If we are unable to raise additional capital or secure additional lending in the near future, management
expects that the Company will need to curtail its operations. These unaudited consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments
related to the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should
we be unable to continue as a going concern. 

On April 3, 2024, Dragon entered into a Securities
Purchase Agreement with an institutional and accredited investor, pursuant to which Dragon agreed to sell an aggregate of 120,000 shares
of Dragon s common stock, par value 0.0001 per share for an aggregate purchase price of 36,000. Following the sale, the Company
retained approximately 71.4 ownership of Dragon. 

On May 31, 2024, Dragon entered into a Securities
Purchase Agreement with an institutional and accredited investor, pursuant to which Dragon agreed to sell an aggregate of 666,660 shares
of Dragon s common stock, par value 0.0001 per share for an aggregate purchase price of 199,998. Following the sale, the Company
retained approximately 70.0 ownership of Dragon. 

During September 2024, Dragon entered into a Securities
Purchase Agreement with investors pursuant to which Dragon agreed to sell an aggregate of 866,666 shares of Dragon s common stock,
par value 0.0001 per share for an aggregate purchase price of 260,000, or 0.30 per share. Following the sale, the Company retains approximately
54.5 ownership of Dragon. 

Our primary uses of cash have been for compensation
and related expenses, fees paid to third parties for professional services, marketing and advertising expenses, and general and administrative
expenses. All funds received have been expended in the furtherance of growing the business. We received funds from the sale of our common
stock and the exercise of warrants. The following trends are reasonably likely to result in changes in our liquidity over the near to
long term: 

An
increase in working capital requirements to finance our current business, 

Cost
of research and development, 

Addition
of administrative, technical and sales personnel as the business grows, and 

The
cost of being a public company.

market risk or credit support to us or engages in leasing, hedging or research and development services with us. 

JOBS Act 

On April 5, 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups
Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act was enacted. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company 
can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised
accounting standards. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards
until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. 

We have chosen to take advantage of the extended
transition periods available to emerging growth companies under the JOBS Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards until
those standards would otherwise apply to private companies provided under the JOBS Act. As a result, our financial statements may not
be comparable to those of companies that comply with public company effective dates for complying with new or revised accounting standards. 

Subject to certain conditions set forth in the
JOBS Act, as an emerging growth company, we intend to rely on certain of these exemptions, including, without limitation,
(i) providing an auditor s attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b)
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, and (ii) complying with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor s report providing additional information
about the audit and the financial statements, known as the auditor discussion and analysis. We will remain an emerging growth company 
until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of 1.235 billion or more; (ii)
the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of our initial public offering, which would be December 31,
2024; (iii) the date on which we have issued more than 1 billion in nonconvertible debt during the previous three years; or (iv) the
date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the SEC. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES
ABOUT MARKET RISK. 

We are a smaller reporting company, 
as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information required by this Item. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures
that are designed to ensure that material information required to be disclosed in our periodic reports filed under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended, or 1934 Act, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s
rules and forms and to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer
and chief financial officer as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. We carried out an evaluation, under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the principal executive officer and the principal financial officer
(principal financial officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined
in Rule 13(a)-15(e) under the 1934 Act, as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on this evaluation, because of the Company s
limited resources and limited number of employees, management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective
as of September 30, 2024. 

33 

Management s Report on Internal Control
Over Financial Reporting 

Our management is responsible for establishing
and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Internal control
over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal
executive officer and principal financial officer, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. All internal control systems, no matter
how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance
with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. 

The ineffectiveness of our internal control over
financial reporting was due to the following material weaknesses which we identified in our internal control over financial reporting: 

We
lack segregation of duties within accounting functions duties as a result of our limited financial resources to support hiring of personnel. 

The
lack of multiples levels of management review on complex business, accounting and financial reporting issues. 

We
have not implemented adequate system and manual controls. 

Remediation Plans 

Management is committed to the remediation of
the material weaknesses described above, as well as the improvement of the Company s overall internal control over financial reporting.
Management plans on implementing actions to remediate the underlying causes of the control deficiencies that gave rise to the material
weaknesses. Remediation efforts include the possible hiring of additional accounting and finance personnel with appropriate expertise
to strengthen overall controls and the establishment of disbursement review and approval processes. The material weaknesses will not be
considered remediated until management designs and implements effective controls that operate for a sufficient period of time and management
has concluded, through testing, that these controls are effective. Our management will monitor the effectiveness of our remediation plan
and will make changes management determines to be appropriate. Until the remediation efforts (including any additional measures management
identifies as necessary) are completed, the material weaknesses described above will continue to exist. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting. 

There have been no changes in our internal control
over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal control over financial reporting. 

Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and
Procedures 

In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls
and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable
assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the
fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls
and procedures relative to their costs.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. 

From time to time, we may become involved in various
lawsuits and legal proceedings, which arise in the ordinary course of business. Litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an
adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm our business. We are currently not aware of any such
legal proceedings or claims that will have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition
or operating results. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. 

Risk factors that affect our business and financial
results are discussed in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2023 as filed with the SEC on March 29, 2024 Annual Report ). Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes
in our risk factors from those previously disclosed in our Annual Report. You should carefully consider the risks described in our Annual
Report, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future results. The risks described in our Annual Report are
not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also
may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and/or operating results. If any of the risks actually occur, our business,
financial condition, and/or results of operations could be negatively affected.
