 SPARK I ACQUISITION CORPORATION NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) or more businesses (the Business Combination ). The Company is not limited to a particular industry or sector for purposes of consummating a Business Combination. The Company is an early stage and emerging growth company and, as such, the Company is subject to all of the risks associated with early stage and emerging growth companies. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had not commenced any operations. All activity for the period from July 12, 2021 (inception) through September 30, 2024 relates to the Company s formation and the initial public offering Initial Public Offering ), which is described below, and since closing of the Initial Public Offering, a search for a business combination candidate. The Company will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion an initial Business Combination, at the earliest. The Company will generate non-operating income in the form of interest income from the proceeds derived from the Initial Public Offering. The Company has selected December 31 as its fiscal year end. The registration statement for the Company s Initial Public Offering was declared effective on September 29, 2023. On October 11, 2023, the Company consummated its Initial Public Offering of units (the Units and, with respect to the Class A ordinary shares included in the Units being offered, the Public Shares ), at per Unit, generating gross proceeds of , which is discussed in Note 3, and the sale of warrants (the Private Placement Warrants at a price of per Private Placement Warrant in private placements to SLG SPAC Fund LLC (the Sponsor that closed simultaneously with the Initial Public Offering. The Company incurred offering costs of , including underwriting fees of , deferred underwriting fees of (see Note 5) and other costs of . On October 10, 2023, the underwriter informed the Company that it will not be exercising the over-allotment option. As a result, the Sponsor forfeited an aggregate of Class B ordinary shares of the Company, par value per share. Such forfeited shares were cancelled by the Company prior to the consummation of the Initial Public Offering. The Company s management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating a Business Combination. The stock exchange listing rules require that the Business Combination must be with one or more operating businesses or assets with a fair market value equal to at least of the assets held in the Trust Account (as defined below) (excluding the amount of deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the income earned on the Trust Account). The Company will only complete a Business Combination if the post-Business Combination company owns or acquires or more of the issued and outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target business sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act ). There is no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully effect a Business Combination. Upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering, management has agreed that per Unit sold in the Initial Public Offering, including proceeds of the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, will be held in a trust account (the Trust Account and invested in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act, with a maturity of 185 days or less, or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund investing solely in U.S. Treasuries and meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act, as determined by the Company, until the earlier of (i) the completion of a Business Combination and (ii) the distribution of the funds in the Trust Account to the Company s shareholders, as described below.

 per Public Share, plus any pro rata interest then in the Trust Account, net of taxes payable). There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of a Business Combination with respect to the Company s warrants. The Public Shares subject to redemption will be recorded at a redemption value and classified as temporary equity upon the completion of the Initial Public Offering in accordance with the Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 480 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity . The Company will not redeem Public Shares in an amount that would cause its net tangible assets to be less than (so that it does not then become subject to the SEC s penny stock rules) or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement that may be contained in the agreement relating to the Business Combination. If the Company seeks shareholder approval of the Business Combination, the Company will proceed with a Business Combination only if the Company receives an ordinary resolution under Cayman Islands law approving a Business Combination, which requires a resolution be passed by a majority of the holders of ordinary shares as, being entitled to do so, vote in person or by proxy at a general meeting of the Company, or such other vote as required by law or stock exchange rule. If a shareholder vote is not required and the Company does not decide to hold a shareholder vote for business or other legal reasons, the Company will, pursuant to its Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association, conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ), and file tender offer documents containing substantially the same information as would be included in a proxy statement with the SEC prior to completing a Business Combination. If the Company seeks shareholder approval in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor has agreed to vote its Founder Shares (as defined in Note 5) and any Public Shares purchased during or after the Initial Public Offering in favor of approving a Business Combination. Additionally, each Public Shareholder may elect to redeem their Public Shares, without voting, and if they do vote, irrespective of whether they vote for or against an initial Business Combination. Additionally, each Public Shareholder may elect to redeem their Public Shares without voting, and if they do vote, irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company seeks shareholder approval of the Business Combination and the Company does not conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, a Public Shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a group (as defined under Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of of the Public Shares without the Company s prior written consent. The Sponsor has agreed (a) to waive its redemption rights with respect to any Founder Shares and Public Shares held by it in connection with the completion of a Business Combination and (b) not to propose an amendment to the Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association (i) to modify the substance or timing of the Company s obligation to allow redemption in connection with the Company s initial Business Combination or to redeem of the Public Shares if the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period (as defined below) or (ii) with respect to any other provision relating to shareholders rights or pre-initial business combination activity, unless the Company provides the Public Shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their Public Shares upon approval of any such amendment. If the Company has not completed a Business Combination within 21 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering (the Combination Period ), or the Company will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem of the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, if any (less up to of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then issued and outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish the rights of the Public Shareholders as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the Company s remaining Public Shareholders and its Board of Directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case to the Company s obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to the Company s warrants, which will expire worthless if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period.

Table of Contents). In order to protect the amounts held in the Trust Account, the Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to the Company if and to the extent any claims by a third party (other than the Company s independent registered public accounting firm) for services rendered or products sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below the lesser of (i) per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account, if less than per share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, less taxes payable, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party or prospective target business who executed a waiver of any and all rights to the monies held in the Trust Account (whether or not such waiver is enforceable) nor will it apply to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of this offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. However, the Company has not asked the Sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor have it independently verified whether the Sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and we believe that the Sponsor s only assets are securities of the Company. Therefore, the Company cannot assure that the Sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. As a result, if any such claims were successfully made against the Trust Account, the funds available for the Company s initial business combination and redemptions could be reduced to less than per public share. In such event, the Company may not be able to complete its initial business combination, and the investors would receive such lesser amount per share in connection with any redemption of their public shares. None of the Company s officers or directors will indemnify the Company for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of September 30, 2024, the Company had in its operating bank account and a working capital deficit of . Subsequent to the consummation of the Initial Public Offering, the Company s liquidity has been satisfied through the net proceeds from the consummation of the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement held outside of the Trust Account. In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor, or certain of the Company s officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, provide the Company Working Capital Loans (as defined in Note 4). However, the Company has future obligations to management, consultants, and directors that will likely extinguish the cash balance within approximately a year from the filing date of the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. In connection with the Company s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board s FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 205-40, Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern, the Company was formed for the purpose of completing a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities on or before July 11, 2025. There is no assurance that the Company will obtain the necessary approvals or raise the additional capital it needs to fund its business operations and complete any business combination prior to July 11, 2025, if at all. The Company also has no approved plan in place to extend the business combination deadline beyond July 11, 2025, and lacks the capital resources needed to fund operations and complete any business combination, even if the deadline to complete a business combination is extended to a later date. Management has determined that the liquidity condition and timing of liquidation raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for the next twelve months from the issuance of these financial statements. No adjustments have been made to the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities. The Company s Sponsor, officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds from time to time or at any time, in whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion, to meet the Company s working capital. Risks and Uncertainties Management is currently evaluating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and has concluded that while it is reasonably possible that the virus could have a negative effect on the Company s financial position and/or search for a target company, the specific impact is not readily determinable as of the date of these financial statements. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

 Class A ordinary shares sold as part of the Units in the Public Offering contain a redemption feature which allows for the redemption of such Public Shares in connection with the Company s liquidation, if there is a shareholder vote or tender offer in connection with the Business Combination and in connection with certain amendments to the Company s amended and restated certificate of incorporation. In accordance with ASC 480, conditionally redeemable Class A ordinary shares (including shares of Class A ordinary shares that feature redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within the Company s control) are classified as temporary equity. Ordinary liquidation events, which involve the redemption and liquidation of all of the entity s equity instruments, are excluded from the provisions of ASC 480. Although the Company did not specify a maximum redemption threshold, its charter provides that currently, the Company will not redeem its public shares in an amount that would cause its net tangible assets (shareholders equity) to be less than . Accordingly, at September 30, 2024 and 2023, the and , respectively, Class A ordinary shares

The deferred fee will become payable to the underwriters from the amounts held in the Trust Account solely in the event that the Company completes a Business Combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement. Forward Purchase Agreement SparkLabs Group Management, LLC forward purchaser ), an accredited institutional investor affiliated with the Sponsor, has entered into a forward purchase agreement with the Company that provides for the purchase by the forward purchaser of forward purchase units for an aggregate purchase price of at least in a private placement to close concurrently with the closing of our initial business combination. The forward purchaser may purchase less than worth of forward purchase units in accordance with the terms of the forward purchase agreement. In addition, the forward purchaser may terminate its commitment under the forward purchase agreement at any time before the closing of the Company s initial business combination. Accordingly, if the forward purchaser exercises its right to terminate its commitment to purchase any forward purchase securities, the Company will not receive any of the amount of proceeds under the forward purchase agreement and all of the Class B ordinary shares will then be forfeited prior to the closing of the Company s initial business combination. The obligations under the forward purchase agreement will not depend on whether any Class A ordinary shares are redeemed by the Public Shareholders. The forward purchase shares will be identical to the shares of Class A ordinary shares included in the Units being sold in the Initial Public Offering, except that they will be subject to transfer restrictions and registration rights. preference shares with a par value of per share with such designations, voting and other rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by the Company s board of directors.

 Class B ordinary shares with a par value of per share. Holders of Class B ordinary shares are entitled to vote for each share. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were shares of Class B ordinary shares issued and outstanding, up to of which are subject to forfeiture immediately prior to the closing of our initial business combination depending on the amount of the proceeds received under the forward purchase agreement described below or in the event of our liquidation and subsequent dissolution. Only holders of the Class B ordinary shares will have the right to vote on the election of directors prior to the Business Combination. Holders of ordinary shares, holders of Class A ordinary shares and holders of Class B ordinary shares will vote together as a single class on all matters submitted to a vote of our shareholders except as otherwise required by law. In connection with our initial business combination, we may enter into a shareholders agreement or other arrangements with the shareholders of the target or other investors to provide for voting or other corporate governance arrangements that differ from those in effect upon completion of the Initial Public Offering. The Founder Shares are designated as Class B ordinary shares and will automatically convert into Class A ordinary shares (which such Class A ordinary shares delivered upon conversion will not have redemption rights or be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account if we do not consummate an initial business combination) at the time of our initial business combination or earlier at the option of the holders thereof at a ratio such that the number of Class A ordinary shares issuable upon conversion of all founder shares will equal, in the aggregate, on an as-converted basis, at most of the sum of (i) the total number of ordinary shares issued and outstanding upon completion of the Initial Public Offering, plus (ii) the total converted Class A ordinary shares to be sold pursuant to the forward purchase agreement. In no event will the Class B ordinary shares convert into Class A ordinary shares at a rate of less than one-to-one. warrants outstanding as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 which consists of private and public warrants. Public Warrants may only be exercised for a whole number of shares. fractional warrants will be issued upon separation of the Units and only whole warrants will trade. The Public Warrants will become exercisable on the later of (a) days after the completion of a Business Combination and (b) months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering. The Public Warrants will expire after the completion of a Business Combination or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. The Company will not be obligated to deliver any shares of Class A ordinary share pursuant to the exercise of a warrant and will have no obligation to settle such warrant exercise unless a registration statement under the Securities Act covering the issuance of the shares of Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants is then effective and a current prospectus relating to those shares of Class A ordinary shares is available, subject to the Company satisfying its obligations with respect to registration, or a valid exemption from registration is available. warrant will be exercisable for cash or on a cashless basis, and the Company will not be obligated to issue any shares to holders seeking to exercise their warrants, unless the issuance of the shares upon such exercise is registered or qualified under the securities laws of the state of residence of the exercising holder, or an exemption from registration is available. The Company has agreed that as soon as practicable, but in no event later than business days after the closing of a Business Combination, the Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to file, and within business days following a Business Combination to have declared effective, a registration statement covering the issuance of the shares of Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants and to maintain a current prospectus relating to those shares of Class A ordinary shares until the warrants expire or are redeemed. Notwithstanding the above, if the Class A ordinary share is at the time of any exercise of a warrant not listed on a national securities exchange such that it satisfies the definition of a covered security under Section 18(b)(1) of the Securities Act, the Company may, at its option, require holders of Public Warrants who exercise their warrants to do so on a cashless basis in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act and, in the event the Company so elects, the Company will not be required to file or maintain in effect a registration statement, but will use its commercially reasonable efforts to register or qualify the shares under applicable blue sky laws to the extent an exemption is not available.

 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganization, recapitalizations and the like) for any trading days within a - trading day period ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the Company sends the notice of redemption to warrant holders. 
 If and when the warrants become redeemable by the Company, the Company may exercise its redemption right even if it is unable to register or qualify the underlying securities for sale under all applicable state securities laws. In addition, if (x) the Company issue additional Class A ordinary shares or equity-linked securities for capital raising purposes in connection with the closing of its initial business combination at a Newly Issued Price of less than per Class A ordinary share (with such issue price or effective issue price to be determined in good faith by its board of directors and, in the case of any such issuance to the Sponsor or its affiliates, without taking into account any founder shares held by the Sponsor or such affiliates, as applicable, prior to such issuance), (y) the aggregate gross proceeds from such issuances represent more than of the total equity proceeds, and interest thereon, available for the funding of its initial business combination on the date of the completion of its initial business combination (net of redemptions), and (z) the Market Value is below per share, then the exercise price of the warrants will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to of the greater of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price, and the per share redemption trigger price described above will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to of the greater of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price. The Private Placement Warrants will be identical to the Public Warrants underlying the Units being sold in the Initial Public Offering, except that the Private Placement Warrants and the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon the exercise of the Private Placement Warrants will not be transferable, assignable or saleable until 30 days after the completion of a Business Combination, subject to certain limited exceptions. 1 In accordance with the Company s investment management trust agreement, investments held in trust consist only of money market mutual funds invested solely in direct U.S. treasury obligations, which is considered a Level 1 measurement. The Company uses inputs such as actual trade data, benchmark yields, quoted market prices from dealers or brokers, and other similar sources to determine the fair value of its investments. Transfers to/from Levels 1, 2, and 3 are recognized at the beginning of the reporting period. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, there were transfers into or out of Level 3 .

Except as expressly required by applicable securities law, the Company disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Overview We are a blank check company incorporated on July 12, 2021, as a Cayman Islands exempted company for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar combination with one or more businesses or assets, which we refer to throughout this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as our Business Combination. To date, our efforts have been limited to organizational activities and activities related to the search for a target business for our initial business combination. We have generated no revenues to date, and we do not expect that we will generate operating revenues at the earliest until we consummate our initial business combination. Since our initial public offering (the Initial Public Offering ), we have completed a detailed assessment of SparkLabs Group ecosystem companies, and have finalized initial targets to prioritize. We are currently having substantive discussions with multiple prioritized targets and are working to having non-binding letters of intent signed with all prioritized targets, with the goal of executing a binding business combination agreement with a final target as efficiently as practicable. We intend to utilize cash derived from the proceeds of our Initial Public Offering and the private placement warrants (the Private Placement Warrants ), our securities, debt or a combination of cash, securities and debt, in effecting our initial Business Combination. We expect to continue to incur significant costs in the pursuit of our acquisition plans. We cannot assure you that our plans to complete a Business Combination will be successful. Results of Operations We have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenues to date. Our only activities from July 12, 2021 (inception) through September 30, 2024 were organizational activities and those necessary to prepare for the Initial Public Offering, described below, and subsequent to the Initial Public Offering, identifying a target company for an initial Business Combination. We do not expect to generate any operating revenues until after the completion of our Business Combination. We generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on marketable securities held in our trust account (the Trust Account ). We incur expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had net income of 901,986, which consists of operating expenses of 142,271 and administration and consulting fees related party of 312,350 offset by the interest earned on investments held in the Trust Account of 1,356,606 and operating account interest income of 1.

Table of Contents 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had net income of 2,543,207, which consists of operating expenses of 515,714 and administration and consulting fees related party of 965,030, offset by the interest earned on investments held in the Trust Account of 4,023,947 and operating account interest income of 4. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, we had net loss of 448,131, which consists of operating expenses of 373,416 and administration and consulting fees related party of 74,715. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we had net loss of 1,244,541, which consists of operating expenses of 1,101,236 and administration and consulting fees related party of 143,305. Liquidity, Capital Resources and Going Concern On October 11, 2023, we consummated our Initial Public Offering of 10,000,000 units (the Units ). Each Unit consists of one Class A ordinary share, par value 0.0001 and one-half of one redeemable warrant (the Public Warrants ), with each Public Warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one Class A ordinary share for 11.50 per share, subject to adjustment, beginning 30 days after the completion of the Company s initial Business Combination. We granted Cantor Fitzgerald Co., as representative of the underwriters Cantor ), a 45-day option to purchase up to 1,500,000 additional Units to cover over-allotments. Subsequently, On October 10, 2023, Cantor informed the Company that it will not be exercising the over-allotment option. As a result, the Sponsor forfeited an aggregate of 448,052 Class B ordinary shares. Such forfeited shares were cancelled by the Company prior to the consummation of the Initial Public Offering. Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, we consummated a private placement (the Private Placement with our Sponsor, who purchased 8,490,535 Private Placement Warrants, generating total proceeds of 8,490,535. The terms of the Private Placement Warrants are identical to the Public Warrants, except that, for so long as the Private Placement Warrants are held by the Sponsor or their permitted transferees, the Private Placement Warrants (i) may not (including the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the Private Placement Warrants), subject to certain limited exceptions, be transferred, assigned or sold until 30 days after the completion of the Company s initial Business Combination, and (ii) are entitled to registration rights. The Private Placement Warrants will be worthless if the Company does not complete an initial Business Combination. A total of 100,500,000 10.05 per Unit, which amount includes 3,500,000 of the underwriters deferred discount) of the net proceeds from the sale of Units in the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placements on October 11, 2023 was placed in a trust account maintained for the benefit of the public shareholders at Continental Stock Transfer Trust Company, as a trustee and was invested only in U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and that invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held in the trust account that may be released to the Company to pay its taxes and up to 100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses, the funds held in the trust account will not be released from the trust account until the earliest of (i) the completion of the Company s initial Business Combination, (ii) the redemption of the Class A ordinary shares included in the Units sold in the Initial Public Offering if we are unable to complete our initial Business Combination by July 11, 2025, subject to applicable law or (iii) the redemption of any of the public shares properly submitted in connection with a shareholder vote to amend the Company s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to allow redemption in connection with its initial Business Combination or to redeem 100 of its public shares if it has not consummated an initial Business Combination by July 11, 2025 or (B) with respect to any other material provisions relating to shareholders rights or pre-initial Business Combination activity. As of September 30, 2024, we had 82,760 in our operating bank account, 105,701,457 in the Trust Account and working capital deficit of 251,453. Subsequent to the consummation of the Initial Public Offering, our liquidity has been satisfied through the net proceeds from the consummation of the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement held outside of our trust account. In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor, or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, provide us working capital loans. In connection with the Company s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board s FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 205-40, Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern, the Company was formed for the purpose of completing a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities on or before July 11, 2025. There is no assurance that the Company will obtain the necessary approvals or raise the additional capital it needs to fund its business operations and complete 

 18 

Table of Contents 
 any business combination prior to July 11, 2025, if at all. The Company also has no approved plan in place to extend the business combination deadline beyond July 11, 2025, and lacks the capital resources needed to fund operations and complete any business combination, even if the deadline to complete a business combination is extended to a later date. Management has determined that the liquidity condition and timing of liquidation raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for the next twelve months from the issuance of these financial statements. No adjustments have been made to the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities. The Company s Sponsor, officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds from time to time or at any time, in whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion, to meet the Company s working capital. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We had no obligations, assets or liabilities, which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2024. We do not participate in transactions that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. We have not entered into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities, or purchased any non-financial assets. Contractual Obligations We do not have any long-term debt, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or long-term liabilities, other than an agreement to pay an aggregate of 77,500 per month to our management team for their services. We began incurring these fees on May 1, 2021, and will continue to incur these fees monthly until the earlier of the completion of the Business Combination and our liquidation. The underwriters are entitled to a deferred underwriting commission of 3.5 per unit or 3,500,000 in the aggregate of the gross proceeds of the Initial Public Offering held in the Trust Account upon the completion of our initial Business Combination subject to the terms of the underwriting commission. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of condensed financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have identified the following critical accounting policies. We have identified the following critical accounting policies: Net Loss per Share Net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period, excluding 3,435,065 Class A ordinary shares subject to forfeiture. Weighted average shares were reduced for the effect of an aggregate of 3,435,065 Class A ordinary shares that were subject to forfeiture depending on the amount of the proceeds received under the forward purchase agreement described below or in the event of our winding up and subsequent dissolution. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company did not have any dilutive securities and other contracts that could, potentially, be exercised or converted into ordinary shares and then share in the earnings of the Company. As a result, diluted loss per share is the same as basic loss per share for the periods presented. Recent Accounting Standards Other than discussed below, management does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the Company s financial statements. In August 2020, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU No. 2020-06, Debt Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging Contracts in Entity s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity s Own Equity ASU 2020-06 ), which simplifies accounting for convertible instruments by removing major separation models required under current GAAP. The ASU also removes certain settlement conditions that are required for equity- linked contracts to qualify for the derivative scope exception, and it simplifies the diluted earnings per share calculation in certain areas. The amendments are effective for smaller reporting companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after 

 19 

Table of Contents 
 December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently assessing what impact, if any, that ASU 2020-06 would have on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which requires disaggregated information about a reporting entity s effective tax rate reconciliation, as well as information related to income taxes paid to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures. This ASU will be effective for the annual period ending December 31, 2025. The Company is currently assessing what impact, if any, that ASU 2023-09 would have on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information otherwise required under this item. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer have concluded that during the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level and, accordingly, provided reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the third quarter of 2024 covered by this Quarterly Report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II - OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings None. Item 1A. Risk Factors Factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in this Quarterly Report are any of the risks described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Any of these factors could result in a significant or material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Additional risk factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business or results of operations. As of the date of this Quarterly Report, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC. We may disclose changes to such factors or disclose additional factors from time to time in our future filings with the SEC. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. On October 11, 2023, we consummated the Initial Public Offering of 10,000,000 Units, at 10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of 100,000,000. Each Unit consists of one Class A ordinary share, and one-half of one redeemable warrant. Each whole Public warrant entitles the holder to purchase one Class A ordinary share at a price of 11.50 per share, subject to adjustment. Each Public Warrant will become exercisable 30 days after the completion of the initial Business Combination and will expire five years after the completion of the initial Business Combination, or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Sponsor purchased an aggregate of 8,490,535 Private Placement Warrants, each exercisable to purchase one Class A ordinary share at 11.50 per share, at a price of 1.00 per Private Placement Warrant, or 8,490,535 in the aggregate, in a private placement. We incurred transaction costs amounting to 6,590,678 consisting of 2,000,000 of cash underwriting discount, 3,500,000 of deferred underwriting fees, and 1,090,678 of other offering costs. After deducting the underwriting fees (excluding the deferred portion of 3,500,000, which amount will be payable upon consummation of our initial Business Combination, if consummated) and the offering expenses, the total net proceeds from the Initial Public Offering and the private placement was 105,399,857, of which 100,500,000 was placed in the Trust Account. For a description of the use of the proceeds generated in the Initial Public Offering, see Part I, Item 2 of this Quarterly Report. Item 3. Defaults upon Senior Securities None. Item 4.
