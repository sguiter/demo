producing 
mine complexes 
(Buchanan 
and Logan), 

100 -owned 
 idled mine complex (Greenbrier) and 

development properties (Mon Valley 
and Russell County). 

 The Company operates its 
business along 

reportable segments: Australia 
and the U.S. The 
organization of 
 the 

reportable segments 
reflects how 
the Company s 
chief operating 
decision maker, 
or CODM, 
manages 
 and allocates resources to the various components of the 
Company s business. 
 The CODM 
uses Adjusted 
EBITDA as 
the primary 
metric to 
measure each 
segment s 
operating performance. 
 Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of financial performance in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 
Investors should be 
 aware that 
the Company s 
presentation of 
Adjusted EBITDA 
may not 
be comparable 
to similarly 
titled financial 
 measures used by other companies. 

 Adjusted EBITDA is 
defined as earnings 
before interest, taxes, 
depreciation, depletion and 
amortization and other 
 foreign exchange losses. Adjusted EBITDA is 
also adjusted for certain discrete items that 
management exclude 
 in analyzing each 
of the 
Company s segments operating performance. 
 Other and corporate 
relates to additional 
 financial information for 
the corporate function 
such as accounting, 
treasury, legal, human resources, 
compliance, 
 and tax. 
As such, the corporate function is not determined to be a 
reportable segment but is discretely disclosed 
 for purposes of reconciliation to the Company s 
unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Reportable segment 
results as 
of and for 
the three 
and nine 
months ended 
September 30, 
2024 and

 The New Notes were issued

at a rate of 
 
 per annum. Interest on 
the New Notes

October 1 of each year, 
commencing April 1, 2025. 
The New

by the 
Company and 
its wholly-owned 
subsidiaries 
 (other than the Issuer) (subject to certain exceptions and permitted liens) and 
secured by (i) a first-priority lien on 
 substantially all of assets of the Company and each Guarantor (other than accounts receivable and certain other 
 rights to payment, inventory, certain investment property,

(ii) a second

the ABL Priority 
Collateral, which is 
junior to a 
first-priority lien 
 for the benefit of the lenders and 
other creditors under the Company s asset-based revolving credit facility, dated 
 as of May 8, 2023, or the ABL Facility, 
in each case, subject to certain exceptions and permitted 
liens. 

 The Company used the net proceeds from the New Notes to redeem all of the Company s 
Existing Notes and to 
 pay related 
fees and 
expenses in connection 
with the 
offering of the 
New Notes 
and the 
redemption of 
the Existing 
 Notes, and the Company intends to use the remaining 
net proceeds for general corporate purposes. 
 The terms 
of the 
New Notes

by the 
Indenture. The 
Indenture contains

the 
aggregate 
principal 
amount 
thereof, 
plus 
accrued 
and 
unpaid 
 interest, if any, to, but excluding, the repurchase

 of the 
aggregate principal amount 
thereof, plus accrued 
and unpaid interest, 
if any, 
to, but excluding, 
the 
 repurchase date, following the occurrence of 
a Change of Control, provided that 
the Issuer redeems at least 

of the 
New Notes 
outstanding prior 
to such 
Change of 
Control. Upon 
the occurrence 
of certain 
changes in 
tax 
 law (as described in the Indenture), the Issuer may redeem any of the New Notes at a redemption price equal to 
 
 of the principal amount of the 
New Notes to be redeemed plus accrued 
and unpaid interest, if any, 
to, but 
 excluding, the redemption date. 

 The Issuer may redeem any of 
the New Notes beginning on October 
1, 2026. The initial redemption price 
of the 
 New Notes is 
 
 of their principal amount, 
plus accrued and unpaid interest, 
if any, 
to, but excluding the 
 redemption 
date. 
The 
redemption 
price 
will 
decline 
each 
year 
after October 
1, 
2026, and 
will 
be 
 
 of 
the 
 principal amount of the New Notes, plus accrued and 
unpaid interest, beginning on October 1, 2028. The Issuer 
 may also redeem up to 
 
 of the aggregate principal amount the New Notes on one or more occasions prior to 
 October 1, 2026 at a 
price equal to 
 
 of the principal amount thereof plus 
a make-whole premium, plus 
 accrued and unpaid interest, if any, 
to, but excluding, the redemption date. 

 At any time and from 
time to time on 
or prior to October 
1, 2026, the Issuer 
may redeem in the 
aggregate up to 
 
 of the 
original aggregate principal 
amount of the 
New Notes (calculated 
after giving effect 
to any issuance 
 of 
additional 
New 
Notes) 
with 
the 
net 
cash 
proceeds 
of 
certain 
equity 
offerings, 
at 
a 
redemption 
price 
of 
 
 , plus 
accrued and 
unpaid interest, 
if any, 
to, but 
excluding, the 
redemption date, 
so long 
as at 
least 

of 
the 
aggregate 
principal 
amount 
of 
the 
New 
Notes 
(calculated 
after 
giving 
effect 
to 
any 
issuance 
of 
 additional 
New Notes) 
issued 
under 
the Indenture 
remains 
outstanding 
after 
each 
such 
redemption 
and 
each 
 such redemption occurs within 

days after the date of the closing of such equity 
offering. 
 The 
Indenture 
contains 
customary 
events 
of 
default, 
including 
failure 
to 
make 
required 
payments, 
failure 
to 
 comply with certain agreements 
or covenants, failure to 
pay or acceleration of 
certain other indebtedness, certain 
 events of 
bankruptcy and 
insolvency, and failure to 
pay certain 
judgments. An 
event of 
default under 
the Indenture 
 will allow either the Trustee or the holders 
of at least 
 
 in aggregate principal amount of the then-outstanding 
 New Notes to accelerate, or 
in certain cases, will automatically cause 
the acceleration of, the amounts due 
under 
 the New Notes.

 Stamp duty on Curragh acquisition 
 On September 27, 2022, the Company received from 
the Queensland Revenue Office, or QRO, 
an assessment 
 of the stamp duty 
payable on its 
acquisition of the Curragh 
mine in March 
2018. The QRO assessed 
the stamp 
 duty on this acquisition at an amount of 

million (A 

million) plus unpaid tax interest. On November 23, 
 2022, 
the 
Company 
filed 
an 
objection 
to 
the 
assessment. 
The 
Company s 
objection 
was 
based 
on 
legal 
and 
 valuation advice obtained, which supported an estimated stamp duty 
payable of 

million (A 

million) on 
 the Curragh acquisition. 
 On January 9, 2024, the Company s objection to the 
assessed stamp duty was disallowed by the QRO. 
 As per the Taxation Administration Act (Queensland) 2001, the Company could only appeal or apply for a review 
 of QRO s 
decision if 
it has 
paid the 
total assessed 
stamp duty 
of 

million (A 

million) plus 
unpaid tax 
 interest of 

million (A 

million). The Company had until March 11, 
2024, to file an appeal. 
 On March 6, 2024, 
the Company made an 
additional payment, and 
paid in full, the stamp 
duty assessed by 
the 
 QRO. 

 The Company disputes 
the additional 
amount of assessed 
stamp duty and, 
on March 11, 
2024, filed its 
appeal 
 with the Supreme Court of Queensland. The outcome of the appeal 
remains uncertain. 

 From time to time, the 
Company becomes a 
party to other legal 
proceedings in the 
ordinary course of business 
 in Australia, the U.S. and other countries where the Company does business. 
Based on current information, the 
 Company believes that such other pending 
or threatened proceedings are likely to 
be resolved without a material 
 adverse 
effect 
on 
its 
financial 
condition, 
results 
of 
operations 
or 
cash 
flows. 
In 
management s 
opinion, 
the 
 Company is not currently 
involved in any legal 
proceedings, which individually 
or in the aggregate 
could have a 
 material effect on the financial condition, results of 
operations and/or liquidity of the Company.

three 
and 
nine-month 
periods 
ended 
September 
30, 
2024 
and 
2023, 
the 
 condensed consolidated 
statements of 
stockholders equity 
for the 
three-month periods 
ended March 
31, June 
 30 and September 30, 2024 and 2023, the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the nine-month 
 periods ended 
September 30, 
2024 and 
2023 and the 
related notes (collectively 
referred to as 
the condensed 
 consolidated interim financial 
statements ). Based on our 
reviews, we are 
not aware of 
any material modifications 
 that should be made to the 
condensed consolidated interim financial statements for them to be 
in conformity with 
 U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 

 We 
have 
previously 
audited, 
in 
accordance 
with 
the 
standards 
of 
the 
Public 
Company 
Accounting 
Oversight 
 Board (United States) (PCAOB), the 
consolidated balance sheet of the Company 
as of December 31, 2023, the 
 related consolidated statements 
of operations 
and comprehensive 
income, stockholders' 
equity and cash 
flows 
 for the year then ended, and 
the related notes (not presented herein), and 
in our report dated February 20, 2024, 
 we 
expressed 
an 
unqualified 
audit 
opinion 
on 
those 
consolidated 
financial 
statements. 
In 
our 
opinion, 
the 
 information set 
forth in 
the accompanying 
condensed consolidated 
balance sheet 
as of December 
31, 2023, 
is 
 fairly stated, in all material 
respects, in relation to the consolidated balance 
sheet from which it has been 
derived. 
 Basis for Review Results 

 These financial 
statements 
are the 
responsibility 
of the 
Company's 
management. 
We 
are a 
public accounting 
 firm registered with the PCAOB and are required 
to be independent with respect to the Company 
in accordance 
 with the 
U.S. federal 
securities laws 
and the 
applicable rules 
and regulations 
of the 
SEC and 
the PCAOB. 
We 
 conducted our review 
in accordance with 
the standards of 
the PCAOB. A 
review of interim 
financial statements 
 consists principally 
of applying 
analytical procedures 
and making 
inquiries of 
persons 
responsible for 
financial 
 and accounting matters. 
It is substantially 
less in scope 
than an audit 
conducted in accordance 
with the standards 
 of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as 
 a whole. Accordingly, 
we do not express such an opinion.

 CAUTIONARY NOTICE REGARDING FORWARD 
-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of 
 the Securities Act of 1933, as 
amended, and Section 21E of the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, 
 or the Exchange 
Act, concerning 
our business, 
operations, financial 
performance and 
condition, the 
coal, steel 
 and 
other 
industries, 
as well 
as 
our 
plans, 
objectives 
and 
expectations 
for 
our 
business, 
operations, 
financial 
 performance 
and 
condition. 
Forward-looking 
statements 
may 
be 
identified 
by 
words 
such 
as 
 may, 
 could, 
 believes, 
 estimates, 
 expects, 
 intends, 
 plans, 
 anticipate, 
 forecast, 
 outlook, 
 target, 
 likely, 
 considers and other similar words. 
 Any 
forward-looking 
statements 
involve 
known 
and 
unknown 
risks, 
uncertainties, 
assumptions 
and 
other 
 important factors that 
could cause actual 
results, performance, 
events or outcomes 
to differ 
materially from 
the 
 results, 
performance, 
events 
or 
outcomes 
expressed 
or 
anticipated 
in 
these 
statements, 
many 
of 
which 
are 
 beyond 
our 
control. 
Such 
forward-looking 
statements 
are 
based 
on 
an 
assessment 
of 
present 
economic 
and 
 operating 
conditions 
on 
a 
number 
of 
best 
estimate 
assumptions 
regarding 
future 
events 
and 
actions. 
These 
 factors are difficult to accurately predict and may be beyond our control. Factors that could affect our results, our 
 announced plans, or an investment in our securities include, 
but are not limited to: 

the prices we receive for our coal; 

uncertainty 
in 
global 
economic 
conditions, 
including 
the 
extent, 
duration 
and 
impact 
of 
ongoing 
civil 
 unrest and wars, 
as well as 
risks related to 
government actions with 
respect to trade 
agreements, treaties 
 or policies; 

a 
decrease 
in 
the 
availability 
or 
increase 
in 
costs 
of 
labor, 
key 
supplies, 
capital 
equipment 
or 
 commodities, such 
as diesel 
fuel, steel, 
explosives 
and tires, 
as the 
result of 
inflationary 
pressures 
or 
 otherwise; 

the extensive forms of taxation 
that our mining operations 
are subject to, and future 
tax regulations and 
 developments. 
For 
example, 
the 
amendments 
to 
the 
coal royalty 
regime 
implemented 
in 
2022 
by the 
 Queensland State Government in Australia introducing higher tiers to the coal royalty rates applicable to 
 our Australian Operations; 

concerns about the environmental impacts of coal combustion and greenhouse gas, or GHG emissions, 
 relating 
to 
mining 
activities, 
including 
possible 
impacts 
on global 
climate 
issues, 
which 
could 
result 
in 
 increased 
regulation 
of 
coal 
combustion 
and 
requirements 
to 
reduce 
GHG 
emissions 
in 
many 
 jurisdictions, including federal and state government initiatives to control GHG emissions could increase 
 costs associated with 
coal production 
and consumption, such 
as costs for 
additional controls to 
reduce 
 carbon 
dioxide 
emissions 
or 
costs 
to 
purchase 
emissions 
reduction 
credits 
to 
comply 
with 
future 
 emissions 
trading 
programs, 
which 
could 
significantly 
impact 
our 
financial 
condition 
and 
results 
of 
 operations, affect demand 
for our products 
or our 
securities and reduced 
access to capital 
and insurance;

severe financial hardship, bankruptcy, 
temporary or permanent shut downs or operational 
challenges of 
 one or more of our major 
customers, including customers in the steel industry, key suppliers/contractors, 
 which 
among 
other 
adverse 
effects, 
could 
lead 
to 
reduced 
demand 
for 
our 
coal, 
increased 
difficulty 
 collecting receivables 
and customers 
and/or suppliers 
asserting force 
majeure or 
other reasons 
for not 
 performing their contractual obligations to us; 

our ability to generate sufficient cash to service 
our indebtedness and other obligations; 

our indebtedness and ability to 
comply with the covenants and other 
undertakings under the agreements 
 governing such indebtedness; 

our 
ability 
to 
collect 
payments 
from 
our 
customers 
depending 
on 
their 
creditworthiness, 
contractual 
 performance or otherwise; 

the demand for steel products, which impacts the demand for 
our metallurgical, or Met, coal; 

risks inherent to 
mining operations, 
such as adverse 
weather conditions, could impact the 
amount of coal 
 produced, cause delay or suspend coal deliveries, or 
increase the cost of operating our business; 

the loss of, or significant reduction in, purchases by our 
largest customers; 

risks unique to international mining and trading operations, 
including tariffs and other barriers to trade; 

unfavorable economic and financial market conditions; 

our ability to continue acquiring and developing coal reserves 
that are economically recoverable; 

uncertainties in estimating our economically recoverable coal 
reserves; 

transportation for our coal becoming unavailable or uneconomic 
for our customers; 

the risk 
that we 
may 
be required 
to pay 
for unused 
capacity 
pursuant 
to the 
terms 
of our 
take-or-pay 
 arrangements with rail and port operators; 

our ability to retain key personnel and attract qualified 
personnel; 

any failure to maintain satisfactory labor relations; 

our ability to obtain, renew or maintain permits and consents 
necessary for our operations; 

potential costs or liability under applicable environmental 
laws and regulations, including with respect 
to 
 any 
exposure 
to 
hazardous 
substances 
caused 
by 
our 
operations, 
as 
well 
as 
any 
environmental 
 contamination our properties may have or our operations 
may cause; 

extensive regulation of our mining operations and future 
regulations and developments; 

our 
ability 
to 
provide 
appropriate 
financial 
assurances 
for 
our 
obligations 
under 
applicable 
laws 
and 
 regulations; 

assumptions underlying our asset retirement obligations 
for reclamation and mine closures; 

any cyber-attacks or other security breaches that disrupt 
our operations or result in the dissemination of 
 proprietary or confidential information about us, our customers 
or other third parties; 

the risk that we may not recover our investments in our mining, exploration and other assets, which may 
 require us to recognize impairment charges related to those assets; 

risks related to divestitures and acquisitions; 

the risk that diversity in interpretation and application of accounting principles in the mining industry may 
 impact our reported financial results; and 

other 
risks 
and 
uncertainties 
detailed 
herein,

 We 
make 
many 
of 
our 
forward-looking 
statements 
based 
on 
our 
operating 
budgets 
and 
forecasts, 
which 
are 
 based upon 
detailed assumptions. 
While we 
believe that 
our assumptions 
are reasonable, 
we caution 
that it 
is 
 very difficult to 
predict the impact 
of known factors, 
and it is 
impossible for us 
to anticipate all 
factors that could 
 affect our actual results. 
 See Part I, Item 
1A. Risk Factors 
of our Annual Report 
on Form 10-K for 
the year ended December 
31, 2023, 
 filed with the 
SEC and 
ASX on February 
20, 2024, 
and Part 
II, Item 1A. 
 Risk Factors 
of our Quarterly 
Report 
 on Form 10-Q for 
the quarterly period ended 
June 30, 2024 filed 
with SEC and ASX 
on August 5, 
2024 for a more 
 complete 
discussion 
of 
the 
risks 
and 
uncertainties 
mentioned 
above 
and 
for 
discussion 
of 
other 
risks 
and 
 uncertainties we face that could 
cause actual results to differ materially from 
those expressed or implied by 
these 
 forward-looking statements. 

 All 
forward-looking 
statements 
attributable 
to 
us 
are 
expressly 
qualified 
in 
their 
entirety 
by 
these 
cautionary 
 statements, as well as others 
made in this Quarterly Report on Form 
10-Q and hereafter in our other 
filings with 
 the 
SEC 
and 
public 
communications. 
You 
should 
evaluate 
all 
forward-looking 
statements 
made 
by 
us 
in 
the 
 context of these risks and uncertainties. 
 We caution you that the risks and uncertainties identified by us may not be all of the factors that are important to 
 you. 
You 
should 
not 
interpret 
the 
disclosure 
of 
any 
risk 
to 
imply 
that 
the 
risk 
has 
not 
already 
materialized. 
 Furthermore, the 
forward-looking statements 
included in this 
Quarterly Report 
on Form 10-Q 
are made only 
as 
 of the date 
hereof. We 
undertake no 
obligation to 
publicly update 
or revise 
any forward-looking 
statement as 
a 
 result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except 
as required by applicable law. 
 Results of Operations 
 How We Evaluate Our Operations 
 We 
evaluate 
our 
operations 
based 
on 
the 
volume 
of 
coal 
we 
can 
safely 
produce 
and 
sell 
in 
compliance 
with 
 regulatory 
standards, 
and 
the 
prices 
we 
receive 
for 
our 
coal. 
Our 
sales 
volume 
and 
sales 
prices 
are 
largely 
 dependent upon 
the terms 
of our 
coal sales 
contracts, for 
which prices 
generally are 
set based 
on daily 
index 
 averages, on a quarterly basis or annual fixed price 
contracts. 
 Our management 
uses a 
variety of 
financial and 
operating metrics 
to analyze 
our performance. 
These metrics 
 are significant factors 
in assessing 
our operating results 
and profitability. 
These financial 
and operating metrics 
 include: (i) safety and environmental metrics; (ii) Adjusted EBITDA; (iii) total sales volumes and average realized 
 price 
per 
Mt 
sold, 
which 
we 
define 
as 
total 
coal 
revenues 
divided 
by 
total 
sales 
volume; 
(iv) Met 
coal 
sales 
 volumes and average realized Met price per 
Mt sold, which we define as Met coal 
revenues divided by Met coal 
 sales volume; (v) average 
segment mining costs 
per Mt sold, 
which we define 
as mining costs 
divided by sales 
 volumes (excluding non-produced coal) for the respective segment; (vi) average segment operating costs 
per Mt 
 sold, which we define as segment operating costs divided by sales volumes for the respective segment; and (vii) 
 net cash (or net 
debt), which we define 
as cash and 
cash equivalents (excluding restricted cash) 
less outstanding 
 aggregate principal amount of the Existing Notes and other 
interest-bearing loans. 
 Coal revenues are 
shown in our 
statement of operations 
and comprehensive income 
exclusive of other 
revenues. 
 Generally, export sale contracts for our 
Australian Operations require us 
to bear the 
cost of freight 
from our mines 
 to 
the 
applicable 
outbound 
shipping 
port, 
while 
freight 
costs 
from 
the 
port 
to 
the 
end 
destination 
are 
typically 
 borne by the customer. Sales 
to the export market from our U.S. Operations are 
generally recognized when title 
 to 
the 
coal 
passes 
to 
the 
customer 
at 
the 
mine 
load 
out 
similar 
to 
a 
domestic 
sale. 
For 
our 
domestic 
sales, 
 customers typically bear 
the cost 
of freight. As 
such, freight expenses 
are excluded from 
the cost of 
coal revenues 
 to allow for consistency and comparability 
in evaluating our operating performance. 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures; Other Measures 
 The 
following 
discussion 
of 
our 
results 
includes 
references 
to 
and 
analysis 
of 
Adjusted 
EBITDA, 
Segment 
 Adjusted EBITDA and mining 
costs, which are financial 
measures not recognized in 
accordance with U.S. GAAP. 

 Non-GAAP financial 
measures, including 
Adjusted EBITDA, 
Segment Adjusted 
EBITDA and 
mining costs, 
are 
 used by investors to measure our operating performance. 
 Non-GAAP financial measures are intended to provide additional information only and do not have any standard 
 meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP. 
These measures should not be considered 
in isolation or as a substitute for 
 measures of performance prepared in accordance with 
U.S. GAAP. 
 Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, is defined as earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, depletion and 
 amortization 
and 
other 
foreign 
exchange 
losses. 
Adjusted 
EBITDA 
is 
also 
adjusted 
for 
certain 
discrete 
non-
 recurring items that we exclude in 
analyzing each of our segments 
operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA 
is 
 not intended 
to serve 
as an 
alternative to 
U.S. GAAP measures 
of performance 
including total 
revenues, total

27 
 costs and expenses, 
net income or 
cash flows from 
operating activities as 
those terms are 
defined by U.S. 
GAAP. 
 Adjusted EBITDA may 
therefore not be 
comparable to 
similarly titled measures 
presented by other 
companies. 
 A reconciliation of 
Adjusted EBITDA to 
its most 
directly comparable measure 
under U.S. GAAP is 
included below. 

 Segment 
Adjusted 
EBITDA 
is 
defined 
as 
Adjusted 
EBITDA 
by 
operating 
and 
reporting 
segment, 
adjusted 
for 
 certain 
transactions, 
eliminations 
or 
adjustments 
that 
our 
CODM 
does 
not 
consider 
for 
making 
decisions 
to 
 allocate resources among segments or assessing segment performance. 
Segment Adjusted EBITDA is used as 
 a supplemental 
financial measure 
by management 
and by 
external users 
of our 
financial statements, 
such 
as 
 investors, industry analysts and lenders, to assess the operating 
performance of the business. 
 Mining costs, a 
non-GAAP measure, is 
based on 
reported cost of 
coal revenues, which 
is shown 
on our 
statement 
 of 
operations 
and 
comprehensive 
income 
exclusive 
of 
freight 
expense, 
Stanwell 
rebate, 
other 
royalties, 
 depreciation, 
depletion 
and 
amortization, 
and selling, 
general and 
administrative 
expenses, 
adjusted for 
other 
 items that do not relate directly to the costs incurred to produce coal at a mine. Mining costs excludes these cost 
 components as 
our CODM 
does not 
view these 
costs as 
directly attributabl 
e 
to the 
production of 
coal. Mining 
 costs 
is 
used 
as 
a 
supplemental 
financial 
measure 
by 
management, 
providing 
an 
accurate 
view 
of 
the 
costs 
 directly 
attributable 
to 
the 
production 
of 
coal 
at 
our 
mining 
segments, 
and 
by 
external 
users 
of 
our 
financial 
 statements, such as 
investors, industry analysts and 
ratings agencies, to assess 
our mine operating 
performance 
 in comparison to the mine operating performance of other 
companies in the coal industry. 
 About Coronado Global Resources Inc. 
 We 
are 
a 
global 
producer, 
marketer 
and 
exporter 
of 
a 
full 
range 
of 
Met 
coal 
products. 
We 
own 
a 
portfolio 
of 
 operating mines and development 
projects in Queensland, Australia, 
and in the states of 
Virginia, West Virginia 
 and Pennsylvania in the United States. 

 Our Australian 
Operations 
comprise the 
100 -owned 
Curragh producing 
mine complex. 
Our U.S. 
Operations 
 comprise 
two 
100 -owned 
producing 
mine 
complexes 
(Buchanan 
and 
Logan), 
one 
100 -owned 
idled 
mine 
 complex (Greenbrier) and two development properties (Mon Valley 
and Russell County). In addition to Met coal, 
 our Australian 
Operations sell 
thermal coal 
domestically, 
which is 
used to 
generate electricity, 
to Stanwell 
and 
 some thermal 
coal in 
the export 
market. Our 
U.S. Operations 
primarily focus 
on the 
production of 
Met coal 
for 
 the North American domestic and seaborne export 
markets and also produce and sell some 
thermal coal that is 
 extracted in the process of mining Met coal. 

 Overview 
 Coronado faced challenges 
in the third 
quarter of 2024 
that led to 
a decrease in 
both production and 
sales volume 
 compared 
to the 
second 
quarter 
of 
2024. 
This 
decrease 
was 
largely 
driven 
by our 
Australian 
Operations 
that 
 were impacted by equipment failures and elevated rainfall 
for the period and resulted in production losses 
in the 
 third quarter. At our U.S. Operations, saleable production 
and sales volume increased during the third quarter of 
 2024, primarily driven by 
improved production yield as we 
progress through the southern panels 
at the Buchanan 
 mine and higher skip 
count and efficiencies 
compared to the second 
quarter of 2024. This 
improved production 
 was achieved 
despite delays 
in the 
planned longwall 
move and 
equipment breakdowns 
at the 
Buchanan mine 
 and adverse 
mining 
conditions 
at the 
Logan 
mine. Towards 
the 
end 
of September 
2024, 
our 
Buchanan 
mine 
 mobilized 
an 
additional 
longwall 
in 
the 
northern 
section 
of 
the 
mine, 
which 
is 
expected 
to 
further 
improve 
 production yield given a higher yielding section of the mine. 
 Although 
production 
for 
third 
quarter 
of 
2024 
of 
3.8Mt 
was 
0.3Mt 
lower 
than 
the 
prior 
quarter, 
it 
remained 
 consistent with the same quarter in 2023. 
 Saleable production of 11.3 
MMt for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, 
compared to 11.9 MMt 
for the 
 nine 
months 
ended 
September 
30, 
2023, 
primarily 
due 
to 
the 
above 
operational 
and 
geological 
issues 
that 
 significantly impacted production yield at Buchanan mine in the 
first half of 2024. 

 The coking 
coal market 
faced multiple 
disruptions in 
the third 
quarter of 
2024 due 
to weakened 
steel demand 
 from China and 
delays in infrastructure 
spending and longer 
than expected monsoon 
season, which 
more than 
 offset the supply constraints due to higher than usual wet weather conditions in Queensland and the suspension 
 of production 
at 
Anglo American s 
Grosvenor 
mine. 
China's stimulus 
measures 
announced 
in 
late September 
 2024 
had 
a 
mixed 
impact 
on 
the 
coking 
coal 
market. 
While 
the 
announcement 
created 
a 
short-term 
boost 
in 
 market activity, 
it is uncertain as to whether this 
stimulus will significantly improve the 
demand for coking coal in 
 the short to medium term. 
 The Australian Premium Low Volatile 
Hard Coking Coal, or AUS PLV 
HCC, index price averaged 210.7 
per Mt 
 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, 31.6 per Mt lower, compared to the three months ended June 
 30, 2024. 
The AUS 
PLV 
HCC index 
averaged 253.2 
per Mt 
for the 
nine months 
ended September 
30, 2024, 
 30.4 per Mt lower, compared to 
the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 Coal revenues 
of 1,898.1 
million for 
the nine 
months 
ended September 
30, 2024, 
were 
down 265.0 
million 
 compared to the same 
period in 2023, primarily driven 
by average Met realized 
price per Mt sold 
of 192.6, 28.9 
 per Mt 
sold lower 
than the 
2023 period. 
Although saleable 
production 
was 0.6 
MMt lower 
for the 
nine months 
 ended September 30, 2024, 
compared to the nine 
months ended September 30, 
2023, 
sales volume of 11.7 MMt 
 remained consistent in 
both periods as 
we drew on 
coal stock built 
at port at 
the end of 
December 2023 due 
to 
 port constraints in Queensland. 

 Mining 
costs 
for the 
nine 
months 
ended 
September 
30, 2024, 
were 
 75.8 
million, 
or 5.5 
per 
Mt sold, 
higher 
 compared to 
the corresponding 
period in 
2023, driven 
by unplanned 
maintenance costs, 
continued inflationary 
 impacts on labor and supply costs and 
significant inventory drawdown at our Australian Operations due 
to higher 
 sales volumes 
exceeding saleable 
production in 
the 2024 
period, partially 
offset by cost 
savings from 
demobilizing 
 contractor fleets in late March 2024 at our Australian Operations 
. 

 Refinancing update 
 On 
October 
2, 
2024, 
we 
successfully 
completed 
a 
refinancing 
initiative 
and 
issued 
 400.0 
million 
aggregate 
 principal amount of 
the New Notes. 
The transaction provides 
Coronado increased financial 
flexibility by extending 
 our debt maturity profile and improved terms that we believe are 
more sustainable for our business. 
 The net proceeds from 
the transaction were 
used to redeem all 
outstanding principal amount 
of the Company s 
 Existing Notes 
and to 
pay related 
fees and 
expenses in 
connection with 
New Notes 
and the 
redemption of 
the 
 Existing Notes, and we expect to use the remaining net proceeds 
for general corporate purposes. 

 Refer to Part I, Item 1, Note 9. Interest Bearing Liabilities 
for further information. 

 Dividends 
 On September 17, 2024, the Company settled 
its previously declared dividends of 8.4 
million, which were paid 
 to stockholders from available cash. 
 Liquidity 
 Coronado 
had 
available 
liquidity 
of 
 326.1

of 22.0 
million and 
 128.0

 270.0 
million 
aggregate 
principal 
amount 
of 
interest-bearing 
liabilities 
outstanding 
less

 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared 
to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Summary 
 The financial and operational highlights for the three months 
ended September 30, 2024 include: 

Net 
loss 
for 
the 
three 
months 
ended 
September 
30, 
2024, 
of 
 71.0 
million 
was 
 49.9 
million 
higher 
 compared to 
 21.1 million 
for the 
three months 
ended September 
30, 2023, 
which was 
largely due 
to 
 lower coal 
revenues 
as a 
result of 
lower average 
realized 
Met price 
and lower 
sales volume 
, 
partially 
 offset by lower operating costs. 

Average realized Met price 
per Mt sold of 179.6 for 
the three months ended September 
30, 2024, was 
 27.8 
per 
Mt 
sold 
lower 
compared 
to 
average 
Met 
realized 
price 
per 
Mt 
sold 
of 
 207.4 
for 
the 
same 
 period in 2023. Coking coal index prices continued to decline due weakened 
demand from key Met coal 
 markets such as China and India. 

Sales volume of 3.9 MMt for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 0.2 MMt lower compared 
 to the same period 
in 2023, largely due 
to lower production caused 
by above average rainfall 
in August 
 at 
our 
Australian 
Operations, 
equipment 
failure 
impacting 
both 
our 
Australian 
Operations 
and 
U.S. 
 Operations and 
adverse geological 
issues combined 
with sales 
slippage into 
October 2024 
at our U.S. 
 Operations. 

Adjusted EBITDA 
loss for 
the three 
months ended 
September 
30, 2024, 
of 19.1 
million compared 
to 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
of 3.4 
million for the 
three months 
ended September 
30, 2023, largely 
due to lower 
 coal sales revenues, 
partially offset by lower operating costs. 

As 
of 
September 
30, 
2024, 
the 
Company 
had 
total 
available 
liquidity 
of 
 326.1 
million, 
consisting 
of 
 176.1 million cash and cash equivalents (excluding restricted cash), 22.0 million of unrestricted short-
 term deposits and 128.0 million of availability under the 
ABL Facility.

 Coal Revenues 
 Coal 
revenues 
were 
 600.7 
million 
for 
the 
three 
months 
ended 
September 
30, 
2024, 
 106.6 
million 
lower, 
 compared to 707.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
The decrease was a result of lower 
 average Met 
realized 
price 
per Mt 
sold 
of 179.6 
the 
three months 
ended 
September 
30, 
2024, compared 
to 
 207.4 per Mt sold 
for the same 
period in 2023 
and lower sales 
volume of 0.2 
MMt for the 
three months ended 
 September 30, 2024. 

 Cost of Coal Revenues (Exclusive of Items Shown 
Separately Below) 
 Cost of coal revenues comprise costs related 
to produced tons sold, along with 
changes in both the volumes and 
 carrying 
values 
of 
coal 
inventory. 
Cost 
of 
coal 
revenues 
include 
items 
such 
as 
direct 
operating 
costs, 
which 
 includes employee-related costs, 
materials and 
supplies, contractor services, 
coal handling 
and preparation costs 
 and production taxes. 

 Total cost of coal revenues was 466.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, 
 35.4 million, or 
 7.1 lower, compared to 501.5 
million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

 Our Australian Operations contributed 
to 20.4 million of the 
decrease in cost of coal 
revenues, primarily driven 
 by cost savings 
from the demobilization of 
four fleets in late 
March 2024, and a 
further fleet in 
July 2024, following 
 completion 
of 
the 
historical 
pre-strip 
waste 
deficit 
works, 
partially 
offset 
by 
higher 
overburden 
removal, 
 demonstrating 
improved 
equipment 
productivity, 
significant 
inventory 
drawdown 
due 
to 
lower 
saleable 
 production, higher 
maintenance costs 
following equipment 
failures and 
unfavorable average 
foreign exchange 
 rates on 
translation of 
the Australian 
Operations for 
the three 
months ended 
September 30, 
2024, of 
A /US : 
 0.67 compared to 0.66 for the same period in 2023. 

 Cost of coal 
revenues for our 
U.S. Operations for the 
three months ended September 
30, 2024, was 15.0 
million 
 lower compared 
to the three 
months ended 
September 30, 
2023, largely 
due to lower 
sales volume, 
and lower 
 coal purchases for the three months ended September 
30, 2024, compared to the same period of 2023.

 Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization 
 Depreciation, depletion and amortization 
was 45.6 million for the 
three months ended September 
30, 2024, an 
 increase 
of 
 10.8 
million, 
compared 
to 
 34.7 
million 
for 
the 
three 
months 
ended 
September 
30, 
2023. 
The 
 increase was 
due to 
additional equipment 
brought into 
service during 
the twelve 
months since 
September 30, 
 2023, and unfavorable average foreign exchange rates 
on translation of the Australian Operations. 
 Freight Expenses 
 Freight expenses 
relate to 
costs associated 
with rail 
and port 
providers, including 
take-or-pay commitments 
at 
 our 
Australian 
Operations, 
and 
demurrage 
costs. 
Freight 
expenses 
totaled 
 66.1 
million 
for the 
three 
months 
 ended September 
30, 2024, 
a decrease 
of 5.6 
million, compared 
to 71.7 
million for 
the three 
months ended 
 September 30, 2023, primarily driven by lower sales volume. 

 Stanwell Rebate 
 The Stanwell 
rebate 
was 
 25.4 
million for 
the three 
months 
ended September 
30, 2024, 
a decrease 
of 11.7 
 million, compared 
to 37.1 
million for 
the three 
months ended 
September 30, 
2023. The 
decrease was 
largely 
 driven by lower 
realized reference coal 
pricing for the 
prior twelve-month period applicable 
to three months 
ended 
 September 
30, 
2024, 
used 
to 
calculate 
the 
rebate 
compared 
to 
the 
same 
period 
in 
2023, 
partially 
offset 
by 
 unfavorable foreign exchange rate on translation of our Australian 
Operations. 

 Other Royalties 
 Other royalties 
were 63.0 
million in the 
three months 
ended September 
30, 2024, 
a decrease 
of 29.7 
million 
 compared to 92.7 million 
for the three months 
ended September 30, 2023 
due to lower coal 
revenues partially 
 offset by unfavorable foreign exchange rate on 
translation of our Australian Operations. 

 Other, net 
 Other, net 
was at a 
loss of 19.7 
million for the 
three months 
ended September 
30, 2024, a 
decrease of 
 27.9 
 million compared to an income of 8.2 million for the three months 
ended September 30, 2023. During the three 
 months 
ended 
September 
30, 
2024, 
the 
Company 
recognized 
an 
impairment 
charge 
of 
 10.6 
million 
against 
 property, 
plant and 
equipment relating 
to a 
long-standing non-core 
idled asset 
within its 
U.S. Operations. 
This 
 impairment 
charge 
was 
recognized 
based 
on 
a 
conditional 
purchase 
offer 
received 
and 
accepted 
by 
the 
 Company. The remaining 
decrease is largely attributable to the higher foreign exchange losses 
on translation of 
 short-term inter-entity balances 
between certain entities 
within the 
group that are 
denominated in currencies 
other 
 than their respective functional currencies.
 Income Tax Benefit 

 Income 
tax 
benefit 
was 
 31.8 
million 
for 
the 
three 
months 
ended 
September 
30, 
2024, 
an 
increase 
of 
 13.5 
 million, compared to 
 18.2 million for 
the three months ended 
September 30, 2023, driven 
by a higher 
loss before 
 tax in the 2024 period. 
 We have 
historically 
calculated 
the provision 
for income 
taxes during 
interim reporting 
periods 
by applying 
an 
 estimate of the annual effective tax rate for the full fiscal year to ordinary 
income or loss (pretax income or loss 
 excluding 
unusual 
or 
infrequently 
occurring 
discrete 
items) 
for 
the 
reporting 
period. 
We 
have 
used 
an 
actual 
 discrete geographical 
effective tax 
rate method to 
calculate taxes for 
the three-month 
period ended 
September 
 30, 2024. 
We 
determined 
that since 
small 
changes 
in 
estimated 
 ordinary 
income 
would 
result 
in significant 
 changes in the estimated annual effective tax rate, the 
historical method would not provide a reliable estimate for 
 the three months ended September 30, 2024.

 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 
Nine months ended September 30, 2023 
 Summary 
 The financial and operational highlights for the nine months ended 
September 30, 2024 include: 

Net loss 
of 54.8 
million for 
the nine 
months ended 
September 30, 
2024, decreased 
by 232.9 
million 
 compared 
to 
a 
net 
income 
of 
 178.1 
million 
for 
the 
nine 
months 
ended 
September 
30, 
2023. 
The 
 decrease was a result of lower coal revenues partially offset by lower operating costs and an income tax 
 benefit compared to an income tax expense in the comparative 
period. 

Average realized 
Met price 
per Mt 
sold of 
 192.6 for 
the nine 
months ended 
September 30, 
2024 was 
 28.9 per Mt sold 
lower compared to 221.5 per 
Mt sold for the 
nine months ended September 30, 
2023. 
 The AUS PLV HCC index 
averaged 253.2 per Mt 
for the nine 
months ended September 30, 
2024, 30.4 
 per Mt lower 
compared to the nine 
months ended September 30, 
2023. The downward trend 
was a result 
 of 
reduced 
supply 
from 
adverse 
weather 
conditions 
and 
operational 
disruptions 
out 
of 
Australia 
and 
 weaker demand from key markets like China and India 
. 

Sales volume of 
11.7 
MMt for the 
nine months 
ended September 
30, 2024, 
remained consistent 
to the 
 nine 
months 
ended 
September 
30, 
2023 
despite 
saleable 
production 
being 
0.6 
MMt 
lower, 
as 
our 
 operations 
drew 
on 
significant 
coal 
inventory 
built 
in 
December 
2023, 
which 
was 
a 
result 
of 
shipping 
 delays caused by our port infrastructure provider in Australia. 

Adjusted EBITDA of 
 116.3 
million for the 
nine months ended 
September 30, 2024, 
was 239.4 million 
 lower compared 
to 355.7 
million for 
the nine 
months ended 
September 30, 
2023. 
This decrease 
was 
 primarily due to lower coal revenues. 

As of 
September 30, 
2024, the 
Company had 
net debt 
of 93.9 
million, consisting 
of closing 
cash and

equivalents 
(excluding 
restricted 
cash) 
of 
 176.1

 Coal Revenues 
 Coal 
revenues 
were 
 1,898.1 
million 
for 
the 
nine 
months 
ended 
September 
30, 
2024, 
a 
decrease 
of 
 265.0 
 million, compared to 2,163.1 million for 
the nine months ended September 
30, 2023. The decrease was 
driven 
 by lower average 
Met realized per 
Mt sold price 
of 192.6 compared 
to 221.5 per 
Mt sold for 
the nine months 
 ended September 
30, 2023, 
due to 
unfavorable market 
conditions causing 
decline in 
coking coal 
index prices. 
 Sales volume for the nine months ended September 
30, 2024 was consistent to the same period in 2023. 

 Other Revenues 
 Other revenues were 
 52.1 million for 
the nine 
months ended 
September 30, 
2024, an increase 
of 4.1 million 
 compared to 48.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
This increase was primarily driven by 
 higher 
termination 
fee 
revenue 
from 
a 
coal 
sales 
contract 
cancelled 
in 
the 
first 
quarter 
of 
2024 
at 
our 
U.S. 
 Operations. 
 Cost of Coal Revenues (Exclusive of Items Shown 
Separately Below) 
 Total 
cost of coal revenues was 1,311.4 
million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase 
of 
 48.5 million, compared to 1,262.9 million for the 
nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

 Cost of coal revenues for 
our Australian Operations in 
the nine months ended September 
30, 2024, were 52.8 
 million higher 
compared to 
the same 
period in 
2023. The 
increase was 
primarily driven 
by coal 
inventory draw 
 down from sales volume exceeding production in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, 
compared to coal 
 inventory built in the 2023 
period, impact of inflation on supply 
costs and higher maintenance costs due 
to mining 
 equipment operating at higher 
capacity. 
This increase was 
partially offset by 
demobilization of four 
fleets in late 
 March 2024 
following completion 
of the 
historical 
pre-strip 
waste deficit 
works, 
demobilization 
of an 
additional 
 fleet in the third quarter of 2024 
and favorable foreign exchange rate 
on translation of our Australian Operations 
 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, of A /US : 0.66 compared 
to 0.67 for the same period in 2023. 
 Cost of coal revenues for our U.S. Operations were 4.3 million lower for the nine months 
ended September 30, 
 2024, compared 
to the 
same period 
in 2023, 
largely due 
to lower 
coal purchases 
partially offset 
by unplanned 
 maintenance costs due to certain 
mechanical and equipment failures 
during the nine months 
ended September 
 30, 2024. 

 Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization 
 Depreciation, depletion and amortization was 142.2 million 
for the nine months ended September 30, 
2024, an 
 increase of 
 29.1 million, 
as compared 
to 113.1 
million for 
the nine 
months ended 
September 30, 
2023. The 
 increase was 
due to 
additional equipment 
brought into 
service during 
the twelve 
months since 
September 30, 
 2023, partially offset by favorable average foreign 
exchange rates 
on translation of the Australian Operations. 
 Freight Expenses 
 Freight 
expenses 
totaled 
 183.7 
million 
for 
the 
nine 
months 
ended 
September 
30, 
2024, 
a 
decrease 
of 
 8.9 
 million compared 
to 192.5 
million for 
the nine 
months ended 
September 30, 
2023. 
Our Australian 
Operations 
 contributed 8.0 million 
to the decrease 
due to higher 
demurrage as a 
result of shipping 
delays during the 
nine 
 months ended September 30, 2023. 

 Stanwell Rebate 
 The 
Stanwell 
rebate 
was 
 83.3 
million 
for 
the 
nine 
months 
ended 
September 
30, 
2024, 
a 
decrease 
of 
 22.1 
 million compared 
to 105.4 
million for 
the nine 
months ended 
September 30, 
2023. The 
decrease was 
due to 
 lower export sales volume and lower realized 
reference coal pricing for the prior twelve-month 
period applicable 
 to the 
nine months 
ended 
September 30, 
2024, 
used to 
calculate 
the rebate 
compared 
to the 
same 
period in 
 2023 and favorable average foreign exchange rates 
on translation of the Australian Operations. 
 Other Royalties 
 Other royalties were 235.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease 
of 33.0 million, 
 as 
compared 
to 
 268.6 
million 
for 
the 
nine 
months 
ended 
September 
30, 
2023 
due 
to 
lower 
coal 
revenues 
 combined with favorable average exchange rates on translation 
of the Australian Operations.

 Other, net 
 Other, 
net was 
at a 
loss of 
 8.6 million 
for the 
nine months 
ended September 
30, 2024, 
a decrease 
of 26.3 
 million compared to an income 
of 17.7 million for the nine 
months ended September 30, 
2023. During the nine 
 months 
ended 
September 
30, 
2024, 
the 
Company 
recognized 
an 
impairment 
charge 
of 
 10.6 
million 
against 
 property, 
plant and 
equipment relating 
to a 
long-standing non-core 
idled asset 
within its 
U.S. Operations. 
This 
 impairment 
charge 
was 
recognized 
based 
on 
a 
conditional 
purchase 
offer 
received 
and 
accepted 
by 
the 
 Company. 
This was 
partially offset 
by lower 
exchange losses 
on translation 
of short-term 
inter-entity balances 
 between certain entities within 
the group that are 
denominated in currencies other than 
their respective functional 
 currencies. 

 Income Tax Benefit (Expense) 
 Income tax benefit of 28.5 
million for the nine months 
ended September 30, 2024, decreased 
by 66.3 million, 
 compared to 37.8 
million tax expense 
for the nine 
months ended 
September 30, 
2023, primarily driven 
by net 
 loss position in the 2024 period. 

 We have 
historically 
calculated 
the provision 
for income 
taxes during 
interim reporting 
periods 
by applying 
an 
 estimate of the annual effective tax rate for the full fiscal year to ordinary 
income or loss (pretax income or loss 
 excluding 
unusual 
or 
infrequently 
occurring 
discrete 
items) 
for 
the 
reporting 
period. 
We 
have 
used 
an 
actual 
 discrete geographical 
effective 
tax rate 
method to 
calculate taxes 
for the 
nine-month period 
ended September 
 30, 
2024. 
We 
determined 
that 
since 
small 
changes 
in 
estimated 
 ordinary 
income 
would 
result 
in 
significant 
 changes in the estimated annual effective tax rate, the 
historical method would not provide a reliable estimate for 
 the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

 million, a decrease of 
 88.2 million, or 19.7 , compared 
to 446.8 million for 
the three months ended September 
 30, 2023. This 
decrease was 
largely driven 
by lower 
average realized 
Met price 
per Mt sold 
of 23.7 
driven by 
 unfavorable 
coal 
market conditions 
causing 
the

in coal 
index 
prices 
and 
sales 
volume 
being

 2024, compared to 260.5 million for the three months ended September 
30, 2023. 
This decrease was primarily 
 driven 
by lower

per 
Mt sold 
of 
 162.8 
for the 
three 
months 
ended 
September 
30, 
 2024, 7.4 per 
Mt sold lower 
than the 2023 
period. Lower average 
realized Met price 
per Mt sold 
was primarily 
 attributed to 
weakened demand 
from key 
export Met 
coal markets 
for our 
U.S. Operations 
such as 
China and 
 India. 

 Operating costs 
decreased by 
 12.8 million to 
 202.3 million 
for the 
three months 
ended September 
30, 2024, 
 compared to the three months ended 
September 30, 2023, driven by lower 
mining costs. The decrease in mining 
 costs 
was 
primarily 
driven 
by 
higher 
coal 
inventory 
build 
in 
the 
quarter 
due 
to 
higher 
saleable 
production 
 compared to 
the same 
period

partially offset 
by unplanned 
maintenance 
costs. 
Mining and 
operating 
 costs per Mt sold for the 
three months ended September

per Mt sold and 9.0 
per 
 Mt sold, respectively, 
compared to the three months ended September

for 
the

months

September

were 
 1,235.7 
 million, a decrease of 25.0 million, 
or 2.0 , compared to 1,260.7 million for 
the nine months ended September 
 30, 2023. The 
decrease was driven by 
lower average realized Met 
price per Mt 
sold of 212.2, 26.3 
per Mt lower 
 compared to 238.5 per Mt 
sold for the nine months 
ended September 30, 2023, 
partially offset by higher 
sales 
 volume for the 
nine months 
ended September 
30, 2024, 
that, despite 
lower saleable 
production, were 
0.4 MMt 
 higher than the same period in 2023, as the Company drew on port inventory built at 
the end of December 2023. 
 Mining costs were 54.3 
million higher for the 
nine months ended 
September 30, 2024, primarily 
driven by coal 
 inventory draw 
down, as 
higher sales 
volume exceeded lower 
production when 
compared to 
the prior 
comparative 
 period, and 
higher maintenance 
and electricity 
costs, partially 
offset by 
cost savings 
from the 
demobilization of 
 four fleets in 
March 2024 and 
another fleet in 
July 2024 following 
completion of historical 
pre-strip deficit works 
 and 
favorable 
foreign 
exchange 
rate 
on 
translation 
of 
our 
Australian 
Operations 
for 
the 
nine 
months 
ended 
 September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. Operating costs decreased by 3.8 
million driven by 
 lower Stanwell 
rebates, freight 
expenses and 
other royalties 
offset by 
higher mining 
costs for 
the nine 
months 
 ended September 
30, 2024. 
Mining costs 
per Mt 
sold were 
 1.8 higher 
while operating 
costs per 
Mt sold 
were 
 9.2 lower compared to the nine months ended September 
30, 2023. 
 Adjusted EBITDA for 
the nine months 
ended September 
30, 2024, of 
 16.4 million decreased 
by 19.2 million, 
 or 54.0 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to 35.6 million for the nine months 
ended 
 September 30, 2023 due to lower coal revenues, partially 
offset by lower operating costs.

for 
the

months 
ended

 compared to 199.5 per Mt sold for the same period in 2023 exacerbated by sales volume 
0.4 MMt lower due to 
 lower production 
which was 
caused by 
operational and 
geological issues 
resulting in 
production downtime 
and 
 lower production yield.

costs 
of 
 568.2

for

were 
 11.7 
million 
lower 
 compared to 
 579.9 million 
for the same 
period in 
2023, driven 
by lower 
coal purchases, 
freight expenses 
and 
 other 
royalties, 
partially 
offset 
by 
higher 
mining 
costs. 
Mining 
costs 
were 
 21.5 
million, 
or 
 12.1 
per 
Mt 
sold, 
 higher for the 
nine months ended 
September 30, 2024, due 
to unplanned maintenance costs 
following equipment 
 failures, and impact of inflation on labor and supply costs. Operating costs increased by 9.5 per Mt sold despite 
 decrease of operating costs due to lower sales volume 
during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Adjusted EBITDA of 125.3

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Overview 
 Our objective is 
to maintain a 
prudent capital structure 
and to ensure 
that sufficient 
liquid assets and 
funding is 
 available to meet both anticipated and 
unanticipated financial obligations, including unforeseen events that could 
 have an 
adverse impact 
on revenues 
or costs. 
Our principal 
sources of 
funds are 
cash and 
cash equivalents, 
 cash flow from operations and availability under our debt 
facilities. 

 Our main uses of cash have historically been, and are expected to continue to be, the funding of our 
operations, 
 working capital, 
capital 
expenditure, 
debt 
service 
obligations, 
business 
or assets 
acquisitions 
and 
payment 
of 
 dividends. Based on our 
outlook for the next 
twelve months, which is 
subject to continued changing demand 
from 
 our 
customers, 
volatility 
in 
coal 
prices, 
current 
and 
future 
trade 
barriers 
and 
the 
uncertainty 
of 
impacts 
from 
 ongoing 
civil 
unrest 
and 
wars, 
we 
believe 
expected 
cash 
generated 
from 
operations 
together 
with 
available 
 borrowing facilities and other strategic and financial initiatives, will be sufficient 
to meet the needs of our existing 
 operations, capital expenditure, service our debt obligations 
and, if declared, payment of dividends. 

 Our ability to generate sufficient cash 
depends on our future performance, 
which may be subject to a number 
of 
 factors 
beyond 
our 
control, 
including 
general 
economic, 
financial 
and 
competitive 
conditions 
and 
other 
risks

 provided in the 
form of restricted 
deposits, with letters 
of credit allowing 
the release of 
such restricted deposits 
to cash and

the 
outstanding 
principal 
amount 
of 
our 
Existing 
Notes 
was 
 242.3 
million. 
As 
of 
 September 30, 2024, the Existing Notes were senior secured 
obligations of the Company. 

 As 
of 
September

we 
were 
in 
compliance 
with 
all 
applicable 
covenants 
under 
the

 9.250 Senior Secured Notes - Refinance update
 On 
October 
2, 
2024, 
we 
successfully 
completed 
a 
refinancing 
initiative 
and 
issued 
 400.0 
million 
aggregate 
 principal amount 
of 9.250 
Senior Secured 
Notes due 
2029 issued 
at par. The 
transaction provides 
the Company 
 increased financial flexibility 
by extending our 
debt maturity profile 
and introducing terms 
that we believe 
are more 
 sustainable for our business. 

 The net proceeds from 
the transaction were 
used to redeem 
all outstanding principal 
amount of the Company s 
 Existing Notes 
and pay 
related fees 
and expenses 
in connection 
with New 
Notes and 
the redemption 
of the 
or 
 the Existing Notes, and we expect to use the remaining 
net proceeds for general and corporate purposes. 
 The New 
Notes are 
guaranteed on 
a senior 
secured basis 
by the 
Company and 
its wholly-owned 
subsidiaries 
 (other than the Issuer) 
(subject to certain exceptions 
and permitted liens) and 
secured by (i) the 
ABL Collateral, 
 and (ii) a second priority 
lien on the ABL Priority 
Collateral, which is junior 
to a first-priority lien 
for the benefit of 
 the lenders and other creditors under the ABL Facility, 
in each case, subject to certain exceptions and permitted 
 liens. 
 The terms 
of the 
New Notes 
are governed 
by the 
Indenture. The 
Indenture contains 
customary 
covenants 
for 
 high 
yield 
bonds, 
including, 
but 
not 
limited 
to, 
limitations 
on 
investments, 
liens, 
indebtedness, 
asset 
sales, 
 transactions with affiliates and restricted payments, 
including payment of dividends on capital stock. 
 Refer to Part I, Item 1, Note 9. Interest Bearing Liabilities 
 
for further information. 
 We 
may 
redeem 
some 
or 
all 
of 
the 
New 
Notes 
at 
the 
redemption 
prices 
and 
on 
the 
terms 
specified 
in 
the 
 Indenture. In 
addition, we 
may, 
from time 
to time, 
seek to 
retire or 
repurchase outstanding 
debt through 
open-
 market purchases, 
privately 
negotiated transactions 
or otherwise. 
Such repurchases, 
if any, 
will be 
upon such 
 terms 
and 
at 
such 
prices 
we 
may 
determine, 
and 
will 
depend 
on 
prevailing 
market 
conditions, 
liquidity 
 requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. 
 Loan Curragh Housing Transaction 
 On May 16, 2024, the Company completed the Curragh Housing Transaction, an agreement for accommodation 
 services and 
the sale 
and leaseback 
of housing 
and accommodation 
assets with 
a regional 
infrastructure and 
 accommodation service provider. 

Table of Contents 

Coronado Global Resources Inc.
 
Form 10-Q September 30, 2024 
42 
 The Curragh Housing Transaction did not satisfy the sale criteria under ASC 606, Revenues from Contracts with 
 Customers and was deemed a financing arrangement. As a result, the proceeds 
of 23.0 million (A 34.6 million) 
 received for the sale and leaseback of property, 
plant and equipment owned by the Company in connection with 
 the Curragh Housing 
Transaction 
were recognized 
as Other 
Financial Liabilities 
on the Company s 
unaudited 
 Condensed Consolidated 
Balance Sheet. 
The term 
of the 
financing arrangement 
is ten 
years with 
an effective 
 interest rate 
of 14.14 . 
This 
liability 
will 
be settled 
in 
equal monthly 
payments 
as 
part of 
the 
accommodation 
 service arrangement. 
 In line 
with the 
Company s capital 
management strategy, 
the Curragh 
Housing Transaction 
provides additional 
 liquidity. In 
addition, the accommodation services 
component of the Curragh Housing 
Transaction is anticipated 
 to enhance the level of service for our employees at our 
Curragh Mine. 

 In connection with the Curragh Housing Transaction, 
the Company borrowed 26.9 million (A 40.4 million) from 
 the same 
regional 
infrastructure 
and accommodation 
service provider. 
This amount 
was recorded 
as Interest 
 Bearing Liabilities in 
the unaudited Condensed 
Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
The amount borrowed 
is payable 
 in equal monthly installments over a period of ten years, 
with an effective interest rate of 14.14 .

I, Item I.

 Surety bonds, letters of credit and bank guarantees 
 We 
are 
required 
to 
provide 
financial 
assurances 
and 
securities 
to 
satisfy 
contractual 
and 
other 
requirements 
 generated in the 
normal course of 
business. Some of 
these assurances are provided 
to comply with 
state or other 
 government agencies statutes and regulations. 

 For 
the 
U.S. 
Operations, 
in 
order 
to 
provide 
the 
required 
financial 
assurance 
for 
post 
mining 
reclamation, 
we 
 generally 
use surety 
bonds. 
We 
also 
use surety 
bonds 
and bank 
letters 
of credit 
to collateralize 
certain 
other 
 obligations including 
contractual obligations under 
workers compensation insurances. 
As of 
September 30, 
2024, 
 we had 
outstanding surety 
bonds of 
 48.9 million 
and 16.8 
million of 
letters of 
credit issued 
from our 
letter of 
 credit sublimit available under the ABL Facility. 
 For the Australian Operations, 
as at September 30, 2024, 
we had bank guarantees outstanding of 24.5 million, 
 including 5.2 million issued from the letter of credit sublimit available under the ABL Facility, primarily in respect 
 of certain rail and port take-or-pay arrangements of the 
Company. 

 As at September 
30, 2024, we 
have in aggregate 
had total outstanding 
bank guarantees provided of 
 41.3 million 
 to secure its obligations and commitments, including 22.0 million issued for the letter of credit sublimit available 
 under the ABL Facility. 

 Future regulatory changes 
relating to these 
obligations could result 
in increased obligations, 
additional costs or 
 additional collateral requirements.

 Capital Requirements 
 Our main uses of cash have historically been the 
funding of our operations, working capital, capital expenditure, 
 and the 
payment of 
interest and 
dividends. We 
intend to 
use cash 
to fund 
debt service 
payments on 
our New 
 Notes, 
the 
ABL 
Facility 
and 
our 
other 
indebtedness, 
to 
fund 
operating 
activities, 
working 
capital, 
capital 
 expenditures, 
including 
organic 
growth 
projects, 
partial 
redemption 
of 
the 
New 
Notes, 
business 
or 
assets 
 acquisitions and, if declared, payment of dividends. 
 Historical Cash Flows

 Operating activities 
 Net 
cash

operating 
activities 
was 
 11.5 
million 
for 
the 
nine 
months 
ended 
September 
30, 
2024, 
 compared to 223.7 million 
for the nine 
months ended September 30, 
2023. The decrease in 
cash from operating 
 activities was 
driven by 
the lower 
coal revenue 
s 
and the 
additional 
payment 
of 51.5 
million 
in relation 
to the 
 stamp duty on 
Curragh s acquisition, 
including tax interest, 
partially offset 
by income tax 
refund of 21.3 
million 
 as compared to income tax payment of 148.8 million 
for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Investing activities 
 Net 
cash 
used 
in 
investing 
activities 
was 
 200.9 
million
 for 
the 
nine 
months 
ended 
September 
30, 
2024, 
 compared to 183.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Cash spent on capital expenditures 
 for the 
nine months 
ended September 
30, 2024, 
was 201.1 
million, of 
which 62.0 
million was 
related to 
the 
 Australian Operations and 
 139.1 million was 
related to the 
U.S. Operations. The 
increase in capital 
expenditures 
 was 
largely 
due 
to 
the 
investment 
in 
organic 
growth 
projects 
at 
both 
of 
our 
U.S. 
Operations 
and 
Australian 
 Operations.

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The preparation 
of 
our 
financial 
statements 
in 
conformity 
with 
U.S. GAAP 
requires 
us to 
make 
estimates 
and 
 assumptions that affect the 
reported amounts of assets and liabilities 
at the date of the financial statements 
and 
 the reported 
amounts of 
revenue and 
expenses during 
the reporting 
period. On 
an ongoing basis, 
we evaluate 
 our estimates. Our estimates are 
based on historical experience 
and various other assumptions 
that we believe 
 are appropriate, the results of 
which form the basis 
for making judgments about the 
carrying values of assets and 
 liabilities 
that 
are 
not 
readily 
apparent 
from 
other 
sources. 
Actual results 
may 
differ 
from 
these 
estimates. 
All 
 critical accounting estimates 
and assumptions, as 
well as the resulting 
impact to our financial 
statements, have 
 been discussed with the Audit Committee of our Board 
of Directors. 
 Our 
critical 
accounting

 ITEM 3. 
QUANTITATIVE 
AND QUALITATIVE 
DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Our activities 
expose us 
to 
a variety 
of financial 
risks, such 
as commodity 
price risk, 
interest rate 
risk, foreign 
 currency risk, liquidity risk and credit 
risk. The overall risk management objective is 
to minimize potential adverse 
 effects on our financial performance from those 
risks which are not coal price related. 
 We manage 
financial risk 
through policies 
and procedures 
approved by 
our Board 
of Directors. 
These specify 
 the responsibility 
of the 
Board 
of Directors 
and 
management 
with regard 
to the 
management 
of financial 
risk. 
 Financial risks are 
managed centrally by 
our finance 
team under the 
direction of the 
Group Chief Financial 
Officer. 
 The finance team manages risk exposures primarily through delegated authority limits approved 
by the Board of 
 Directors. The finance team regularly monitors 
our exposure to these financial risks and reports 
to management 
 and 
the 
Board 
of 
Directors 
on 
a 
regular 
basis. 
Policies 
are 
reviewed 
at 
least 
annually 
and 
amended 
where 
 appropriate. 
 We may use 
derivative financial instruments such 
as forward fixed 
price commodity contracts, interest 
rate swaps 
 and 
foreign 
exchange 
rate 
contracts 
to 
hedge 
certain 
risk 
exposures. 
Derivatives 
for 
speculative 
purposes 
is 
 strictly prohibited by the Treasury Risk Management Policy approved by our Board of 
Directors. We use different 
 methods 
to 
measure 
the 
extent 
to 
which 
we 
are 
exposed 
to 
various 
financial 
risks. 
These 
methods 
include 
 sensitivity analysis 
in the 
case of 
interest rates, 
foreign exchange 
and other 
price risks 
and aging 
analysis for 
 credit risk. 
 Commodity Price Risk 
 Coal Price Risk 
 We 
are 
exposed 
to 
domestic 
and 
global 
coal 
prices. 
Our 
principal 
philosophy 
is 
that 
our 
investors 
would 
not 
 consider hedging coal prices to be in the long-term interest of 
our stockholders. Therefore, any potential hedging 
 of coal 
prices 
through 
long-term 
fixed price 
contracts 
is subject 
to the 
approval 
of our 
Board 
of Directors 
and 
 would only be adopted in exceptional circumstances. 
 The 
expectation 
of 
future 
prices 
for 
coal 
depends 
upon 
many 
factors 
beyond 
our 
control. 
Met 
coal 
has 
been 
 volatile commodity over the 
past ten years. The 
demand and supply in the 
Met coal industry changes 
from time 
 to 
time. 
There 
are 
no 
assurances 
that 
oversupply 
will 
not 
occur, 
that 
demand 
will 
not 
decrease 
or 
that 
 overcapacity will not occur, which could cause 
declines in the prices of 
coal, which could have a 
material adverse 
 effect on our financial condition and results 
of operations. 
 Access to 
international markets 
may be 
subject to 
ongoing interruptions 
and trade 
barriers due 
to policies 
and 
 tariffs 
of 
individual 
countries. 
We 
may 
or 
may 
not 
be 
able 
to 
access 
alternate 
markets 
of 
our 
coal 
should 
 interruptions or 
trade barriers occur 
in the 
future. An 
inability for 
Met coal 
suppliers to 
access international markets 
 would likely result 
in an oversupply 
of Met coal and 
may result in 
a decrease in 
prices and or 
the curtailment of 
 production. 
 We manage 
our commodity 
price risk 
for our non-trading, 
thermal coal 
sales through 
the use 
of long-term 
coal 
 supply agreements in our 
U.S. Operations. In Australia, thermal 
coal is sold 
to Stanwell on a 
supply contract. See 
 Item 
1A. 
 Risk 
Factors Risks 
related 
to 
the 
Supply 
Deed 
with 
Stanwell 
may 
adversely 
affect 
our 
financial 
 condition and results of operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC and ASX on February 
 20, 2024. 
 Sales commitments in the 
Met coal market are typically 
not long-term in nature, 
and we are therefore subject 
to 
 fluctuations in 
market pricing. 
Certain coal 
sales are 
provisionally priced 
initially. 
Provisionally priced 
sales are 
 those for which price finalization, 
referenced to the relevant index, 
is outstanding at the reporting 
date. The final 
 sales price is determined 
within 7 to 
90 days after 
delivery to the 
customer. 
As of September 
30, 2024, 
we had 
 44.8 
million 
of 
outstanding 
provisionally 
priced 
receivables 
subject 
to 
changes 
in 
the 
relevant 
price 
index. 
If 
 prices decreased 10 , these provisionally 
priced receivables would decrease by 
 4.5 million. See Item 
1A. Risk 
 Factors Our profitability 
depends upon 
the prices 
we receive 
for our 
coal. Prices 
for coal 
are volatile 
and can 
 fluctuate widely 
based upon 
a number 
of factors 
beyond our 
control in 
our Annual 
Report on 
Form 10-K 
filed 
 with the SEC and ASX on February 20, 2024. 
 Diesel Fuel 
 We may 
be exposed 
to price 
risk in 
relation to 
other commodities 
from time 
to time 
arising from 
raw materials 
 used in our 
operations (such 
as gas 
or diesel). 
The expectation 
of future 
prices for 
diesel depends 
upon many 
 factors 
beyond 
our 
control. 
The 
current 
Israel-Palestine 
conflict 
could 
create 
significant 
uncertainty 
regarding 
 interruptions to global oil supply causing significant 
volatility in prices of related commodities, 
including the price 
 of diesel fuel we 
purchase. These commodities 
may be hedged 
through financial instruments 
if the exposure 
is 
 considered material and where the exposure cannot be 
mitigated through fixed price supply agreements. 
 The fuel 
required 
for 
our operations 
for 
the remainder 
of fiscal 
year 
2024 
will 
be 
purchased 
under 
fixed-price 
 contracts or on a spot basis.

 Interest Rate Risk 
 Interest rate risk is the risk that a change in interest rates 
on our borrowing facilities will have an adverse impact 
 on 
our 
financial 
performance, 
investment 
decisions 
and 
stockholder 
return. 
Our 
objectives 
in 
managing 
our 
 exposure 
to 
interest 
rates 
include 
minimizing 
interest 
costs 
in 
the 
long 
term, 
providing 
a 
reliable 
estimate 
of 
 interest costs for the 
annual work program 
and budget and ensuring 
that changes in interest 
rates will not have 
 a material impact on our financial performance. 
 As of September 
30, 2024, 
we had 
 299.9 million 
of fixed rate 
borrowings and 
Existing Notes 
and no variable-
 rate borrowings outstanding. 
 We currently do not hedge against interest rate 
fluctuations. 

 Foreign Exchange Risk 
 A significant portion of our 
sales are denominated in US . 
Foreign exchange risk is 
the risk that our earnings 
or 
 cash flows are adversely impacted by movements in exchange 
rates of currencies that are not in US . 
 Our main exposure 
is to the 
A -US exchange rate 
through our Australian 
Operations, which have 
predominantly 
 A denominated costs. Greater than 70 of expenses incurred at our Australian Operations are denominated in 
 A . Approximately 30 
of our Australian Operations purchases are 
made with reference to US , 
which provides 
 a natural hedge against foreign 
exchange movements on these 
purchases (including fuel, several 
port handling 
 charges, demurrage, 
purchased coal 
and some 
insurance premiums). 
Appreciation of 
the A 
against US 
will 
 increase our Australian 
Operations US reported 
cost base and 
reduce US reported 
net income. For 
the portion 
 of US required to purchase A to settle our Australian Operations operating costs, a 10 increase in the A to 
 US exchange rate would increase reported 
total costs and expenses by approximately 
 32.4 million and 92.5 
 million for the three and nine months ended September 
30, 2024, respectively. 
 Under normal market conditions, we generally do not consider it necessary to hedge our 
exposure to this foreign 
 exchange risk. 
However, 
there 
may be 
specific commercial 
circumstances, 
such 
as the 
hedging 
of significant 
 capital 
expenditure, 
acquisitions, 
disposals 
and 
other 
financial 
transactions, 
where 
we 
may 
deem 
foreign 
 exchange hedging 
as appropriate 
and 
where a 
US contract 
cannot 
be negotiated 
directly with 
suppliers 
and 
 other third parties. 

 For our 
Australian Operations, 
we translate 
all monetary 
assets and 
liabilities at the 
period end 
exchange rate, 
 all non-monetary 
assets and 
liabilities at 
historical 
rates 
and revenue 
and expenses 
at the 
average exchange 
 rates in effect during 
the periods. The net 
effect of these 
translation adjustments is 
shown in the accompanying 
 Consolidated Financial Statements within components 
of net income. 
 We currently do not hedge our non-US exposures 
against exchange rate fluctuations. 

 Credit Risk 
 Credit risk is the risk of 
sustaining a financial loss 
as a result of a counterparty 
not meeting its obligations 
under 
 a financial instrument or customer contract. 
 We are exposed 
to credit risk 
when we have financial 
derivatives, cash deposits, 
lines of credit, letters 
of credit 
 or bank guarantees 
in place with 
financial institutions. 
 To 
 mitigate against credit risk 
from financial counterparties, 
 we have minimum credit rating requirements with financial 
institutions where we transact. 
 We 
are 
also 
exposed 
to 
counterparty 
credit 
risk 
arising 
from 
our 
operating 
activities, 
primarily 
from 
trade 
 receivables. Customers who wish to trade 
on credit terms are subject to credit 
verification procedures, including 
 an assessment of their independent credit rating, financial position, past experience and industry reputation. 
We 
 monitor the financial performance 
of counterparties on a routine 
basis to ensure credit 
thresholds are achieved. 
 Where required, we will request additional credit 
support, such as letters of credit, 
to mitigate against credit risk. 
 Credit 
risk 
is 
monitored 
regularly, 
and 
performance 
reports 
are 
provided 
to 
our 
management 
and 
Board 
of 
 Directors. 
 As of September 30, 
2024, we had financial 
assets of 541.8 million, 
comprising of cash 
and cash equivalents, 
 trade 
receivables, 
short-term 
deposits 
and 
restricted 
deposits, 
all 
of 
which 
are 
exposed 
to 
varied 
levels 
of 
 counterparty 
credit risk. 
These 
financial 
assets 
have 
been assessed 
under 
ASC 
326, 
 Financial 
Instruments 
 
 Credit Losses
 , and 
a provision 
for discounting 
and credit 
losses of 
 0.7 million 
was recorded 
as of 
September 
 30, 2024.

the 
definition 
of 
 disclosure 
controls 
and 
 procedures in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the 
Exchange Act. In designing and evaluating the disclosure 
 controls 
and 
procedures, 
management 
recognized 
that 
any 
controls 
and 
procedures, 
no 
matter 
how 
well 
 designed and operated, can provide only reasonable 
assurance of achieving the desired control 
objectives, and 
 management necessarily was 
required to apply 
its judgment in 
evaluating the cost-benefit 
relationship of possible 
 controls and procedures. 
 As of the end 
of the period 
covered by this Quarterly 
Report on Form 
10-Q, we carried 
out an evaluation 
under 
 the supervision and 
with the participation 
of our 
management, including the 
Chief Executive Officer 
and the 
Group 
 Chief Financial 
Officer, of the effectiveness of 
the design and 
operation of 
our disclosure controls 
and procedures. 
 Based on 
the foregoing, 
the 
Chief Executive 
Officer 
and the 
Group Chief 
Financial 
Officer 
concluded 
that our 
 disclosure controls and procedures were effective.
 Changes to Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 During the 
fiscal quarter covered 
by this 
Quarterly Report on 
Form 10-Q, 
there were 
no changes 
in the 
Company's 
 internal 
control 
over 
financial 
reporting, 
as 
such 
term 
is 
defined 
in 
Rule 
13a-15(f) 
of 
the 
Exchange 
Act, 
that 
 materially 
affected, 
or 
are 
reasonably 
likely 
to 
materially 
affect, 
the 
Company s 
internal 
control 
over 
financial 
 reporting.

include multiple mining 
complexes across 
three states and 
are regulated by 
both the U.S. 
 Mine Safety 
and Health 
Administration, or 
MSHA, and 
state regulatory 
agencies. Under 
regulations mandated 
 by the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, or the Mine Act, MSHA inspects our U.S. mines on a regular 
 basis and issues various citations and orders when it believes 
a violation has occurred under the Mine Act. 
 In accordance

Section 1503(a) of 
the 
Dodd-Frank 
Wall 
Street 
Reform

attached 
to 
this

 Exhibit 95.1 
 Mine Safety Disclosures
 Safety is 
the cornerstone 
of our 
Company s 
values and 
is the 
number one 
priority for 
all employees 
at Coronado 
Global Resources. 
Our mining 
operation at 
Curragh, 
 located in Australia, is subject to regulation by the Queensland Department of Natural Resources, Mine and Energy, or DNRME, under the Coal Mining Safety and Health 
 Act 1999 (Qld). The operation of our mines located 
in the United States is subject to regulation by 
the Mine Safety and Health Administration, or MSHA, under the 
Federal 
 Mine Safety and Health Act 
of 1977, or the Mine 
Act. MSHA inspects these 
mines on a regular basis 
and issues various citations 
and orders when it believes 
a violation 
 has occurred 
under the 
Mine Act. 
We present 
information below 
regarding certain 
mining safety 
and health 
citations that 
MSHA has 
issued with 
respect to 
our mining 
 operations. In evaluating 
this information, consideration 
should be given 
to factors 
such as: (i) 
the number of 
citations and orders 
will vary 
depending on the 
size of the 
 mine; (ii) the 
number of citations 
issued will vary 
from inspector to 
inspector and mine 
to mine; and 
(iii) citations and 
orders can be 
contested and appealed 
and, in that 
 process, are often reduced 
in severity and amount, 
and are sometimes dismissed. 
Since MSHA is a 
branch of the U.S. Department 
of Labor, 
its jurisdiction only applies 
 to our operations in the United States. 
As such, the mine safety disclosures included herein do 
not contain information related to our Australian mines. 
 Under the Dodd-Frank 
Act, each operator 
of a coal or 
other mine is required 
to include certain 
mine safety results 
within its periodic 
reports filed with 
the Securities and 
 Exchange Commission, 
or the 
SEC. As 
required 
by the 
reporting requirements 
included 
in 1503(a) 
of the 
Dodd-Frank 
Act and 
Item 
104 of 
Regulation 
S-K (17 
CFR 
 229.104), we present the 
following items regarding certain 
mining safety and health 
matters, for the quarter 
ended September 30, 
2024, for each 
of our U.S. 
mine locations 
 that are covered under the scope of the Dodd-Frank 
Act. 
 The table that 
follows reflects 
citations and orders 
issued to us 
by MSHA during 
the quarter ended 
September 30, 2024. 
The table only 
includes those U.S. 
mines that 
 were issued orders or citations during this period, and commensurate with SEC regulations, does not reflect orders or citations issued to 
independent contractors working 
 at our mines. 
The proposed assessments 
for the quarter 
ended September 30, 
2024, are estimates 
provided by the 
operations and not 
from the MSHA 
Data Retrieval 
 System, since MSHA has not updated the proposed 
assessments on its system this quarter.
