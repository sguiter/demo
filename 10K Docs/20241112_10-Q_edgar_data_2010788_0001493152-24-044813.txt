controlling interest at September 30, 2024, and as of the date of this report holds an approximate minority interest. Prior to January 14, 2022, MDB Capital, a subsidiary of MDB, owned a majority interest in
Invizyne. On January 14, 2022, in a corporate reorganization, MDB Capital distributed 
of its equity interest in Invizyne to its members in proportion to their respective interests. 

On
June 1 st , 2022, the Company signed a joint venture with Neuractas Therapeutics, a preclinical company developing high impact
therapeutics, to work with the Company on deuterated cannabinoid molecules, for which the Company has filed a provisional patent application.
No business activities have occurred to date. The Company follows Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 323-10, Investments-Equity

Going
Concern 

These
financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which implies that the Company will continue to realize its assets
and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company incurred a net loss of and during the
nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and had cash flows from operations of ) and ) for the
nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Management believes that the Company s remaining cash on hand for
one year from the date the financials are issued will not be sufficient to meet its liabilities and obligations as and when they fall
due through the next year without additional financial support which raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue
as a going concern. The continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon the continued financial support from its shareholders,
the ability to raise equity or debt financing, and the attainment of profitable operations from the Company s future business.
These financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification
of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

of Common Stock. The proceeds will be used in the expansion of its production capabilities, staffing, R D and other working capital
requirements, and repayment of approximately in
intercompany loans from its parent company, MDB Capital Holdings, LLC as of November 13,2024. 

Based
on its working capital of approximately after the IPO, and its program of seeking various grants, the Company believes it
will maintain adequate capital to pursue its operational objectives.

ROU
assets represent the Company s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term, and lease liabilities represent the Company s
obligation to make lease payments. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on
the present value of lease payments over the lease term. The Company uses the implicit rate in its lease calculations when it is readily
determinable. Since the Company s leases do not provide implicit rates, to determine the present value of lease payments, management
uses the Company s estimated incremental borrowing rate for a fully collateralized loan with a similar term of the lease that is
based on the information available at the inception of the lease.

DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Overview 

Invizyne
is a bio-technology, pre-revenue, development stage company, which as of the date of this report is an approximate 48 owned
subsidiary of MDB Capital Holdings, LLC. Management believes that Invizyne s technology is a differentiated and unique
synthetic biology platform. Management believes the platform will enable scalable production of chemical molecules found in nature
in a process that is alternative to and more environmentally friendly and sustainable than the typical methods used today, such as
chemical synthesis, natural extraction, and synthetic biology. Invizyne believes its technology could significantly change
biomanufacturing through leveraging cell-free, multi-step enzyme-based systems that will be able to transform natural or renewable
resources into sought after chemicals. The objective with SimplePath, the Invizyne synthetic biology platform, as it is
developed over time, for diverse range of select chemicals will enable the production of pharmaceuticals, fuels, materials, food
additives, and novel compounds.

Operating
Income. For the nine-months and three-months periods ended September 30, 2024, there has been no operating income activity. 

General
and Administrative Costs . During the three-months and nine-months periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively,
several factors contributed to changes in various expense categories: 

Compensation
 Expense: The increase in compensation expense during the three-month and nine-month periods ending September 30, 2024, resulted from
 the recruitment of additional administrative staff, in the latter half of 2023, who are not covered by grants. 2024 results represents the ongoing costs of the additional hires in 2023. 

Professional
 Fees: The increase in professional fees compared to previous periods was due to higher consulting costs related to operations and
 the expenses of the initial public offering. Along with higher legal, tax, audit, and consulting costs associated with completing
 year-end financial audits and preparing for the initial public offering. 

Information
 Technology Costs: The increase in costs for the three-month and nine-month periods ending September 30, 2024, were negligible compared
 to the same period in the previous year. 

Other
 General and Administrative Costs: The decrease in costs for the three-month and nine-month periods ending September 30, 2024, were
 negligible compared to the same period in the previous year . 

Research
and Development Costs . For the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024, there was an increase of 1,171,368, respectively,
in research and development costs due to an increase in salaries, lab expenses and a decrease in grant funding. It is important to note
that the fluctuation in grant funding was due to completion of certain grants and is expected to fluctuate throughout the year.

Financial
Condition: The increase in assets was due to changes in several asset classes. The decrease in grants receivable was driven
by completion of certain grants. The increase in prepaid expenses was due to 284,602 of deferred IPO costs between the periods. The
increase in property and equipment was due to the purchase of lab equipment. The decrease in operating lease right-of-use assets resulted
from the usage and payments of office space during the period. 

The
increase in liabilities were a result of funds loaned by the parent company to be used to fund operations. The decrease in
operating lease liability was due to normal lease liability payments during the period. 

The
equity decrease was driven by the accumulated deficit generated through operational activities.

On
September 30, 2024, the Company had working capital of (4,379,709), as compared to working capital of (1,201,680) on December 31, 2023,
reflecting a decrease in working capital of 3,178,029. This decrease in working capital was primarily the result of a reduction in grant
reimbursements over the period and the increase in accounts due to affiliates, which were used to pay certain expenses of the Company
and to cover general operating expenses. On September 30, 2024, the Company had cash of 233,935 available to fund its operation. 

On
November 11, 2024, the Company signed a firm commitment underwriting agreement for its IPO, in which it sold an aggregate of 1,875,000
shares of Common Stock, for gross proceeds of 15,000,000, and
net proceeds of approximately 14,321,686. The proceeds will be used in the expansion of its production capabilities, staffing, R D
and other working capital requirements, and repayment of approximately 4,393,022 in intercompany loans from its parent company, MDB
Capital Holdings, LLC. 

In
a private placement Concurrent Private Offering completed concurrently with the IPO, the Company sold to accredited investors
an aggregate of 93,750 warrants to purchase up to 93,750 shares of Common Stock (the Private Warrants ). The Private Warrants
were sold at a purchase price of 0.125. The Private Warrants have an exercise price of 8.00 per share, are exercisable beginning six
months after issuance, and expire five years from the date of issuance. The Private Warrants have a cashless exercise provision and registration
rights for the underlying shares of Common Stock. The gross proceeds from the Concurrent Private Offering were approximately 11,719,
and if the Private Warrants are fully exercised, for cash, the Company will receive up to 750,000. 

In
October 2024, the Company received an additional cost share grant from the Department of Defense (DOD) BioMADE initiative to help fund
next steps toward cell-free biomanufacturing of isobutanol in the amount of approximately 1,000,000 against our own required expenses
of an equal amount. The Company intends to pursue additional grants which will further improve its working capital position. 

Based
on its working capital of approximately 9,941,977 after the IPO, and its program of seeking various grants, the Company believes it
will not need to raise capital in the immediate future. If, however, it does require capital, it may sell its equity securities,
seek institutional and bank funding, borrow from its affiliates, for which there are no arrangements or obligations in place at this
time, and sell or license various of its intellectual property rights. 

18 

Operating

an increased research and development activity, as well as increased general and administrative costs.

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements 

See
Note 2 in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the discussion on recently accounting pronouncements. 

Critical
Accounting Estimates 

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with general accepted accounting principles in the United States requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
We have identified certain accounting policies as being critical because they require us to make difficult, subjective, or complex judgments
about matters that are uncertain. We believe that the judgment, estimates, and assumptions used in the preparation of our unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements and unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are appropriate given the factual circumstances
at the time. However, actual results could differ, and the use of other assumptions or estimates could result in material differences
in our results of operations or financial condition. Our critical accounting estimates are: 

Accounting
for Research Grants 

Invizyne
receives grant reimbursements, which are netted against research and development expenses in the unaudited condensed consolidated statement
of operations. Grant reimbursements for capitalized assets are recognized over the useful life of the assets, with the unrecognized portion
considered a deferred liability and are included in accounts payable and accrued expenses in the unaudited condensed consolidated balance
sheet. 

Grants
that operate on a reimbursement basis are recognized on the accrual basis are revenues to extent of disbursements and commitments that
are allowable for reimbursement of allowable expenses incurred as of September 30, 2024 and 2023 and expected to be received from funding
sources in the subsequent year. Management considers such receivables at September 30, 2024 and 2023, to be fully collectable, due to
the historical experience with the Federal Government of the United States of America. Accordingly, no allowance for grants receivable
was recorded in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 

Research
grants received from organizations are subject to the contract agreement as to how Invizyne conducts its research activities, and Invizyne
is required to comply with the agreement terms relating to those grants. Amounts received under research grants are nonrefundable, regardless
of the success of the underlying research project, to the extent that such amounts are expended in accordance with the approved grant
project. Invizyne is permitted to draw down (a process of submitting expenses for reimbursement) the research grants after incurring
the related expenses. Amounts received under research grants are offset against the related research and development costs in the Company s
unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations. 

Summary
of Business Activities and Plans 

On November 11, 2024, the Company signed a firm commitment underwriting
agreement for its initial public offering (IPO) with a closing date of November 13, 2024, which consisted of the sale of an aggregate
of _1,875,000 shares of Common Stock. The public offering price was 8.00 per share, for gross proceeds of 15,000,000. The
underwriter may exercise its overallotment option for up to an additional 281,250 shares until December 26, 2024. The net proceeds are
estimated to be 14,321,686 as of the date of this report. The proceeds will be used for the development of Invizyne, expansion of production
capabilities, increased staff and related expenses, R D expenses, repayment of a related party loan and other general corporate and
working capital requirements. 

External
Risks Associated with the Company s Business Activities 

Inflation
Risk . The Company does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on its operations to date, other than its impact
on the general economy. 

Supply
Chain Issues . The Company does not currently expect that supply chain issues will have a significant impact on its business
activities. 

Potential
Recession . There are various indications that the United States economy may be entering a recessionary period. Although unclear
at this time an economic recession would likely impact the general business environment and the capital markets, which could, in turn,
if there is a recession, such an event could affect the Company. 

The
Company is continuing to monitor these matters and will adjust its current business and financing plans as more information and guidance
become available. 

Technology.
 The Company endeavors to create and bring new technologies to the market may never come to fruition or might not reach a
level of development sufficient for commercial viability. Even if they do achieve a commercial level of development, the acceptance of
these technologies within the marketplace is uncertain. There s a possibility that the technologies they develop may not gain widespread
or timely acceptance. Moreover, technologies from our Company that undergo regulatory scrutiny, testing, and approval may ultimately
fail to receive the necessary approvals from relevant regulatory bodies. 

Trends,
Events and Uncertainties 

Other
than as discussed above, we are not currently aware of any trends, events or uncertainties that are likely to have a material effect
on our financial condition in the near term, although it is possible that new trends or events may develop in the future that could have
a material effect on our financial condition.

3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

As
a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide this information. 

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures 

The
Company, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Vice President, Finance, evaluated, as of the end of the period
covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, and
as a result of the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting described below, the Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Accounting Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, the disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the
reasonable assurance level. 

Ongoing
Remediation of Previously Identified Material Weakness 

There
are no ongoing remediation of previously identified material weakness. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in the internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d)
and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the nine-months ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are
reasonably likely to materially affect, the internal control over financial reporting. 

Inherent
Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 

The
Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Vice President, Finance, believes that disclosure controls and
procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and
are effective at the reasonable assurance level. However, management does not expect that the disclosure controls and procedures or the
internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived
and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the
inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances
of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions
about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under
all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements
due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

PART
II OTHER INFORMATION 

Item
1. Legal Proceedings 

We
are not currently a party to any material legal proceedings, and we are not aware of any pending or threatened litigation that would
have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, cash flows, or financial condition should such litigation be resolved
unfavorably. We believe that from time to time we will have commercial disputes arising in the ordinary course of our business. 

Item
1A. Risk Factors 

In
addition to the information set forth in this Form 10-Q, you should also carefully review and consider the risk factors contained in
our other registration statements, reports and periodic filings with the SEC that could materially and adversely affect our business,
financial condition, and results of operations. The risk factors we have identified and discussed, however, do not identify all risks
that we face because our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not known to us or that we currently
consider to be immaterial to our operations. 

Item
2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 

In a private placement Concurrent Private Offering completed
concurrently with the completion of the initial public offering by the Company of its shares of Common Stock, it sold to accredited investors
an aggregate of 93,750 warrants to purchase up to 93,750 shares of Common Stock (the Private Warrants ). The Private Warrants
were sold at a purchase price of 0.125. The Private Warrants have an exercise price of 8.00 per share, are exercisable beginning six
months after issuance, and expire five years from the date of issuance. The Private Warrants have a demand and multiple piggy back registration
rights for the underlying shares of Common Stock starting six months after issuance, may be exercised on a cashless basis, and have other
terms that are typical of investor warrants such as anti-dilution rights and blocker provisions. The Private Warrants and underlying shares
are subject to a one-year lock up from the date of issuance. The gross proceeds from the Concurrent Private Offering were approximately
 11,719, and if the Private Warrants are fully exercised, for cash, the Company will receive up to 750,000. The offer and sale of the
Private Warrants and the shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Private Warrants are not being registered under the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act and are being offered pursuant to the exemption from registration provided
in Section 4(a)(2) under the Securities Act and/or Rule 506(b) promulgated thereunder.
