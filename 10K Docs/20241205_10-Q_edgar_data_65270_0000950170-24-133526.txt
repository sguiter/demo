- from the time control transfers. As the Company s standard payment terms are less than one year, the Company has elected the practical expedient under Accounting Standards Codification ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers to not assess whether a contract has a significant financing component. Contract balances The Company receives payment from customers based on the contractual billing schedule and specific performance requirements established in the contract. Billings are recorded as accounts receivable when an unconditional right to the contractual consideration exists. A contract asset is an entity s right to consideration in exchange for goods or services that the entity has transferred to a customer. A contract liability exists when an entity has received consideration, or the amount is due from the customer in advance of revenue recognition. Contract assets and contract liabilities are recognized in other current assets and other accrued liabilities, respectively in the condensed consolidated balance sheets and were immaterial as of November 2, 2024 and April 27, 2024.

Effective tax rate 

() 

The effective tax rate for the three and six months ended November 2, 2024 differs from the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of primarily due to an increase in a valuation allowance for U.S. deferred tax assets and an unfavorable impact of the global intangible low-tax income GILTI ), partially offset by the impact of income derived from foreign operations with lower statutory tax rates, research deductions claimed in foreign jurisdictions and foreign exchange loss. The effective tax rate for the three and six months ended October 28, 2023 differs from the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of primarily due to the impact of an impairment of goodwill which is non-deductible for tax purposes, income derived from foreign operations with lower statutory tax rates and research deductions claimed in foreign jurisdictions, offset by an unfavorable impact of GILTI. As of November 2, 2024 , the Company determined that recovery of some of its U.S. deferred tax assets was not more likely than not, and a valuation allowance of million has been recorded on those deferred tax assets, based on the evaluation of all available evidence. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development s OECD Pillar II Initiative introduced a global minimum tax for certain multinational groups exceeding minimum annual global revenue thresholds. Some countries in which the Company operates have enacted legislation adopting the minimum tax effective January 1, 2024. To date, the Company has determined that there is an immaterial global minimum tax liability as a result of Pillar II, as certain tax jurisdictions either will not have Pillar II enacted until after December 31, 2024, or have satisfied the safe harbor test to prevent any minimum tax under Pillar II. The Company continues to monitor its jurisdictions for any changes and include any appropriate minimum tax throughout the fiscal year. The Company s gross unrecognized income tax benefits were million and million as of November 2, 2024 and April 27, 2024 , respectively. If any portion of the Company s unrecognized tax benefits is recognized, it would impact the Company s effective tax rate. The unrecognized tax benefits are reviewed periodically and adjusted for changing facts and circumstances, such as tax audits, the lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations and changes in tax law. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax uncertainties in income tax expense. Accrued interest and penalties were million and million as of November 2, 2024 and April 27, 2024 , respectively.

Accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts Accounts receivable are customer obligations due under normal trade terms and are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. The Company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts based on the current expected credit loss impairment model. The Company applies a historical loss rate based on historic write-offs to aging categories. The historical loss rate is adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future losses as necessary. The Company may also record a specific reserve for individual accounts when it becomes aware of specific customer circumstances, such as in the case of a bankruptcy filing or deterioration in the customer s operating results or financial position.

Assets held for sale The Company classifies long-lived assets to be sold as held for sale in the period in which all of the required criteria under ASC 360 Property, Plant, and Equipment are met. The Company initially measures a long-lived asset that is classified as held for sale at the lower of its carrying value or fair value less any costs to sell. Upon determining that a long-lived asset meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale, the Company ceases depreciation and reports long-lived assets as Assets held for sale on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Assets held for sale at November 2, 2024 consists of one non-core real estate asset. Assets held for sale at April 27, 2024 consisted of three non-core real estate assets, two of which were sold in the three months ended November 2, 2024.

The Company tests goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis as of the beginning of the fourth quarter each fiscal year. In addition, the Company continuously monitors for events and circumstances that could negatively impact the key assumptions used in determining fair value and therefore require interim goodwill impairment testing, including long-term revenue growth projections, profitability, discount rates, volatility in the Company's market capitalization, and general industry, market and macroeconomic conditions. No impairment indicators were identified in the second quarter of fiscal 2025. October 28, 2023 goodwill impairment During the three months ended October 28, 2023, the Company identified an impairment triggering event associated with a sustained decrease in the Company s publicly quoted share price, market capitalization and lower than expected operating results. These factors suggested that the fair value of one or more of the Company s reporting units may have fallen below their carrying amounts. As a result, the Company performed an interim quantitative impairment test and recognized a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of million for reporting units in its Automotive segment.

The Company entered into the cross-currency swap to mitigate changes in net assets due to changes in U.S. dollar-euro spot exchange rate. Hedge effectiveness is assessed at the inception of the hedging relationship and quarterly thereafter, under the spot-to-spot method. The Company recognizes the impact of all other changes in fair value of the derivative, which represents the interest rate differential of the cross-currency swap, through interest expense. For the three months ended November 2, 2024 and October 28, 2023 , the Company recorded gains of million and million, respectively, in interest expense, net in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.

Included in AOCI related to this net investment hedge were cumulative gains of million and million, respectively, as of November 2, 2024 and April 27, 2024. Interest rate swaps The Company utilizes interest rate swaps to limit its exposure to market fluctuations on its variable-rate borrowings. The interest rate swaps effectively convert a portion of the Company's variable rate borrowings to a fixed rate based upon a determined notional amount. The Company has an interest rate swap, maturing on , with a notional value of million million). The interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges. Hedge effectiveness is assessed at the inception of the hedging relationship and quarterly thereafter. The effective portion of the periodic changes in fair value is recognized in AOCI in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Subsequently, the accumulated gains and losses recorded in AOCI are reclassified to income in the period during which the hedged cash flow impacts earnings, which are expected to be immaterial over the next 12 months. No ineffectiveness was recognized in the three or six months ended November 2, 2024 and October 28, 2023. Derivatives not designated as hedges The Company uses short-term foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the earnings impact that exchange rate fluctuations have on non-functional currency balance sheet exposures. These forward contracts are not designated as hedging instruments.

 million in compensatory damages and million in punitive damages. On April 22, 2020, the District Court entered a permanent injunction barring defendants from selling infringing products and ordering them to return Hetronic s confidential information. Defendants appealed entry of the permanent injunction. On May 29, 2020, the District Court held defendants in contempt for violating the permanent injunction and entered the final judgment. Defendants appealed entry of the final monetary judgment as well. The appeal of the permanent injunction and the appeal of the final judgment were consolidated into a single appeal before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. On August 24, 2021, the Tenth Circuit issued a decision affirming the lower court s ruling with the exception that it instructed the District Court to modify the injunction from the entire world to all of the countries in which Hetronic sells its products. On April 20 and 21, 2022, the District Court held a hearing related to modifying the injunction pursuant to the Tenth Circuit s opinion, and the parties have filed post-hearing briefs. The defendants also filed a petition for certiorari with the United States Supreme Court seeking to further appeal the extraterritorial application of the Lanham Act in this case. The Company opposed that petition. The Supreme Court requested the views of the Solicitor General on the petition for certiorari, and the Solicitor General recommended granting the petition. On November 4, 2022, the Supreme Court granted the petition. The Supreme Court heard arguments in this matter on March 21, 2023. On June 29, 2023, the Supreme Court vacated the Tenth Circuit s August 2021 decision and remanded the matter back to the Tenth Circuit for further proceedings. On September 1, 2023, the Tenth Circuit requested supplemental briefing from the parties regarding the effect of the Supreme Court s decision on the appeal and the proper course of further proceedings. That briefing was thereafter submitted, and the Tenth Circuit heard argument in this matter on January 24, 2024. On April 23, 2024, the Tenth Circuit issued an opinion affirming the District Court s final judgment on the state law breach of contract and tort claims (this affirmed final judgment amount represents only approximately million of the vacated original million final judgment that had been entered in 2020) and remanding for further non-trial proceedings with respect to the appropriate remedies for the Lanham Act claims in light of the Supreme s Court ruling that the Lanham Act does not apply extraterritorially. On August 5, 2024, the District Court entered an amended permanent injunction and amended final judgment. The amended permanent injunction limited the geographic reach of the permanent injunction barring defendants from selling infringing products so that it only applies in the United States and reaffirmed the court s prior order requiring defendants to return Hetronic s confidential information. The amended final judgment reaffirmed the final judgment of approximately million plus interest for the state law breach of contract and tort claims and entered judgment in an amended amount of approximately million plus interest for the infringing U.S. sales under the Lanham Act. The deadline for any appeals of the District Court s orders was September 4, 2024 and no appeal of those orders was filed before that deadline. The Company has not received payment of any portion of the judgment from the defendants. Like any judgment, particularly a judgment involving defendants outside of the United States, there is no guarantee that the Company will be able to collect all or any portion of the judgment. Furthermore, defendants Abitron Germany and Hetronic Germany filed for insolvency in German court in September and October 2023 respectively, and the Germany insolvency court then appointed a receiver. These insolvency proceedings could potentially adversely impact our ability to enforce or collect upon the judgment or portions of the judgment or otherwise pursue or enforce claims or rights against those defendants.

 Overview 
 We are a leading global supplier of custom engineered solutions with sales, engineering and manufacturing locations in North America, Europe, Middle East and Asia. We design, engineer and produce mechatronic products for Original Equipment Manufacturers OEMs utilizing our broad range of technologies for user interface, light-emitting diode LED lighting system, power distribution and sensor applications. 
 Our solutions are found in the end markets of transportation (including automotive, commercial vehicle, e-bike, aerospace, bus and rail), cloud computing infrastructure, construction equipment and consumer appliance. 
 Macroeconomic Conditions 
 The global economy continues to experience volatile disruptions including to the commodity, labor and transportation markets, arising from a combination of geopolitical events and various economic and financial factors. These disruptions have affected our operations and may continue to affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. As a result of continued inflation, we have implemented measures to mitigate certain adverse effects of higher costs. However, we have been unable to fully mitigate or pass through the increases in our costs to our customers, which will likely continue in the future. 
 Our business in the future will be impacted by the broad trend of electrification. The adoption of EVs has been slower than anticipated, which may impact our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, there are various government policies, subsidies, and economic incentives designed to increase EV adoption. There is no guarantee these incentive programs will be available in the future. 
 Geopolitical Conditions 
 Russia s invasion of Ukraine and the resulting economic sanctions imposed by the international community impacted the global economy and gave rise to potential global security issues that may adversely affect international business and economic conditions. Given our manufacturing operations in the Middle East and Asia, the continuation of the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the escalation or expansion of the Israel-Hamas war, or renewed terrorist attacks on Red Sea shipping, such as those by the Houthi, could lead to other supply chain disruptions, increased inflationary pressures, higher freight costs and volatility in global markets and industries that could negatively impact our operations. The full impact of the conflicts on our business operations and financial performance remains uncertain and will depend on future developments, including the severity and duration of the conflicts and their impact on regional and global economic conditions. We will continue to monitor the conflicts and assess the related restrictions and other effects on our employees, customers, suppliers and business. 
 Global Supply Chain Disruptions 
 Although we saw improvements in our supply chain in fiscal 2024, including easing of the worldwide semiconductor supply shortage, new supply chain disruptions may occur in the future. In addition, we have experienced, and may continue to experience, business interruptions, including customer shutdowns and increased material and logistics costs and labor shortages. We could also be impacted by changes in government regulations in areas including, but not limited to, trade and tariff regulations, which would increase our costs. We continue to work closely with suppliers and customers to minimize the potential adverse impact from global supply chain disruptions. However, if we are not able to mitigate any direct or indirect supply chain disruptions, this may have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
 Consolidated Results of Operations 
 We maintain our financial records on the basis of a 52 or 53-week fiscal year ending on the Saturday closest to April 30. Fiscal 2025 is a 53-week year and fiscal 2024 was a 52-week year. For the three months ended November 2, 2024, our accounting period included 14 weeks compared to 13 weeks for the three months ended October 28, 2023. For the six months ended November 2, 2024, our accounting period included 27 weeks compared to 26 weeks for the six months ended October 28, 2023. The following discussions of comparative results among periods should be reviewed in this context.

 Net sales decreased 26.6 million, or 4.6 , to 551.1 million in the six months ended November 2, 2024, compared to 577.7 million in the six months ended October 28, 2023. Foreign currency translation increased net sales by 2.6 million. Excluding foreign currency translation, net sales decreased 29.2 million. The decrease was primarily due to lower sales volumes in the Automotive segment, partially offset by higher sales volumes in the Industrial segment. 
 Cost of products sold 
 Cost of products sold decreased 1.0 million, or 0.4 , to 234.7 million (80.2 of net sales) in the three months ended November 2, 2024, compared to 235.7 million (81.8 of net sales) in the three months ended October 28, 2023. Foreign currency translation increased cost of products sold by 3.3 million. Excluding foreign currency translation, cost of products sold decreased 4.3 million. The decrease was primarily due to lower freight and warranty costs, partially offset by higher salary expense. 
 Cost of products sold decreased 22.8 million, or 4.8 , to 448.6 million (81.4 of net sales) in the six months ended November 2, 2024, compared to 471.4 million (81.6 of net sales) in the six months ended October 28, 2023. Foreign currency translation increased cost of products sold by 2.0 million. Excluding foreign currency translation, cost of products sold decreased 24.8 million. The decrease was primarily due to lower material and freight costs as a result of a decrease in sales volumes, partially offset by higher salary expense.

 The increase in gross profit margin in both periods was primarily a result of product mix from higher sales in the Industrial segment and lower operating expenses. 
 Selling and administrative expenses 
 Selling and administrative expenses increased 1.7 million, or 4.2 , to 42.6 million (14.6 of net sales) in the three months ended November 2, 2024, compared to 40.9 million (14.2 of net sales) in the three months ended October 28, 2023.

 The effective tax rate for the three and six months ended November 2, 2024 was higher than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21 primarily due to an increase in a valuation allowance for U.S. deferred tax assets and global intangible low-tax income, partially offset by the impact of income derived from foreign operations with lower statutory tax rates, research deductions claimed in foreign jurisdictions and foreign exchange loss. The effective tax rate for the three and six months ended October 28, 2023 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21 primarily due to income derived from foreign operations with lower statutory tax rates and research deductions claimed in foreign jurisdictions, partially offset by global intangible low-tax income and non-deductible expenses. 
 Net loss 
 Net loss was 1.6 million in the three months ended November 2, 2024, compared to 55.3 million in the three months ended October 28, 2023.

 Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our liquidity requirements are primarily to fund our business operations, including capital expenditures and working capital requirements, as well as to fund debt service requirements, dividends and stock repurchases. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations, existing cash balances and borrowings under our senior secured credit agreement. We believe our liquidity position will be sufficient to fund our existing operations and current commitments for at least the next twelve months. However, if economic conditions remain impacted for longer than we expect due to supply chain disruptions, inflationary pressure or other geopolitical risks, or if we are unable to maintain compliance with our debt covenants, our liquidity position could be severely impacted. 
 As of November 2, 2024, we had 97.0 million of cash and cash equivalents, of which 49.8 million was held in subsidiaries outside the U.S. Cash held by these subsidiaries is used to fund operational activities and can be repatriated, primarily through the payment of dividends and the repayment of intercompany loans, without creating material additional income tax expense. 
 Repurchases of Common Stock 
 On March 31, 2021, as subsequently amended on June 16, 2022, the Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to 200.0 million of our outstanding common stock through June 14, 2024 (the 2021 Buyback Authorization ). On June 13, 2024, the Board of Directors approved a new share buyback authorization, commencing on June 17, 2024, for the purchase of up to 200.0 million of our outstanding common stock through June 17, 2026 (the 2024 Buyback Authorization ). Purchases may be made on the open market, including pursuant to purchase plans designed to comply with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or in private transactions. Prior to its expiration, a total of 3,553,961 shares were purchased under the 2021 Buyback Authorization at a total cost of 134.6 million. No further shares can be purchased under the 2021 Buyback Authorization. In the three and six months ended November 2, 2024, zero and 136,000 shares were purchased under the 2021 Buyback Authorization and no shares were purchased under the 2024 Buyback Authorization. As of November 2, 2024, the dollar value of shares that remained available to be purchased under 2024 Buyback Authorization was 200.0 million. 
 Amended Credit Agreement 
 On October 31, 2022, we entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent, Swing Line Lender and L/C Issuer, and the Lenders and other parties named therein. On March 6, 2024, we entered into a First Amendment to Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the First Amendment and on July 9, 2024, we entered into a Second Amendment to Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and First Amendment to Second Amended and Restated Guaranty (the Second Amendment with Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent, Swing Line Lender and L/C Issuer, the other Lenders party thereto and other parties thereto.

The Credit Agreement, as amended by the First Amendment and the Second Amendment, is referred to herein as the Amended Credit Agreement. 
 The Amended Credit Agreement provides for a secured multicurrency revolving credit facility of 500 million. In addition, the Amended Credit Agreement permits us to increase the revolving commitments and/or add one or more tranches of term loans under the Amended Credit Agreement from time to time by up to an amount equal to (i) 250 million plus (ii) an additional amount so long as the consolidated leverage ratio would not exceed 3.00:1.00 on a pro forma basis, subject to, among other things, the receipt of additional commitments from existing and/or new lenders. The Amended Credit Agreement matures on October 31, 2027.

Table of Contents 

 As of November 2, 2024, the outstanding balance under the revolving credit facility consisted of 297.9 million 275.0 million) of euro-denominated borrowings and 45.0 million of US denominated borrowings. The Amended Credit Agreement contains various representations and warranties, financial covenants (including covenants requiring us to maintain compliance with a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio and a maximum consolidated leverage ratio, in each case as of the end of each fiscal quarter of the Company), restrictive and other covenants, and events of default. The covenants in the Amended Credit Agreement include an anti-cash hoarding requirement, as discussed above. As of November 2, 2024, we were in compliance with all the covenants in the Amended Credit Agreement. For further information, see Note 8, Debt to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Report. 
 Although we currently anticipate, based on our current projections and analyses, that we will be in compliance with the financial covenants contained in the Amended Credit Agreement, no assurance can be given that we will be and remain in compliance with such covenants in the future. Factors that could increase our risk of future non-compliance include those identified in Part I Item 1A, Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended April 27, 2024, as supplemented by subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including under Part II Item 1A, Risk Factors of this Quarterly Report.

 Net cash used in operating activities was 37.1 million in the six months ended November 2, 2024, compared to 6.2 million in the six months ended October 28, 2023. The increase was due to a higher net loss adjusted for non-cash items and higher cash outflows from operating assets and liabilities. The 54.7 million of cash outflows for operating assets and liabilities in the six months ended November 2, 2024 was primarily due to higher inventory and lower other liabilities, partially offset by lower accounts receivable. 
 Investing activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 21.0 million in the six months ended November 2, 2024, compared to 22.3 million in the six months ended October 28, 2023. Capital expenditures were 24.0 million in the six months ended November 2, 2024, compared to 24.5 million in the six months ended October 28, 2023. In the six months ended November 2, 2024, we received proceeds of 3.0 million from the sale of assets, compared to 1.6 million in the six months ended October 28, 2023. 
 Financing activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 8.1 million in the six months ended November 2, 2024, compared to net cash provided by financing activities of 1.9 million in the six months ended October 28, 2023. In the six months ended November 2, 2024, we used 1.6 million of cash for the purchase of shares under the 2021 Buyback Authorization, compared to 7.8 million in the six months ended October 28, 2023. We paid cash dividends of 10.0 million in the six months ended November 2, 2024, compared to 10.1 million in the six months ended October 28, 2023. In the six months ended November 2, 2024, we had net proceeds from borrowings of 5.9 million, compared to net proceeds from borrowings of 34.6 million in the six months ended October 28, 2023. In the six months ended November 2, 2024, we paid 1.8 million of debt issuance costs associated with the Second Amendment. In the six months ended October 28, 2023, we paid 10.9 million for the purchase of redeemable noncontrolling interests related to Nordic Lights.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, we performed an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including our Chief Executive Officer CEO and our Chief Financial Officer CFO ), of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s applicable rules and forms. As a result of this evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of November 2, 2024 due to the material weaknesses that were previously reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended April 27, 2024. 
 Notwithstanding the ineffectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures due to the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we believe there are no material inaccuracies or omissions of material fact in this this Quarterly Report, and, to the best of our knowledge, we believe that the condensed consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q fairly present in all material aspects our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in conformity with GAAP. 
 Previously Disclosed Material Weaknesses 
 As previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended April 27, 2024, our management concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective due to a material weakness associated with ineffective information technology general controls (ITGCs) over one of its information technology (IT) systems that is relevant to the preparation of the financial information at a substantial portion of the Company s subsidiaries throughout the year ended April 27, 2024, which resulted in ineffective business process controls (automated and IT-dependent manual controls) that could result in misstatements potentially impacting significant financial statement accounts and disclosures. Specifically, management did not design and execute program change management controls to provide reasonable assurance that IT program changes affecting financial applications are authorized, tested, and implemented appropriately. As a result, business process controls (automated and IT-dependent manual controls) that are reliant on the affected ITGCs, or that use data produced from the affected systems, were deemed ineffective at April 27, 2024. 
 Management also identified a material weakness associated with ineffective controls over its impairment analyses for goodwill. Specifically, management did not retain sufficient contemporaneous documentation to demonstrate the operation of sufficiently precise review controls over certain significant assumptions used in the determination of fair value of its reporting units. 
 Management also identified a material weakness associated with ineffective controls related to the application of GAAP to non-routine events and conditions. Specifically, we did not design and maintain controls to properly evaluate all of the events and conditions relevant to the Company s going concern evaluation, including the assessment and disclosure of management s plans in accordance with GAAP. 
 We are committed to maintaining a strong internal control environment. We and our Board of Directors treat the controls surrounding, and the integrity of, our financial statements with the utmost priority. Management is committed to the planning and implementation of remediation efforts to address control deficiencies and any other identified areas of risk. These remediation efforts are intended to both address the identified material weaknesses and to enhance our overall financial control environment.

Table of Contents 

 Our remediation efforts include, among other items, (1) enhancing the design and operating effectiveness of internal controls over IT change management, review of significant assumptions used in goodwill impairment analyses, and the application of GAAP to non-routine events and conditions; and (2) developing and deploying additional training programs around the operation and importance of these controls. 
 As we continue to evaluate and work to improve our internal control over financial reporting, management may determine to take additional measures to strengthen controls or to modify the remediation plan described above. When fully implemented and operational, we believe the controls we have designed or plan to design will remediate the control deficiencies that led to the material weaknesses we have identified and strengthen our internal controls over financial reporting. The material weaknesses will not be considered remediated until the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 Except as described above, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended November 2, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 See Note 12, Contingencies to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Report for a description of certain of our pending legal proceedings. 
 Item 1A. Ri sk Factors 
 Our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows are subject to various risks which could cause actual results to vary from recent results or from anticipated future results. Please refer to Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended April 27, 2024, for a description of certain material risks and uncertainties to which our business, financial condition and results of operations are subject. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. 
 Except as updated below, there have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended April 27, 2024: 
 We are, and in the future may be, subject to securities class action and other litigation, as well as government investigations and inquiries, which may harm our business and results of operations. 
 We are involved in legal proceedings related to various matters, including securities litigation, and may become involved in other legal proceedings, as well as government investigations and inquiries, that arise from time to time in the future. For example, as discussed further in Note 12, Contingencies to the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements contained in this Report, on August 26, 2024, a purported shareholder of the Company filed a putative class action lawsuit alleging that the Company, its former Chief Executive Officer, and its former Chief Financial Officer violated the federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements relating to our business, operations and prospects, including in respect of our transition to production of more specialized components for manufacturers of electric vehicles and our operations at our facility in Monterrey, Mexico. The complaint seeks unspecified money damages along with equitable relief and costs and expenses, including counsel fees and expert fees. Another purported shareholder filed a substantially similar action against the same defendants and a former Chief Operating Officer of the Company on October 7, 2024. In addition, on November 26, 2024, a purported shareholder filed a derivative lawsuit on behalf of the Company against the current members of the Company s Board of Directors, as well as certain former directors and executives, alleging that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties by allowing the Company to issue various statements that are alleged to have been false or misleading for the same reasons alleged in the securities class action complaints. The Company intends to vigorously defend itself against the allegations but there can be no assurance as to outcome. An unfavorable outcome in this litigation and other legal proceedings may have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows or liquidity of the Company. This type of litigation can also result in substantial costs, and a diversion of management s attention and resources, which could adversely affect our business, operating results, or financial condition. In addition, the Company received a subpoena from the Securities and Exchange Commission dated November 1, 2024 seeking documents and information relating to, among other things, the Company s operations in certain foreign countries, and certain financial reporting and accounting relating thereto, compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws, and material weaknesses in the Company s internal control over financial reporting previously reported in its public filings. This request may lead to the assertion of claims or the commencement of legal proceedings against the Company, which in turn may lead to material fines, penalties or other liabilities. The subpoena and similar requests could result in costs to the Company, including the expenditure of financial and managerial resources in connection with responding to the subpoena and related investigation or any other future requests for information or investigations. Additionally, the dramatic increase in the cost of directors and officers liability insurance may cause us to opt for lower overall policy limits or to forgo insurance that we may otherwise rely on to cover any significant defense costs, settlements, and damages awarded to plaintiffs, or incur substantially higher costs to maintain the same or similar coverage. These factors may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified executive officers and members of our board of directors.

 LONG-TERM TIME-BASED 
 RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARD AGREEMENT 
 
 This Long-Term Time-Based Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement (the Award Agreement ), effective as of October 1, 2024 (the Award Date ), is entered into by and between Methode Electronics, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the Company and Laura Kowalchik (the Grantee ). 
 WHEREAS, the Company desires to encourage Grantee to continue to work for the benefit of the Company in a manner that will benefit all Company stockholders. 
 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual covenants and obligations set forth herein, the Company agrees to award to the Grantee Restricted Stock Units RSUs under the Methode Electronics, Inc. 2022 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the Plan on the terms and conditions set forth herein and in the Plan.

In the event of any conflict between the terms of this Award Agreement and the terms of the Plan, the terms of the Plan shall control.

4. Payment for RSUs . 

(a) The Company will pay one share of Common Stock to the Grantee for each vested Restricted Stock Unit during the two and one-half month period immediately following vesting under this Award Agreement. 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the Grantee is a specified employee within the meaning of Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) 

and the Award is considered to be nonqualified deferred compensation upon the Grantee s Separation from Service as defined below, any payment under this Award Agreement which results from a Separation from Service shall be delayed until the earlier of (i) first day of the seventh (7th) month beginning after the Grantee s Separation from Service, or (ii) the Grantee s death, if such a delay is necessary to avoid the imposition of additional tax and interest on the Grantee under Section 409A(a)(1)(B). 

5. Rights as Stockholder . The Grantee shall have no rights as a stockholder with respect to any RSUs. The Grantee will only have stockholder rights after a stock certificate is issued.

(b) except as provided in Section 8 below, if the Grantee s employment with the Company and its Affiliates is involuntarily terminated without Cause, then the unvested RSUs shall become vested pro rata based on the date of termination and payable as soon as reasonably possible following such termination date.

Exhibit A 
 
 Performance Period and Performance Criteria 
 
 22. Performance Period . The Performance Period is the period between April 29, 2024 and April 30, 2027. 

23. Performance Criteria . The Grantee s PSUs shall become vested based on the satisfaction of both the Time Measure and the Performance Measure, each as outlined below. 

24. Time Measure . Except to the extent provided in Section 7(b), 8(b), 8(c), and 8(d) of the Award Agreement, the Time Measure shall be satisfied based on Grantee s continued employment with the Company or a Subsidiary or Affiliate through the date the Committee has certified the Company s attainment of the Performance Measure, which shall occur immediately following the end of such Performance Period. 

25. Performance Measure . 

(a) The number of PSUs that would be delivered pursuant to this Exhibit A, assuming the Performance Measure described in this Section 4 has been attained at the Target Level, is listed in Section 2 of the Award Agreement. The final number of PSUs, if any, that will be delivered at the end of the Performance Period (defined above) shall be calculated as described below based upon the Payout Percentage (see table below in Section 4(c)). 

(b) The Performance Measure used to determine (1) the number of PSUs that will be earned as of the end of the Performance Period, and (2) the number of shares of Common Stock delivered upon settlement of such PSUs, shall be the Company s Annualized Total Stockholder Return Annualized TSR for the Performance Period, subject to and provided that a Change of Control has not occurred before the end of the Performance Period. 

(c) If the Company s Annualized TSR is between two of the designated performance levels below, the Payout Percentage shall be determined based on linear interpolation. No portion of this Award will be earned if the Company s performance during the Performance Period is below the threshold level of the Performance Criteria as described below. Any determination of performance under this Agreement shall be determined by the Committee in accordance with the Plan s terms.

(d) Annualized TSR shall be the Company s annualized total shareholder return, calculated as follows: 

Ending Average Stock Price+Reinvested Dividend AmountBeginning Average Stock Price1/n-1 
 
 where n is equal to 3, which is the number of years over which Annualized TSR is measured. 

The Ending Average Stock Price shall be calculated as the volume weighted average price for the Company s Common Stock for the last 20 trading days of the Performance Period. 
 
 The Beginning Average Stock Price shall be calculated as the volume weighted average price for the Company s Common Stock for the last 20 trading days prior to the first day of the Performance Period. 
 
 Reinvested Dividend Amount shall be calculated as the sum of the total dividends paid 1 on one share of Common Stock during the Performance Period, assuming reinvestment of such dividends in such Common Stock (based on the Closing Stock Price of such Stock on the ex-dividend date). For the avoidance of doubt, it is intended that the foregoing calculation of Reinvested Dividend Amount shall take into account not only the reinvestment of dividends in a share of Common Stock but also capital appreciation or depreciation in the shares of Common Stock deemed acquired by such reinvestment. 
 
 (e) As soon as administratively practicable after the end of the Performance Period, the Company s Annualized TSR shall be calculated and reviewed by the Committee. The Committee shall certify in writing the extent to which the Performance Measure has been satisfied and the Payout Percentage for the Award. 

(f) In addition to any other authority or powers granted to the Committee herein or in the Plan, the Committee shall have the authority to interpret and determine the application and calculation of any matter relating to the determination of Annualized TSR, including any terms in the Agreement or this Exhibit A related thereto. The Committee shall also have the power to make any and all adjustments it deems appropriate to reflect any changes in the Company s outstanding Common Stock, including by reason of subdivision or consolidation of Common Stock or other capital readjustment, the payment of a stock dividend on the Common Stock, other increase or reduction in the number of shares of Stock outstanding, recapitalizations, reorganizations, mergers, consolidations, combinations, split-ups, split-offs, spin-offs, exchanges or other relevant changes in capitalization or distributions to holders of Common Stock. The determination of the Committee with respect to any such matter shall be conclusive. 

1 	 The relevant date for determining whether a dividend is included in the calculation of Reinvested Dividend Amount is the ex-dividend date (and not the payment date). In the event that the stock of the Company goes ex-dividend during the Performance Period (including the 20-day trading period during which the Ending Average Stock Price is to be calculated), such dividend shall be included in the determination of Reinvested Dividend Amount, notwithstanding the fact that the payment date of such dividend may actually occur after the conclusion of the Performance Period. In the event that the stock of the Company goes ex-dividend prior to the commencement of the Performance Period (for example, during the 20-day trading period during which the Beginning Average Stock Price is to be calculated), such dividend shall not be included in the termination of Reinvested Dividend Amount, notwithstanding the fact that the payment date of such dividend may actually occur during the Performance Period.

Any determination by the Accounting Firm shall be binding upon the Company and Employee absent manifest error. 

6. Mitigation and Set-Off . Employee shall not be required to mitigate Employee s damages by seeking other employment or otherwise. The Company s obligations under this Agreement shall not be reduced in any way by reason of any compensation or benefits received (or foregone) by Employee from sources other than the Company after Employee s Employment Termination, or any amounts that might have been received by Employee in other employment had Employee sought other employment, except for the termination of benefits under a Welfare Benefit Plan pursuant to Section 1.3(ii) hereof.

8. Assignment, Successors . This Agreement may not be assigned by the Company without the written consent of Employee but the obligations of the Company under this Agreement shall be the binding legal obligations of any successor to the Company by merger or other business combination, and in the event of any business combination or transaction that results in the transfer of substantially all of the assets or business of the Company, the Company will cause the transferee to assume the obligations of the Company under this Agreement. This Agreement may not be assigned by Employee during Employee s life, and upon Employee s death will inure to the benefit of Employee s heirs, legatees and legal representatives of Employee s estate. 

9. Interpretation . The validity, interpretation, construction and performance of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Illinois, without regard to the conflict of law principles thereof. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement. 

10. Withholding . The Company may withhold from any payment that it is required to make under this Agreement amounts sufficient to satisfy applicable withholding requirements under any federal, state, local or foreign law or regulation. 

11. Amendment or Termination . This Agreement may be amended at any time by written agreement between the Company and Employee. The Company may terminate this Agreement by written notice given to Employee at least two (2) years prior to the effective date of such termination, provided that, if a Change in Control occurs prior to the effective date of such termination, the termination of this Agreement shall not be effective and Employee shall be entitled to the full benefits of this Agreement. Any such amendment or termination shall be made pursuant to a resolution of the Company s Board of Directors or Compensation Committee. 

12. Financing . Cash and benefit payments under this Agreement shall constitute general obligations of the Company. Employee shall have only an unsecured right to payment thereof out of the general assets of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may, by agreement with one or more trustees to be selected by the Company, create a trust on such terms, as the Company shall determine, to make payments to Employee in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. 

13. Severability . In the event that any provision or portion of this Agreement shall be determined to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall be unaffected thereby and shall remain in full force and effect. 

14. Arbitration . Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the breach hereof shall be adjudicated by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association AAA under its Employment Arbitration Rules, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Arbitration shall be by a single arbitrator, and the arbitration shall take place in Chicago, Illinois. The costs of the arbitration, including the fees of the arbitrator, cost of any record or transcripts of the arbitration hearing, administrative fees, and other similar fees and costs of arbitration shall be borne equally by the parties; provided, however, in the event of a dispute following or in connection with a Change in Control, the Company shall pay the fees of the arbitrator as well as such other fees and costs of arbitration. Judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction, and both parties consent and submit to the jurisdiction of such court for purposes of such action. Nothing in this Agreement shall preclude either party from seeking equitable relief from a court of competent jurisdiction.
