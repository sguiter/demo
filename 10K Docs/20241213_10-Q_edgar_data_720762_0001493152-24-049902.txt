NOTES
TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) 

For
the Three Month Periods Ended October 31, 2024 and 2023 

The
following (a) condensed consolidated balance sheet at July 31, 2024 was derived from audited annual consolidated financial statements,
but does not contain all of the footnote disclosures from the annual financial statements, and (b) the unaudited condensed consolidated
interim financial statements included herein have been prepared by Non-Invasive Monitoring Systems, Inc. (together with its consolidated
subsidiaries, the Company or NIMS in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States GAAP for interim financial information and the instructions to the quarterly report on Form 10-Q and Rule 8-03
of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements.
These statements reflect adjustments, all of which are of a normal, recurring nature, and which are, in the opinion of management, necessary
to present fairly the Company s financial position as of October 31, 2024, and results of operations and cash flows for the interim
periods ended October 31, 2024 and 2023. The results of operations for the three months ended October 31, 2024, are not necessarily indicative
of the results for a full year. Certain information and footnote disclosure normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance
with GAAP have been condensed or omitted. The Company s accounting policies continue unchanged from July 31, 2024. These financial
statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s
annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 31, 2024. 

of remaining liabilities met the discontinued operations criteria in Accounting Standards Codification
205-20-45 and were classified as discontinued operations at October 31, 2024 and July 31, 2024. 

Going
Concern. The Company s condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared and presented on a basis assuming
it will continue as a going concern. As reflected in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements, the Company had net
losses of approximately for the three months ended October 31, 2024 and has experienced continuous cash outflows from operating
activities. The Company also has a shareholders deficit of as of October 31, 2024. The Company had of cash at
October 31, 2024 and negative working capital of approximately . These matters raise substantial doubt about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include adjustments relating
to the recoverability and classification of reported asset amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities that might be necessary
should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. The Company s independent registered public accounting firm, in its
report on the Company s consolidated financial statements for the year ended July 31, 2024, has also expressed substantial doubt
about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

The
Company is seeking potential mergers, acquisitions and strategic collaborations. There is no assurance that the Company will be successful
in this regard, and, if not successful, that it will be able to continue its business activities. The accompanying condensed consolidated
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary from the outcome of this uncertainty.

 MANAGEMENT S
 DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

Cautionary
Statement Regarding Forward-looking Statements . 

This
Interim Report on Form 10-Q contains, in addition to historical information, certain forward-looking statements regarding Non-Invasive
Monitoring Systems, Inc. (the Company or NIMS, also referred to as us , we or
 our ). These forward-looking statements represent our expectations or beliefs concerning the Company s performance,
financial condition, business strategies, and other information and that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. For this purpose,
any statements contained in this Report that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, words such as may, will, expect, believe, 
 anticipate, intend, could, estimate, or continue or the negative
or other variations thereof or comparable terminology are intended to identify forward-looking statements. The Company s actual
results, some of which are beyond the Company s control, could differ materially from the activities and results implied by the
forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to the Company s:
history of losses and accumulated deficit; need for additional financing; dependence on management; risks related to proprietary rights;
other factors described herein as well as the factors contained in Item 1A Risk Factors of our Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended July 31, 2024. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements, except as required
by applicable law. These forward-looking statements are only predictions and reflect our views as of the date they are made with respect
to future events and financial performance. 

Overview 

We
previously were engaged in the development, manufacture and marketing of non-invasive, whole body periodic acceleration WBPA therapeutic platforms, which are motorized platforms that move a subject repetitively head to foot. The Company discontinued operations
in May 2019, accordingly, certain liabilities are classified as discontinued operations. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Our
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements,
which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these condensed
consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates,
including those related to income taxes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed
to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets
and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. A more detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting
policies can be found in Note 2 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of the Annual Report on Form
10-K. While we believe that the factors we evaluate provide us with a meaningful basis for establishing and applying sound accounting
policies, we cannot guarantee that the results will always be accurate. Since the determination of these estimates requires the exercise
of judgment, actual results could differ from such estimates. 

Results
of Operations 

We
had discontinued operations in May 2019. The Company is assessing potential mergers, acquisitions and strategic collaborations. 

Three
months ended October 31, 2024 Compared to Three months Ended October 31, 2023 

General
and administrative costs and expenses. General and administrative G A costs and expenses were 63,000 for the
three months ended October 31, 2024 as compared to 75,000 for the three months ended October 31, 2023. The
 12,000 decrease was primarily due to insurance premium reductions. 

Total
operating costs and expenses. Total operating costs and expenses were 63,000 for the three months ended October 31, 2024 as compared
to 75,000 for the three months ended October 31, 2023. 

Interest
expense. Net interest expense was 14,000 for the three months ended October 31, 2024 as compared to 13,000 for the three months
ended October 31, 2023. The interest expense is due to the related party Promissory Notes described in Note 6 to the accompanying unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements. 

Net
loss. Net loss was 77,000 for the three months
ended October 31, 2024 as compared to 88,000 for the three months ended October 31, 2023. This
 11,000 decrease is primarily attributable to insurance premium reductions. 

11 

Going
Concern. The Company s condensed consolidated
financial statements have been prepared and presented on a basis assuming it will continue as a going concern. As reflected in the accompanying
condensed consolidated financial statements, the Company had net losses of approximately 77,000 for the three months ended October 31,
2024 and has experienced continuous cash outflows from operating activities. The Company also has a shareholders deficit of 802,000
as of October 31, 2024. The Company had 15,000 of cash at October 31, 2024 and negative working capital of approximately 802,000. These
matters raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

The
Company s operations have been primarily financed through private sales of its equity securities and advances under promissory
notes. 

At
October 31, 2024, we had approximately 15,000 of cash and negative working capital of approximately 802,000. We believe that the cash
on hand at October 31, 2024 is not sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for the next 12 months. We are currently exploring
promissory notes and other opportunities for additional capital. 

We
expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future. It is likely that we will be required to obtain additional external financing through
public or private equity offerings, debt financings or collaborative agreements. No assurance can be given that such additional financing
will be available on acceptable terms or at all. 

Current
economic conditions have been, and continue to be, volatile and continued instability in these market conditions may limit our ability
to access the capital in a timely manner. Additionally, the sales of equity or convertible debt securities may result in dilution to
our stockholders. 

Net
cash used in operating activities was 65,000 and 61,000 for three months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This 4,000
increase in cash used was primarily due to increase in prepaid expenses partially offset by increase in accounts payable liabilities. 

Net
cash provided by financing activities was 55,000 and 200,000 for three months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, as a result
of proceeds from related party Promissory Notes described in Note 6 to the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.

 CONTROLS
 AND PROCEDURES. 

The
Company s management, with the participation of its Interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the
effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules
13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e)) as of October 31, 2024. Based upon that evaluation, the Interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer
concluded that, as of that date, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the material weakness
identified below. 

12 

Management s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Management
is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting
is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control over financial reporting
includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded
as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts
and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and
(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company s
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 

A
material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a
reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented
or detected on a timely basis. In its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of October 31,
2024, the Company determined that there were control deficiencies that constituted material weaknesses, as described below. 

Process
and procedures The Company does not employ a sufficient number of individuals to maintain optimal segregation of duties. The
internal control procedures over the completeness and accuracy of the general ledger information and the risk assessment process are
not formally documented and may not be designed and operate with a level of precision adequate to prevent or detect misstatements. Since
internal control procedures are not formally documented, management cannot monitor their effectiveness. 

Accordingly,
the Company concluded that these control deficiencies resulted in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual
or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by the Company s internal controls. 

As
a result of the material weaknesses described above, management has concluded that the Company did not maintain effective internal control
over financial reporting as of October 31, 2024 based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission COSO ). 

Notwithstanding
the existence of these material weaknesses in the Company s internal control over financial reporting, the Company s management
believes that the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-Q fairly present in all material respects the Company s
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the last quarter that have materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
