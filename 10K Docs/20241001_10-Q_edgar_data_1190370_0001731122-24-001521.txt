Revenues for the six-month period ended April 30, 2024, were 366,217 compared to
revenues of 98,896 for the six-month period ended April 30, 2024. The increase in revenue is nearly all attributable to an increase in
our House Wrap products revenue as we had approximately 7,000 in apparel sales during the period. 

As of September 27,2024, we have a backlog of approximately 247,00 in orders
for our Housewrap product line. 

As of August 30, 2024, one of our Distributors has
generated approximately 550,000 in sales. 

SG A expenses were 206,722 for the six month
period ended April 30, 2024, compared to 234,974 for the six month period ended April 30, 2023. 

In the period starting May 1, 2024, to September 3, 2024, our sales have increased
158 over the period beginning November 1, 2023, to April 30, 2024.

INNOVATIVE DESIGNS, INC. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

During the three-month period ended April 30, 2024,
we funded our operations from revenues and the sale of our common stock. 

Short Term: We will continue to fund our operations
from sales and the sale of our securities. We continue to pay our creditors when payments are due. We will require more funds to be able
to order the material for our Insultex products and to purchase equipment needed for the manufacture of the Insultex product. The Company
reached an agreement with the manufacturer of the Insultex material to purchase a machine capable of producing the Insultex material.
Also included in the proposed agreement will be the propriety formula that creates Insultex. The Company took delivery of the equipment
in December 2015. The Company will have to have the machine installed and ensure that it can be operated in compliance with all environmental
rules and regulations. It is the Company intentions to have the equipment operational but cannot currently provide a time estimate. Among
the factors affecting the time estimate are the financial resources available to the Company, finding a suitable facility and bringing
technical personnel from abroad to install the equipment. The Company has currently made deposits of 600,000 on the equipment. The Company
has incurred 17,000 of additional expenses related to shipping. The Company will produce Insultex under its own brand name. See Note
14 of the Notes to the Condensed Financial Statements. 

The new quality control testing equipment for our
House Wrap Product line has been built. We have reached an agreement with the vendor on the final amount. As of August 30, 2024, we have
paid approximately 134,000 in deposits for the equipment. We expect to accept delivery of the equipment when we are able to reach an
agreement with a testing laboratory that will house the equipment. Once the equipment is installed it will have to go through a certification
process before we will be able to conduct tests on our Insultex products. Once the testing equipment is certified, we intend to begin
the process of having Insulted certified by ICC Evaluation Services, LLC ICC-ES ). ICC-ES certifies, among other items,
building materials and products of which our House Wrap falls under. The reason we need to have ICC-ES certification is that we believe
in order to get large orders for House Wrap, ICC-ES certification will be required. The other component part of the Housewrap produced
by a third party is ICC-Es certified. Getting ICC-ES certification is costly and time consuming. 

Long Term: The Company will continue to fund its operations
from revenues, borrowings from private parties and the possible sale of our securities. Should we not be able to rely on the private sources
for borrowing and /or increased sales, our operations would be severely affected as we would not be able to fund our purchase orders to
our suppliers for finished goods and our efforts to produce our own IINSULTEX would be delayed. 

Subsequent to the period, on September 26, 2024, we
appointed a new CEO/CFO. Please see our Form 8-K filed on September 27, 2024.

risk factors. 

Sole Source
for Insultex . We rely on a single source for the Insultex material. We do not believe we could obtain Insultex from any other
source. Insultex is manufactured by a company in Indonesia using proprietary technology Should we not be able to obtain Insultex from
this company for any reason we could no longer maintain operations. 

Reliance
on Key Personal . Mr. Gregory Domian is our Executive Vice-President, Operations. Should we lose the services of Mr. Domian

ITEM
4T. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Management has developed and implemented a policy
and procedures for reviewing, on a quarterly basis, our disclosure controls and procedures. During the period ended April 30, 2024,, our
principal executive/financial officer concluded that these controls and procedures were ineffective. At this time, we do not have the
financial resources to employ a financial staff with accounting and financial expertise. Once we have the necessary financial resources,
we plan to hire and designate an individual responsible for identifying reportable developments and to implement procedures designed to
remediate the material weakness by focusing additional attention and resources in our internal accounting functions. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

During the most recent fiscal quarter, there were
no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph
(d) of Exchange Act Rules 13(a)-15 or 15d-15 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s
internal control over financial reporting. 

Until the Company has the financial resources to employ
a financial staff with accounting and financial expertise, to be able to properly account for internal financial reporting, errors that
may have a material effect on the financial statements have the potential to occur. 

ITEM 5. Other Information 

During the quarter ended April 30, 2024, no director or officer of the Company or a rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement 
or non-Rule 10b-5 trading arrangement as such terms are defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K.
