the opinion that it does have sufficient working capital to meet the Company s liabilities and commitments as they become due for
the 12 months from the date these financial statements. Management intends to finance operating costs over the next twelve months with

Balance, September 30, 2024 

On September 24, 2024, the Company entered into
Securities Purchase Agreements SPAs with various third party lenders for the issuance of convertible debentures Debentures and warrants to purchase common shares of the Company at an exercise price of per share until September 24, 2029 Debenture
Warrants for . 

The Debentures bear interest at per annum,
computed on the basis of a 360-day year and twelve 30-day months, and are due and payable with accrued interest thereon on Maturity Date ). At any time prior to the Maturity Date, the holder has the option to convert their Debenture and any
accrued interest into common shares of the Company at a price of Conversion Price ). Should the Company complete
a Qualified Offering, being an offering of the Company s securities for at least million in aggregate gross proceeds in coordination
with the simultaneous uplisting of the Company s common shares onto a United States national securities exchange, the Debentures
will automatically convert into the securities, including warrants, on the same terms as are applicable in the Qualified Offering at the
lower of (i) the Conversion Price or (ii) the per security offering price in the Qualified Offering. If prior to the Maturity Date or
the completion of a Qualified Offering, the last trading price of the Company s common shares exceed of the Conversion Price
for 10 consecutive trading days, the Debentures and accrued interest will automatically convert into common shares of the Company at the
Conversion Price. 

Upon closing of a Qualified Offering, each Debenture
Warrant holder will receive an additional of warrants with identical terms as the Debenture Warrants. The exercise price of the Debenture
Warrants are subject to adjustment upon the completion of a Qualified Offering to the lower of (i) the existing Debenture Warrant exercise
price, (ii) the exercise price of any common share purchase warrants issued in the Qualified Offering, or (iii) if no common share purchase
warrants are issued in the Qualified Offering, the closing price of the common shares on the Canadian Securities Exchange (as converted
into U.S. dollars) immediately prior to the pricing news release of the Qualified Offering. 

The holders of the Debenture Warrants may elect, if the Company does
not have an effective registration statement registering or the prospectus contained therein is not available for the issuance of the
Debenture Warrant shares to the holder, in lieu of exercising the Debenture Warrants for cash, a cashless exercise option to receive common
shares equal to the fair value of the Debenture Warrants. The fair value is determined by multiplying the number of Debenture Warrants
to be exercised by, the option of the Debenture Holder, (i) the previous day s volume weighted average price VWAP of the common shares of the Company, (ii) the bid price of the common shares of the Company as of the time of the execution of the exercise
notice, or (iii) the closing price of the common shares on the date of the exercise notice Elected Exercise Price less
the exercise price with the difference divided by the Elected Exercise Price. On October 16, 2024, the Company s registration
statement restricting the Debenture Warrant holders ability to elect to cashless exercise their Debenture Warrants became effective. 

If a Qualified Offering occurs or Debenture Warrant
holder elects to exercise on a cashless basis, there will be variability in the number of shares issued per Debenture Warrant. 

Each SPA also grants each lender a participation
right up to September 24, 2025 whereby each lender will have the right to participate in up to 25 of any subsequent offering of the Company
based on such lender s pro rata portion of the SPAs. 

The Company has determined that the conversion
features meet the definition of a derivative in accordance with ASC 815 Derivatives and hedging, and as a result has
bifurcated the conversion features from the contract. As a result, the Company recorded the embedded derivative as a conversion feature
liability on its consolidated balance sheets with a corresponding debt discount which is netted against the principal amount of the
Debentures. The Company accretes the debt discount associated with the conversion feature liability to accretion expense over the term
of the Debentures using the effective interest rate method. The conversion feature liability is initially measured at fair value and re-measured
at the end of each reporting period with any changes in fair value reported on the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive
loss. 

The Company incurred transaction costs of 
in connection with the SPAs, of which was allocated to the debt component of the Debentures and is being amortized over the term
of the Debentures and was expensed as general and administrative expenses.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

The following discussion and analysis should
be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30,2024,
and the related notes thereto, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.
This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements and forward-looking information that involve risks, uncertainties, and
assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements and information as a
result of many factors. See section heading Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements. 

Overview 

The Company is a biopharmaceutical company dedicated
to developing treatments for patients suffering from neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer s disease Alzheimer s
disease or AD ), for which there are limited or no treatment options. On July 26, 2024, the Company received
approval by the FDA of the Company s New Drug Application (the NDA for ZUNVEYL (benzgalantamine)
previously known as ALPHA-1062 ZUNVEYL or ALPHA-1062 oral tablet formulation for the treatment of mild-to-moderate Alzheimer s
disease. The Company will now focus on the development of commercial manufacturing and commercial sales of ZUNVEYL oral tablet formulation.
The Company s commercial development program for ZUNVEYL is primarily focused on building a long-term care commercial team that
can focus on providing key points of differentiation, exploiting key issues with existing AChEI treatments, and franchising potential
additional indications and new products. The company will target the largest volume nursing homes specializing in Alzheimer s Disease,
leveraging an account-based sales team with demonstrated success in LTC, positioning ZUNVEYL with Medicare payors, and developing strategic
and clinical partnerships with consultant pharmacists and long-term care pharmacies. The company s anticipated launch is in Q1 2025.
Alpha Cognition has set the Wholesale Acquisition Cost (WAC) for its latest therapeutic product at 649 per month. This pricing reflects
the company s commitment to balancing patient access with the value of innovative healthcare solutions. By establishing a competitive
WAC price, Alpha Cognition aims to enhance affordability and ensure patients can benefit from our advanced treatment options. Patients'
out-of-pocket cost for treatment with ZUNVEYL will depend on their length of treatment and their insurance. The Company has three additional
pre-clinical development programs: ZUNVEYL in combination with memantine for the treatment of moderate-to-severe Alzheimer s
disease, ALPHA-1062 sublingual formulation, ALPHA-1062 intranasal ALPHA-1062IN formulation for the treatment
of cognitive impairment with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI; otherwise known as concussion) and ALPHA-0602, ALPHA-0702 ALPHA-0802,
also referred to as Progranulin and Progranulin GEM s , for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases
including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, otherwise known as ALS or Lou Gehrig s disease and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). 

ZUNVEYL, is a patented new innovative product
being developed as a next generation acetylcholinesterase inhibitor for the treatment of Alzheimer s disease, with expected minimal
gastrointestinal side effects. ZUNVEYL s active metabolite is differentiated from donepezil and rivastigmine in that it binds neuronal
nicotinic receptors, most notably the alpha-7 subtype, which is known to have a positive effect on cognition. ZUNVEYL is in pre-clinical development
in combination with memantine to treat moderate to severe Alzheimer s disease, in pre-clinical development with sublingual
formulation for patients suffering from dysphagia, and ALPHA-1062IN is intended to be out-licensed for pre-clinical development
to study an intranasal formulation for cognitive impairment with mTBI. 

Our other pre-clinical stage assets include
ALPHA-0602, ALPHA-0702 ALPHA-0802 (Progranulin and Progranulin GEM s), which are expressed in several cell types
in the central nervous system and in peripheral tissues, promotes cell survival, regulates certain inflammatory processes, and play a
significant role in regulating lysosomal function and microglial responses to disease. Its intended use for the treatment of neurodegenerative
diseases has been patented by the Company and ALPHA-0602 has been granted an Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of ALS by
the FDA. Orphan Drug Designation was provided for ALPHA-0602 by the Office of Orphan Drug Products, FDA on February 2020
based on the Federal Food Drug, and Cosmetic Act, whereby the ALPHA-0602 met the criteria designated in Section 526 of such
Act. For a further description see the section entitled Business Government Regulation Orphan
Drug Designation . The Orphan Drug Designation allows for exclusivity provisions provided the drug is approved first for indication:
treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ALPHA-0702 and ALPHA-0802 are Granulin Epithelin Motifs, GEMs ), derived
from full length progranulin which have therapeutic potential across multiple neurodegenerative diseases. GEMs have been shown to be important
in regulating cell growth, survival, repair, and inflammation. ALPHA-0702 and ALPHA-0802 are designed to deliver this with potentially
lower toxicity, and greater therapeutic effect. As the assets are pre-clinical assets and do not add material value to the Company,
the Company will not develop these assets further and instead will seek to out-license the assets to interested third parties. Given
the early stage of discussion with third parties, the Company cannot assess value to a license agreement. 

The Company is the parent company of Alpha Cognition Canada Inc. Alpha
Canada or ACI Canada which is the parent company of Alpha Cognition USA Inc. ACI USA ). As of May 1,
2023, the Company s common shares commenced trading on the CSE under the symbol ACOG , previously the Company s
shares were traded on the TSX-V until April 28, 2023, when the Company had them delisted. As of November 12, 2024, the Company s
common shares commenced trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol ACOG , previously the Company s common
shares were quoted for trading on the OTCQB under the trading symbol ACOGF . 

32 

The Company has not generated revenues from its
operations to date and as of September 30, 2024, and had a deficit of 70,626,302 (December 31, 2023 61,648,173)
which has been primarily financed by equity. The Company had 3,666,389 in cash and cash equivalents, including restricted cash, and 3,005,836
in current liabilities (of which 107,010 is payable from the Company s available restricted cash balance) as of September 30, 2024.
The Company s continuing operations, as intended, are highly dependent upon its ability to obtain additional funding and eventually
generate cash flows. Management is of the opinion that it does not have sufficient working capital to fully meet the Company s liabilities
and commitments as outlined and planned in the following discussion. Management is of the opinion it will need to raise additional capital
to cover upcoming planned Research and Development R D ), commercialization of ZUNVEYL and operating costs. Possible
sources of such capital may come from private placements and public offerings of the Company s common shares and funds received
from the exercise of warrants and share options. Additionally, the Company will also consider funding that may arise through partnership
activities, including royalties, and debt. There is a risk that additional financing will not be available on a timely basis, on terms
acceptable, or at all to the Company. These factors indicate the existence of a material uncertainty which causes significant doubt in
the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern. 

The Company is also contemplating raising capital
by pursuing both dilutive and non-dilutive strategic sources of capital to fully execute its commercialization and operating plans following
receipt of the NDA approval for ZUNVEYL from the FDA. Any additional capital is expected to further support our planned costs to begin
commercial activities including launching U.S. sales of ZUNVEYL in AD 

Components of our Results of Operations 

Research and development 

Research and development expenses represent costs incurred to conduct
research, such as the discovery and development of our product candidates. We recognize all research and development costs as they are
incurred unless there is an alternative future use in other research and development projects or otherwise. 

Research and development expenses consists primarily of the following: 

costs related to production of clinical supplies and non-clinical materials, including fees paid to contract manufacturers. 

employee-related expenses, which include salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation. 

other expenses including travel and consulting services. 

General and administrative expenses 

General and administrative expenses costs consist of personnel costs,
other outside professional services including legal, human resources, audit and accounting services, consulting and pre-commercialization
expenses, including selling and marketing costs as well attendance to various conferences. Personnel costs consist of salaries, benefits,
and share-based compensation. We expect to continue to incur expenses to support our continued operations as a public company, including
expenses related to existing and future compliance with rules and regulations of the stock exchanges on which our securities are now
traded, insurance expenses, investor relations, audit fees, professional services and general overhead and administrative costs. 

Foreign exchange gain (loss) 

The foreign exchange gain (loss) amount consists
of changes in the value of the Canadian Dollar compared to the U.S. Dollar throughout the year. 

33 

Liability-Based Awards 

Bonus right awards that include cash settlement
features are accounted for as liability-based awards in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation Share Based Compensation.
The fair value of the bonus right awards is estimated using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model and is revalued on each reporting date,
based on the probability of the expected awards to vest, until settlement. Changes in the estimated fair value of the bonus right awards
are recognized within general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss over the
vesting period. Key assumptions in the calculation of the fair value of the bonus right awards include expected volatility, risk-free
interest rate, expected life, and fair value per award. 

Share Based Compensation 

Share-based compensation cost is recorded for
all option grants and awards of non-vested stock based on the grant date fair value of the award using the Black-Scholes option-pricing
model and is recognized over the service period required for the award. We estimate the fair value of stock option grants using the Black-Scholes
option pricing model and the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock-based awards represent management s best estimates
and involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management s judgment. 

Expected Term The expected
term of options represents the period that the Company s stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding based on the simplified
method, which is the half-life from vesting to the end of its contractual term. 

Expected Volatility The Company
computes stock price volatility over expected terms based on its historical common stock trading prices. 

Risk-Free Interest Rate The
Company bases the risk-free interest rate on the implied yield available on United States Treasury zero-coupon issues with an equivalent
remaining term. 

Expected Dividend The Company
has never declared or paid any cash dividends on its common shares and does not plan to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future,
and, therefore, uses an expected dividend yield of zero in its valuation models. 

Interest income 

Interest income consists of interest earned on
our cash and cash equivalents. 

Grant revenue 

The Company received grant revenue from the Army
Medical Research and Material Command on June 5, 2023, for a pre-clinical study on the use of the ALPHA-1062 Intranasal to reduce
blast of mTBI induced functional deficit and brain abnormalities. All funds relating to government grants are being recorded under the
gross method of accounting for government grants whereby any income received and associated expenses incurred will be reported as grant
income and included in research and development expenses, respectively on the statement of operations and comprehensive loss. When grant
proceeds are initially received, they are recorded as deferred income and restricted cash. Grant proceeds used to pay for study costs
and are expensed as incurred, with a corresponding amount of grant revenue recorded along with a reduction of the balance of the deferred
income liability. The Company classifies the balance of cash received from grants as restricted cash, when the proceeds from the grant
have been designated for use in specified research. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the Company
recorded grant income of 61,122 and 32,757, respectively and during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and September 30, 2023,
the Company recorded grant income of 333,462 and 32,757, respectively, from its R D Grant in the consolidated statements of operations
and comprehensive loss. 

Interest expense 

Interest expense relates primarily to the interest
paid on the Neurodyn Life Sciences Inc. NLS promissory note. Effective April 1, 2024, the Company and NLS agreed to another
amendment to the promissory note pursuant to which the interest rate was increased from 5.5 to 7 and the maturity date was extended
from July 2024 to July 2025. Additionally, 300,000 will be due on December 31, 2024, with the remaining principal balance due at maturity. 

34 

Change in fair value of derivatives 

The change in the fair value of warrant liability
consists of the Company s revaluation of their liability classified warrants that have an exercise price in USD. The Company
uses the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model to determine the fair value of the warrant liability at the end of each reporting period.
This model requires the input of subjective assumptions including expected share price volatility, risk-free interest rate, and term
of the warrant. Changes in the input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate and the Company s earnings (loss)
and equity. 

Currency translation adjustment 

For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial
statements, the assets and liabilities of the Company s CAD operations are translated to USD at the exchange rate on the reporting
date. The income and expenses are translated using average exchange rates. Foreign currency differences that arise on translation for
consolidated purposes are recognized in other comprehensive loss on the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss.

General and administrative expenses 

General and administrative expenses costs consist
of personnel costs, consulting fees, other outside professional services including legal, human resources, audit and accounting services,
and pre-commercialization expenses, including selling and marketing costs as well attendance to various conferences. Personnel costs
consist of salaries, benefits, and share-based compensation. We expect to continue to incur expenses to support our continued operations

which our securities are traded, insurance expenses, investor relations, audit fees, professional services and general overhead and administrative
costs. 

Comparison of General and Administrative Expenses for the Three Months
ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 

General and administrative expenses increased
by 155,558 or 12 , from 1,336,197 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 1,491,755, for the three months ended

Comparison of General and Administrative Expenses for the Nine
months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 

General and administrative expenses increased
by 2,696,406 or 72 , from 3,744,162 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 6,440,568, for the nine months ended September
30, 2024, primarily due to the increase in expenses related to consulting fees, financing fees, professional fees, investor relations
and registrar and filing fees. Consulting fees during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, included 2,273,949 relating to the issuance
of 582,331 Common Shares pursuant to the Spartan Consulting Agreement. Management fees and salaries, professional fees, registrar and
filing fees, investor relations were primarily higher in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, in support of the Company s NDA
filing for ALPHA-1062, the US IPO filing and general business operating support. Share-based compensation was lower primarily due to fluctuations
in the Company stock price and accounting for equity awards that were issued after September 30, 2023. The following table depicts the
fluctuation in the general and administrative accounts:

Foreign Exchange (Loss) Gain 

The foreign exchange (loss) gain amount consists
of changes in the value of the Canadian Dollar compared to the U.S. Dollar throughout the year. 

The foreign exchange gain (loss) changes by 5,086, or 38 , from a
loss of 13,301 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to a loss of 8,217 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The
foreign exchange loss increased by 26,124, or 729 , from a loss of 3,584 as of September 30, 2023, to a loss of 29,708 as of September
30, 2024, due primarily to the fluctuations in exchange rate between the Canadian Dollar and the U.S. Dollar. This variance is largely
due to the Company changing its functional currency from the CAD to the USD on August 31, 2023, therefore having less transactions
needing to be denominated in a foreign currency. The change in mix and balance of the Company s assets and liabilities over the
periods also impacted the changes in foreign currency exchange (loss) gain. 

Interest Income 

Interest income consists of interest earned on the Company s
cash. 

Interest income decreased 796, or 29 , from 2,172 for the three months
ended September 30, 2023, to 1,916 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Interest income increased 11,087, or 219 , from 5,059
for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 16,146 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Grant Income 

The Company received grant revenue from the Army Medical Research and
Material Command on June 5, 2023, for a pre-clinical study on the use of the ALPHA-1062 Intranasal to reduce blast of mTBI induced
functional deficit and brain abnormalities. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded grant income
of 61,122 and 32,757, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded grant income of 333,462
and 32,757, respectively. 

Interest Expense 

Interest expense increased 9,072, or 94 , from 9,607 for the three
months ended September 30, 2023, to 18,679 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Interest expense increased 28,136, or 201 ,
from 14,017 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 42,153 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, following the increase
in interest rates on the NLS note which occurred in 2023. Interest expense relates primarily to the interest paid on the NLS promissory
note and the accrued interest for the convertible debentures. 

Impairment of Intangible Assets 

During the three and nine months ended September
30, 2024, the Company recorded an impairment of intangible assets of 0 and 39,166, respectively, from the impairment of the ALPHA-0602
license as the Company decided to discontinue development of the ALPHA-602 technology, no impairments were reported in the comparable
2023 periods. 

Change in Fair Value of Derivatives 

The Company uses the Black-Scholes Option Pricing
Model to determine the fair value of stock options, standalone share purchase warrants issued and derivative liability. This model requires
the input of subjective assumptions including expected share price volatility, interest rate, and forfeiture rate. Changes in the input
assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate and the Company s earnings (loss) and equity reserves. 

39 

The gain of 416,806 for the three months ended September 30, 2024
for the fair value of the warrant liabilities was a net change of 932,577, or 181 , compared to a loss of 515,771 for the three months
ended September 30, 2023. The loss of 16,127 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 for the fair value of the warrant liabilities
was a net change of 516,302, or 97 , compared to a loss of 532,429 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change was primarily
due to the fluctuation in the Company s stock price as well as the volatility of the financial markets, coupled with the addition
of new warrants issued during the first quarter of 2023 which were priced differently that the Company s functional currency at
the time of issuance and new warrants issued during the third quarter of 2024 which have a variable exercise price. 

Provision for Loan Losses 

The Company recorded a provision for loan losses
of 55,000 relating to its loan to Alpha Seven during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, following a delay in Alpha Seven s
initial capital raise and therefore potential inability to repay the loan when due. 

Currency Translation Adjustment 

For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial
statements, the assets and liabilities of the Company s CAD operations were translated to USD at the exchange rate on the reporting
date. The income and expenses were translated using average exchange rates. Foreign currency differences that arise on translation for
consolidated purposes are recognized in other comprehensive loss on the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the currency translation
adjustments recorded increased 11,232, or 100 , from a loss of 11,232 to nil. The currency translation adjustment was (19,573) for
September 30, 2023, compared to nil for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The change is due to the Company changing its functional
currency from the CAD to the USD on August 31, 2023, resulting in no currency translation adjustment being required after August 31,
2023. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Sources of Liquidity 

The Company does not have operating revenue to
finance its existing obligations and therefore must continue to rely on external financing to generate capital to maintain its capacity
to meet working capital requirements. The Company has relied on debt and equity raises to finance its operating activities since incorporation.
The Company expects to continue to rely on debt and the issuance of shares, and possibly other non-dilutive financing options to finance
its ongoing operations and plans for commercialization of ZUNVEYL. However, there is a risk that additional financing will not be available
on a timely basis or on terms acceptable to the Company. 

40 

Future Funding Requirements 

We expect our expenses to increase substantially
in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we continue the commercialization of ZUNVEYL, following the FDA s approval
in July 2024 and potentially seek to discover and develop additional product candidates, conduct our ongoing and planned clinical trials
and preclinical studies, continue our R D activities, utilize third parties to manufacture ZUNVEYL, hire additional personnel, expand
and protect our intellectual property, and incur additional costs associated with being a public company. 

Cash used to fund operating expenses is impacted
by the timing of when we pay these expenses, as reflected in the change in our outstanding accounts payable, accrued expenses, and prepaid
expenses. The timing and amount of our funding requirements will depend on many factors, including: 

the initiation, type, number, scope, progress, expansions, results, costs and timing of clinical trials and preclinical studies of ZUNVEYL and any future product candidates we may choose to pursue, including the costs of modification to clinical development plans based on feedback that we may receive from regulatory authorities and any third-party products used as combination agents in our clinical trials; 

the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory meetings and reviews of ZUNVEYL or any future product candidates, including requirements of regulatory authorities in any additional jurisdictions in which we may seek approval for ZUNVEYL and any future product candidates; 

the costs of obtaining, maintaining, enforcing and protecting our patents and other intellectual property and proprietary rights; 

our efforts to enhance operational systems and hire additional personnel to satisfy our obligations as a public company, including enhanced internal control over financial reporting; 

the costs associated with hiring additional personnel and consultants as our business grows, including additional executive officers and clinical development, regulatory, CMC quality and commercial personnel; 

the costs and timing of establishing or securing sales and marketing capabilities of any future product candidate approval; 

our ability to achieve sufficient market acceptance, coverage, and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors and adequate market share and revenue for any approved products; 

our ability and strategic decision to develop future product candidates other than ZUNVEYL, and the timing of such development, if any; 

patients willingness to pay out-of-pocket for any approved products in the absence of coverage and/or adequate reimbursement from third-party payors; 

the terms and timing of establishing and maintaining collaborations, licenses and other similar arrangements; and 

costs associated with any products or technologies that we may in-license or acquire. 

Based upon our current operating plan, we estimate
that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of the date of this filing, will be sufficient to fund our projected
base ongoing operating expenses, the initial costs to prepare for commercialization of ZUNVEYL in AD, planned CMC costs, ongoing operating
costs and capital expenditures through at least the next 24 months. We expect to look to raise additional capital to continue to
further advance our commercialization plans and ongoing operating costs. However, we have based our estimates on assumptions that may
prove to be wrong, and our operating plan may change as a result of many factors currently unknown to us. In addition, we could utilize
our available capital resources sooner than we expected. The Company is also contemplating raising additional capital by pursuing
both dilutive and non-dilutive strategic sources of capital; to fully execute its commercial and operating plans following receipt of
the NDA approval for ZUNVEYL from the FDA. Any additional capital would further support our planned costs to begin commercial activities
including launching U.S. sales of ZUNVEYL in AD. 

We have no other committed sources of capital. Until such time, if
ever, we can generate substantial product revenue, we expect to finance our operations through equity offerings, debt financings, or other
capital sources, including current or potential future collaborations, licenses, royalties and other similar arrangements. We do not know
what the terms of these future financings will be and whether they will be acceptable to the us or not and, therefore, we may be unable
to raise additional funds or enter into such other arrangements when needed on favorable terms or at all. To the extent we raise additional
capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, your ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms of these securities
may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a common stockholder. Debt financing and preferred equity
financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such
as incurring additional debt, making acquisitions, engaging in acquisition, merger or collaboration transactions, selling or licensing
our assets, making capital expenditures, redeeming our stock, making certain investments or declaring dividends. If we raise additional
funds through collaborations or license agreements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies,
future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates, or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are
unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate
our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise
prefer to develop and market ourselves, or even cease operations.

Financing Activities 

Recent capital raising activities 

During the third quarter of 2022 the Company initiated
cost cutting measures to extend its cash runway and reduce ongoing cash burn. The Company streamlined R D programs and has prioritized
spend towards the NDA filing and development of ALPHA-1062 in AD. The Company has reduced headcount and other operating costs related
to the ZUNVEYL NDA file and other development costs. The Company has lowered its near-term operating burn until additional capital can
be secured. If we are unable to raise adequate funds, we may have to further delay or reduce the scope of or eliminate some or all of
our current research and development. Any of these actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations
or financial condition. 

During
the first quarter of 2023 the Company completed the brokered private placement by issuing 949,906 units at a price of CAD 6.38 for total
proceeds of 4,506,055 (CAD 6,055,650) with each unit consisting of one Common share and one warrant exercisable at a price of CAD 9.75
per warrant for a term of 5 years from the closing date Q1 2023 PP ). 

In March 2023, the Company entered into an
amendment of the Promissory Note and License Agreement with the NLS promissory note holders to extend the maturity of the 1.2M outstanding
promissory note to July 15, 2024, the previous maturity date of the promissory note was December 31, 2022. The parties also
agreed to increase the Promissory Note interest rate from 2 annually to a market rate of 5.5 annually. (see Note 7 of the accompanying
audited financial statements). 

On May 30, 2023, the Company announced a
best-efforts private placement offering of up to 6,500,000 of units at the initial pricing of 5.50 per unit Q2 2023 PP ).
Each unit consists of one common share and one-half of a warrant. Each whole warrant will entitle the holder to purchase an additional
common share of the Company at the initial pricing of 7.75 per share for a period of three years from the closing date. The aggregate
proceeds may be increased by 30 to accommodate any overallotment. The Company also announced that it entered into an Investment Banking
Agreement IBA with Spartan Securities LLC Spartan pursuant to which Spartan will act as agent on a best-efforts
basis in connection with the Q2 2023 PP. In accordance with the Q2 2023 PP, the Company has agreed to pay Spartan cash commissions
of 10 of the gross proceeds, issue Spartan finder s warrants equal to 10 of the number of the warrants issued to investors, in
each case excluding investors on the Company s president s list and pay Spartan a non-accountable expense fee equal to 5 
of the gross proceeds of the Q2 2023 PP excluding the president s list.

On September 24, 2024, the Company announced
the closing of a 4.545 million bridge financing through the issuance of convertible notes and warrants led by existing investors
and select new investors comprised of institutional funds and high-net-worth accredited investors. 

The notes are convertible into common shares of the Company
at a conversion price of 10.55 per share. The notes were set to mature on September 24, 2026, had an aggregate face value of 4.545 million
and bears interest at a rate of 10 per annum paid in common shares of the Company at the conversion price, subject to certain limitations.
The notes were subject to mandatory conversion into common shares of the Company in conjunction with the closing of an offering of securities
of the Company for at least 10 million in aggregate gross proceeds in coordination with the simultaneous uplisting of the common
shares of the Company onto a United States national securities exchange (a Qualified Offering ). Such conversion was completed
into the securities offered in such Qualified Offering at the lower of (i) the conversion price in effect at such time and (ii) the offering
price of the securities in the Qualified Offering. The notes were unsecured and rank senior to the Company s other indebtedness. 

The notes were sold along with warrants to purchase common
shares of the Company at an exercise price of 10.55 for a five-year term. Each investor received warrants sufficient to purchase
such number of common shares equal to the principal amount of notes such investor purchased divided by the conversion price of the notes.
Each investor will receive an additional 50 of warrants with identical terms upon the closing of a Qualified Offering, as described
above. The exercise price of the warrants is subject to adjustment upon the completion of a Qualified Offering to the lower of (i) the
then existing exercise price, (ii) the exercise price of any common share purchase warrants issued in the Qualified Offering or (iii)
if no common share purchase warrants are issued in the Qualified Offering, the closing price of the common shares on the Canadian Securities
Exchange (as converted into U.S. dollars) immediately prior to the pricing news release of the Qualified Offering. 

On November 13, 2024, the Company completed a
public offering of common shares by issuing 8,695,653 common shares at a public offering price of 5.75 per share for gross proceeds of
approximately 50 million. In connection with the US public offering, the Company s Common Shares began trading on The Nasdaq Capital
Market on November 12, 2024. 

The completion of the public offering of common
shares was a Qualified Offering under the Company s convertible notes, which automatically converted into 801,413
common shares at closing of the public offering at a price of 5.75 per share, being the public offering price in the Qualified Offering.
The amount converted consisted of the converted principal amount of convertible notes and interest through November 13, 2024. 

Additionally, as a result of the closing of the
Qualified Offering, the Company issued an additional 215,418 warrants exercisable to acquire 215,418 Common Shares with an exercise price
of 7.19 per share and the exercise price of the Company s existing 430,835 warrants issued in connection with the offering of the
convertible notes was repriced from 10.55 per share to 7.19 per share.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Our management s discussion and analysis
of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance
with US GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial
statements and expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other
factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying
value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under
different assumptions or conditions. We believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical
and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management s judgments and estimates. 

Use of Estimates and Assumptions 

The preparation of these consolidated financial
statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported
amounts of expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates, including valuing equity securities
in share-based payment arrangements, estimating the fair value of financial instruments recorded as a warrant liability, useful lives
of depreciable assets and definite lived intangible assets, and whether impairment charges may apply, and the determination of whether
an asset constitutes a business a business combination or asset acquisition. Management bases these estimates on historical and anticipated
results, trends, and various other assumptions that the Company believes are reasonable under the circumstances, including assumptions
as to forecasted amounts and future events. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or
conditions. 

Functional Currency 

The functional currency of an entity is the currency
of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates. Effective August 31, 2023, the functional currency of the Company
was updated to the United States Dollar USD or U.S. Dollar as management assessed that the currency
of the primary economic environment in which the Company operates changed to USD on that date. The key factor influencing this decision
was the change in the Company s primary funding from Canadian dollars CAD to USD, whereas the functional currency
of its subsidiaries was unchanged and remain in USD. Prior to USD the functional currency of the Company was CAD, and its subsidiaries
was USD. Changes to the Company s functional currency have been accounted for on a prospective basis from August 31,
2023. The determination of functional currency was made in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standard Codification ASC 830, Foreign Currency Matters. 

The Company s reporting currency is the
USD. For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Company s CAD operations
are translated to USD at the exchange rate on the reporting date. The income and expenses are translated using average exchange rates.
Foreign currency differences that arise on translation for consolidated purposes are recognized in other comprehensive loss on the consolidated
statements of operations and comprehensive (loss) income. 

Grant Accounting 

All funds relating to government grants are being
recorded under the gross method of accounting for government grants whereby any income received and associated expenses incurred will
be reported as grant income and included in research and development expenses, respectively on the statement of comprehensive loss. When
grant proceeds are initially received, they are recorded as deferred income and restricted cash. Grant proceeds are then used to pay
for study costs and are expensed, the Company will also record a corresponding amount to grant revenue and reduce the balance of the
deferred income liability. 

On June 5, 2023, the Company was awarded
a 750,000 research and development grant from the Army Medical Research and Material Command for a pre-clinical study on the use of
the ALPHA-1062IN (Intranasal) to reduce blast mTBI (mild Traumatic Brain Injury) induced functional deficit and brain abnormalities R D
Grant ). The grant funds are to be used on the following project Assessment of Functional Recovery and Reduced Tauopathy
Following ALPHA-1062 Administration in a Repetitive Blast TBI Model in Rodents . The R D Grant is issued in collaboration
with the Seattle Institute of Biomedical and Clinical Research and endorsed by the Department of Defense. Funds received from the R D
grant are restricted and to be used solely as outlined in the grant. The R D grant funding will expire for use on September 30,
2028. The award funding is to subsidized the costs for research and development with the following specific Aims: 

Specific Aim 1: Quantify
 the ability of ALPHA-1062 to reduce brain-wide tauopathy and pathology in blast-mTBI; 

45 

Specific Aim 2: Characterize
 and quantify changes in the inter-cellular associations between disease-associated microglia and cells of the basal forebrain induced
 by repetitive blast-mTBI and altered by ALPHA-1062 treatment; Specific Aim 3: Determine the efficacy of ALPHA-1062 to improve the
 adverse cognitive and behavioral outcomes consequent to repetitive blast-mTBI. 

Per the R G Grant budget expenses are expected
to include cost to carry out the clinical trials including personnel costs, materials and supplies, animal housing, publications, and
travel costs. The Company classifies any cash received from the R D Grant that has not yet been used to pay ongoing R D grant
expenditures as restricted cash, as the proceeds from the grant are to be designated for the specified grant research. 

Fair Value Measurements 

Fair value is defined as the price that would
be received for sale of an asset or paid for transfer of a liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement
date. U.S. GAAP establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. The hierarchy
gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and
the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). These tiers include: 

Level 1 defined
 as observable inputs such as quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets; 

Level 2 quoted
 prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable; 

Level 3 inputs
 that are unobservable. 

The Company s financial instruments consist
of cash, restricted cash, prepaid and other current assets, notes receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, warrant liability,
promissory note, and other liabilities. 

Share Based Compensation 

Share-based compensation cost is recorded for
all option grants and awards of non-vested stock based on the grant date fair value of the award using the Black-Scholes option-pricing
model and is recognized over the service period required for the award. We estimate the fair value of stock option grants using the Black-Scholes
option pricing model and the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock-based awards represent management s best estimates
and involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management s judgment. 

Expected Term The
expected term of options represents the period that the Company s stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding based on the
simplified method, which is the half-life from vesting to the end of its contractual term. 

Expected Volatility The
Company computes stock price volatility over expected terms based on its historical common stock trading prices. 

Risk-Free Interest Rate The
Company bases the risk-free interest rate on the implied yield available on U. S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with an equivalent
remaining term. 

Expected Dividend The
Company has never declared or paid any cash dividends on its common shares and does not plan to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable
future, and, therefore, uses an expected dividend yield of zero in its valuation models. 

Liability-Based Awards 

Bonus right awards that include cash settlement
features are accounted for as liability-based awards in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation Stock Compensation.
The fair value of the bonus right awards is estimated using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model and is revalued on each reporting date,
based on the probability of the expected awards to vest, until settlement. Changes in the estimated fair value of the bonus right awards
are recognized within general and administrative expense on the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income. Key assumptions
in the calculation of the fair value of the bonus right awards include expected volatility, risk-free interest rate, expected life, and
fair value per award. 

46 

Research and Development Costs 

Research and development costs are expensed as
incurred unless there is an alternate future use in other research and development projects or otherwise. Research and development costs
include salaries and benefits, share-based compensation expense, management fees and salaries, research costs, travel costs and other
consulting services. We expect our research and development expenses will increase as we progress our product candidates into later stage
clinical trials, add to the number of ongoing clinical trials, advance our discovery research projects into the pre-clinical stage, continue
our early-stage research, and prepare for the commercialization of our product candidates. The process of conducting research, identifying
potential product candidates, and conducting pre-clinical and clinical trials necessary to obtain regulatory approval and commencing
pre-commercialization activities is costly and time intensive. We may never succeed in achieving marketing approval for our product candidates
regardless of our costs and efforts. The probability of success of our product candidates may be affected by numerous factors, including
pre-clinical data, clinical data, competition, manufacturing capability, our cost of goods to be sold, our ability to receive, and the
timing of, regulatory approvals, market conditions, and our ability to successfully commercialize our products if they are approved for
marketing. As a result, we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects or when
and to what extent we will generate revenue from the commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates. Our research and development
programs are subject to change from time to time as we evaluate our priorities and available resources. 

Going concern 

We continue to assess the ability to continue as a going concern, which
involves management judgement and analysis of resources and prospects. The Company has reported negative cash flow from operating activities
since inception and expects to experience negative operating cash flows for the foreseeable future. The Company has not generated revenues
from its operations to date and as of September 30, 2024, had a deficit of 70,626,302 (December 31, 2023 - 61,648,173) which has been
primarily financed by equity. The Company had 3,773,399 in cash and restricted cash and 3,005,836 in current liabilities (of which 56,233
is payable from the Company s available restricted cash balance) as of September 30, 2024. The Company s continuing operations,
as intended, are highly dependent upon its ability to obtain additional funding and generate cash flows. Based upon our current operating
plan and our closing of our public offering of common shares for approximately 46.42 million in net proceeds on November 13, 2024, we
estimate that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of the date of this filing would be sufficient to fund
our projected base ongoing operating expenses, the initial costs to prepare for commercialization of ZUNVEYL in AD, planned CMC costs,
ongoing operating costs and capital expenditures through at least the next 12 months. However, we may look to raise additional capital
to continue to further advance our commercialization plans and ongoing operating costs through a debt financing in the next 12 months.
We have based our estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and our operating plan may change as a result of many factors currently
unknown to us. In addition, we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we expected. The Company is also contemplating
raising additional capital by pursuing both dilutive and non-dilutive strategic sources of capital; to fully execute its commercial and
operating plans following receipt of the NDA approval for ZUNVEYL from the FDA. Any additional capital would further support our planned
costs to begin commercial activities including launching U.S. sales of ZUNVEYL in AD. 

The Company has maintained the cost cutting measures
it initiated in the third quarter of 2022 to extend its cash runway and reduce ongoing cash burn. The Company focus has been to streamline
R D programs and has prioritized spend towards the NDA filing and development of ALPHA-1062 in AD. The Company reduced headcount
and other operating costs to focus spending on the ALPHA-1062 NDA file and other related development costs. The Company expects to continue
to operate under the lower operating burn until further additional capital can be secured. If we are unable to raise adequate funds,
we may have to further delay or reduce the scope of or eliminate some or all of our operating and commercialization plans and product
development. Any of these actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. 

Income taxes 

In assessing the probability of realizing income
tax assets, management makes estimates related to expectation of future taxable income, applicable tax opportunities, expected timing
of reversals of existing temporary differences and the likelihood that tax positions taken will be sustained upon examination by applicable
tax authorities. In making its assessments, management gives additional weight to positive and negative evidence that can be objectively
verified. 

47 

Impairment of intangible assets 

The application of the Company s accounting
policy for intangible assets requires judgment in determining whether it is likely that future economic benefits will flow to the Company
and whether any impairment indicators exist, which may be based on assumptions about future events or circumstances. Estimates and assumptions
may change if new information becomes available. If, after expenditures are capitalized, information becomes available suggesting that
the recovery of expenditures is unlikely, the amount capitalized is written off in profit or loss in the period the new information becomes
available. 

Useful lives of intangible assets 

Amortization is recorded on a straight-line basis
based upon management s estimate of the useful life and residual value. The estimates are reviewed at least annually and are updated
if expectations change as a result of technical obsolescence or legal and other limits to use. 

Valuation of debt modification 

The Company calculated the debt modification
using the net present value of cash flows approach. This approach requires the input of subjective assumptions including the Company s
borrowing rate. Changes in the input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate and the Company s earnings (loss). 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted 

In August 2020, FASB issued ASU 2020-06,
Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging Contracts in Entity s
Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity s Own Equity, which is intended
to simplify the accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity, including convertible instruments
and contracts on an entity s own equity. ASU 2020-06 is effective for the Company for the fiscal year beginning after December 15,
2023. There was no material impact of this new guidance on the accompanying unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements. 

Emerging Growth Company Status and Smaller
Reporting Company Status 

We are an emerging growth company, as defined
in the JOBS Act. The JOBS Act permits an emerging growth company such as us to take advantage of an extended transition period to comply
with new or revised accounting standards. We have elected to avail ourselves of such extended transition period, which means that when
a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we can adopt the new or revised
standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard and may do so until such time that we either (i) irrevocably
elect to opt out of such extended transition period or (ii) no longer qualify as an emerging growth company. We may choose to early
adopt any new or revised accounting standards whenever such early adoption is permitted for private companies. We will continue to remain
an emerging growth company until the earliest of the following: (1) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary
of the date of the effectiveness of the Registration Statement on Form S-1 of which this prospectus form a part; (2) the last day
of the fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenue is equal to or more than 1.235 billion; (3) the date on which we
have issued more than 1.0 billion in nonconvertible debt during the previous three years; or (4) the date on which we
are deemed to be a large accelerated filer under the rules of the SEC. 

48 

We are also a smaller reporting company as defined
in the Exchange Act. We may continue to be a smaller reporting company even after we are no longer an emerging growth company. We
may take advantage of certain of the scaled disclosures available to smaller reporting companies and will be able to take advantage of
these scaled disclosures for so long as our voting and non-voting common stock held by non-affiliates is less than 250.0 million
measured on the last business day of our second fiscal quarter, or our annual revenue is less than 100.0 million during the
most recently completed fiscal year and our voting and non-voting common stock held by non-affiliates is less than 700.0 million
measured on the last business day of our second fiscal quarter. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

At the end of the period covered by this quarterly
report on Form 10-Q for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an evaluation was carried out under the supervision of and with
the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO ),
of the effectiveness of the design and operations of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and
Rule 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, the CEO and the CFO have concluded that as of the end of the period
covered by this quarterly report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that: (i) information required
to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit to the SEC under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in applicable rules and forms and (ii) material information required to be disclosed in our reports
filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow for
accurate and timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
