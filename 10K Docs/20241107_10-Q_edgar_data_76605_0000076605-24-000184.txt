ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 OVERVIEW 
 This Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations MD A is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations, financial condition and cash flows of Patrick Industries, Inc. This MD A should be read in conjunction with the Company s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included in Item 1 of this Report. In addition, this MD A contains certain statements relating to future results which are forward-looking statements as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. See Information Concerning Forward-Looking Statements on page 30 of this Report. The Company undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements. 
 OVERVIEW OF MARKETS AND RELATED INDUSTRY PERFORMANCE 
 Third Quarter and Nine Months Ended 2024 Financial Overview 
 Recreational Vehicle ("RV") Industry 
 The RV industry is our primary market and comprised 43 and 44 of the Company's net sales in the third quarter and nine months ended September 29, 2024, respectively, and 46 and 43 in the third quarter and nine months ended October 1, 2023, respectively. Net sales to the RV industry in the third quarter and nine months ended September 29, 2024 decreased 1 and increased 10 , respectively, compared to the prior year periods. 
 According to the RV Industry Association ("RVIA"), RV wholesale unit shipments in the third quarter of 2024 totaled approximately 77,800 units, an increase of 6 from approximately 73,300 units in the third quarter of 2023. While we estimate RV industry retail unit sales in the third quarter of 2024 decreased by approximately 8 compared to the third quarter of 2023, we estimate that industry retail unit sales exceeded wholesale unit shipments in the third quarter of 2024 as RV OEMs maintained lower production volumes. 
 RV wholesale unit shipments for the first nine months of 2024 totaled approximately 256,400 units, an increase of 8 from approximately 238,100 units, compared to the first nine months of 2023. While we estimate RV industry retail unit sales in the first nine months of 2024 decreased by approximately 10 compared to the first nine months of 2023, we estimate that industry retail unit sales exceeded wholesale unit shipments which resulted in improved alignment of dealer inventory levels with current retail demand. 
 Marine Industry 
 Net sales to the marine industry comprised 15 and 16 of the Company's net sales in the third quarter and nine months ended September 29, 2024, respectively, and 20 and 24 in the third quarter and nine months ended October 1, 2023, respectively. Net sales to the marine industry in the third quarter and nine months ended September 29, 2024 decreased 21 and 29 , respectively, compared to the prior year periods. The decrease in net sales to the marine industry was in line with the decrease in wholesale powerboats volumes. 
 Our marine revenue is generally correlated to marine industry wholesale powerboat unit shipments. According to Company estimates based on data published by the National Marine Manufacturers Association ("NMMA"), wholesale powerboat unit shipments decreased 23 and 27 in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared to the prior year periods. 
 We estimate that marine industry retail powerboat unit sales decreased 8 in both the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared to the prior year periods, primarily due to the current macroeconomic environment faced by the end consumer, such as economic uncertainty and higher interest rates.

Powersports Industry 
 Through acquisitions completed in recent years, the Company entered the powersports end market. Powersports is a category of motorsports which includes vehicles such as motorcycles, all-terrain vehicles (ATV's), utility vehicles (UTV's), snowmobiles, scooters, golf carts and other personal transportation vehicles, and other related categories. Previously, our sales to the powersports end market were included in the Company s marine end market sales. Effective with the first quarter of 2024, powersports net sales are being reported separately after the January 2024 acquisition of Sportech, LLC Sportech ), as discussed in Note 5 "Acquisitions" of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Net sales to the powersports industry increased 204 in the third quarter ended September 29, 2024 compared to the prior year quarter, representing 10 and 3 of the Company's consolidated net sales in the respective periods. Net sales to the powersports industry increased 179 in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the prior year period, representing 9 and 3 of the Company's consolidated net sales in the respective periods. The increases in net sales for these periods are primarily attributable to the Company's acquisition of Sportech in January 2024. 
 Manufactured Housing ("MH") Industry 
 Net sales to the MH industry comprised 19 and 18 of the Company's net sales in the third quarter and nine months ended September 29, 2024, respectively, and 17 and 16 in the third quarter and nine months ended October 1, 2023, respectively. Net sales to the MH industry in the third quarter and the first nine months of September 29, 2024 increased 22 and 20 , respectively, compared to the prior year periods. According to Company estimates based on industry data from the Manufactured Housing Institute, MH industry wholesale unit shipments increased 17 in both the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 compared to the prior year periods, primarily driven by OEMs increasing production from significantly reduced levels in 2023 in anticipation of a recovery in demand. 
 Industrial Market 
 The industrial market is comprised primarily of kitchen cabinet, countertop, hospitality, retail and commercial fixtures, and office and household furniture markets and regional distributors. Net sales to the industrial market comprised 13 of the Company's net sales in both the third quarter and nine months ended September 29, 2024, and 14 in both the third quarter and nine months ended October 1, 2023. Net sales to the industrial market in the third quarter and the first nine months of September 29, 2024 increased 2 and decreased 2 , respectively, compared to the prior year periods. Overall, our revenues in these markets are focused on residential and multifamily housing, hospitality, high-rise housing and office, commercial construction and institutional furniture markets. We estimate that, in general, approximately 70 to 80 of our industrial business is directly tied to the residential housing market, with the remaining 20 to 30 tied to the non-residential and commercial markets. 
 According to the U.S. Census Bureau, combined new housing starts decreased 3 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the prior year quarter, reflecting decreases in multifamily housing starts and single-family housing starts of 11 and 1 , respectively. 
 For the first nine months of 2024, combined new housing starts decreased 3 compared to the prior year period, reflecting a decrease in multifamily housing starts of 29 , partially offset by an increase in single-family housing starts of 10 . Our industrial products are generally among the last components installed in new unit construction and as such our related sales typically trail new housing starts by four to six months.

 Net Sales. Net sales in the third quarter of 2024 increased 53.3 million, or 6 , to 919.4 million compared to 866.1 million in the third quarter of 2023. Net sales in the third quarter of 2024 increased due to increased sales to the powersports, MH and industrial markets, partially offset by decreased sales to the marine and RV markets. Sales to the powersports market increased 58.6 million, or 204 , compared to the prior year quarter, primarily attributable to the Company s acquisition of Sportech in the first quarter of 2024. Sales to the MH market increased 31.7 million, or 22 , compared to the prior year quarter, primarily due to an increase in estimated wholesale MH industry unit shipments of approximately 17 . Sales to the industrial market increased 2.3 million, or 2 , when compared to the prior year quarter, which is in line with housing start trends in the prior two quarters given the timing at which our products are installed in relation to housing starts. Sales to the marine market decreased 35.7 million, or 21 , primarily attributable to a decrease in estimated wholesale units of 23 compared to the prior year quarter. The Company's sales to the RV market decreased 3.6 million, or 1 , to 396.5 million in the third quarter of 2024 from 400.1 million in the third quarter of 2023, resulting from decreased production by our RV OEM customers. 
 Net sales in the first nine months of 2024 increased 182.7 million, or 7 , to 2.87 billion from 2.69 billion in the first nine months of 2023. Net sales in the first nine months of 2024 increased due to increased sales to the powersports, RV and MH markets, partially offset by decreased sales to the marine and industrial markets.

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 The Company's primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operation, available cash reserves and borrowing capacity available under the revolving credit and term loan facility (the 2021 Credit Facility ), as discussed in Note 8 "Debt" of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Our liquidity as of September 29, 2024 consisted of cash and cash equivalents of 52.6 million and 405.0 million of availability under the 2021 Credit Facility, net of 5 million of outstanding letters of credit. 
 Subsequent to the end of the third quarter of 2024, we expanded our access to capital and reduced our cost of debt by issuing 500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.375 senior notes due 2032 (the 6.375 Senior Notes ). The proceeds from the issuance were utilized to redeem all 300.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Company s 7.50 Senior Notes due 2027 (the 7.50 Senior Notes ), to repay a portion of the Company s borrowings under its existing senior secured credit facility and pay related fees and expenses, as discussed in Note 14 "Subsequent Events" to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

As of September 29, 2024, the Company's existing cash and cash equivalents, cash generated from operations, and available borrowings under the 2021 Credit Facility are expected to be sufficient to meet anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months, exclusive of any acquisitions, based on the Company's current cash flow budgets and forecast of short-term and long-term liquidity needs. 
 Principal uses of cash are to support working capital demands, meet debt service requirements and support the Company's capital allocation strategy, which includes acquisitions, capital expenditures, dividends and repurchases of the Company s common stock, among others. 
 Working capital requirements vary from period to period depending on manufacturing volumes primarily related to the RV, marine, powersports, MH and industrial markets we serve, the timing of deliveries, and the payment cycles of customers. In the event that operating cash flow is inadequate and one or more of the Company's capital resources were to become unavailable, the Company would seek to revise its operating strategies accordingly. The Company will continue to assess its liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in view of operating performance, current economic and capital market conditions, and other relevant circumstances. 
 In the first nine months of 2024, the Company utilized available borrowing capacity under the Revolver due 2027 and cash on hand to fund the acquisitions of Sportech and ICON Direct LLC ("RecPro"), as discussed in Note 5 "Acquisitions" of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 As of and for the reporting period ended September 29, 2024, the Company was in compliance with its financial covenants as required under the terms of the credit agreement that established the 2021 Credit Facility (the 2021 Credit Agreement ). The required maximum consolidated secured net leverage ratio and the required minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio, as such ratios are defined in the 2021 Credit Agreement, compared to the actual amounts as of September 29, 2024 and for the fiscal period then ended are as follows: 
 Required Actual Consolidated secured net leverage ratio (12-month period) 2.75 0.85 Consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio (12-month period) 1.50 3.55 
 In addition, as of September 29, 2024, the Company's consolidated total net leverage ratio (12-month period) was 2.65, which is used to determine the applicable borrowing margin under the 2021 Credit Agreement. 
 Cash Flows 
 Operating Activities: Cash flows from operating activities are one of the Company's primary sources of liquidity, representing the net income the Company earned in the reported periods, adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities. 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 224.2 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 293.8 million in the first nine months of 2023. The decrease in operating cash flows is primarily attributable to a 40.4 million use of cash for working capital, net of business acquisitions, compared to a 56.1 million source of cash in the prior year period, partially offset by a 11.7 million increase in net income and a 16.0 million increase in depreciation and amortization compared to the first nine months of 2023. 
 Investing Activities: Net cash used in investing activities increased 409.9 million to 485.4 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 75.5 million in the first nine months of 2023 due to an increase in cash used in business acquisitions, which were 411.6 million in the nine months of 2024, primarily due to the acquisitions of Sportech and RecPro, compared to 26.0 million in the first nine months of 2023. 
 Financing Activities: Net cash provided by financing activities was 302.4 million in the first nine months of 2024 compared to 224.8 million use of cash in the first nine months of 2023 primarily due to an increase in cash provided from net borrowings of 365.0 million under the Revolver due 2027 to fund the acquisitions of Sportech and RecPro.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 
 See Note 1, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies to the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1. 
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies which are summarized in the MD A in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 29, 2024. 
 OTHER 
 Seasonality 
 Manufacturing operations in the RV, marine and MH industries historically have been seasonal and at their highest levels when the weather is moderate. Accordingly, the Company s sales and profits had generally been the highest in the second quarter and lowest in the fourth quarter. Seasonal industry trends in the past several years have included the impact related to the addition of major RV manufacturer open houses for dealers in the August-September timeframe and marine open houses in the December to February timeframe, resulting in dealers delaying certain restocking purchases until new product lines are introduced at these shows. In addition, recent seasonal industry trends have been, and future trends may be, different than in prior years due to volatile economic conditions, interest rates, access to financing, cost of fuel, national and regional economic conditions and consumer confidence on retail sales of RVs and marine units and other products for which the Company sells its components, as well as fluctuations in RV and marine dealer inventories, increased volatility in demand from RV and marine dealers, the timing of dealer orders, and from time to time, the impact of severe weather conditions on the timing of industry-wide wholesale shipments. 
 INFORMATION CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 The Company makes forward-looking statements with respect to financial condition, results of operations, business strategies, operating efficiencies or synergies, competitive position, growth opportunities for existing products, plans and objectives of management, markets for the common stock of Patrick Industries, Inc. and other matters from time to time and desires to take advantage of the safe harbor which is afforded such statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 when they are accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. The statements contained in the foregoing Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations , as well as other statements contained in this quarterly report and statements contained in future filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ), publicly disseminated press releases, quarterly earnings conference calls, and statements which may be made from time to time in the future by management of the Company in presentations to shareholders, prospective investors, and others interested in the business and financial affairs of the Company, which are not historical facts, are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Any projections of financial performance or statements concerning expectations as to future developments should not be construed in any manner as a guarantee that such results or developments will, in fact, occur. There can be no assurance that any forward-looking statement will be realized or that actual results will not be significantly different from those set forth in such forward-looking statement. The Company does not undertake to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements. Information about certain risks that could affect our business and cause actual results to differ from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements are contained in the section entitled Risk Factors in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and in the Company's Forms 10-Q for subsequent quarterly periods, which are filed with the SEC and are available on the SEC s website at www.sec.gov.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Debt Obligations under Credit Agreement 
 As of September 29, 2024, our total debt obligations under our 2021 Credit Agreement accrue interest under SOFR-based interest rates. A 100-basis point increase in the underlying SOFR would result in additional annual interest cost of approximately 4.9 million, assuming average borrowings, including our revolving credit facility and term loan under our senior credit facility, subject to variable rates of 490.6 million, which was the amount of such borrowings outstanding at September 29, 2024 subject to variable rates, excluding deferred financing costs related to the term loan. 
 Commodity Volatility 
 The prices of key raw materials, consisting primarily of lauan, gypsum, particleboard, aluminum, softwoods lumber, and petroleum-based products, are influenced by demand and other factors specific to these commodities, such as the price of oil, rather than being directly affected by inflationary pressures. Prices of certain commodities have historically been volatile. During periods of volatile commodity prices, we have generally been able to pass both price increases and decreases to our customers in the form of price adjustments. We are exposed to risks during periods of commodity volatility because there can be no assurance future cost increases or decreases, if any, can be partially or fully passed on to customers, or that the timing of such sales price increases or decreases will match raw material cost increases or decreases. We do not believe that commodity price volatility had a material effect on results of operations for the periods presented. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures , as such term is defined under Securities Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, the Company s management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and the Company s management necessarily is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of our senior management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report (the Evaluation Date ). Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded as of the Evaluation Date that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective such that the information relating to the Company, including consolidated subsidiaries, required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Changes in internal control over financial reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) that occurred during the third quarter ended September 29, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
