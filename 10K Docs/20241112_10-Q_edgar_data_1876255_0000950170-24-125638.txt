The investment objective of the Company is to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns through investments primarily in loans secured by high quality commercial real estate properties located in the United States. The Company seeks to prioritize capital preservation and high current income by investing primarily in directly originated first mortgage loans, senior and junior mezzanine loans, B-notes, second mortgages or other subordinated loans. To a lesser extent, the Company invests in the following: legacy, new issue, and single-borrower commercial mortgage backed securities CMBS commercial real estate- related securities; performing, sub-performing and non-performing/distressed loans; and net leased assets. While the Company focuses mainly on loans directly secured by commercial real estate-related assets, it also has the flexibility to invest in other types of debt investments, including unsecured debt of entities that directly or indirectly own real property or real estate-related debt, and invests in commercial real estate-related preferred and common equity interests where doing so is in keeping with the investment objective. The Company conducts private offerings of its Units to investors in reliance on exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ). The Company s initial private offering of Units (the Private Offering has been conducted in reliance on Regulation D under the Securities Act.

Each investor has made a capital commitment (a Capital Commitment to purchase Units pursuant to a subscription agreement (a Subscription Agreement ). We refer to the initial date on which Capital Commitments were first accepted by or on behalf of the Company from Members as the Initial Closing, and each such date on which Capital Commitments are accepted as a closing.

Each Capital Commitment made by a Member at a closing has its own lock-up period (a Lock-Up Period ). The Lock-Up Period for each Capital Commitment is the period commencing on the applicable closing and ending on the third anniversary of such closing. Upon the expiration of a Member s Lock-Up Period, such Member may choose to be released from its Remaining Commitment (as defined below), subject to certain post-commitment period obligations. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2024 investors will begin to exit their Lock-Up Period in accordance with the Company s Second Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Operating Agreement (the Second A R LLCA ).

Fair values for loan receivables held for investment, are measured by discounting future contractual cash flows to be received on the mortgage loan using a discount rate that is derived from observations in the market of discount rates on similar loans with similar credit characteristics and tenor. The discount rate is typically expressed as a spread to Treasuries of a similar tenor if the loan is fixed rate or if floating, as a discount margin to the floating rate index described in the mortgage. The spread or discount margin is reflective of the risk premium associated with the specific loan. Loans that are experiencing deteriorating credit fundamentals, delinquencies, or are anticipated to be foreclosed upon will tend to have higher spreads or discount margins reflecting their higher credit risk. Loans that are experiencing improving fundamentals will correspondingly have lower spreads or discount margins reflecting their improving credit quality. The discounted cash flow method was used in calculating the fair values of the Company s loan receivables held for investment. The significant unobservable inputs as of September 30, 2024 are the discount margins and range from to . The significant unobservable inputs as of December 31, 2023, are the discount margins and range from to . Fair values of Repurchase Agreement, Credit Facility, and Notes Payable approximate their carrying value as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 because interest rates approximate the discount rates used in calculating the fair value of the investments.

The Investment Manager is responsible for, and the Company does not reimburse the Investment Manager for, the expenses related to investment personnel of the Investment Manager who provide services to the Company. However, the Company does reimburse the Investment Manager for the Company s allocable share of compensation paid to certain of the Investment Manager s non-investment personnel, which compensation is allocated among the Company and other applicable clients of the Investment Manager on a basis that the Investment Manager believes in good faith to be fair and reasonable.

These forward-looking statements apply only as of the date of this Quarterly Report. Moreover, we assume no duty and do not undertake to update the forward-looking statements. 
 The following analysis of the Company s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the Company s financial statements and the related notes thereto contained elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. 
 Overview 
 We are a Delaware limited liability company formed on June 1, 2021, to operate as a private investment fund generally for qualified US investors. We intend to qualify and elect to be taxed as a real estate investment trust under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ). Our board of directors (the Board was appointed to serve the Company. However, pursuant to an investment management agreement (as amended, the Management Agreement between us and the Investment Manager, the Board delegated to the Investment Manager all rights, power, authority, discretion, duties and responsibilities in respect of the Company, including without limitation, responsibility for the investment activities of the Company and the day-to-day management and administration of the Company. The Board remains responsible for overseeing the performance of the Investment Manager. The investment management services provided by the Investment Manager are in accordance with our investment objectives and policies, subject to the oversight by the Board. To achieve certain tax, regulatory and/or administrative efficiencies, we may invest through or otherwise utilize one or more subsidiary investment vehicles (each, a Subsidiary that are managed and/or sponsored by the Investment Manager or its affiliates. The discussion in this Quarterly Report relating to investments made by us or other actions may relate to such investments or other actions made by a Subsidiary, as applicable. Our investment objective is to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns through a diversified portfolio of commercial real estate-related investments that are predominantly credit investments secured by commercial real estate located in the United States, principally through investments made pursuant to the investment program described herein. 
 We, directly or indirectly (including through a Subsidiary), invest in a portfolio of primarily debt investments, or participations therein (collectively, the Portfolio Investments that may include, without limitation, the following: directly originated commercial real estate mortgage loans, including senior and junior mezzanine loans, B-notes, second mortgages, other subordinated loans (together, Directly Originated Loans legacy, new issue, and single-borrower commercial mortgage backed securities CMBS commercial real estate-related securities; performing, sub-performing and non-performing loans; and net lease assets. While we intend to focus primarily on loans directly secured by commercial real estate-related assets, we also have the flexibility, subject to compliance with the real estate investment trust REIT qualification requirements, to invest in other types of debt investments, including unsecured debt of entities that directly or indirectly own real property or real estate-related debt. We may also invest in commercial real estate-related preferred and common equity interests where doing so is in keeping with our investment objective. We retain ultimate discretion on our investment profile. 
 Our Private Offering 
 The Company currently falls outside of the definition of an investment company under the Investment Company Act, by satisfying the conditions of Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the Investment Company Act, which excludes from the definition of an investment company persons that are primarily engaged in investing in interests in real estate. We expect to conduct private offerings of our Units to investors in reliance on exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ). Our initial private offering of Units (the Private Offering was conducted in reliance on Regulation D under the Securities Act. Any investors in our Private Offering were required to be accredited investors as defined in Regulation D of the Securities Act. The criteria required of Regulation D under the Securities Act may not apply to investors in subsequent offerings. Investments by U.S. investors in the Private Offering were also subject to state securities laws. Further, due to certain anti-money laundering restrictions and economic sanctions concerns, Units may not be offered, sold, transferred, or delivered, directly or indirectly, to certain unacceptable investors. Our LLC Agreement also imposes additional restrictions upon the ownership of the Units to ensure, among other things, that we qualify and maintain our status as a REIT under the Code. 
 21 

We entered into separate subscription agreements with a number of investors for the Private Offering. Each investor has made a capital commitment (a Capital Commitment to purchase Units pursuant to a subscription agreement (a Subscription Agreement ). We refer to the initial date on which Capital Commitments were first accepted by or on behalf of the Company from Members as the Initial Closing, and each such date on which Capital Commitments are accepted as a closing. Thereafter, subsequent closings for additional Capital Commitments from new and existing Members may generally be held as of the end of the calendar quarter, subject to our discretion to hold closings at any other time. 
 Each Capital Commitment made by a Member at a closing has its own lock-up period (a Lock-Up Period ). The Lock- Up Period for each Capital Commitment is the period commencing on the applicable closing and ending on the third anniversary of such closing. Upon the expiration of a Member s Lock-Up Period, such Member may choose to be released from its Remaining Commitment (as defined below), subject to certain post-commitment period obligations. 
 A Member s Remaining Commitment equals such Capital Commitment reduced by amounts contributed to the Company in respect of capital calls and post-commitment period capital calls and increased by (i) the amount of any unused capital contributions that are returned to such Member pursuant to the last sentence of the following paragraph and (ii) distributions to such Member that represent a return of capital (and not Current Income (as defined below)). Each Capital Commitment made by a Member is accounted for separately, including for purposes of determining Remaining Commitments and capital calls. In no event will a Member be required to make a capital contribution in respect of its Capital Commitment in excess of its Remaining Commitment. 
 Each Capital Commitment (or a portion thereof, as applicable) of a Member lasts until (i) the Company determines to repurchase all or any portion of such Member s Units that are attributable to such Capital Commitment (or such portion thereof, as applicable), as discussed below (which for the avoidance of doubt, will not become available pursuant to a Member s repurchase request until the expiration of the Lock-Up Period), (ii) such Member has chosen to be released from its Remaining Commitments after the expiration of its Lock-Up Period (except with respect to post commitment period obligations) or (iii) the Company has elected to wind up. 
 Investors are required to purchase Units each time we provide notice of a capital call, which notice is delivered at least 5 business days prior to the date on which a capital call is due, in an aggregate amount not exceeding their respective Capital Commitments. All capital calls generally are made pro rata in accordance with the investors Capital Commitments. 
 We currently have one class of Units. We may issue additional classes of Units in the future (or we may enter into agreements with certain Members that alter, modify or change the terms of the Units held by such Members), which may differ from the Units described herein, including, without limitation, in respect of a Related Investor. New classes of Units may be established by us without providing prior notice to, or receiving consent from, existing Members. The terms of such classes will be determined by us in our sole discretion. See Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence Transactions with Related Persons; Policies and Procedures for Review of Related Party Transactions The Investment Manager Diverse Member Group of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 
 We may, directly or indirectly, borrow for working capital purposes, including, but not limited to, paying fees and expenses or managing cash flows from Capital Commitments. In connection therewith, we will be authorized to pledge, charge, mortgage, assign, transfer and grant security interests to a lender in (i) all Capital Commitments, our right to initiate drawdowns and collect the capital contributions of the Members and to enforce their obligations to make capital contributions to purchase Units, and (ii) a Company collateral account into which the payment by the Members of their remaining Capital Commitment are to be made. We refer to any such financing as a Commitment Facility. In connection with any Commitment Facility, and as further described in the LLC Agreement, each Member remains absolutely and unconditionally obligated to fund capital calls duly issued by us or by the lender under a Commitment Facility (including, without limitation, those required as a result of the failure of any other Member to fund capital calls), without setoff, counterclaim or defense, including without limitation any defense of fraud or mistake, or any defense under any bankruptcy or insolvency law, including Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code, subject in all cases to the Members rights to assert such claims against us in one or more separate actions; provided that, any such claims are subordinate to all payments due to the lenders under a Commitment Facility. 
 A Member that defaults in respect of its remaining Capital Commitment may be subject to certain remedies, including forfeiture of its Units. 
 The NAV per Unit is calculated by the Administrator (as defined below) as of each Valuation Date pursuant to the procedures determined by the Investment Manager. Generally, the last business day of each calendar quarter or such other date designated by us to accept the purchase of Units, as determined in our sole discretion, is the Valuation Date. The NAV per Unit is determined by dividing the value of the total assets of the Company less the liabilities of the Company by the total number of Units outstanding as at any Valuation Date. Liabilities are determined based upon generally accepted accounting principles, subject to our right, in 
 22 

consultation with the Investment Manager, to provide reserves or holdbacks for estimated accrued expenses, liabilities or contingencies, including general reserves or holdbacks for unspecified contingencies (even if not required by generally accepted accounting principles). In calculating the NAV per unit, income and expenditure are treated as accruing from day-to-day. 
 In connection with any capital call, the per Unit price for the corresponding purchase of Units is determined by the Company in accordance with the policies described herein. In particular, in the event that Units are issued as of the first business day of a calendar quarter, the per Unit price of such Units is equal to the NAV per Unit established by the Company as of the immediately preceding Valuation Date (i.e., the last business day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter). In the event that Units are issued on any day that is not the first business day of the calendar quarter, we use the methods described above, to the extent reasonably possible, to determine the NAV per Unit as of such issuance date.

Income 
 Our investment objective is to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns through investments primarily in loans secured by high quality commercial real estate properties located in the United States. The Investment Manager seeks to prioritize capital preservation and stable income for investors by building a portfolio of investments primarily through Directly Originated Loans secured by high-quality commercial real estate properties, including senior mortgage loans, mezzanine loans, and B-notes. Our investment strategy also allows for the acquisition of discounted loans with room to restructure in order to improve recoverability above the price paid or achieve an enhanced income stream. To a lesser extent, the Investment Manager invests in the following: legacy, new issue, and single-borrower CMBSs; commercial real estate-related securities; performing, sub-performing and non-performing/distressed loans; and net lease assets. While we focus mainly on loans directly secured by commercial real estate-related assets, we will also have the flexibility to invest in other types of debt investments, including unsecured debt of entities that directly or indirectly own real property or real estate-related debt, and may invest in commercial real estate-related preferred and common equity interests where doing so is in keeping with the investment objective. This embedded diversification enables the Team to invest across real estate debt opportunities in various stages of an economic cycle, and to capitalize on dislocations in the markets over time. 
 We generate revenue in the form of cash dividends, interest and other similar cash distributions received by the Company in respect of its investments, as well as principal repayment or sale or distribution proceeds in respect of such investments. 
 Expenses 
 Our primary operating expenses include the payment of fees to the Investment Manager pursuant to the Management Agreement and the LLC Agreement, payment of fees to the Administrator pursuant to the Administration Agreement and reimbursement of the Investment Manager or its affiliates for Organizational Expenses.

This cap will be maintained until the third anniversary of the Initial Closing Date, which is November 5, 2024. Pursuant to the cap, any fees waived and expenses borne by the Investment Manager may be reimbursed by the Company during the period of time following the end of the amortization period and ending on the third anniversary of the start of the amortization period, provided that no reimbursement payment will be made that would cause the Company s expenses to exceed the same cap.

 Factors Impacting Operating Results 
 Our results of operations are affected by a number of factors and primarily depend on, among other things, the level of the interest income generated by the Company from targeted assets, the market value of our assets and the supply of, and demand for, real estate-related loans, including mezzanine loans, first mortgage loans, subordinated mortgage loans, preferred equity investments and other loans related to high quality commercial real estate in the United States, and the financing and other costs associated with our business. Interest income and borrowing costs of the Company may vary as a result of changes in interest rates, which could impact the net interest we receive on our assets. Our operating results may also be impacted by conditions in the financial markets and unanticipated credit events experienced by borrowers under our loan assets.

Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates 
 This discussion of our operating plans is based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ. In addition to the discussion below, we describe our critical accounting policies in the notes to our financial statements. 
 Investments 
 Loan Receivables 
 The Company originates and purchases commercial real estate debt and related instruments generally to be held as long-term investments at amortized cost. 
 Provision for Loan Losses 
 The provision for loan losses reflects the Company s estimate of loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. The provision for loan losses includes a portfolio-based, general component and an asset-specific component. 
 The Company estimates its portfolio-based loan loss provision based on consultation with a third-party valuation provider and expectation of losses inherent in the investment portfolio but not yet realized. To ensure that the risk exposures are properly measured and the appropriate reserves are taken, the Company assesses a loan loss provision balance that will grow over time with its portfolio and the related risk as the assets are aged and approach maturity and ultimate refinancing where applicable. Significant judgment is required when evaluating loans for impairment, therefore actual results over time could be materially different. 
 The asset-specific reserve component relates to reserves for losses on individually impaired loans. The Company evaluates each loan for impairment at least quarterly. Impairment occurs when it is deemed probable that the Company will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan. If the loan is considered to be impaired, an allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying value of the loan to the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective rate or the fair value of the collateral, less the estimated costs to sell, if recovery of the Company s investment is expected solely from the collateral. The Company generally will use the direct capitalization rate valuation methodology or the sales comparison approach to estimate the fair value of the collateral for such loans and in certain cases obtain external appraisals. Determining fair value of the collateral may take into account a number of assumptions including, but not limited to, cash flow projections, market capitalization rates, discount rates and data regarding recent comparable sales of similar properties. Such assumptions are generally based on current market conditions and are subject to economic and market uncertainties. 
 The Company s loans are typically collateralized by real estate directly or indirectly. As a result, the Company regularly evaluates the extent and impact of any credit deterioration associated with the performance and/or value of the underlying collateral property as well as the financial and operating capability of the borrower/sponsor on a loan by loan basis. Specifically, a property s operating results and any cash reserves are analyzed and used to assess (i) whether cash flow from operations is sufficient to cover the debt service requirements currently and into the future, (ii) the ability of the borrower to refinance the loan at maturity, and/or (iii) the property s liquidation value. The Company also evaluates the financial wherewithal of any loan guarantors as well as the borrower s competency in managing and operating the properties. In addition, the Company considers the overall economic environment, real estate sector, and geographic submarket in which the collateral property is located. Such impairment analyses are completed and reviewed by asset management and underwriting personnel, who utilize various data sources, including (i) periodic financial data such as property occupancy, tenant profile, rental rates, operating expenses, the borrowers business plan, and capitalization and discount rates, (ii) site inspections, and (iii) current credit spreads and other market data and ultimately presented to management for approval. 
 The Company designates non-accrual loans generally when (i) the principal or coupon interest components of loan payments become 90-days past due or (ii) in the opinion of the Company, it is doubtful the Company will be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan. Interest income on non-accrual loans in which the Company reasonably expects a full recovery of the loan s outstanding principal balance is recognized when received in cash. Otherwise, income recognition will be suspended and any cash received will be applied as a reduction to the amortized cost. A non-accrual loan is returned to accrual status at such time as the loan becomes contractually current and future principal and coupon interest are reasonably assured to be received in accordance with the contractual loan terms. A loan will be written off when management has determined it is no longer realizable and deemed non-recoverable. There have been no non-accrual loans through September 30, 2024. 
 The allowance for credit losses was 6.7 million and 5.3 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and is included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, 
 27 

respectively, this allowance was impacted by an decrease of 1.8 million and an increase of 1.4 million in allowance for credit losses as reflected in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. 
 Equity Method Investments 
 The Company accounts for its investments in unconsolidated entities under the equity method of accounting. The Company applies the equity method by initially recording these investments at cost, as equity method investments, subsequently adjusted for equity in earnings and cash contributions and distributions. The reporting period of the investments financial statements lags the Company s financial reporting period, but such lag is never more than three months. In the event there is an outside basis portion of the Company s equity method investments, it is amortized over the anticipated useful lives of the underlying entities tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed. 
 The Company evaluates equity investments on a periodic basis to determine if there are any indicators that the value of the equity investment may be impaired and whether or not that impairment is other-than-temporary. To the extent an impairment has occurred and is determined to be other-than-temporary, we measure the charge as the excess of the carrying value of our investment over its estimated fair value. 
 Revenue Recognition 
 Interest income, adjusted for amortization of market premium and accretion of market discount, is recorded on an accrual basis to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts. Original issue discount, principally representing the estimated fair value of detachable equity or warrants obtained in conjunction with our debt investments, and market discount or premium are capitalized and accreted or amortized into income over the life of the respective security using the effective interest method. Loan origination fees received in connection with the closing of investments are reported as unearned income which is included as amortized cost of the investment; the unearned income from such fees is accreted over the contractual life of the loan based on a straight line up to the maturity date of the loan. Upon prepayment of a loan or debt security, any prepayment penalties, unamortized loan origination fees, and unamortized market discounts are recorded as income. 
 Management Fees 
 We accrue for the Management Fee and Incentive Fee as part of the quarterly valuation of the Company, or as otherwise provided in the LLC Agreement. 
 Federal Income Taxes 
 We intend to qualify and elect to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes commencing with our taxable year that begins on the date of our Initial Closing. To qualify as a REIT, we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that we distribute at least 90 of our REIT taxable income, subject to certain adjustments and excluding any net capital gain, to Members. Our intention is to adhere to the REIT qualification requirements and to maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT. 
 As a REIT, we are generally not subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax on the portion of taxable income that is distributed to Members. If we fail to qualify for taxation as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to U.S. federal income taxes at regular corporate rates and we may not be able to qualify as a REIT for four subsequent taxable years. As a REIT, we may be subject to certain state and local taxes on our income and property, and to U.S. federal income and excise taxes on undistributed taxable income. Taxable income from non-REIT activities is subject to U.S. federal, state, and local income taxes at the applicable rates. 
 We account for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective income tax basis, and for net operating loss, capital loss and tax credit carryforwards. The deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted income tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be realized or settled. The effect on the deferred tax assets and liabilities from a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period when the new rate is enacted. However, deferred tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is more likely than not that they will be realized based on consideration of all available evidence, including the future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, future projected taxable income and tax planning strategies. Valuation allowances are provided if, based upon the weight of the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We perform an annual review for any uncertain tax positions and, if necessary, will record the expected future tax consequences of uncertain tax positions in the financial statements.

Deferred Financing Costs 
 Deferred financing costs include capitalized expenses related to the closing of the debt obligations. Amortization of deferred financing costs is computed on the straight-line basis over the contractual term for the Credit Facility, Repurchase Agreement and Notes Payable. The amortization of such costs is included in interest expense in the consolidated statements of income, with any unamortized amounts included in deferred financing costs on the consolidated balance sheets.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We are subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates. To the extent that we borrow money to make investments, our net investment income is dependent upon the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we invest these funds. In periods of rising interest rates, our cost of funds would increase, which may reduce our net investment income. Because most of our investments bear interest at floating rates, an increase in interest rates could have a corresponding increase in our interest income that may offset any reduction in our net investment income. However, there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. 
 Assuming that the statement of assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2024, were to remain constant and that we took no actions to alter our existing interest rate sensitivity, the following table shows the annualized impact of hypothetical base rate changes in interest rates. The total outstanding amount of loan receivable assets and debt obligation liabilities subject to changes on floating interest rate are 849.8 million and 536.9 million, respectively.

In addition, any investments we make that are denominated in a foreign currency are subject to risks associated with changes in currency exchange rates. These risks include the possibility of significant fluctuations in the foreign currency markets, the imposition or modification of foreign exchange controls and potential illiquidity in the secondary market. These risks will vary depending upon the currency or currencies involved. 
 We may hedge against interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations by using standard hedging instruments such as futures, options and forward contracts. While hedging activities may insulate us against adverse changes in interest rates, they may also limit our ability to participate in benefits of lower interest rates with respect to our portfolio of investments with fixed interest rates. 
 Market Risk 
 The Company s loans are highly illiquid and there is no assurance that it will achieve its investment objectives, including targeted returns. The Company invests in financial instruments that are subject to interest rate volatility and regional and global conflicts that could adversely affect the results of the Company. 
 Credit Risk 
 Credit risk represents the potential loss that the Company would incur if the borrowers failed to perform pursuant to the terms of their obligations to the Company. The Company manages exposure to credit risk by limiting exposure to any one individual borrower and any one asset class. Additionally, the Company employs an asset management approach and monitors the portfolio of loans through, at a minimum, quarterly financial review of property performance including net operating income and the debt yield. The Company also may require certain borrowers to establish a cash reserve, for the purpose of providing for future interest or property-related operating payments. 
 The performance and value of the Company s loans depend upon the sponsors ability to operate or manage the development of the respective properties that serve as collateral so that each property s value ultimately supports the repayment of the loan balance. Mezzanine loans and preferred equity investments are subordinate to senior mortgage loans and, therefore, involve a higher degree of risk. In the event of a default, mezzanine loans and preferred equity investments will be satisfied only after the senior lender s investment is fully recovered. As a result, in the event of a default, the Company may not recover all of its investments. 
 
 In addition, the Company is exposed to the risks generally associated with the commercial real estate market, including variances in occupancy rates, capitalization rates, absorption rates, and other macroeconomic factors beyond its control. The Company seeks to manage these risks through its underwriting and asset management processes. 
 The Company maintains all of its cash at financial institutions which, at times, may exceed the amount insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. 
 33 

Concentration Risk 
 The Company holds real estate-related loans. Thus, its loan portfolio may be subject to a more rapid change in value than would be the case if it were required to maintain a wide diversification among industries, companies and types of loans. The result of such concentration in real estate assets is that a loss in such loans could materially reduce the Company s capital. 
 Liquidity Risk 
 Liquidity risk represents the possibility that we may not be able to sell, directly or indirectly, our equity interest in the Company at a reasonable price in times of low trading volume, high volatility and financial stress. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Interest rate risk represents the effect from a change in interest rates, which could result in an adverse change in the fair value of our interest-bearing financial instruments. With respect to the Company s business operations, increases in interest rates, in general, may over time cause: (i) the interest expense associated with variable rate borrowings to increase; (ii) the value of real estate-related loans to decline; (iii) coupons on variable rate loans to reset, although on a delayed basis, to higher interest rates; (iv) to the extent applicable under the terms of the Company s investments, prepayments on real estate-related loans to slow, and (v) to the extent we enter into interest rate swap agreements as part of the Company s hedging strategy, the value of these agreements to increase. 
 Conversely, decreases in interest rates, in general, may over time cause: (i) the interest expense associated with variable rate borrowings to decrease; (ii) the value of real estate-related loans to increase; (iii) coupons on variable rate real estate-related loans to reset, although on a delayed basis, to lower interest rates (iv) to the extent applicable under the terms of the Company s investments, prepayments on real estate-related loans to increase, and (v) to the extent the Company enters into interest rate swap agreements as part of its hedging strategy, the value of these agreements to decrease. 
 Prepayment Risk 
 Prepayments can either positively or adversely affect the yields on the Company s loans. Prepayments on debt instruments, where permitted under the debt documents, are influenced by changes in current interest rates and a variety of economic, geographic and other factors beyond our control, and consequently, such prepayment rates cannot be predicted with certainty. If the Company does not collect a prepayment fee in connection with a prepayment or are unable to invest the proceeds of such prepayments received, the yield on the portfolio will decline. In addition, the Company may acquire assets at a discount or premium and if the asset does not repay when expected, the anticipated yield may be impacted. Under certain interest rate and prepayment scenarios the Company may fail to recoup fully its cost of acquisition of certain loans. 
 Extension Risk 
 Extension risk is the risk that the Company s assets are repaid at a slower rate than anticipated and generally increases when interest rates rise. In which case, to the extent the Company has financed the acquisition of an asset, the Company s may have to finance its asset at potentially higher costs without the ability to reinvest principal into higher yielding securities because borrowers prepay their mortgages at a slower pace than originally expected, adversely impacting its net interest spread, and thus its net interest income. 
 
 Real Estate Risk 
 The market values of commercial and residential mortgage assets are subject to volatility and may be affected adversely by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, national, regional and local economic conditions (which may be adversely affected by industry slowdowns and other factors); local real estate conditions; changes or continued weakness in specific industry segments; construction quality, age and design; demographic factors; retroactive changes to building or similar codes; pandemics; natural disasters and other acts of god. In addition, decreases in property values reduce the value of the collateral and the potential proceeds available to a borrower to repay the underlying loans, which could also cause the Company to suffer losses.

As of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Company s principal executive and principal financial officers, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, the Company s principal executive and principal financial officers have concluded that the Company s current disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them to material information relating to the Company that is required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act. 
 There have been no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Company s most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

 The Company is not currently subject to any material legal proceedings, nor, to our knowledge, is any material legal proceeding threatened against us. From time to time, we may be a party to certain legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business. Our business is also subject to extensive regulation, which may result in regulatory proceedings against us. While the outcome of these legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not expect that these proceedings will have a material effect upon our financial condition or results of operations.
