 Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
 This report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), which reflect our current views with respect to, among other things, future events, operations and financial performance. You can identify these forward-looking statements by the use of forward-looking words such as outlook, believes, expects, potential, continues, may, will, should, seeks, predicts, intends, plans, estimates, anticipates, foresees or negative versions of those words, other comparable words or other statements that do not relate to historical or factual matters. The forward-looking statements are based on our beliefs, assumptions and expectations of our future performance, taking into account all information currently available to us. Such forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties and assumptions relating to our operations, financial results, financial condition, business prospects, growth strategy and liquidity. Some of these factors are described in this report and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, under the headings Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Item 1A. Risk Factors. These factors should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read in conjunction with the risk factors and other cautionary statements that are included in this report and in our other periodic filings. If one or more of these or other risks or uncertainties materialize, or if our underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect, our actual results may vary materially from those indicated in these forward-looking statements. New risks and uncertainties arise over time, and it is not possible for us to predict those events or how they may affect us. Therefore, you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made. We do not undertake any obligation to publicly update or review any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as required by law. 
 
 References in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to the Ares Operating Group refer to Ares Holdings L.P. Ares Holdings ). References in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to an Ares Operating Group Unit or an AOG Unit refers to a partnership unit in the Ares Operating Group entity. 
 
 The use of any defined term in this report to mean more than one entities, persons, securities or other items collectively is solely for convenience of reference and in no way implies that such entities, persons, securities or other items are one indistinguishable group. For example, notwithstanding the use of the defined terms Ares, we and our in this report to refer to Ares Management Corporation and its subsidiaries, each subsidiary of Ares Management Corporation is a standalone legal entity that is separate and distinct from Ares Management Corporation and any of its other subsidiaries. 
 
 Under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States U.S. ( GAAP ), we are required to consolidate (i) entities other than limited partnerships and entities similar to limited partnerships in which we hold a majority voting interest or have majority ownership and control over the operational, financial and investing decisions of that entity, including Ares-affiliates and affiliated funds and co-investment vehicles, for which we are presumed to have controlling financial interests, and (ii) entities that we concluded are variable interest entities VIEs ), including limited partnerships and collateralized loan obligations, for which we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary. When an entity is consolidated, we reflect the assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and cash flows of the entity in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements on a gross basis, subject to eliminations from consolidation, including the elimination of the management fees, carried interest, incentive fees and other fees that we earn from the entity. However, the presentation of performance related compensation and other expenses associated with generating such revenues is not affected by the consolidation process. In addition, as a result of the consolidation process, the net income attributable to third-party investors in consolidated entities is presented as net income attributable to non-controlling interests in Consolidated Funds within Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. We also consolidate joint ventures that we have established with third-party investors for strategic distribution and expansion purposes. The results of these entities are reflected on a gross basis in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, subject to eliminations from consolidation, and net income attributable to third-party investors in the consolidated joint ventures is presented within net income attributable to redeemable interest and non-controlling interests in Ares Operating Group entities or an AOG Entity, which refers to, collectively, Ares Holdings and any future entity designated by our board of directors in its sole discretion as an Ares Operating Group entity. 
 
 In this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, in addition to presenting our results on a consolidated basis in accordance with GAAP, we present revenues, expenses and other results on a: (i) segment basis, which deconsolidates the consolidated funds and removes the proportional results attributable to third-party investors in the consolidated joint ventures, and therefore shows the results of our operating segments without giving effect to the consolidation of these entities; and (ii) unconsolidated reporting basis, which shows the results of our operating segments on a combined segment basis together with the Operations Management Group (the OMG ). In addition to our operating segments, the OMG consists of shared resource groups to support our operating segments by providing infrastructure and administrative support in the areas of accounting/finance, operations, information technology, legal, compliance, human resources, strategy and relationship management and

 distribution. The OMG includes Ares Wealth Management Solutions, LLC AWMS that facilitates the product development, distribution, marketing and client management activities for investment offerings in the global wealth management channel. Additionally, the OMG provides services to certain of the Company s managed funds and vehicles, which reimburse the OMG for expenses either equal to the costs of services provided or as a percentage of invested capital. The OMG s revenues and expenses are not allocated to our operating segments but we consider the cost structure of the OMG when evaluating our financial performance. This information constitutes non-GAAP financial information within the meaning of Regulation G, as promulgated by the SEC. Our management uses this information to assess the performance of our operating segments and the OMG, and we believe that this information enhances the ability of shareholders to analyze our performance. For more information, see Note 13. Segment Reporting, within our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

For our funds other than CLOs, our AUM represents the sum of the net asset value NAV of such funds, the drawn and undrawn debt (at the fund-level including amounts subject to restrictions) and uncalled committed capital (including commitments to funds that have yet to commence their investment periods). NAV refers to the fair value of the assets of a fund less the fair value of the liabilities of the fund. For the CLOs we manage, our AUM is equal to initial principal of collateral adjusted for paydowns. AUM also includes the proceeds raised in the initial public offerings of special purpose acquisition companies SPACs sponsored by us, less any redemptions; 
 
 AUM not yet paying fees (also referred to as shadow AUM refers to AUM that is not currently paying fees and is eligible to earn management fees upon deployment;

 catch-up fees refers to management fees charged retroactively on limited partner commitments to a fund following the initial close date of that fund. These fees are charged to ensure that all limited partners claims on the net assets of that fund are ratable with their commitment. Catch-up fees reflect the fees generated between the fund s initial close date and the last day of the quarter prior to the new limited partner s commitment;

For the CLOs we manage, our FPAUM is equal to the gross amount of aggregate collateral balance, at par, adjusted for defaulted or discounted collateral; 
 
 fee related earnings or FRE , a non-GAAP measure, is used to assess core operating performance by determining whether recurring revenue, primarily consisting of management fees and fee related performance revenues, is sufficient to cover operating expenses and to generate profits. FRE differs from income before taxes computed in accordance with GAAP as FRE excludes net performance income, investment income from our funds and adjusts for certain other items that we believe are not indicative of our core operating performance. Fee related performance revenues, together with fee related performance compensation, is presented within FRE because it represents incentive fees from perpetual capital vehicles that are measured and eligible to be received on a recurring basis and are not dependent on realization events from the underlying investments; 
 
 fee related performance revenues refers to incentive fees from perpetual capital vehicles that are: (i) measured and eligible to be received on a recurring basis; and (ii) not dependent on realization events from the underlying investments.

It generally represents the NAV plus uncalled equity or total assets plus uncalled debt, as applicable, of our funds for which we are entitled to receive carried interest and incentive fees, excluding capital committed by us and our professionals (from which we generally do not earn carried interest and incentive fees), as well as proceeds raised in the initial public offerings of SPACs sponsored by us, less any redemptions.

ARCC, ASIF and AESIF are only included in IGAUM when Part II Fees are being generated; 
 
 management fees refers to fees we earn for advisory services provided to our funds, which are generally based on a defined percentage of fair value of assets, total commitments, invested capital, net asset value, net investment income, total assets or par value of the investment portfolios managed by us.

Such fees are classified as management fees as they are predictable and recurring in nature, not subject to contingent repayment and generally cash-settled each quarter, unless subject to a payment deferral; 
 
 Part II Fees refers to fees from ARCC, ASIF and AESIF that are paid in arrears as of the end of each calendar year when the respective cumulative aggregate realized capital gains exceed the cumulative aggregate realized capital losses and aggregate unrealized capital depreciation, less the aggregate amount of respective Part II Fees paid in all prior years since inception; 
 
 performance income refers to income we earn based on the performance of a fund that is generally based on certain specific hurdle rates as defined in the fund s investment management or partnership agreements and may be either incentive fees earned from funds with stated investment periods or carried interest; 
 
 perpetual capital refers to the AUM of: (i) our publicly-traded vehicles, including ARCC, Ares Commercial Real Estate Corporation (NYSE: ACRE) ACRE and Ares Dynamic Credit Allocation Fund, Inc. (NYSE: ARDC) ARDC (ii) our non-traded vehicles, including ASIF, CADC and AESIF, our non-traded real estate investment trusts REITs and Ares Private Markets Fund APMF (iii) Aspida Holdings Ltd.

Perpetual Capital - Private Commingled Funds refers to commingled funds that meet the perpetual capital criteria, not including our publicly-traded vehicles or non-traded vehicles. Perpetual capital may be withdrawn by investors under certain conditions, including through an election to redeem an investor s fund investment or to terminate the investment management agreement, which in certain cases may be terminated on 30 days prior written notice. In addition, the investment management or advisory agreements of certain of our publicly-traded and non-traded vehicles have one year terms, which are subject to annual renewal by such vehicles; 
 
 realized income or RI , a non-GAAP measure, is an operating metric used by management to evaluate performance of the business based on operating performance and the contribution of each of the business segments to that performance, while removing the fluctuations of unrealized income and losses, which may or may not be eventually realized at the levels presented and whose realizations depend more on future outcomes than current business operations. RI differs from income before taxes by excluding: (i) operating results of our Consolidated Funds; (ii) depreciation and amortization expense; (iii) the effects of changes arising from corporate actions; and (iv) unrealized gains and losses related to carried interest, incentive fees and investment performance; and adjusting for certain other items that we believe are not indicative of our operating performance. Changes arising from corporate actions include equity-based compensation expenses, the amortization of intangible assets, transaction costs associated with mergers, acquisitions and capital activities, underwriting costs and expenses incurred in connection with corporate reorganization. Placement fee adjustment represents the net portion of either expense deferral or amortization of upfront fees to placement agents that is presented to match the timing of expense recognition with the period over which management fees are expected to be earned from the associated fund for segment purposes but have been expensed in advance in accordance with GAAP. For periods in which the amortization of upfront fees for segment purposes is higher than the GAAP expense, the placement fee adjustment is presented as a reduction to RI; 
 
 SEC refers to the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Table of Contents 

 Many of the terms used in this report, including AUM, FPAUM, FRE and RI, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. In addition, our definitions of AUM and FPAUM are not based on any definition of AUM or FPAUM that is set forth in the agreements governing the funds that we manage and may differ from definitions of AUM or FPAUM set forth in other agreements to which we are a party or definitions used by the SEC or other regulatory bodies. Further, FRE and RI are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP. We use FRE and RI as measures of operating performance, not as measures of liquidity. FRE and RI should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for operating income, net income, operating cash flows, or other income or cash flow statement data prepared in accordance with GAAP. The use of FRE and RI without consideration of related GAAP measures is not adequate due to the adjustments described above. Our management compensates for these limitations by using FRE and RI as supplemental measures to our GAAP results. We present these measures to provide a more complete understanding of our performance as our management measures it. 
 
 Amounts and percentages throughout this report may reflect rounding adjustments and consequently totals may not appear to sum.

 Carried Interest 
 
 Carried interest is affected by changes in the fair values of the underlying investments in the funds that are advised by the Company. Valuations, on an unrealized basis, can be significantly affected by a variety of external factors including, but not limited to, public equity market volatility, industry trading multiples and interest rates. Generally, if at the termination of a fund (and increasingly at interim points in the life of a fund), the fund has not achieved investment returns that (in most cases) exceed the preferred return threshold or (in all cases) the general partner receives net profits over the life of the fund in excess of its allocable share under the applicable partnership agreement, the Company will be obligated to repay carried interest that was received by the Company in excess of the amounts to which the Company is entitled. This contingent obligation is normally reduced by income taxes paid by the Company related to its carried interest. 
 
 Senior professionals of the Company who have received carried interest distributions are responsible for funding their proportionate share of any contingent repayment obligations. However, the governing agreements of certain of the Company s funds provide that if a current or former professional does not fund his or her respective share for such fund, then the Company may have to fund additional amounts beyond what was received in carried interest, although the Company will generally retain the right to pursue any remedies under such governing agreements against those carried interest recipients who fail to fund their obligations. 
 
 Additionally, at the end of the life of the funds there could be a payment due to a fund by the Company if the Company has recognized more carried interest than was ultimately earned. The general partner obligation amount, if any, will depend on final realized values of investments at the end of the life of the fund. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, if the Company assumed all existing investments were worthless, the amount of carried interest subject to potential repayment, net of tax distributions, which may differ from the recognition of revenue, would have been approximately million and million, respectively, of which approximately million and million, respectively, is reimbursable to the Company by certain professionals who are the recipients of such carried interest. Management believes the possibility of all of the investments becoming worthless is remote. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, if the funds were liquidated at their fair values, there would be contingent repayment obligation or liability. 
 
 Litigation 
 
 From time to time, the Company is named as a defendant in legal actions relating to transactions conducted in the ordinary course of business. Although there can be no assurance of the outcome of such legal actions, in the opinion of management, the Company does not have a potential liability related to any current legal proceeding or claim that would individually or in the aggregate materially affect its results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.

The Company s effective income tax rate is dependent on many factors, including the estimated nature and amounts of income and expenses allocated to the non-controlling interests without being subject to federal, state and local income taxes at the corporate level. Additionally, the Company s effective tax rate is influenced by the amount of income tax provision recorded for any affiliated funds and co-investment vehicles that are consolidated in the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.

Although the outcome of tax audits is always uncertain, the Company does not believe the outcome of any future audit will have a material adverse effect on the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.

 shares and as of September 30, 2024, shares remained available for issuance. 
 Generally, unvested restricted units are forfeited upon termination of employment in accordance with the Equity Incentive Plan. The Company recognizes forfeitures as a reversal of previously recognized compensation expense in the period the forfeiture occurs. 
 
 Restricted Units 
 
 Each restricted unit represents an unfunded, unsecured right of the holder to receive a share of the Company s Class A common stock on a specific date. The restricted units generally vest and are settled in shares of Class A common stock at a rate of either: (i) one-third per year, beginning on the third anniversary of the grant date; (ii) one-quarter per year, beginning on the second anniversary of the grant date or the holder s employment commencement date; or (iii) one-third per year, beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date, in each case generally subject to the holder s continued employment as of the applicable vesting date (subject to accelerated vesting upon certain qualifying terminations of employment or retirement eligibility provisions). Compensation expense associated with restricted units is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award. 
 
 Restricted units are delivered net of the holder s payroll related taxes upon vesting. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, million restricted units vested and million shares of Class A common stock were delivered to the holders. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, million restricted units vested and million shares of Class A common stock were delivered to the holders. 
 
 The holders of restricted units, other than awards that have not yet been issued as described in the subsequent sections, generally have the right to receive as current compensation an amount in cash equal to: (i) the amount of any dividend paid with respect to a share of Class A common stock multiplied by (ii) the number of restricted units held at the time such dividends are declared Dividend Equivalent ). When units are forfeited, the cumulative amount of Dividend Equivalents previously paid is reclassified to compensation and benefits expense within the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 
 June 14, 2024 September 16, 2024 
 
 During the first quarter of 2024, the Company approved the future grant of restricted units to certain senior executives in each of 2025 and 2026, subject to the holder s continued employment and acceleration in certain instances. These restricted awards vest before July 1, 2029, at a rate of either: (i) one-quarter per year, beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date; or (ii) one-third per year, beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date. Given that these future restricted units have been communicated to the recipient, the Company accounts for these awards as if they have been granted and recognizes the compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the service period. The restricted units that have been approved and communicated but not yet granted are not eligible to receive a Dividend Equivalent until the grant date.

The Class B common stock and Class C common stock are non-economic and holders are not entitled to dividends from the Company or to receive any assets of the Company in the event of any dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Company. 
 In January 2024, the Company's board of directors authorized the renewal of the stock repurchase program that allows for the repurchase of up to million of shares of Class A common stock. Under the program, shares may be repurchased from time to time in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, including in reliance on Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Act. The program is scheduled to expire in March 2025. Repurchases under the program, if any, will depend on the prevailing market conditions and other factors. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company did repurchase any shares as part of the stock repurchase program. 
 The Company entered into an underwriting agreement pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue and sell shares of Class A common stock in June 2024 and an additional shares of Class A common stock following the subsequent exercise of the underwriters -day option to purchase additional shares in July 2024 (the Offering ). The Offering resulted in net proceeds of approximately million (after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses).

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis o f Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 Ares Management Corporation is a Delaware corporation. Unless the context otherwise requires, references to Ares, we, us, our, and the Company are intended to mean the business and operations of Ares Management Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries. The following discussion analyzes the financial condition and results of operations of the Company. Consolidated Funds refers collectively to certain Ares funds, co-investment vehicles, CLOs and SPACs that are required under U.S. GAAP to be consolidated in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Additional terms used by the Company are defined in the Glossary and throughout the Management s Discussion and Analysis in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of Ares Management Corporation and the related notes included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the audited financial statements and the related notes included in the 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K of Ares Management Corporation. We have reclassified certain prior period amounts to conform to the current year presentation. 
 Amounts and percentages presented throughout our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations may reflect rounded results in thousands (unless otherwise indicated) and consequently, totals may not appear to sum. In addition, illustrative charts may not be presented at scale. 
 
 The changes from current year compared to prior year may be deemed to be not meaningful and are designated as NM within the discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations. 

Trends Affecting Our Business 
 We believe that our disciplined investment philosophy across our distinct but complementary investment groups contributes to the stability of our performance throughout market cycles. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, 95 of our management fees were derived from perpetual capital vehicles or long-dated funds. Our funds have a stable base of committed capital enabling us to invest in assets with a long-term focus over different points in a market cycle and to take advantage of market volatility. However, our results from operations, including the fair value of our AUM, are affected by a variety of factors. Conditions in the global financial markets and economic and political environments may impact our business, particularly in the U.S., Europe and Asia-Pacific APAC ). 
 The following table presents returns of selected market indices: 
 Returns ) Type of Index Name of Index Region Three months ended September 30, 2024 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 High yield bonds ICE BAML High Yield Master II Index U.S. 5.3 8.0 High yield bonds ICE BAML European Currency High Yield Index Europe 3.5 6.8 Leveraged loans Credit Suisse Leveraged Loan Index CSLLI U.S. 2.1 6.6 Leveraged loans Credit Suisse Western European Leveraged Loan Index Europe 2.0 6.2 Equities S P 500 Index U.S. 5.9 22.1 Equities MSCI All Country World Ex-U.S. Index Non-U.S. 8.1 14.2 Real estate equities FTSE NAREIT All Equity REITs Index U.S. 15.8 11.0 Real estate equities FTSE EPRA/NAREIT Developed Europe Index Europe 11.9 6.1 
 
 Global markets continued to perform positively in the third quarter fueled by the easing of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve and several other major central banks, better than expected economic growth and resilient consumer spending. Despite the headwinds and ongoing conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine, U.S. and European high yield bonds and leveraged loans returned positive performance with stable demand and improved capital markets access. The Asian-Pacific markets experienced favorable performance as the region overall continued to show growth, primarily driven by moderate inflation, low unemployment and lower interest rate expectations driving consumption in Southeast Asia, India and Australia. China announced policy stimulus measures affecting monetary policy, the property sector and equity markets, driving an overall positive investor sentiment. Globally, reduced lending activity by banks and limited capital accessibility continued to support private credit growth. 
 
 The private equity markets saw a modest recovery, with an increase in private equity deal value in the U.S. We believe that interest rate cuts, stabilizing inflation and improved labor dynamics have improved confidence among sponsors and encouraged transaction activity. Valuation gaps among buyers and sellers are beginning to narrow, creating a more attractive

 deployment environment. We believe that strong performance will continue to be driven by partnerships with value-add managers and investments in resilient industries where we have the ability to drive fundamental business growth and deliver a systematic approach to long-term value creation. 
 
 The U.S. and European commercial real estate markets continued to improve in the third quarter, with increased deal activity on a year over year basis that was largely supported by the improving macroeconomic environment. Property valuations and capitalization rates are continuing to show signs of stabilization. We continue to believe that we are well-positioned with strong fundamentals, such as occupancy and rental rates, in property types that include multifamily and industrial. 
 
 Market factors may have a more pronounced impact on certain industries, including energy, which is an industry in which few of our funds have made investments. As of September 30, 2024, less than 1 of our total AUM was invested in debt and equity investments in the energy sector, including midstream investments, oil and gas exploration, and renewable energy investments. 
 
 We believe our portfolios across all strategies are well positioned for a fluctuating interest rate environment. On a market value basis, approximately 85 of our debt assets and 57 of our total assets were floating rate instruments as of September 30, 2024.

 Managing Business Performance 
 Operating Metrics 
 We measure our business performance using certain operating metrics that are common to the alternative asset management industry and are discussed below. 
 Assets Under Management 
 AUM refers to the assets we manage and is viewed as a metric to measure our investment and fundraising performance as it reflects assets generally at fair value plus available uncalled capital.

Fee related performance revenues are not recognized by us until such fees are crystallized and no longer subject to reversal. As of September 30, 2024, perpetual capital IGAUM that could generate fee related performance revenues totaled 20.4 billion, composed of 18.5 billion within the Credit Group and 1.9 billion within the Secondaries Group. As of September 30, 2023, perpetual capital IGAUM from which we could generate fee related performance revenues totaled 14.3 billion, composed of 13.9 billion within the Credit Group and 0.4 billion within the Secondaries Group. As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, IGAUM included 42.8 billion and 35.7 billion, respectively, of AUM from funds generating incentive income that is not recognized by Ares until such fees are crystallized or no longer subject to reversal. 
 
 Fund Performance Metrics 
 Fund performance information for our funds considered to be significant funds is included throughout this discussion with analysis to facilitate an understanding of our results of operations for the periods presented. Our significant funds are commingled funds that either contributed at least 1 of our total management fees or comprised at least 1 of the Company s total FPAUM for the past two consecutive quarters. In addition to management fees, each of our significant funds may generate carried interest or incentive fees upon the achievement of performance hurdles. The fund performance information reflected in this discussion and analysis is not indicative of our overall performance. An investment in Ares is not an investment in any of our funds. Past performance is not indicative of future results. As with any investment, there is always the potential for gains as well as the possibility of losses. There can be no assurance that any of these funds or our other existing and future funds will achieve similar returns. 
 Fund performance metrics for significant funds may be marked as NM as they may not be considered meaningful due to the limited time since the initial investment and/or early stage of capital deployment. 
 
 To further facilitate an understanding of the impact a significant fund may have on our results, we present our drawdown funds as either harvesting investments or deploying capital to indicate the fund s stage in its life cycle. A fund harvesting investments is generally not seeking to deploy capital into new investment opportunities, while a fund deploying capital is generally seeking new investment opportunities.

 Consolidation and Deconsolidation of Ares Funds 
 Consolidated Funds represented approximately 4 of our AUM as of September 30, 2024 and less than 1 of total revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, we consolidated 28 CLOs, 10 private funds and one SPAC, and as of September 30, 2023, we consolidated 26 CLOs, nine private funds and two SPACs. 
 The activity of the Consolidated Funds is reflected within the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statement line items indicated by reference thereto. The impact of consolidation also typically will decrease management fees, carried interest allocation and incentive fees reported under GAAP to the extent these amounts are eliminated upon consolidation. 
 The assets and liabilities of our Consolidated Funds are held within separate legal entities and, as a result, the liabilities of our Consolidated Funds are typically non-recourse to us. Generally, the consolidation of our Consolidated Funds has a significant gross-up effect on our assets, liabilities and cash flows but has no net effect on the net income attributable to us or our stockholders equity, except where accounting for a redemption or liquidation preference requires the reallocation of ownership based on specific terms of a profit sharing agreement. The net economic ownership interests of our Consolidated Funds, to which we have no economic rights, are reflected as redeemable and non-controlling interests in the Consolidated Funds within our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. Redeemable interest in Consolidated Funds represent the shares issued by our SPACs that are redeemable for cash by the public shareholders in the event that the SPAC does not complete a business combination or tender offer associated with shareholder approval provisions. 
 We generally deconsolidate funds and CLOs when we are no longer deemed to have a controlling interest in the entity. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we did not deconsolidate any entities. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we deconsolidated one private fund as a result of significant change in ownership. 
 The performance of our Consolidated Funds is not necessarily consistent with, or representative of, the combined performance trends of all of our funds. 
 For the actual impact that consolidation had on our results and further discussion on consolidation and deconsolidation of funds, see Note 14. Consolidation within our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included herein.

 Segment Analysis 
 For segment reporting purposes, revenues and expenses are presented before giving effect to the results of our Consolidated Funds and the results attributable to non-controlling interests of joint ventures that we consolidate. As a result, segment revenues from management fees, fee related performance revenues, performance income and investment income are different than those presented on a consolidated basis in accordance with GAAP. Revenues recognized from Consolidated Funds are eliminated in consolidation and those attributable to the non-controlling interests of joint ventures have been excluded by us. Furthermore, expenses and the effects of other income (expense) are different than related amounts presented on a consolidated basis in accordance with GAAP due to the exclusion of the results of Consolidated Funds and the non-controlling interests of joint ventures. 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 We use the following non-GAAP measures to make operating decisions, assess performance and allocate resources: 
 Fee Related Earnings FRE 
 Realized Income RI 
 These non-GAAP financial measures supplement and should be considered in addition to and not in lieu of, the results of operations, which are discussed further under Components of Consolidated Results of Operations and are prepared in accordance with GAAP. We operate through our distinct operating segments. On January 1, 2024, we changed our segment composition. The special opportunities strategy, historically part of the Private Equity Group, is now referred to as opportunistic credit and is presented within the Credit Group. Historical results have been modified to conform with the current presentation.

 Management Fees. C apital deployment in direct lending, alternative credit and opportunistic credit funds within the Credit Group led to a rise in FPAUM, contributing to increases in management fees of 63.2 million and 177.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. Part I Fees increased by 26.7 million and 78.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. The increases in Part I Fees were primarily due to: (i) the increases in pre-incentive fee net investment income generated by ARCC, ASIF and CADC, driven by an increase in the average size of their portfolios and the impact of rising interest rates, given their primarily floating-rate loan portfolios; and (ii) the increases in pre-incentive fee net investment income from AESIF that began generating Part I Fees after the third quarter of 2023. Within the Private Equity Group, funds that we manage as a result of the Crescent Point Acquisition, which was completed on October 2, 2023, generated additional fees of 7.5 million and 22.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively.

 certain investments in funds within our infrastructure opportunities and U.S. direct lending strategies; and (iii) distributions of investment income from funds within our real estate debt and European direct lending strategies; partially offset by (iv) unrealized losses from certain investments in funds within our real estate secondaries, APAC credit, private equity secondaries and opportunistic credit strategies. 
 The activity for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily composed of: (i) appreciation of certain investments within funds in our corporate private equity, alternative credit and European direct lending strategies; and (ii) dividend income from a European real estate debt fund and LREF VIII; partially offset by (iii) unrealized losses of certain investments within funds in our real estate secondaries strategy. The nine months ended September 30, 2023 also included: (i) appreciation of certain investments within funds in our opportunistic credit and infrastructure debt strategies; and (ii) dividend income from an open-ended core alternative credit fund and SSF IV. 
 Administrative, Transaction and Other Fees. The increase for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily driven by: (i) higher administrative service fees of 4.6 million, primarily from private funds within our Credit Group that are based on invested capital and from our non-traded vehicles; and (ii) higher development fees of 1.7 million from property-related activities within certain U.S. real estate equity funds; partially offset by (iii) lower asset-based, net distribution fees associated with our non-traded REITs of 0.9 million. 
 The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was driven by: (i) higher administrative service fees of 13.9 million primarily from private funds within our Credit Group that are based on invested capital and from our non-traded vehicles; and (ii) higher administrative fees of 5.1 million from a commercial finance fund that were previously eliminated when this fund was consolidated into our results until the second quarter of 2023; partially offset by (iii) lower credit transaction fees of 9.1 million, primarily from the infrastructure debt strategy which are infrequent in nature and lower loan origination income earned from certain managed accounts within the U.S. direct lending strategy, driven by a lower capacity of investable capital; and (iv) lower asset-based, net distribution fees associated with our non-traded REITs of 3.4 million.

 Compensation and Benefits. The increases in compensation and benefits for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023 were primarily driven by increases in equity-based compensation expense of 23.6 million and 72.8 million, respectively. The number of unvested restricted units being amortized has increased as has the value of these units with our rising stock price. In addition, the immediate vesting of certain awards occurs annually in the first quarter as a retirement benefit for eligible recipients and accelerated expense of 17.4 million and 10.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 In addition, the increases in compensation and benefits for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023 were driven by: (i) increases in salary expense of 13.7 million and 40.9 million, respectively, primarily attributable to headcount growth to support the expansion of our business; and (ii) higher Part I Fee compensation of 11.9 million and 35.4 million, respectively. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was also attributable to (i) an increase in payroll related taxes of 11.2 million primarily due to the higher stock price associated with our restricted units that vested during the first quarter of 2024; and (ii) increased compensation and benefits of 11.0 million associated with our retail distribution channel, AWMS, resulting from higher sales employee variable compensation associated with APMF and ASIF. The increase in compensation and benefits for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was partially offset by lower incentive-based compensation, which is dependent on our operating performance and is expected to fluctuate during the year. 
 Compensation and benefits for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 also included costs associated with a performance-based, acquisition-related compensation arrangement established in connection with the Crescent Point

 Acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2023 of 4.8 million and 14.5 million, respectively. See Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies for a further description of the contingent liabilities related to the Crescent Point Acquisition arrangement. 
 Average headcount increased by 11 to 2,918 professionals for the year-to-date period in 2024 from 2,621 professionals for the same period in 2023. 
 
 For detail regarding the fluctuations of compensation and benefits within each of our segments see Results of Operations by Segment. 
 Performance Related Compensation. Changes in performance related compensation are directly associated with the changes in carried interest allocation and incentive fees described above and include associated payroll related taxes as well as carried interest and incentive fees allocated to charitable organizations as part of our philanthropic initiatives. Performance related compensation generally represents 60 to 80 of carried interest allocation and incentive fees recognized before giving effect to payroll taxes and will vary based on the mix of funds generating carried interest allocation and incentive fees for that period. 
 General, Administrative and Other Expenses. Before giving effect to certain amortization costs associated with the impairment of intangible assets, general, administrative and other expenses increased by 29 and 21 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023 . These increases were primarily due to costs incurred to support fundraising for our funds and distribution of shares in our non-traded vehicles, which we refer to as supplemental distribution fees. Supplemental distribution fees increased by 9.7 million and 31.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. These fees will fluctuate with sales volumes and net asset value of our non-traded vehicles. Placement fees also increased by 9.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to new commitments to Ares Senior Direct Lending Fund III, L.P. SDL III ). 
 In addition, occupancy costs, information services and information technology costs collectively increased by 10.5 million and 30.0 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023 to support our growing headcount and the expansion of our business, including costs for our new corporate headquarters that we occupied beginning in third quarter of 2024. 
 Acquisition-related costs increased by 22.8 million and 29.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. Acquisition-related costs generally precede a business combination, varying with the size, scale and complexity of the transaction. The majority of the costs incurred in the current year are related to the GCP Acquisition, which is expected to close in the first half of 2025. We also incurred costs in the current year for the various strategic acquisitions, including the WSM Acquisition which is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2024. We expect to continue to incur acquisition-related costs until acquisitions are completed. 
 Marketing expenses for the year-to-date comparative period have also increased by 7.2 million, driven by investor events, including our first firmwide annual general meeting with investors AGM ), that were held during the second quarter of 2024. In prior years, each of our business lines have hosted separate events for their investors throughout the year and as a result of holding a consolidated, firmwide AGM event in the second quarter, we have benefited from lower event costs in the current quarter. 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a non-cash impairment charge of 8.9 million to the fair value of management contracts of certain funds primarily within the Credit Group. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized non-cash impairment charges of 65.7 million and 78.6 million, respectively, primarily related to the value of client relationships from the acquisition of Landmark Partners, LLC (the Landmark Acquisition ).

 Net Realized and Unrealized Gains (Losses) on Investments. The activity for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 included: (i) unrealized gains from the appreciation of our investments in APMF, in the subordinated notes of U.S. CLOs, and in a European liquid credit asset manager, as well as in a company that manages portfolios of non-performing loans; and (ii) net unrealized losses from our strategic investment in a U.S. energy company. 
 
 The activity for the three months ended September 30, 2024 also included unrealized losses from a company that manages portfolios of real estate owned properties. In addition, the activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included unrealized gains from the appreciation of our investments in a European liquid credit vehicle that is invested in the subordinated notes of European CLOs, partially offset by unrealized losses from our strategic investment in a non-core insurance related company. 
 
 The activity for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily attributable to: (i) unrealized gains from the appreciation of our investments in APMF and in certain strategic investments in companies that manage real estate owned properties and portfolios of non-performing loans; partially offset by (ii) unrealized losses from our strategic investment in a U.S. financial technology company. 
 
 Interest and dividend income . The activity for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 included: (i) distributions of investment income from multiple strategic investments; and (ii) interest income generated from our CLO investments. 
 
 Interest Expense . Interest expense increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023 primarily due to the i ssuance of the 2028 Senior Notes in November 2023 that increased interest expense by 8.3 million and 24.7 million, respectively. The increase in interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was partially offset by lower interest expense of 4.6 million from our Credit Facility due to the lower average outstanding balance during the current quarter. While we have benefited from lower interest expense from our Credit Facility in the current quarter, interest expense for the year-to-date period when compared to the same period in 2023 increased by 3.3 million from higher average SOFR rates and a higher average outstanding balance during the first six months of 2024 when compared to the same period in 2023. We expect interest expense to trend higher in future periods as the issuance of our 2054 Senior Notes is expected to result in greater interest expense than the collective savings resulting from the repayment of our 2024 Senior Notes in October 2024 and lower anticipated balances from our Credit Facility. 
 
 Other Income (Expense), Net. The activity for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 primarily included transaction gains (losses) associated with currency fluctuations impacting the revaluation of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies other than an entity s functional currency. Transaction losses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were primarily attributable to the British Pound strengthening against the U.S. dollar and Euro. Transaction gains for the three months ended September 30, 2023 were primarily attributable to the Euro strengthening against the U.S. dollar and British pound. Despite the gains during the third quarter of 2023, we recognized transaction losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to the Euro weakening against the U.S. dollar and British pound for the year-to-date period.

 The increases in income tax expense were attributable to higher pre-tax income allocable to AMC for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023 as the income attributed to redeemable and non-controlling interests is generally passed through to partners and not subject to corporate income taxes. The calculation of income taxes is also sensitive to any changes in weighted average daily ownership. 
 The following table summarizes weighted average daily ownership: 
 Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 AMC common stockholders 
 64.14 61.03 63.23 60.52 Non-controlling AOG unitholders 35.86 38.97 36.77 39.48 
 The changes in ownership for the comparative periods were primarily driven by the issuances of shares of Class A common stock in connection with exchanges of AOG Units, the public offering that closed in June 2024 and the subsequent exercise of the underwriter s option to purchase additional shares in July 2024 (the Offering ), stock option exercises, vesting of restricted stock awards and the Crescent Point Acquisition.

 The results of operations of the Consolidated Funds primarily represent activities from certain funds that we are deemed to control. When a fund is consolidated, we reflect the revenues and expenses of the entity on a gross basis, subject to eliminations from consolidation. Substantially all of our results of operations related to the Consolidated Funds are attributable to ownership interests that third parties hold in those funds. The Consolidated Funds are not necessarily the same funds in each year presented due to changes in ownership, changes in limited partners or investor rights, and the creation or termination of funds and entities. Accordingly, such amounts may not be comparable for the periods presented, and in any event have no material impact on net income attributable to Ares Management Corporation.

SDL III, Ares Senior Direct Lending Fund II, L.P. SDL II ), our sixth European direct lending fund, ACE V, a n open-ended core alternative credit fund, ASOF II, Pathfinder II and Pathfinder I collectively generated additional management fees of 39.9 million and 115.4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023 . SDL III, our sixth European direct lending fund and Pathfinder II launched during the second quarter of 2023.

Management fees from ARCC, ASIF and CADC, excluding Part I Fees described below, collectively increased by 30.1 million and 72.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. The increases in management fees from ARCC, ASIF and CADC were primarily due to an increase in the average size of their portfolios. 
 
 Part I Fees increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to: (i) increases in pre-incentive fee net investment income generated by ARCC, ASIF and CADC, driven by an increase in the average size of their portfolios and by the impact of rising interest rates, given their primarily floating-rate loan portfolios; and (ii) AESIF that began generating Part I Fees after the third quarter of 2023. ASIF contributed additional Part I Fees of 11.7 million and 26.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023. AESIF contributed Part I Fees of 2.8 million and 5.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. 
 
 Conversely, m anagement fees from ASOF I and Ares Senior Direct Lending Fund, L.P. SDL I , collectively decreased by 6.8 million and 16.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023 resulting from distributions that reduced the fee bases as the funds are past their investment periods. M anagement fees from Ares Capital Europe III, L.P. ACE III also decreased by 4.2 million and 12.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily due to the reduction in fee rate . 
 
 The increases in effective management fee rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 were primarily driven by the increase in Part I Fees contribution to the effective management fee rate. 
 
 Fee Related Performance Revenues. The increases for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 were primarily attributable to incentive fees earned from an open-ended core alternative credit fund, which has a measurement period that crystallizes fees annually during the third quarter. 
 
 Other Fees. The increases in other fees for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 were primarily driven by higher administrative service fees of 1.9 million and 6.0 million, respectively, which were earned from certain private funds that pay on invested capital. 
 
 Compensation and Benefits. The increases in compensation and benefits for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 were primarily driven by: (i) higher fee related performance compensation of 31.3 million and 35.0 million, respectively, corresponding to the increases in fee related performance revenues; and (ii) increases in salary expense of 2.2 million and 8.4 million, respectively, primarily attributable to headcount growth to support the expansion of our business. The increases in compensation and benefits over the comparative periods were also driven by higher Part I Fee compensation of 11.9 million and 35.4 million, respectively, corresponding to the increases in Part I Fees that were partially reduced by a portion of supplemental distribution fees we paid to distribution partners. We reduce Part I Fee compensation by a portion of the supplemental distribution fees paid to the extent that Part I Fees are earned. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we reduced Part I Fee compensation by 3.3 million and 8.0 million, respectively, as reimbursement for supplemental distribution fees paid. 
 
 Conversely, the increase in compensation and benefits for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was partially offset by lower incentive-based compensation, which is dependent on our operating performance and is expected to fluctuate during the year. 
 
 Average headcount increased by 13 to 663 investment and investment support professionals for the year-to-date period in 2024 from 586 professionals for the same period in 2023 as we continued to add professionals, primarily to support our growing direct lending and alternative credit platforms. 
 
 General, Administrative and Other Expenses. The increases in general, administrative and other expenses were primarily due to costs incurred to support fundraising for our funds and distribution of shares in our non-traded vehicles. Supplemental distribution fees were 8.6 million and 21.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Such supplemental distribution fees increased by 4.9 million and 15.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023, a s we develop our distribution relationships and expand our retail product offerings. These supplemental distribution fees are expected to fluctuate with sales volumes and net asset values of our

 non-traded vehicles and will reduce Part I Fee compensation to the extent that Part I Fees are earned. The increase in general, administrative and other expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was also driven by: (i) placement fees of 1.9 million, primarily due to new commitments to SDL III; and (ii) travel and marketing costs of 3.1 million, driven by investor events held during the second quarter of 2024, including our firmwide AGM event. 
 
 Additionally, certain expenses increased during the current period, including occupancy costs, information services and information technology costs. These expenses collectively increased by 2.7 million and 6.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023 to support our growing headcount and the expansion of our business, including costs for our new corporate headquarters that we occupied beginning in third quarter of 2024. Separately, total professional service fees rose by 4.9 million and 6.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily related to certain non-recurring legal fees .

 Realized net performance income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 primarily included (i) incentive fees earned from a U.S. CLO that was driven by the reset of its capital structure and extension of its reinvestment period; and (ii) incentive fees earned from a U.S. direct lending fund. Realized net performance income for the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily included incentive fees earned from an alternative credit fund. In addition, realized net performance income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 included: (i) tax distributions from ACE IV, ACE V, PCS I and ASOF I; and (ii) incentive fees earned from two alternative credit funds that have annual measurement periods in the second quarter. Realized net performance income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 also included tax distributions from an alternative credit fund, while realized net performance income for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 included tax distributions from ACE III. 
 
 Realized net investment income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 included interest income generated from our CLO investments, where we earned a similar level of income from: (i) 12 and 13 CLO investments for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively; and (ii) 15 and 16 CLO investments for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The activity for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 also included dividend income from our investments in an APAC credit fund and a European liquid credit vehicle that is invested in the subordinated notes of European CLOs. The activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 also included income recognized in connection with distributions from our investment in a U.S. direct lending fund, while the nine months ended September 30, 2023 included distributions from our investment in a commercial finance fund that was sold during the second quarter of 2023. 
 
 Interest expense, which is allocated among our segments based on the cost basis of our balance sheet investments, increased over the comparative periods primarily due to the issuance of the 2028 Senior Notes in November 2023.

 (1) For funds other than our opportunistic credit funds, realized value represent the sum of all cash distributions to all partners and if applicable, exclude tax and incentive distributions made to the general partner. For our opportunistic credit funds, realized value represent the sum of all cash distributions to the fee-paying limited partners and if applicable, exclude tax and incentive distributions made to the general partner. 
 (2) Unrealized value represents the fund's NAV reduced by the accrued incentive allocation, if applicable. There can be no assurance that unrealized values will be realized at the valuations indicated. For funds other than our opportunistic credit funds, the unrealized value is based on all partners. For our opportunistic credit funds, the unrealized value is based on the fee-paying limited partners. 
 (3) The gross multiple of invested capital MoIC is calculated at the fund-level and is based on the interests of the fee-paying limited partners and if applicable, excludes interests attributable to the non-fee paying limited partners and/or the general partner which does not pay management fees or carried interest. The gross MoIC is before giving effect to management fees, carried interest and other expenses, as applicable, but after giving effect to credit facility interest expenses, as applicable. The funds may utilize a credit facility during the investment period and for general cash management purposes. Early in the life of a fund, the gross fund-level MoICs would generally have been lower had such fund called capital from its limited partners instead of utilizing the credit facility. 
 (4) The net MoIC is calculated at the fund-level and is based on the interests of the fee-paying limited partners and if applicable, excludes those interests attributable to the non-fee paying limited partners and/or the general partner which does not pay management fees or carried interest. The net MoIC is after giving effect to management fees and carried interest, other expenses and credit facility interest expenses, as applicable. The funds may utilize a credit facility during the investment period and for general cash management purposes. Early in the life of a fund, the net fund-level MoICs would generally have been lower had such fund called capital from its limited partners instead of utilizing the credit facility. 
 (5) The gross IRR is an annualized since inception gross internal rate of return of cash flows to and from the fund and the fund s residual value at the end of the measurement period. Gross IRR reflects returns to the fee-paying limited partners and, if applicable, excludes interests attributable to the non-fee paying limited partners and/or the general partner which does not pay management fees or carried interest. The cash flow dates used in the gross IRR calculation are based on the actual dates of the cash flows. The gross IRRs are calculated before giving effect to management fees, carried interest and other expenses, as applicable, but after giving effect to credit facility interest expenses, as applicable. The funds may utilize a credit facility during the investment period and for general cash management purposes. Gross fund-level IRRs would generally have been lower had such fund called capital from its limited partners instead of utilizing the credit facility. 
 (6) The net IRR is an annualized since inception net internal rate of return of cash flows to and from the fund and the fund s residual value at the end of the measurement period. Net IRRs reflect returns to the fee-paying limited partners and, if applicable, exclude interests attributable to the non-fee paying limited partners and/or the general partner which does not pay management fees or carried interest. The cash flow dates used in the net IRR calculations are based on the actual dates of the cash flows. The net IRRs are calculated after giving effect to management fees and carried interest, other expenses and credit facility interest expenses, as applicable. The funds may utilize a credit facility during the investment period and for general cash management purposes. Net fund-level IRRs would generally have been lower had such fund called capital from its limited partners instead of utilizing the credit facility.

 Management Fees. The chart below presents Real Assets Group management fees and effective management fee rates in millions): 

Excluding the impact of catch-up fees, management fees increased by 5.4 million and 18.4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023 primarily due to new capital commitments for Ares U.S. Real Estate Opportunity Fund IV, L.P. AREOF IV and our second climate infrastructure fund. Management fees from IDF V also increased over the comparative periods by 2.0 million and 7.4 million, respectively, driven by the deployment of capital. 
 Additionally, our fourth European value-add real estate equity fund, which launched during the second quarter of 2024, contributed management fees of 2.3 million and 2.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively.

Table of Contents 

 The increases in fees for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023 were partially offset by decrease of 2.0 million and 6.7 million, respectively, from our industrial non-traded REIT, driven by a decrease in NAV due to lower valuations of certain properties. Management fees for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 also decreased by: (i) 6.7 million from Infrastructure Debt Fund IV, L.P. IDF IV and Infrastructure Debt Fund III, L.P. IDF III resulting from distributions that reduced the fee bases as the funds are past their investment periods; (ii) 3.3 million due to make-whole termination fees that were recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 from the early termination of the advisory agreements of two U.S. industrial real estate equity funds; (iii) 3.6 million from AREOF III due to a contractual reduction in the fee base that was triggered at the expiration of the fund s investment period at the end of the fourth quarter of 2023; and (iv) 2.0 million from our open-ended real estate industrial fund driven by a decrease in NAV due to lower valuations of certain properties. 
 The increases in effective management fee rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 were primarily driven by the deployment of capital within our real estate equity funds. Certain of our private real estate equity funds pay a fee on committed capital that increases once that capital is invested. As a result, our effective management fee rate increases as capital is deployed. 
 Other Fees. The increase in other fees for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily driven by: (i) higher development and property management fees of 2.1 million from property-related activities within certain U.S. real estate equity funds; and (ii) higher administrative service fees of 0.5 million, primarily from certain infrastructure debt funds that started paying such fees to us subsequent to the third quarter of 2023; partially offset by (iii) lower credit transaction fees of 2.0 million from the infrastructure debt strategy which are infrequent in nature. 
 The decrease in other fees for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was driven by: (i) lower credit transaction fees 7.4 million from the infrastructure debt strategy; partially offset by (ii) higher administrative service fees 0.7 million, primarily from certain infrastructure debt funds that started paying such fees to us subsequent to the third quarter of 2023. 
 Compensation and Benefits. The increase in compensation and benefits for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily driven by (i) an increase in salary expenses of 1.8 million, primarily attributable to headcount growth to support the expansion of our business; and (ii) higher incentive-based compensation, which is dependent on our operating performance and is expected to fluctuate during the year. 
 The increase in compensation and benefits for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily driven by (i) an increase in salary expenses of 5.3 million, primarily attributable to headcount growth to support the expansion of our business; and (ii) an increase in payroll related taxes of 2.5 million, primarily due to the higher stock price associated with our restricted units that vested during the first quarter of 2024. Conversely, the increase in compensation and benefits for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was partially offset by (i) lower incentive-based compensation; and (ii) higher administrative fees reimbursement for expenses for the current year period. 
 Average headcount increased by 9 to 386 investment and investment support professionals for the year-to-date period in 2024 from 353 professionals for the same period in 2023. 
 General, Administrative and Other Expenses. The increases in general, administrative and other expenses for the comparative periods were primarily due to marketing and fundraising activities, including supplemental distribution fees charged in connection with an amended servicing arrangement with a distribution partner. Supplemental distribution fees increased by 0.6 million and 2.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023 . Marketing expenses for the comparative periods increased by 0.7 million and 2.8 million, respectively, driven by: (i) investor events held during the second quarter of 2024, including our firmwide AGM event; and (ii) fund formation costs for AREOF IV. 
 In addition, certain expenses increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023, including: (i) higher information technology costs related to software license fees of 1.0 million and 2.5 million, respectively; and (ii) higher professional service fees of 0.8 million and 2.0 million, respectively, which included non-recurring legal expenses of 1.5 million incurred during the first quarter of 2024.

 Realized net performance income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 included distributions from U.S. Real Estate Fund VIII, L.P. US VIII ), which is a European-style waterfall fund that is past its investment period and monetizing its assets. Realized net performance income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 also included realized gains from the partial sale of ACIP s investment in a renewable energy company. Realized net performance income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 included distributions from a U.S. real estate equity fund that is past its investment period and monetizing its assets. Realized net performance income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were also attributable to incentive fees generated from an open-ended industrial real estate fund that varies based upon a three-year measurement period calculated for each fund investor. 
 
 Realized net investment loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was primarily attributable to interest expense exceeding investment income during these periods. Interest expense, which is allocated among our segments based on the cost basis of our balance sheet investments, increased over the comparative periods primarily due to the issuance of the 2028 Senior Notes in November 2023. 
 
 In addition, the realized investment activities for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 included realized gains from the sale of an infrastructure opportunities fund s investment in a wind energy company and distributions of investment income from an infrastructure debt fund. The nine months ended September 30, 2024 also included distributions of investment income from funds within our real estate debt strategy, partially offset by a realized loss associated with a guarantee of a credit facility provided in connection with a historical acquisition. 
 
 The realized investment activities for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 included distributions of investment income from multiple real estate debt and U.S. real estate equity vehicles. Investment income was partially offset by realized losses from a real estate debt vehicle, where interest expense was incurred with no associated investment income during the periods. These realized losses are not expected to recur as we restructured the arrangement in the fourth quarter of 2023.

 (2) Performance is measured by total return, which includes income and appreciation and reinvestment of all distributions for the respective time period. Returns are shown for institutional share class. Shares of other classes may have lower returns due to higher selling commissions and fees. Actual individual stockholder returns will vary. Net returns are calculated using the fund s NAV and assume distributions are reinvested at the NAV on the date of distribution. The inception date used in the calculation of the since inception return is the date in which the first shares of common stock were sold after converting to a NAV-based REIT. 
 (3) Performance is measured by total return, which includes income and appreciation and reinvestment of all distributions for the respective time period. Returns are shown for institutional share class. Shares of other classes may have lower returns due to higher selling commissions and fees. Actual individual stockholder returns will vary. Net returns are calculated using the fund s NAV and assume distributions are reinvested at the NAV on the date of distribution. 
 (4) Returns are time-weighted rates of return and include the reinvestment of income and other earnings from securities or other investments and reflect the deduction of all trading expenses. Gross returns do not reflect the deduction of management fees, incentive fees, as applicable, or other expenses. Net returns are calculated by subtracting the applicable management fees, incentive fees, as applicable and other expenses from the gross returns on a quarterly basis.

 (1) Realized proceeds include distributions of operating income, sales and financing proceeds received to the limited partners. 
 (2) Unrealized value represents the fund's NAV reduced by the accrued incentive allocation, if applicable. There can be no assurance that unrealized values will be realized at the valuations indicated. 
 (3) The gross MoIC is calculated at the fund-level and is based on the interests of the fee-paying limited partners and if applicable, excludes interests attributable to the non-fee paying limited partners and/or the general partner which does not pay management fees or carried interest. The gross MoIC is before giving effect to management fees, carried interest, as applicable, and other expenses, but after giving effect to credit facility interest expenses, as applicable. The funds may utilize a credit facility during the investment period and for general cash management purposes. Early in the life of a fund, the gross fund-level MoICs would generally have been lower had such fund called capital from its limited partners instead of utilizing the credit facility. 
 (4) The net MoIC is calculated at the fund-level and is based on the interests of the fee-paying limited partners and, if applicable, excludes interests attributable to the non fee-paying limited partners and/or the general partner which does not pay management fees or carried interest. The net MoIC is after giving effect to management fees, carried interest, as applicable, credit facility interest expense, as applicable, and other expenses. The funds may utilize a credit facility during the investment period and for general cash management purposes. Early in the life of a fund, the net fund-level MoICs would generally have been lower had such fund called capital from its limited partners instead of utilizing the credit facility. 
 (5) The gross IRR is an annualized since inception gross internal rate of return of cash flows to and from the fund and the fund s residual value at the end of the measurement period. Gross IRR reflects returns to the fee-paying limited partners and, if applicable, excludes interests attributable to the non-fee paying limited partners and/or the general partner which does not pay management fees or carried interest. The cash flow dates used in the gross IRR calculation are based on the actual dates of the cash flows. The gross IRRs are calculated before giving effect to management fees, carried interest and other expenses, but after giving effect to credit facility interest expenses, as applicable. The funds may utilize a credit facility during the investment period and for general cash management purposes. Gross fund-level IRRs would generally have been lower had such fund called capital from its limited partners instead of utilizing the credit facility. 
 (6) The net IRR is an annualized since inception net internal rate of return of cash flows to and from the fund and the fund s residual value at the end of the measurement period. Net IRRs reflect returns to the fee-paying limited partners and, if applicable, exclude interests attributable to the non-fee paying limited partners and/or the general partner which does not pay management fees or carried interest. The cash flow dates used in the net IRR calculations are based on the actual dates of the cash flows. The net IRRs are calculated after giving effect to management fees and carried interest, other expenses and credit facility interest expenses, as applicable. The funds may utilize a credit facility during the investment period and for general cash management purposes. Net fund-level IRRs would generally have been lower had such fund called capital from its limited partners instead of utilizing the credit facility.

 Management Fees. The chart below presents Private Equity Group management fees and effective management fee rates in millions): 

Management fees increased primarily due to fees from funds that we manage as a result of the Crescent Point Acquisition that generated additional fees of 7.5 million and 22.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023 . The increases in management fees over the comparative periods were partially offset by decreases of 2.9 million and 8.5 million, respectively, from an energy opportunities fund, driven by the change in fee base from capital commitments to invested capital and reduction in fee rate from 1.50 to 0.75 . Both the change in fee base and the reduction in fee rate were contractually triggered at the expiration of the fund s investment period. 
 
 The increases in effective management fee rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 were primarily driven by certain funds from the Crescent Point

 Acquisition that have a higher effective management fee rate than the average effective management fee rate of the funds within our corporate private equity strategy. 
 
 Compensation and Benefits. Although salary and benefits costs have increased over the comparative periods to reflect changes from the increase in headcount from the Crescent Point Acquisition, compensation and benefits remained relatively flat for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 and decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The decrease for the year-to-date period was primarily driven by lower incentive-based compensation that is dependent on our operating performance and is expected to fluctuate each period. 
 
 Average headcount increased by 17 to 103 investment and investment support professionals for the year-to-date period in 2024 from 88 professionals for the same period in 2023, primarily due to the Crescent Point Acquisition. 
 
 General, Administrative and Other Expenses. The increases in general, administrative and other expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023 largely reflect Crescent Point s operating expenses following the Crescent Point Acquisition.

 Realized net performance income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was attributable to realized gains from ACOF IV s investment in various energy companies. Realized net performance income and realized investment income for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 included realized gains from the partial sale of ACOF IV s investment in the AZEK Company AZEK ). 
 
 Realized net investment loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 largely represents interest expense exceeding investment income during these periods. Interest expense, which is allocated among our segments based on the cost basis of our balance sheet investments, increased over the comparative periods primarily due to the issuance of the 2028 Senior Notes in November 2023. 
 Realized net investment loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 also reflects realized losses in connection with the liquidation and disposition of remaining assets of certain legacy funds.

 (1) Realized value represents the sum of all cash dividends, interest income, other fees and cash proceeds from realizations of interests in portfolio investments. Realized value excludes any proceeds related to bridge financings. 
 (2) Unrealized value represents the fair market value of remaining investments. Unrealized value does not take into account any bridge financings. There can be no assurance that unrealized investments will be realized at the valuations indicated. 
 (3) The gross MoIC is calculated at the fund-level and is based on the interests of the fee-paying limited partners and if applicable, excludes interests attributable to the non-fee paying limited partners and/or the general partner which does not pay management fees or carried interest. The gross MoIC is before giving effect to management fees, carried interest, as applicable, and other expenses, but after giving effect to credit facility interest expenses, as applicable. The gross MoICs are also calculated before giving effect to any bridge financings. The funds may utilize a credit facility during the investment period and for general cash management purposes. Early in the life of a fund, the gross fund-level MoICs would generally have been lower had such fund called capital from its limited partners instead of utilizing the credit facility. 
 (4) The net MoIC is calculated at the fund-level. The net MoIC is based on the interests of the fee-paying limited partners and if applicable, excludes interests attributable to the non-fee paying limited partners and/or the general partner which does not pay management fees or performance fees. The net MoIC is after giving effect to management fees, carried interest, as applicable, and other expenses. The net MoICs are also calculated before giving effect to any bridge financings. Inclusive of bridge financings, the net MoIC would be 1.3x for ACOF V and 1.3x for ACOF VI. The funds may utilize a credit facility during the investment period and for general cash management purposes. Early in the life of a fund, the net fund-level MoICs would generally have been lower had such fund called capital from its limited partners instead of utilizing the credit facility. 
 (5) The gross IRR is an annualized since inception gross internal rate of return of cash flows to and from the fund and the fund s residual value at the end of the measurement period. Gross IRRs reflect returns to the fee-paying limited partners and, if applicable, excludes interests attributable to the non-fee paying limited partners and/or the general partner which does not pay management fees or carried interest. The cash flow dates used in the gross IRR calculation are based on the actual dates of the cash flows. The gross IRRs are calculated before giving effect to management fees, carried interest, as applicable, and other expenses, but after giving effect to credit facility interest expenses, as applicable. The gross IRRs are also calculated before giving effect to any bridge financings. The funds may utilize a credit facility during the investment period and for general cash management purposes. Gross fund-level IRRs would generally have been lower had such fund called capital from its limited partners instead of utilizing the credit facility. 
 (6) The net IRR is an annualized since inception net internal rate of return of cash flows to and from the fund and the fund s residual value at the end of the measurement period. Net IRRs reflect returns to the fee-paying limited partners and if applicable, exclude interests attributable to the non-fee paying limited partners and/or the general partner which does not pay management fees or carried interest. The cash flow dates used in the net IRR calculation are based on the actual dates of the cash flows. The net IRRs are calculated after giving effect to management fees, carried interest as applicable, and other expenses and exclude commitments by the general partner and Schedule I investors who do not pay either management fees or carried interest. The funds may utilize a credit facility during the investment period and for general cash management purposes. Net fund-level IRRs would generally have been lower had such fund called capital from its limited partners instead of utilizing the credit facility. The net IRRs are also calculated before giving effect to any bridge financings. Inclusive of bridge financings, the net IRRs would be 6.9 for ACOF V and 16.9 for ACOF VI.

 Management Fees. The chart below presents Secondaries Group management fees and effective management fee rates in millions): 

Management fees increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to higher management fees from APMF of 4.9 million and 11.8 million, respectively, due to additional capital raised and an increase in fee rate. Beginning April 1, 2023, a fee waiver expired, resulting in a step up in the fee rate from 0.25 to 1.40 per annum. 
 
 Excluding the impact of catch-up fees, management fees for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023 increased by: (i) 1.1 million and 3.3 million, respectively, from our third infrastructure

Table of Contents 

 secondaries fund, which launched during the fourth quarter of 2023; and (ii) 1.1 million and 3.2 million, respectively, from Landmark Real Estate Fund IX, L.P. LREF IX ). The increases in management fees for these funds were driven by additional capital commitments. 
 
 The increases in effective management fee rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 were primarily due to additional capital raised by APMF, as well as the higher fee rate for APMF following the expiration of the fee waiver. 
 
 Fee Related Performance Revenues . The three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 reflect incentive fees recognized from APMF. The activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 includes gains recognized in connection with acquiring a sizable portfolio of limited partnership interests during the second quarter of 2024. 
 
 Compensation and Benefits. Compensation and benefits decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 as a result of: (i) lower incentive-based compensation that is dependent on our operating performance and is expected to fluctuate each period; and (ii) lower fee related performance compensation of 1.1 million. Fee related performance compensation is recognized as the corresponding fee related performance revenues are earned from APMF. However, we reduce this compensation by a portion of the supplemental distribution fees paid to distribution partners. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we reduced fee related performance compensation by 1.1 million as reimbursement for supplemental distribution fees paid. 
 
 The increase in compensation and benefits for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was driven by higher fee related performance compensation of 2.9 million, corresponding to the increase in fee related performance revenues that was partially reduced by a portion of supplemental distribution fees we paid to distribution partners. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we reduced fee related performance compensation by 6.0 million as reimbursement for supplemental distribution fees paid. In addition, the increase in compensation and benefits for the year-to-date period was further driven by: (i) an increase in salary expenses primarily attributable to headcount growth to support the expansion of our business; partially offset by (ii) lower incentive-based compensation. 
 
 Average headcount increased by 9 to 112 investment and investment support professionals for the year-to-date period in 2024 from 103 professionals for the same period in 2023. 
 
 General, Administrative and Other Expenses. In an effort to accelerate the growth of APMF s assets, we entered into agreements beginning in the second quarter of 2023 that pay distribution partners a supplemental distribution fee based on assets and/or sales. These agreements contributed to increases in expenses of 3.2 million and 11.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023 . Such supplemental distribution fees are expected to fluctuate with sales and the growth in assets, and will reduce fee related performance compensation to the extent that fee related performance revenues are earned from APMF.

 Realized net investment loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 largely represents interest expense exceeding investment income during these periods. Interest expense, which is allocated among our segments based on the cost basis of our balance sheet investments, increased over the comparative periods primarily due to the issuance of the 2028 Senior Notes in November 2023. Realized investment income for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 included dividend income received from APMF.

 For the funds in the Secondaries Group, returns are calculated from results of the underlying portfolio that are generally reported on a three month lag and may not include the impact of economic and market activities occurring in the current reporting period. 
 
 (1) Realized value represents the sum of all cash distributions to all limited partners and if applicable, exclude tax and incentive distributions made to the general partner. 
 (2) Unrealized value represents the limited partners share of fund s NAV reduced by the accrued incentive allocation, if applicable. There can be no assurance that unrealized values will be realized at the valuations indicated. 
 (3) The gross MoIC is calculated at the fund-level and is based on the interests of all partners. If applicable, limiting the gross MoIC to exclude interests attributable to the non-fee paying limited partners and/or the general partner who does not pay management fees or carried interest would have no material impact on the result. The gross MoIC is before giving effect to management fees, carried interest, as applicable, and other expenses, but after giving effect to credit facility interest expenses, as applicable. The funds may utilize a short-term credit facility for general cash management purposes, as well as a long-term credit facility as permitted by the respective fund s governing documentation. The gross fund-level MoIC would have generally been lower had such fund called capital from its partners instead of utilizing the credit facility. 
 (4) The net MoIC is calculated at the fund-level and is based on the interests of the fee-paying limited partners and if applicable, excludes those interests attributable to the non-fee paying limited partners and/or the general partner which does not pay management fees or carried interest. The net MoIC is after giving effect to management fees and other expenses, carried interest and credit facility interest expense, as applicable. The funds may utilize a short-term credit facility for general cash management purposes, as well as a long-term credit facility as permitted by the respective fund s governing documentation. The net fund-level MoICs would generally have been lower had such fund called capital from its limited partners instead of utilizing the credit facility. 
 (5) The gross IRR is an annualized since inception gross internal rate of return of cash flows to and from the fund and the fund s residual value at the end of the measurement period. Gross IRR reflects returns to all partners. If applicable, limiting the gross IRR to exclude interests attributable to the non-fee paying limited partners and/or the general partner who does not pay management fees or carried interest would have no material impact on the result. The cash flow dates used in the gross IRR calculation are based on the actual dates of the cash flows. The gross IRRs are calculated before giving effect to management fees, carried interest, as applicable, and other expenses, but after giving effect to credit facility interest expenses, as applicable. The funds may utilize a short-term credit facility for general cash management purposes, as well as a long-term credit facility as permitted by the respective fund s governing documents. The gross fund-level IRR would generally have been lower had such fund called capital from its partners instead of utilizing the credit facility. 
 (6) The net IRR is an annualized since inception net internal rate of return of cash flows to and from the fund and the fund s residual value at the end of the measurement period. Net IRRs reflect returns to the fee-paying limited partners and, if applicable, exclude interests attributable to the non-fee paying limited partners and/or the general partner who does not pay management fees or carried interest. The cash flow dates used in the net IRR calculations are based on the actual dates of the cash flows. The net IRRs are calculated after giving effect to management fees and other expenses, carried interest and credit facility interest expenses, as applicable. The funds may utilize a short-term credit facility for general cash management purposes, as well as a long-term credit facility as permitted by the respective fund s governing documents. Net fund-level IRRs would generally have been lower had such fund called capital from its limited partners instead of utilizing the credit facility. 
 (7) The results of each fund is presented on a combined basis with the affiliated parallel funds or accounts, given that the investments are substantially the same.

 Other Fees. The decrease in other fees for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily driven by lower asset-based, net distribution fees of 3.3 million associated with our non-traded REITs. The nine months ended September 30, 2023 also included broker-dealer advisory fees of 2.0 million which were earned by Ares Management Capital Markets LLC, a registered broker-dealer, for a capital markets transaction executed during the second quarter of 2023. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in facilitation fees from the 1031 exchange program associated with our non-traded REITs of 0.9 million during the annual comparative period. 
 Compensation and Benefits. The increases in compensation and benefits for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 were primarily driven by: (i) the expansion of our business operations teams to support the growth of our business and other strategic initiatives; (ii) the expansion of our strategy and relationship management teams to support global fundraising; and (iii) increased compensation and benefits associated with our retail distribution channel, AWMS, resulting from higher sales employee variable compensation associated with APMF and ASIF; partially offset by (iv) higher expense reimbursement to support the formation of new retail products during the current year periods. 
 Average headcount increased by 11 to 1,622 professionals for the year-to-date period in 2024 from 1,466 professionals for the same period in 2023. 
 General, Administrative and Other Expenses. Certain expenses increased during the current year, including occupancy costs and information technology costs. These expenses collectively increased by 5.5 million and 15.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023 to support our growing headcount and the expansion of our business, including costs for our new corporate headquarters that we occupied beginning in third quarter of 2024. In addition, travel and marketing costs increased by 2.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, driven by investor events held during the second quarter of 2024, including our firmwide AGM event. 
 The aforementioned increases were partially offset by: (i) lower professional service fees of 2.9 million and 7.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively, compared to the same periods in 2023, as we have recognized efficiencies from the transition of our income tax compliance function; and (ii) costs related to Ares 25th anniversary celebrations that were incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 .

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Management assesses liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund operating, investing and financing activities. Management believes that the Company is well-positioned and its liquidity will continue to be sufficient for its foreseeable working capital needs, contractual obligations, dividend payments, pending acquisitions and strategic initiatives. 
 
 Sources and Uses of Liquidity 
 Our sources of liquidity are: (i) cash on hand; (ii) net working capital; (iii) cash from operations, including management fees and fee related performance revenues, which are collected monthly, quarterly or semi-annually, and net realized performance income, which may be unpredictable as to amount and timing; (iv) fund distributions related to our investments that are unpredictable as to amount and timing; and (v) net borrowings from the Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents were 350.1 million and we have 930.0 million available under our Credit Facility. Our ability to draw from the Credit Facility is subject to leverage and other covenants. We remain in compliance with all covenants as of September 30, 2024. We believe that these sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund our working capital requirements and to meet our commitments in the ordinary course of business and under the current market conditions for the foreseeable future. Cash flows from management fees may be impacted by a slowdown in deployment, declines in valuations or negatively impacted fundraising. In addition, management fees may be subject to deferral and fee related performance revenues may be subject to hold backs. Declines or delays in transaction activity may impact our fund distributions and net realized performance income, which could adversely impact our cash flows and liquidity. Market conditions may make it difficult to extend the maturity or refinance our existing indebtedness or obtain new indebtedness with similar terms. 
 We expect that our primary liquidity needs will continue to be to: (i) provide capital to facilitate the growth of our existing investment management businesses; (ii) fund our investment commitments; (iii) provide capital to facilitate our expansion into businesses that are complementary to our existing investment management businesses as well as other strategic growth initiatives; (iv) pay operating expenses, including cash compensation to our employees and tax payments for net settlement of equity awards; (v) fund capital expenditures; (vi) service our debt; (vii) pay income taxes and make payments under the tax receivable agreement TRA (viii) make dividend payments to our Class A and non-voting common stockholders in accordance with our dividend policy; and (ix) pay distributions to AOG unitholders. 
 In the normal course of business, we expect to pay dividends to our Class A and non-voting common stockholders that are aligned with our expected FRE after an allocation of current taxes paid. For the purposes of determining this amount, we allocate the current taxes paid to FRE and to realized performance and investment income in a manner that may be disproportionate to earnings generated by these metrics, and the actual taxes paid on these metrics should they be considered separately. Additionally, our methodology uses the tax benefits from certain expenses that are not included in these non-GAAP metrics, such as equity-based compensation from the vesting of restricted units and from the amortization of intangible assets, among others. We allocate the taxes by multiplying the statutory tax rate currently in effect by our net realized performance and net investment income and removing this amount from total current taxes. The remaining current tax paid is the amount that we allocate to FRE. We use this method to allocate the current provision for income taxes to approximate the amount of cash that is available to pay dividends to our stockholders. If cash flows from operations were insufficient to fund dividends over a sustained period of time, we expect that we would suspend or reduce paying such dividends. In addition, there is no assurance that dividends would continue at the current levels or at all. 
 Our ability to obtain debt financing and complete stock offerings provides us with additional sources of liquidity. For further discussion of financing transactions occurring in the current period, see Cash Flows within this section and Note 6. Debt and Note 12. Equity and Redeemable Interest within our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect the cash flows of our operating businesses as well as those of our Consolidated Funds. The assets of our Consolidated Funds, on a gross basis, are significantly larger than the assets of our operating businesses and therefore have a substantial effect on the amounts reported within our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. The primary cash flow activities of our Consolidated Funds include: (i) raising capital from third-party investors, which is reflected as non-controlling interests of our Consolidated Funds; (ii) financing certain investments by issuing debt; (iii) purchasing and selling investment securities; (iv) generating cash through the realization of certain investments; (v) collecting interest and dividend income; and (vi) distributing cash to investors. Our Consolidated Funds are generally accounted for as investment companies under GAAP; therefore, the character and classification of all Consolidated Fund transactions are presented as cash flows from operations. Liquidity available at our Consolidated Funds is not available for corporate liquidity needs, and debt of the Consolidated Funds is non recourse to the Company except to the extent of the Company s investment in the fund.

 Cash Flows 
 The following tables summarize our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows by activities attributable to the Company and Consolidated Funds. For more details on the activity of the Company and Consolidated Funds, refer to Note 14. Consolidation within our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

 The Consolidated Funds had no effect on cash flows attributable to the Company for the periods presented and are excluded from the discussion below. The following discussion focuses on cash flow by activities attributable to the Company. 
 
 Operating Activities 
 
 In the table below, cash flows from operations are summarized to present: (i) cash generated from our core operating activities, primarily consisting of profits generated principally from management fees and fee related performance revenues after covering for operating expenses and fee related performance compensation; (ii) net realized performance income; and (iii) net cash from investment related activities including purchases, sales, realized net investment income and interest expense. We generated meaningful cash flow from operations in each period presented. 
 Nine months ended September 30, Favorable (Unfavorable) 2024 2023 Change Change Core operating activities 1,096,816 1,062,418 34,398 3 Net realized performance income 98,000 (52,333) 150,333 (287) Net cash provided by (used in) investment related activities 94,685 (285,172) 379,857 (133) Net cash provided by operating activities 1,289,501 724,913 564,588 78 
 
 Cash from our core operating activities increased as a result of growing fee revenues and sustained profitability and timing of cash collection of our receivables, partially offset by a decrease in cash attributable to fee related performance revenues earned from our non-traded REITs in 2022 and collected during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. There were no fee related performance revenues earned from our non-traded REITs in 2023. 
 Net realized performance income includes: (i) carried interest distributions that may represent tax distributions or other distributions of income; and (ii) incentive fees that are realized annually at the end of the measurement period, which is typically at the end of the calendar year. Cash received from carried interest distributions and the subsequent payments to employees may not necessarily occur in the same quarter. Cash from the incentive fee activities is generally received in the period subsequent to the measurement period. The increase in net realized performance income over the comparative period was primarily due to timing of payments to employees for tax distributions that were both received and paid in the fourth quarter 2023, while tax distributions received in the fourth quarter of 2022 were paid in the first quarter of 2023, resulting in a use of cash for the 2023 year-to-date period. 
 Net cash provided by (used in) investment related activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 primarily represents: (i) distributions received from our capital investments and the repayment of loans that we have made; (ii) sales of certain capital investments to employees; (iii) the rebalancing of and associated return of our capital commitments upon admitting new limited partners; offset by (iv) purchases associated with funding capital commitments and strategic investments in our investment portfolio; and (v) interest payments on our debt obligations. Although our capital commitments continue to increase with our growing assets under management, cash generated from our investment related activities has exceeded cash used in investment related activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Our investment related activities may fluctuate depending on timing of capital investments and distributions of each fund from year to year. For further discussion of

 our capital commitments, see Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies, within our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Our working capital needs are generally rising to support the growth of our business, while the capital requirements needed to support fund-related activities vary based upon the specific investment activities being conducted during such period. 
 Investing Activities 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 Purchase of furniture, equipment and leasehold improvements, net of disposals (82,203) (44,177) Acquisitions (13,683) Net cash used in investing activities (95,886) (44,177) 
 
 Net cash used in the Company s investing activities for both periods included cash to purchase furniture, fixtures, equipment and leasehold improvements to support the growth in our staffing levels. Net cash used in the Company s investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was predominantly for the build out of our new corporate headquarters that we have occupied beginning in the third quarter of 2024. 
 Financing Activities 
 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net proceeds from issuance of Class A common stock 407,236 Net borrowings (repayments) of Credit Facility (425,000) 65,000 Class A and non-voting common stock dividends (583,740) (446,252) AOG unitholder distributions (385,620) (313,833) Stock option exercises 1,511 80,426 Taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards (211,615) (145,421) Other financing activities 485 902 Net cash used in the Company s financing activities (1,196,743) (759,178) 
 
 As a result of generating higher fee related earnings, we increased the level of dividends paid to a growing shareholder base of Class A and non-voting common stockholders and distributions paid to AOG unitholders, resulting in net cash used in the Company s financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 Net cash used in the Company s financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 also included the repayment of our Credit Facility, partially using cash provided by the net proceeds from the Offering. 
 
 In connection with the vesting of restricted units that are granted to our employees under the 2023 Equity Incentive Plan (the Equity Incentive Plan ), we withhold shares equal to the fair value of our employees tax withholding liabilities and pay the taxes on their behalf in cash and thus issue fewer net shares. The use of cash increased from the prior year period as a result of our higher stock price, which resulted in employees recognizing additional compensation. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we net settled and did not issue 1.7 million shares and 1.6 million shares, respectively. The Company s financing activities also included cash received from stock options exercises with 0.1 million and 4.8 million options exercised for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. All the remaining options were exercised during the first quarter of 2024, and we will no longer receive cash or realize any tax benefit from the exercise of stock options after the 2024 tax year. 
 Capital Resources 
 
 We intend to use a portion of our available liquidity to pay cash dividends to our Class A and non-voting common stockholders on a quarterly basis in accordance with our dividend policy. Our ability to make cash dividends is dependent on a myriad of factors, including: (i) general economic and business conditions; (ii) our strategic plans and prospects; (iii) our business and investment opportunities; (iv) timing of capital calls by our funds in support of our commitments; (v) our financial condition and operating results; (vi) working capital requirements and other anticipated cash needs; (vii) contractual restrictions and obligations; (viii) legal, tax and regulatory restrictions; (ix) restrictions on the payment of distributions by our subsidiaries to us; and (x) other relevant factors.

 We are required to maintain minimum net capital balances for regulatory purposes for our broker-dealer entities. These net capital requirements are met in part by retaining cash, cash equivalents and investment securities. Additionally, certain of our subsidiaries operating outside the U.S. are also subject to capital adequacy requirements in each of the applicable jurisdictions. As a result, we may be restricted in our ability to transfer cash between different operating entities and jurisdictions. As of September 30, 2024, we were required to maintain approximately 76.8 million in net assets within these subsidiaries to meet regulatory net capital and capital adequacy requirements. We remain in compliance with these regulatory requirements. 
 
 Holders of AOG Units, subject to the terms of the exchange agreement, may exchange their AOG Units for shares of our Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis. These exchanges are expected to result in increases in the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of AMC that otherwise would not have been available. These increases in tax basis may increase depreciation and amortization for U.S. income tax purposes and thereby reduce the amount of tax that we would otherwise be required to pay in the future. We entered into the TRA that provides payment to the TRA recipients of 85 of the amount of actual cash savings Cash Tax Savings ), if any, in U.S. federal, state, local and foreign income tax or franchise tax that we actually realize as a result of these increases in tax basis and of certain other tax benefits related to entering into the TRA, including tax benefits attributable to payments under the TRA and interest accrued thereon Tax Benefit Payment ). Effective as of May 1, 2023, pursuant to an amendment to the TRA, to the extent Ares Owners Holdings L.P. would have been a recipient of certain Tax Benefit Payments under the TRA for taxable exchanges on or after May 1, 2023, Ares Owners Holdings L.P. will no longer be entitled to any Tax Benefit Payment for such exchanges and 100 of any Cash Tax Savings will inure to us. Future payments under the TRA in respect of subsequent exchanges are expected to be substantial.

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 We prepare our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. In applying many of these accounting principles, we need to make assumptions, estimates or judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses in our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. These assumptions, estimates or judgments, however, are both subjective and subject to change, and actual results may differ from our assumptions and estimates. If actual amounts are ultimately different from our estimates, the revisions are included in our results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. For a summary of our critical accounting estimates, please see Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Estimates in our Annual Report on Form 10-K.

 Information regarding recent accounting pronouncements and their impact on the Company can be found in Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, within our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

Commitments and Contingencies 
 
 In the normal course of business, we enter into contractual obligations that may require future cash payments. We may also engage in off-balance sheet arrangements, including transactions in derivatives, guarantees, capital commitments to funds, indemnifications and potential contingent payment obligations. For further discussion of these arrangements, see Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 Our primary exposure to market risk is related to our role as general partner or investment adviser to our funds and the sensitivity to movements in the fair value of their investments, including the effect on management fees, performance income and investment income. 
 Market Risk 
 The market price of investments may significantly fluctuate during the period of investment. Investments may decline in value due to factors affecting securities markets generally or particular industries represented in the securities markets. The value of an investment may decline due to general market conditions, which are not specifically related to such investment, such as real or perceived adverse economic conditions, changes in the general outlook for corporate earnings, changes in interest or currency rates or adverse investor sentiment generally. It may also decline due to factors that affect a particular industry or industries, such as labor shortages or increased production costs, supply chain constraints and competitive conditions within an industry. 
 Our credit orientation has been a central tenet of our business across our debt and equity investment strategies. We believe the combination of high-quality proprietary information flow and a consistent, rigorous approach to managing investments across our strategies has been, and we believe will continue to be, a major driver of our strong risk-adjusted returns and the stability and predictability of our income. 
 
 Exchange Rate Risk 
 
 We and our funds hold investments that are denominated in foreign currencies that may be affected by movements in the rate of exchange between those currencies and the U.S. dollar. Movements in the exchange rate between currencies impact the management fees, carried interest and incentive fees earned by funds with fee paying AUM denominated in foreign currencies as well as by funds with fee paying AUM denominated in U.S. dollars that hold investments denominated in foreign currencies. Additionally, movements in the exchange rate impact operating expenses for our global offices that transact in foreign currencies and the revaluation of assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies, including cash balances and investments. 
 
 We manage our exposure to exchange rate risks through our regular operating activities, wherein we utilize payments received in foreign currencies to fulfill obligations in foreign currencies, and, when appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments to hedge the net foreign currency exposure in: (i) the funds that we advise; (ii) the balance sheet exposure for certain direct investments denominated in foreign currencies; and (iii) the cash flow exposure for foreign currencies. 
 
 Credit Risk 
 
 We are party to agreements providing for various financial services and transactions that contain an element of risk in the event that the counterparties are unable to meet the terms of such agreements. In such agreements, we depend on the counterparty to make payment or otherwise perform. We generally endeavor to minimize our risk of exposure by limiting to reputable financial institutions the counterparties with which we enter into financial transactions. In other circumstances, availability of financing from financial institutions may be uncertain due to market events, and we may not be able to access these financing markets. 
 
 In the ordinary course of business, we may extend loans to our funds or guarantee credit facilities held by our funds and could be subject to risk of loss or repayment if our funds do not perform. 
 
 Certain of our funds investments include lower-rated and comparable quality unrated distressed investments and other instruments. These issuers can be more sensitive to adverse market conditions, such as a recession or increasing interest rates, as compared to higher rated issuers. We seek to minimize risk exposure by subjecting each prospective investment to our rigorous, credit-oriented investment approach.

Table of Contents 

 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had cash balances with financial institutions in excess of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insured limits. We seek to mitigate this exposure by monitoring the credit standing of these financial institutions. 
 
 There have been no material changes in our market risks for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. For additional information on our market risks, refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which is accessible on the SEC s website at www.sec.gov. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based upon that evaluation and subject to the foregoing, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to accomplish their objectives at the reasonable assurance level. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or that are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
