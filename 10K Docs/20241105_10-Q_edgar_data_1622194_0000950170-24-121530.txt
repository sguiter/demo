 Overview 
 References to we, our, us and the Company refer to Easterly Government Properties, Inc., a Maryland corporation, together with our consolidated subsidiaries, including Easterly Government Properties LP, a Delaware limited partnership, which we refer to herein as the Operating Partnership. We present certain financial information and metrics at Easterly Share, which is calculated on an entity-by-entity basis. At Easterly Share information, which we also refer to as being at share, pro rata, our pro rata share or our share is not, and is not intended to be, a presentation in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP ). 
 We are an internally managed real estate investment trust REIT ), focused primarily on the acquisition, development and management of Class A commercial properties that are leased to U.S. Government agencies that serve essential functions. We generate substantially all of our revenue by leasing our properties to such agencies, either directly or through the U.S. General Services Administration GSA ). Our objective is to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns for our stockholders over the long term through dividends and capital appreciation. 
 We focus primarily on acquiring, developing and managing U.S. Government-leased properties that are essential to supporting the mission of the tenant agency and strive to be a partner of choice for the U.S. Government, working closely with the tenant agency to meet its needs and objectives. We may also consider other potential opportunities to add properties to our portfolio, including acquiring properties leased to state and local governments with strong creditworthiness and other opportunities that directly or indirectly support the mission of select government agencies. As of September 30, 2024, we wholly owned 85 operating properties and ten operating properties through an unconsolidated joint venture (the JV in the United States, encompassing approximately 9.3 million leased square feet (8.8 million pro rata), including 92 operating properties that were leased primarily to U.S. Government tenant agencies, two operating properties that were entirely leased to private tenants and one operating property entirely leased to tenant agencies of a U.S. state government. As of September 30, 2024, our operating properties were 97 leased. For purposes of calculating percentage leased, we exclude from the denominator total square feet that was unleased and to which we attributed no value at the time of acquisition. In addition, we wholly owned two properties under development that we expect will encompass approximately 0.2 million leased square feet upon completion. 
 The Operating Partnership holds substantially all of our assets and conducts substantially all of our business. We are the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership and owned approximately 95.2 of the aggregate limited partnership interests in the Operating Partnership, which we refer to herein as common units, as of September 30, 2024. We have elected to be taxed as a REIT and believe that we have operated and have been organized in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2015.

(9) We own 53.0 of the property through an unconsolidated joint venture. 

(10) Asset is subject to a ground lease where the unconsolidated joint venture is the lessee. 

Certain of our leases are currently in the soft-term period of the lease, meaning that the U.S. Government tenant agency has the right to terminate the lease prior to its stated lease end date. We believe that, from the U.S. Government s perspective, leases with such provisions are helpful for budgetary purposes. While some of our leases are contractually subject to early termination, we do not believe that our tenant agencies are likely to terminate these leases early given the build-to-suit features at the properties subject to the leases, the weighted average age of these properties based on the date the property was built or renovated-to-suit, where applicable (approximately 19.4 years as of September 30, 2024), the mission-critical focus of the properties subject to the leases and the current level of operations at such properties.

(1) The year of lease expiration is pursuant to current contract terms. Some tenants have the right to vacate their space during a specified period, or soft term, before the stated terms of their leases expire. As of September 30, 2024, 8 tenants occupying approximately 5.5 of our leased square feet and contributing approximately 5.4 of our annualized lease income are currently operating under lease provisions that allow them to exercise their right to terminate their lease before the stated term of their respective lease expires.

 The 0.2 million increase in Income from unconsolidated real estate venture is primarily attributable to the one operating property acquired by the JV since September 30, 2023 and the one operating property acquired during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Interest expense, net 
 The 9.5 million increase in Interest expense, net is primarily attributable to the fixed rate, senior unsecured notes entered into during the three months ended June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2024 and higher weighted average interest rates across the Company's borrowings. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We anticipate that our cash flows from the sources listed below will provide adequate capital for the next 12 months for all anticipated uses, including all scheduled principal and interest payments on our outstanding indebtedness, current and anticipated tenant improvements, development activities at FDA Atlanta and JUD Flagstaff, planned and possible acquisitions of properties, stockholder distributions to maintain our qualification as a REIT, potential repurchases of common stock under our share repurchase program and other capital obligations associated with conducting our business. At September 30, 2024, we had approximately 31.2 million available in cash and cash equivalents, 8.0 million of restricted cash and there was approximately 250.3 million available under our 2024 revolving credit facility. 
 Our primary expected sources of capital are as follows: 
 existing cash balances; 

operating cash flow; 

distribution of cash flows from the JV; 

available borrowings under our 2024 revolving credit facility; 

issuance of long-term debt; 

issuance of equity, including under our ATM Programs (as described below); and 

asset sales. 

Our short-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds to pay for the following: 
 development and redevelopment activities, including major redevelopment, renovation or expansion programs at FDA - Atlanta and JUD - Flagstaff and other individual properties; 

31 

property acquisitions under contract; 

tenant improvements, allowances and leasing costs; 

recurring maintenance and capital expenditures; 

debt repayment requirements; 

commitments to fund advancements through loan receivables; 

corporate and administrative costs; 

interest payments on our outstanding indebtedness; 

interest swap payments; 

distribution payments; and 

potential repurchases of common stock under our share repurchase program. 

Our long-term liquidity needs, in addition to recurring short-term liquidity needs as discussed above, consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for acquisitions, non-recurring capital expenditures, and scheduled debt maturities. Although we may be able to anticipate and plan for certain of our liquidity needs, unexpected increases in uses of cash that are beyond our control and which affect our financial condition and results of operations may arise, or our sources of liquidity may be fewer than, and the funds available from such sources may be less than, anticipated or required. As of the date of this filing, there were no known commitments or events that would have a material impact on our liquidity.

As of September 30, 2024 and the date of this filing the outstanding balance of the loan receivable was 32.4 million and 33.8 million, respectively. We expect to fund the remaining commitment through the anticipated maturity of the loan on August 31, 2027, dependent on the borrower's election to use the commitments. For a more complete description of the real estate loan receivable, see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Other than as described above, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no material changes to the cash commitment information presented in Item 7 of Part II of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

 Dividend Policy 
 In order to qualify as a REIT, we are required to distribute to our stockholders, on an annual basis, at least 90 of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains. We anticipate distributing all of our taxable income. We expect to make quarterly distributions to our stockholders in a manner intended to satisfy this requirement. Prior to making any distributions for U.S. federal tax purposes or otherwise, we must first satisfy our operating and debt service obligations. It is possible that it would be necessary to utilize cash reserves, liquidate assets at unfavorable prices or incur additional indebtedness in order to make required distributions. It is also possible that our board of directors could decide to make required distributions in part by using shares of our common stock.

Inflation 
 Substantially all of our leases provide for operating expense escalations. We believe inflationary increases in expenses may be at least partially offset by the operating expenses that are passed through to our tenants and by contractual rent increases. We do not believe inflation has had a material impact on our historical financial position or results of operations.

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 We use and present Funds From Operations FFO and Core FFO as supplemental measures of our performance. The summary below describes our use of FFO and Core FFO and provides information regarding why we believe these measures are meaningful supplemental measures of our performance and reconciles these measures from net income, presented in accordance with GAAP. 
 Funds From Operations and Core Funds From Operations 
 FFO is a supplemental measure of our performance. We present FFO calculated in accordance with the current National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts Nareit definition set forth in the Nareit FFO White Paper Restatement 2018. FFO includes the REIT s share of FFO generated by unconsolidated affiliates. In addition, we present Core FFO for certain other adjustments that we believe enhance the comparability of our FFO across periods and to the FFO reported by other publicly traded REITs. FFO is a supplemental performance measure that is commonly used in the real estate industry to assist investors and analysts in comparing results of REITs. 
 FFO is defined by Nareit as net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP), excluding: 
 Depreciation and amortization related to real estate. 

Gains and losses from the sale of certain real estate assets. 

Gains and losses from change in control. 

Impairment write-downs of certain real estate assets and investments in entities when the impairment is directly attributable to decreases in the value of depreciable real estate held by the entity. 

We present FFO because we consider it an important supplemental measure of our operating performance, and we believe it is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs, many of which present FFO when reporting results. 
 We adjust FFO to present Core FFO as an alternative measure of our operating performance, which, when applicable, excludes items which we believe are not representative of ongoing operating results, such as liability management related costs (including losses on extinguishment of debt and modification costs), catastrophic event charges, depreciation of non-real estate assets, provision for credit losses and the unconsolidated real estate venture's allocated share of these adjustments. In future periods, we may also exclude other items from Core FFO that we believe may help investors compare our results. We believe Core FFO more accurately reflects the ongoing operational and financial performance of our core business. 
 FFO and Core FFO are presented as supplemental financial measures and do not fully represent our operating performance. Other REITs may use different methodologies for calculating FFO and Core FFO or use other definitions of FFO and Core FFO and, accordingly, our presentation of these measures may not be comparable to other REITs. Neither FFO nor Core FFO is intended to be a measure of cash flow or liquidity. Please refer to our financial statements, prepared in accordance with GAAP, for purposes of evaluating our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. We base these estimates, judgments, and assumptions on historical experience, current trends, and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different, or different assumptions were made, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied, resulting in different financial results or a different presentation of our financial statements. 
 Our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 contains a discussion of our significant accounting policies, which utilize relevant critical accounting estimates. See below for our Current Expected Credit Loss CECL policy subsequent to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update ASU 2016-13 Financial Instruments - Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no other material changes to the discussion of our significant accounting policies included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Loan Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses 
 The measurement of expected credit losses under the CECL methodology is applicable to our financial assets measured at amortized cost, including loan receivables and certain off-balance sheet credit exposures such as unfunded loan commitments. We adopted this standard on January 1, 2020 and apply this methodology to our loan receivables and off-balance sheet credit exposure. To determine our expected credit losses under CECL we utilize a probability of default PD and loss given default LGD methodology. We determined that we have one portfolio segment and reserve for loan losses on an asset-specific basis. We have a limited history of incurred losses and consequently have elected to employ external data to perform our CECL calculation. Our model s inputs consider a default grade or industry relative default grade associated with the borrower and/or prospective tenant funding the development to determine an appropriate default risk and allowance for credit loss under the PD and LGD methodology. If a reserve is recorded, the allowance is increased as a provision for credit losses and is decreased by charge-offs when losses are confirmed through the receipt of assets such as cash or via ownership control of the underlying collateral in full. The allowance for loan losses reflects management's estimate of loan losses as of the balance sheet date. For more information on the measurement of expected credit losses with respect to our real estate loan receivable, see Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

I tem 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates. Our future earnings, cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevailing market interest rates. Our primary market risk results from our indebtedness, which bears interest at both fixed and variable rates. We manage and may continue to manage our market risk on variable rate debt by entering into swap arrangements to, in effect, fix the rate on all or a portion of the debt for varying periods up to maturity. This in turn, reduces the risks of variability of cash flows created by variable rate debt and mitigates the risk of increases in interest rates. Our objective when undertaking such arrangements is to reduce our floating rate exposure and we do not intend to enter into hedging arrangements for speculative purposes. For more information on our interest rate swaps, see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 As of September 30, 2024, 1.4 billion, or 91.6 of our debt, excluding unamortized premiums and discounts, had fixed interest rates and 124.1 million, or 8.4 , had variable interest rates based on SOFR. If market interest rates on our variable rate debt fluctuate by 25 basis points, our interest expense would increase or decrease, depending on rate movement, by 0.3 million annually. 
 I tem 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We carried out an evaluation required by the Exchange Act, under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a -15(e) and Rule 15d-15 of the Exchange Act, as of September 30, 2024. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and to provide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
