NOTES
TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

.
The Company was formed for the purpose of entering into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, recapitalization,
reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities (the Business Combination ). The
Company is not limited to a particular industry or geographic region for purposes of consummating a Business Combination. 

On
June 2, 2022, Goldenstone Merger Sub, Inc. Merger Sub 1 was incorporated in the state of Delaware as a corporation and
is wholly-owned by the Company. Merger Sub 1 was formed in connection with the execution of a business combination agreement that was
subsequently terminated. It has not conducted any activities and is inactive. 

On
June 20, 2024, Pacifica Acquisition Corp Merger Sub 2 was incorporated in the state of Delaware as a corporation and
is wholly-owned by the Company. Merger Sub 2 was formed in connection with the execution of a business combination agreement. It has
not conducted any activities and is inactive. 

The
Company has selected March 31 as its fiscal year end. As of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, the Company had not commenced any
operations. For the period from September 9, 2020 (inception) to September 30, 2024, the Company s efforts have been limited to
organizational activities as well as activities related to the Initial Public Offering (as defined below) and to consummate a Business
Combination. The Company will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of a Business Combination, at the earliest.
The Company will generate non-operating income in the form of interest income from the proceeds derived from the Initial Public Offering. 

On
March 21, 2022, the Company closed its initial public offering of units, which includes the full exercise of the underwriters 
over-allotment option. The units were sold at a price of per unit, resulting in total gross proceeds of . Each unit
consists of share of common stock, redeemable warrant and right to receive one-tenth (1/10) of share of common stock.
Each redeemable warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one-half (1/2) of share of common stock, and each ten (10) rights
entitle the holder thereof to receive share of common stock at the closing of a Business Combination. The exercise price of the warrants
is per full share. 

Simultaneously
with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company completed the private sale of units (the Private Units to the Sponsor, Ray Chen, our Chief Financial Officer, and Yongsheng Liu, our former Chief Operating Officer, each through their respective
affiliated entities. Each Private Unit consists of share of common stock, warrant Private Warrant and right
(each, a Private Right ). Each Private Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one-half of share of common stock at
an exercise price of per whole share. Each Private Right entitles the holder to receive one-tenth of share of common stock
at the closing of a Business Combination. The Private Units were sold at a purchase price of per Private Unit, generating gross
proceeds to the Company of . The Private Units are identical to the Public Units sold in the Initial Public Offering, except
that the holders of the Private Units have agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of the Private Units and the underlying securities
(except to certain permitted transferees) until the completion of the Company s initial Business Combination. 

5 

shares of Common Stock (the Representative Shares to Maxim Group LLC and/or its designees Maxim as part of representative compensation. The representative shares are identical to the Common Stock sold as part of the Public Units,
except that Maxim Group LLC has agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any such representative shares until the completion of the Company s
initial Business Combination. In addition, Maxim Group LLC has agreed (i) to waive its redemption rights with respect to such shares
in connection with the completion of the Company s initial Business Combination and (ii) to waive its rights to liquidating distributions
from the trust account with respect to such shares if the Company fails to complete its initial Business Combination within 12 months
(or up to 21 months if the Company extends the period of time to consummate a Business Combination) from the effective date of its registration
statement. The shares have been deemed compensation by FINRA and are therefore subject to a lock-up for a period of 180 days immediately
following the commencement of sales of the offering pursuant to Rule 5110(e)(1) of FINRA s Rules. Pursuant to FINRA Rule 5110(e)(1),
these securities may not be sold, transferred, assigned, pledged or hypothecated nor may they be the subject of any hedging, short sale,
derivative, put or call transaction that would result in the economic disposition of the securities by any person for a period of 180
days immediately following the commencement of sales of this offering except to any underwriter and selected dealer participating in
the offering and their officers or partners, registered persons or affiliates. The Company used a Black-Scholes option-pricing Model
that values the Representative Shares granted to Maxim Group LLC and/or its designees. The key inputs into the Binomial model were (i)
risk- free interest rate of , (ii) volatility of , (iii) expected life of year, and (iv) probability of business combination.
According to the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, the fair value of the Representative Shares was approximately or
 per share. 

The
Company also sold to Maxim, for , a Unit Purchase Option UPO to purchase Units exercisable at per
Unit, for an aggregate exercise price of , commencing on the later of the first anniversary of the effective date of the registration
statement related to the Initial Public Offering and the consummation of a Business Combination. The UPO may be exercised for cash or
on a cashless basis, at the holder s option, and expires five years from the effective date of the registration statement related
to the Initial Public Offering. The Units issuable upon exercise of the option are identical to those offered in the Initial Public Offering.
The Company accounted for the unit purchase option, inclusive of the receipt of the cash payment and the fair value of ,
or per Unit, as an expense of the Initial Public Offering resulting in a charge directly to stockholders equity. The fair
value of the UPO granted to Maxim was estimated as of the date of grant using the following assumptions: (1) expected volatility of ,
(2) risk-free interest rate of , (3) expected life of years and (4) probability of successful combination. 

Transaction
costs amounted to , consisting of of underwriting discounts and commissions, of deferred underwriting
discounts and commissions, of other offering costs, fair value of the representative shares and fair
value of the UPO considered as part of the transaction costs. 

Following
the closing of the Initial Public Offering and the issuance and the sale of Private Units on March 21, 2022, per
Public Unit) from the net proceeds of the sale of the Public Units in the Initial Public Offering and the sale of Private Units was placed
in a trust account (the Trust Account maintained by Continental Stock Transfer Trust Company, LLC as a trustee and
invested the proceeds in U.S. government treasury bills, bonds or notes having a maturity of 185 days or less, or in money market funds
meeting the applicable conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and that invest solely in United
States government treasuries, so that we are not deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act. The proceeds held
in the trust account will not be released until the earlier of: (1) the completion of the Company s initial Business Combination
within the required time period and (2) its redemption of of the outstanding public shares if the Company has not completed a Business
Combination in the required time period. Therefore, unless and until the Company s initial Business Combination is consummated,
the proceeds held in the trust account will not be available for the Company s use for any expenses related to the Initial Public
Offering or expenses which the Company may incur related to the investigation and selection of a target business and the negotiation
of an agreement in connection with its initial Business Combination.

per public share. The per-share
amount the Company will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by deferred underwriting commissions

of the Business Combination. If a shareholder vote is not required and the Company does not decide to hold a shareholder vote for business
or other legal reasons, the Company will, pursuant to its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, offer such redemption pursuant
to the tender offer rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ), and file tender offer documents containing substantially
the same information as would be included in a proxy statement with the SEC prior to completing a Business Combination. 

The
Company will provide its stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of a
Business Combination either (i) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the Business Combination or (ii) by means
of a tender offer. The decision as to whether the Company will seek stockholder approval of a Business Combination or conduct a tender
offer will be made by the Company, solely in its discretion. The stockholders will be entitled to redeem their Public Shares for a pro
rata portion of the amount then on deposit in the Trust Account (initially 10.15 per share), plus any pro rata interest earned on the
funds held in the Trust Account. 

The
Company s initial stockholders (the initial stockholders have agreed (a) to vote the founders shares and the common
stock Insider Shares underlying the Private Units (the Private Shares and any Public Shares purchased
during or after the Initial Public Offering in favor of a Business Combination, (b) not to propose, or vote in favor of, an amendment
to the Company s amended and restated certificate of incorporation that would stop the public stockholders from converting or selling
their shares to the Company in connection with a Business Combination or affect the substance or timing of the Company s obligation
to redeem of the Public Shares if the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period unless the
Company provides dissenting public stockholders with the opportunity to convert their Public Shares into the right to receive cash from
the Trust Account in connection with any such vote; (c) not to convert any Insider Shares and Private Units (including underlying securities)
(as well as any Public Shares purchased during or after the Initial Public Offering) into the right to receive cash from the Trust Account
in connection with a stockholder vote to approve a Business Combination (or sell any shares in a tender offer in connection with a Business
Combination) or a vote to amend the provisions of the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation relating to stockholders 
rights of pre-Business Combination activity and (d) that the Insider Shares and Private Units (including underlying securities) shall
not participate in any liquidating distributions upon winding up if a Business Combination is not consummated. However, the initial stockholders
will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to any Public Shares purchased during or after the
Initial Public Offering if the Company fails to complete its Business Combination.

for each three-month extension. On September 21, 2023, the Charter and the Trust Agreement were amended
to extend the date by which the Company has to consummate a business combination up to nine (9) times, each such extension for an additional
one (1) month period, from September 21, 2023 to June 21, 2024, provided that the Company deposited into the trust the sum of 
for each one month extension. On June 18, 2024, the Charter and the Trust Agreement were further amended to extend the date by which
Company has to consummate a business combination to June 21, 2025 provided that the Company deposits a sum of for each one month
extended. (for a total of up to 39 months to complete a Business Combination) (the Combination Period ). 

If
the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period, the Company will (i) cease all operations except
for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but no more than ten business days thereafter, redeem of
the outstanding Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account,
including interest earned (net of taxes payable, and less up to of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number
of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders rights as stockholders (including
the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible
following such redemption, subject to the approval of the remaining stockholders and the Company s board of directors, liquidate
and dissolve, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other
applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to the Company s public warrants,
public rights, or private rights. The warrants and rights will expire worthless if the Company fails to complete its initial Business
Combination within the Combination Period. The underwriters have agreed to waive its rights to the deferred underwriting commission held
in the Trust Account in the event the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and, in such event,
such amounts will be included with the funds held in the Trust Account that will be available to fund the redemption of the Public Shares.
In the event of such distribution, it is possible that the per share value of the assets remaining available for distribution will be

has discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below (i) per public share
or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account due to reductions
in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, except as to any claims by a
third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the trust account and except as to any claims under the Company s
indemnity of the underwriters of this offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the Securities Act ). Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third
party, the Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third party claims. The Company will seek to reduce
the possibility that the Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors,
service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which the Company does business, execute agreements with the
Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account.

In
connection with the Company s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with Financial Accounting Standard Board s
Accounting Standards Update ASU 2014-15, Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue
as a Going Concern, management has determined that these conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability
to continue as a going concern. The management s plan in addressing this uncertainty is through the Working Capital Loans, as defined
below (see Note 6). In addition, if the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period by November
21, 2024, if not further extended, the Company s board of directors would proceed to commence a voluntary liquidation and thereby
a formal dissolution of the Company. There is no assurance that the Company s plans to consummate a Business Combination will be
successful within the Combination Period. As a result, management has determined that such condition raise substantial doubt about the
Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any
adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Inflation
Reduction Act of 2022 

On
August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the IR Act was signed into federal law. The IR Act provides for,
among other things, a new U.S. federal excise tax on certain repurchases (including redemptions) of stock by publicly traded U.S.
domestic corporations and certain U.S. domestic subsidiaries of publicly traded foreign corporations occurring on or after January 1,
2023. The excise tax is imposed on the repurchasing corporation itself, not its shareholders from which shares are repurchased. The amount
of the excise tax is generally of the fair market value of the shares repurchased at the time of the repurchase. However, for purposes
of calculating the excise tax, repurchasing corporations are permitted to net the fair market value of certain new stock issuances against
the fair market value of stock repurchases during the same taxable year. In addition, certain exceptions apply to the excise tax. The
U.S. Department of the Treasury (the Treasury has been given authority to provide regulations and other guidance to carry
out and prevent the abuse or avoidance of the excise tax. Any redemption or other repurchase that occurs after December 31, 2022, in
connection with a Business Combination, extension vote or otherwise, may be subject to the excise tax. Whether and to what extent the
Company would be subject to the excise tax in connection with a Business Combination, extension vote or otherwise would depend on a number
of factors, including (i) the fair market value of the redemptions and repurchases in connection with the Business Combination, extension
or otherwise, (ii) the structure of a Business Combination, (iii) the nature and amount of any PIPE or other equity issuances
in connection with a Business Combination (or otherwise issued not in connection with a Business Combination but issued within the same
taxable year of a Business Combination) and (iv) the content of regulations and other guidance from the Treasury. In addition, because
the excise tax would be payable by the Company and not by the redeeming holder, the mechanics of any required payment of the excise tax
have not been determined. The foregoing could cause a reduction in the cash available on hand to complete a Business Combination and
in the Company s ability to complete a Business Combination. 

At
this time, it has been determined that the IR Act tax provisions have an impact to the Company s three and six months ended September
30, 2024 and for the year ended March 31, 2024 income tax provision as there were redemptions by the public stockholders in June 2024
and October 2023; as a result, the Company recorded and excise tax liability as of September 30, 2024 and March
31, 2024, respectively. The Company will continue to monitor for updates to the Company s business along with guidance issued with
respect to the IR Act to determine whether any adjustments are needed to the Company s tax provision in future periods.

consists of share of common stock, redeemable warrant and right to receive one-tenth (1/10) of share of common stock.
Each redeemable warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one-half (1/2) of share of common stock, and each ten (10) rights
entitle the holder thereof to receive share of common stock at the closing of a Business Combination. The exercise price of the warrants
is per full share. The warrants will become exercisable on the later of 30 days after the completion of the Company s initial
Business Combination or 12 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering, and will expire five years after the completion of
the Company s initial Business Combination or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. 

All
of the public shares sold as part of the Public Units in the Initial Public Offering contain a redemption feature which allows
for the redemption of such public shares if there is a stockholder vote or tender offer in connection with the Business Combination and
in connection with certain amendments to the Company s amended and restated certificate of incorporation, or in connection with
the Company s liquidation. In accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC and its staff s
guidance on redeemable equity instruments, which has been codified in ASC 480-10-S99, redemption provisions not solely within the control
of the Company require Common Stock subject to redemption to be classified outside of permanent equity. 

The
Company s redeemable Common Stock is subject to SEC and its staff s guidance on redeemable equity instruments, which has
been codified in ASC 480-10-S99. If it is probable that the equity instrument will become redeemable, the Company has the option to either
accrete changes in the redemption value over the period from the date of issuance (or from the date that it becomes probable that the
instrument will become redeemable, if later) to the earliest redemption date of the instrument or to recognize changes in the redemption
value immediately as they occur and adjust the carrying amount of the instrument to equal the redemption value at the end of each reporting
period. The Company has elected to recognize the changes over the period from the date of issuance to the earliest redemption date of
the instrument of twelve months. The accretion or remeasurement is treated as a deemed dividend (i.e., a reduction to retained earnings,
or in absence of retained earnings, additional paid-in capital).

having the right to exchange their shares of common stock for cash, securities or other property. 

Working
Capital and Extension Loans 

In
addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with searching for a target business or consummating an intended initial
business combination, the initial stockholders, officers, directors or their affiliates may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds
as may be required. In the event that the initial business combination does not close, the Company may use a portion of the working capital
held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts, but no proceeds from the Trust Account would be used for such repayment.
Such loans would be evidenced by promissory notes. The notes would either be paid upon consummation of its initial business combination,
without interest, or, at the lender s discretion, up to of the notes may be converted upon consummation of the Company s
business combination into private units at a price of per unit. 

The
Company will have until 12 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering to consummate an initial Business Combination. However,
if the Company anticipates that it may not be able to consummate its initial Business Combination within 12 months, the Company may extend
the period of time to consummate a Business Combination up to three times, each by an additional three months (for a total of up to 21
months to complete a Business Combination). Pursuant to the terms of the Company s amended and restated certificate of incorporation
and the trust agreement to be entered into between the Company and the trustee, in order to extend the time available for the Company
to consummate its initial Business Combination, its sponsor or its affiliates or designees, upon ten days advance notice prior to the

On September 21, 2023, the Company s stockholders approved the amendment to the Company s Amended and Restated Certificate
of Incorporation to extend the date by which the Company has to consummate a business combination up to nine (9) times, each such extension

and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to extend the date by which the Company has to consummate a business combination up to twelve
(12) times, each such extension for an additional one month period, from June 21, 2024 to June 21, 2025, and must deposit into the trust
account in the sum of for each one month extended. Any such payments would be made in the form of a loan. Any such loans will

Shares 

The
Company issued shares of Common Stock (the Representative Shares to Maxim as part of representative compensation.
The Representative Shares are identical to the Common Stock sold as part of the Public Units, except that Maxim Group LLC has agreed
not to transfer, assign or sell any such representative shares until the completion of the Company s initial Business Combination.
In addition, Maxim Group LLC has agreed (i) to waive its redemption rights with respect to such shares in connection with the completion

with respect to such shares if the Company fails to complete its initial Business Combination within months (or up to 21 months if
the Company extends the period of time to consummate a Business Combination) from the effective date of its registration statement. The

Company also sold to Maxim, , a Unit Purchase Option UPO to purchase Units exercisable at per Unit,
an aggregate exercise price of , commencing on the later of the first anniversary the effective date of the registration statement
related to the Initial Public Offering and the consummation of a Business Combination. The unit purchase option may be exercised for
cash or on a cashless basis, at the holder s option, and expires from the effective date of the registration statement
related to the Initial Public Offering. The Units issuable upon exercise of the option are identical to those offered in the Initial
Public Offering. The Company accounted for the unit purchase option, inclusive of the receipt of cash payment and the fair value
of , or per Unit, as an expense of the Initial Public Offering resulting in a charge directly to stockholders equity.
The fair value of the UPO granted to Maxim was estimated as of the date of grant using the following assumptions: (1) expected volatility

The
Company sold Maxim for , an UPO to purchase up to Units exercisable at per Unit (or an aggregate exercise price of) commencing on the later of the first anniversary of the effective date of the registration statement related to the Initial
Public Offering and the consummation of a Business Combination. The UPO may be exercised for cash or on a cashless basis, at the holder s
option, and expires from the effective date of the registration statement related to the Initial Public Offering. The Units
issuable upon exercise of the option are identical to those offered in the Initial Public Offering. The Company accounted for the unit
purchase option, inclusive of the receipt of cash payment and the fair value of , or per Unit, as an expense of the
Initial Public Offering resulting in a charge directly to stockholders equity. The fair value of the UPO granted to Maxim was
estimated as of the date of grant using the following assumptions: (1) expected volatility of , (2) risk-free interest rate of
 , (3) expected life of and (4) probability of successful combination. The option and such units purchased pursuant
to the option, as well as the common stock underlying such units, the rights included in such units, the shares of common stock that
are issuable for the rights included in such units, the warrants included in such units, and the shares underlying such warrants, have
been deemed compensation by FINRA and are therefore subject to a 180-day lock-up pursuant to FINRA Rule 5110(e)(1). Additionally, the
option may not be sold, transferred, assigned, pledged or hypothecated for a one-year period (including the foregoing 180-day period)
following the date of Initial Public Offering except to any underwriter and selected dealer participating in the Initial Public Offering
and their bona fide officers or partners. The option grants to holders demand and piggy back rights for periods of five
and seven years, respectively, from the effective date of the registration statement with respect to the registration under the Securities
Act of the securities directly and indirectly issuable upon exercise of the option. The Company will bear all fees and expenses attendant
to registering the securities, other than underwriting commissions which will be paid for by the holders themselves. The exercise price
and number of units issuable upon exercise of the option may be adjusted in certain circumstances including in the event of a stock dividend,
or the Company s recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation. However, the option will not be adjusted for issuances
of common stock at a price below its exercise price.

shares of common stock, par value per share. As of September 30, 2024 and March
31, 2024, there were shares of common stock issued and outstanding, respectively. 

Rights 

As
of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, there were Public Rights and Private Rights outstanding. 
Except in cases where the Company is not the surviving company in a Business Combination, each holder of a right will automatically receive
one-tenth (1/10) of one share of common stock upon consummation of its initial Business Combination. In the event the Company will not
be the surviving company upon completion of its initial Business Combination, each holder of a right will be required to affirmatively
convert his, her or its rights in order to receive the one-tenth (1/10) of a share underlying each right upon consummation of the Business
Combination. The Company will not issue fractional shares in connection with an exchange of rights. Fractional shares will either be
rounded down to the nearest whole share or otherwise addressed in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Delaware law. As a
result, the holder must hold rights in multiples of 10 in order to receive shares for all of their rights upon closing of a Business
Combination. If the Company is unable to complete an initial Business Combination within the required time period and the Company redeems
the public shares for the funds held in the Trust Account, holders of rights will not receive any of such funds for their rights and
the rights will expire worthless. The Company accounted for the rights issued with the IPO as equity instruments in accordance
with ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity and ASC 815-40, Derivatives and Hedging: Contracts in Entity s
Own Equity . The Company accounted for the rights as an expense of the IPO resulting in a charge directly to stockholders 
equity. The Company estimates that the fair value of the rights is approximately million, or per Unit, using the Black-Scholes
Option Pricing Model. The fair value of the rights is estimated as of the date of grant using the following assumptions: (1) expected
volatility of , (2) risk-free interest rate of , (3) expected life of 1 year, (4) exercise price of and (5) stock price
of . 

Warrants 

As
of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, there were Public Warrants and Private Warrants outstanding. 
Each redeemable warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one-half (1/2) of share of common stock at a price of per
full share, subject to adjustment as described in this prospectus. The warrants will become exercisable on the later of the completion
of an initial Business Combination and 12 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering. However, no public warrants will be
exercisable for cash unless the Company has an effective and current registration statement covering the issuance of the common stock
issuable upon exercise of the warrants and a current prospectus relating to such common stock. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a registration
statement covering the issuance of the common stock issuable upon exercise of the public warrants is not effective within 90 days from
the closing of the Company s initial Business Combination, warrant holders may, until such time as there is an effective registration
statement and during any period when we shall have failed to maintain an effective registration statement, exercise warrants on a cashless
basis pursuant to an available exemption from registration under the Securities Act. If an exemption from registration is not available,
holders will not be able to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis. The warrants will expire from the closing of the
Company s initial Business Combination at 5:00 p.m., New York City time or earlier redemption. 

In
addition, if (x) the Company issues additional shares of common stock or equity-linked securities for capital raising purposes in connection
with the closing of the Company s initial Business Combination at an issue price or effective issue price of less than per
share (with such issue price or effective issue price to be determined in good faith by our board of directors), (y) the aggregate gross
proceeds from such issuances represent more than of the total equity proceeds, and interest thereon, available for the funding of
the Company s initial Business Combination, and (z) the volume weighted average trading price of the Company s common stock
during the trading day period starting on the trading day prior to the day on which the Company consummates its initial Business Combination
(such price, the Market Price is below per share, the exercise price of the warrants will be adjusted (to the nearest
cent) to be equal to of the Market Price, and the per share redemption trigger price described below will be adjusted (to
the nearest cent) to be equal to of the Market Value.

if,

splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any trading days within a -trading day period ending
on the third trading day prior to the date on which the Company sends the notice of redemption to the warrant holders. 

If
the Company calls the Public Warrants for redemption, management will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise the
Public Warrants to do so on a cashless basis, as described in the warrant agreement. In such event, each holder would pay
the exercise price by surrendering the whole warrants for that number of shares of common stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing
(x) the product of the number of shares of common stock underlying the warrants, multiplied by the difference between the exercise price
of the warrants and the fair market value (defined below) by (y) the fair market value. The fair market value 
shall mean the average reported last sale price of the common stock for the trading days ending on the third trading day prior to
the date on which the notice of redemption is sent to the holders of warrants. 

Except
as described above, no warrants will be exercisable and the Company will not be obligated to issue common stock unless at the time a
holder seeks to exercise such warrant, a prospectus relating to the common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants is current and
the common stock have been registered or qualified or deemed to be exempt under the securities laws of the state of residence of the
holder of the warrants. Under the terms of the warrant agreement, the Company has agreed to use its best efforts to meet these conditions
and to maintain a current prospectus relating to the common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants until the expiration of the
warrants. However, the Company cannot assure that it will be able to do so and, if the Company does not maintain a current prospectus
relating to the common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants, holders will be unable to exercise their warrants and the Company
will not be required to settle any such warrant exercise. If the prospectus relating to the common stock issuable upon the exercise of
the warrants is not current or if the common stock is not qualified or exempt from qualification in the jurisdictions in which the holders
of the warrants reside, the Company will not be required to net cash settle or cash settle the warrant exercise, the warrants may have
no value, the market for the warrants may be limited and the warrants may expire worthless. 

The
private warrants have terms and provisions that are identical to those of the warrants being sold as part of the units in the Initial
Public Offering except that the private warrants will be entitled to registration rights. The private warrants (including the common
stock issuable upon exercise of the private warrants) will not be transferable, assignable or salable until 30 days after the completion
of our initial business combination except to permitted transferees. 

The
Company accounted for the warrants issued with the IPO as equity instruments in accordance with ASC 480, Distinguishing
Liabilities from Equity and ASC 815-40, Derivatives and Hedging: Contracts in Entity s Own Equity . The Company
accounted for the warrant as an expense of the IPO resulting in a charge directly to stockholders equity. The Company estimates
that the fair value of the warrants is approximately million, or per Warrant, using the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model.
The fair value of the warrants is estimated as of the date of grant using the following assumptions: (1) expected volatility of ,

The Company s effective tax rate was and for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
The effective tax rate differs from the statutory tax rate of primarily due to the valuation allowance on the deferred tax

As
of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, the Company had and of U.S. federal and state gross deferred tax assets
on start-up/organization costs carryovers available to offset future taxable income over the period of 180 months upon the consummation
of the Business Combination. In assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than
not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent
upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences representing net future deductible amounts
become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax assets, projected future taxable income and tax planning
strategies in making this assessment. After consideration of all of the information available, management believes that significant uncertainty
exists with respect to future realization of the deferred tax assets and has therefore established a full valuation allowance of 
and as of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, respectively. The valuation allowance increased by from March 31,
2024 to September 30, 2024.

of the promissory note were deposited into the Company s Trust Account for the public shareholders, which enables the Company to
extend the period of time it has to consummate its initial Business Combination from October 21, 2024 to November 21, 2024.

2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

References
to the Company, Goldenstone our, us or we refer to Goldenstone
Acquisition Limited. The following discussion and analysis of the Company s financial condition and results of operations should
be read in conjunction with the unaudited interim condensed financial statements and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this report.
Certain information contained in the discussion and analysis set forth below includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and
uncertainties. 

Cautionary
Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 

This
Current Report on Form 10-Q includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,
and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). We have based these forward-looking
statements on our current expectations and projections about future events. These forward-looking statements are subject to known and
unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions about us that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements
to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking
statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as may, should, 
 could, would, expect, plan, anticipate, believe, 
 estimate, continue, or the negative of such terms or other similar expressions. Factors that might cause
or contribute to such a discrepancy include, but are not limited to, those described in our other Securities and Exchange Commission SEC filings. 

Overview 

We
are a blank check company incorporated on September 9, 2020 as a Delaware corporation and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger,
capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. 

On
March 21, 2022, we consummated our IPO of 5,750,000 units at 10.00 per unit (the Units ). The units sold included the full
exercise of the underwriters over-allotment. Each Unit consists of one share of our common stock (the Public Shares ),
one redeemable warrant to purchase one-half of one share of our common stock at a price of 11.50 per whole share and one right. Each
right entitles the holder thereof to receive one-tenth (1/10) of one share of our common stock upon the consummation of the Business
Combination. 

Simultaneously
with the closing of the IPO and the over-allotment, we consummated the issuance of 351,250 private placement units (the Private
Placement Units for aggregate cash proceeds of 3,512,500. Each Private Placement Unit consists of one share of our common stock,
one redeemable warrant to purchase one-half of one share of our common stock at a price of 11.50 per whole share and one right. Each
right entitles the holder thereof to receive one-tenth (1/10) of one share of our common stock upon the consummation of our Business
Combination. Our management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the IPO and the Private
Placement Units, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be generally applied toward consummating our Business
Combination. 

Upon
the closing of the initial public offering on March 21, 2022, a total of 58,362,500 of the net proceeds from the IPO, the Over-Allotment
and the Private Placement were deposited in a trust account established for the benefit of our public stockholders. 

If
we have not completed our initial business combination within 12 months (or by December 21, 2023, if so extended), we will: (i) cease
all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter,
redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account,
including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable, and less up to 100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses) divided
by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders rights as stockholders
(including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably
possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate,
subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable
law. 

We
cannot assure you that our plans to complete our initial business combination will be successful.

expenses of the Company for which Infintium is responsible. If the potential business combination fails to occur and the LOI or the LOI
or any subsequent definitive agreements are terminated by either party due to reasons not attributable to Infintium, the Company will
be required to return the Earnest Money to Infintium.

Results
of Operations 

Our
entire activity since inception up to September 30, 2024 was in connection with our search for a target for our initial business combination.
We will not generate any operating revenues until the closing and completion of our initial business combination, at the earliest. 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024, we generated a net income of 58,624, which consisted of interest income on the trust account

For
the three months ended September 30, 2023, we generated a net income of 52,927, which consisted of interest income on the trust account

Liquidity
and Going Concern 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had 5,040 in cash in our operating account as compared to cash of 30,823 at March 31, 2024 and working deficit
of 3,798,362 as compared to 2,870,013 at March 31, 2024. The change in liquidity is attributable to cash used in operating activities
of 1,067,424 and cash used in financing activities of 37,334,345, and offset by cash provided by investing activities of 38,375,986. 

For
the six months ended September 30, 2024, there was 1,067,424 of cash used in operating activities resulting from interest income earned
on investment held in Trust Account amounting to 925,418, and non-cash deferred tax benefit of 35,347, increase in prepaid expenses
of 43,956, decrease in income tax payable of 358,882, and offset by net income of 81,219, increase in accrued expenses of 188,828,
and increase in franchise tax payable of 26,132. 

For
the six months ended September 30, 2023, there was 593,088 of cash used in operating activities resulting from interest income earned
on investment held in Trust Account amounting to 1,240,083, non-cash deferred tax expense of 48,070, and decrease in income tax payable

increase in due to related parties of 110,000, and increase in franchise tax payable of 1,204. 

For
the year six months September 30, 2024, there was 38,375,986 of cash provided by investing activities resulting from the withdrawal
of an investment held in the Trust Account for payment to redeeming stockholders of 38,044,345, the withdrawal of an investment held
in the Trust Account amounting to 731,641, offset by the purchase of investment held in Trust Account amounting to 400,000. 

For
the six months ended September 30, 2023, there was 168,146 of cash used in investing activities resulting from the purchase of investment
held in Trust Account amounting to 675,000, offset by withdrawal of an investment held in the Trust Account amounting to 506,854. 

For
the six months ended September 30, 2024, there was 37,334,345 of cash used in financing activities resulting from the redemption of
common stock of 38,044,345 and repayments of working capital loans from our Sponsor amounting to 130,000, offset by the proceeds from
working capital and extension loans from our Sponsor amounting to 840,000. 

For
the six months ended September 30, 2023, there was 760,000 of cash provided by financing activities resulting from the proceeds from
working capital and extension loans from our Sponsor amounting to 760,000. 

In
addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with searching for a target business or consummating an intended initial
business combination, the initial stockholders, officers, directors or their affiliates may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds
as may be required. In the event that the initial business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held
outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts, but no proceeds from our trust account would be used for such repayment. Such
loans would be evidenced by promissory notes. The notes would either be paid upon consummation of our initial business combination, without
interest, or, at the lender s discretion, up to 600,000 of the notes may be converted upon consummation of our business combination
into private units at a price of 10.00 per unit. 

We
will have until 12 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering to consummate an initial Business Combination. However, if
we anticipate that it may not be able to consummate our initial Business Combination within 12 months, we may extend the period of time
to consummate a Business Combination up to three times, each by an additional three months (for a total of up to 21 months to complete
a Business Combination). Pursuant to the terms of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and the trust agreement to be
entered into between us and the trustee, in order to extend the time available for us to consummate our initial Business Combination,
our sponsor or its affiliates or designees, upon ten days advance notice prior to the applicable deadline, must deposit into the trust
account 575,000 0.10 per share) on or prior to the date of the applicable deadline, for each three month extension (or up to an aggregate
of 1,725,000, or 0.30 per share if the Company extends for the full nine months). On September 21, 2023, our stockholders approved
the amendment to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to extend the date by which we have to consummate a business combination
up to nine (9) times, each such extension for an additional one month period, from September 21, 2023 to June 21, 2024, and must deposit
into the trust account in the sum of 100,000 for each one month extended. On June 18, 2024, the Company s stockholders approved
a second amendment to the Company s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to extend the date by which the Company has
to consummate a business combination up to twelve (12) times, each such extension for an additional one month period, from June 21, 2024
to June 21, 2025, and must deposit into the trust account in the sum of 50,000 for each one month extended. Any such payments would
be made in the form of a loan. Any such loans will be non-interest bearing and payable upon the consummation of our initial Business
Combination. If we complete our initial Business Combination, we would either repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust
account released to us, or up to 1,725,000 of such loans may be convertible into private units at a price of 10.00 per unit at the
option of the lender. 

As
of September 30, 2024 and March 31, 2024, we had 2,501,000 and 1,791,000, respectively, of borrowings under the working capital and
extension loans. 

In
connection with our assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with Financial Accounting Standard Board s Accounting
Standards Update ASU 2014-15, Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going
Concern, management has determined that these conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
The management s plan in addressing this uncertainty is through the Working Capital Loans. In addition, if we are unable to complete
a Business Combination within the Combination Period by November 21, 2025, if not further extended, our board of directors would proceed
to commence a voluntary liquidation and thereby a formal dissolution of us. There is no assurance that our plans to consummate a Business
Combination will be successful within the Combination Period. As a result, management has determined that such condition raise substantial
doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The unaudited condensed financial statements does not include any adjustments
that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

26 

Critical
Accounting Estimates 

Use
of Estimates 

The
preparation of unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the
date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates. The Company does not have any critical accounting estimates. 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements 

In
December 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures ASU 2023-09 ), which modifies the rules on income tax disclosures to require entities to disclose (1) specific categories
in the rate reconciliation, (2) the income or loss from continuing operations before income tax expense or benefit (separated between
domestic and foreign) and (3) income tax expense or benefit from continuing operations (separated by federal, state and foreign). ASU 2023-09 also
requires entities to disclose their income tax payments to international, federal, state and local jurisdictions, among other changes.
The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted for annual financial statements
that have not yet been issued or made available for issuance. ASU 2023-09 should be applied on a prospective basis, but
retrospective application is permitted. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this new guidance on our unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 

Management
does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements, if currently adopted, would have a
material effect on our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements; Commitments and Contractual Obligations 

Registration
Rights 

Pursuant
to a registration rights agreement entered into on September 10, 2021, the holders of the founder shares, the private placement units
and private placement units that may be issued upon conversion of working capital loans will be entitled to registration rights pursuant
to a registration rights agreement to be signed prior to or on the closing date of this offering requiring us to register such securities
for resale. The holders of these securities are entitled to make up to three demands, excluding short form demands, that we register
such securities. In addition, the holders have certain piggy-back registration rights with respect to registration statements
filed subsequent to the completion of our initial business combination. We will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing
of any such registration statements. 

Underwriting
Agreement 

We
sold to the underwriters, 100, a Unit Purchase Option UPO to purchase 270,250 Units exercisable at 11.00 per Unit,
an aggregate exercise price of 2,972,750, commencing on the later of the first anniversary the effective date of the registration statement
related to the Initial Public Offering and the consummation of a Business Combination. The unit purchase option may be exercised for
cash or on a cashless basis, at the holder s option, and expires five years from the effective date of the registration statement
related to the Initial Public Offering. 

The
underwriters received a cash underwriting discount of 2 of the gross proceeds of the IPO, or 1,150,000, upon closing of the IPO. In
addition the underwriters are entitled to a deferred underwriting discount of 3.5 of the gross proceeds of the sale of Units in the
IPO, or 2,012,500, which is currently held in the trust account and would be payable upon the completion of the initial Business Combination
subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement.

3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

As
smaller reporting company, we are not required to make disclosures under this Item. 

ITEM
4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure
controls are procedures that are designed with the objective of ensuring that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed
under the Exchange Act, such as this Report, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time period specified in the
SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls are also designed with the objective of ensuring that such information is accumulated
and communicated to our management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management evaluated, with the participation of our current chief executive officer and
chief financial officer (our Certifying Officers ), the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September
30, 2024, pursuant to Rule 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, our Certifying Officers concluded that, as of
September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 

We
do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and
procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the
disclosure controls and procedures are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there
are resource constraints, and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure
controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all
our control deficiencies and instances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain
assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated
goals under all potential future conditions. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange
Act) during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting.
