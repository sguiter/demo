 Derivative and Financial Instruments Fair Value Measurements 
 The Company's contracts are non-exchange-traded and valued using prices provided by external sources. The Company uses quoted observable forward prices to value its energy-related commodity contracts, which includes long-term power commodity contracts and heat rate call option contracts. To the extent that observable forward prices are not available, the quoted prices reflect the average of the forward prices from the prior year, adjusted for inflation. As of September 30, 2024, contracts valued with prices provided by models and other valuation techniques make up of derivative assets and of derivative liabilities and other financial instruments.

 The fair value of each contract is discounted using a risk-free interest rate. In addition, a credit reserve is applied to reflect credit risk, which is, for interest rate swaps, calculated based on credit default swaps using the bilateral method. For commodities, to the extent that the Net Exposure under a specific master agreement is an asset, the Company uses the counterparty s default swap rate. If the Net Exposure under a specific master agreement is a liability, the Company uses a proxy of its own default swap rate. For interest rate swaps and commodities, the credit reserve is added to the discounted fair value to reflect the exit price that a market participant would be willing to receive to assume the liabilities or that a market participant would be willing to pay for the assets. As of September 30, 2024, the non-performance reserve was a million gain recorded primarily to total operating revenues in the consolidated statements of income. It is possible that future market prices could vary from those used in recording assets and liabilities and such variations could be material.

GenConn is a VIE for which the Company is not the primary beneficiary. The Company s pro-rata share of non-recourse debt held by unconsolidated affiliates was approximately 290 million as of September 30, 2024. This indebtedness may restrict the ability of these subsidiaries to issue dividends or distributions to the Company. 
 Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments 
 The Company has a variety of contractual obligations and other commercial commitments that represent prospective cash requirements in addition to the Company s capital expenditure programs, as disclosed in the Company s 2023 Form 10-K. 
 Acquisitions and Investments 
 The Company intends to acquire generation assets developed and constructed by CEG, as well as generation assets from third parties where the Company believes its knowledge of the market and operating expertise provides a competitive advantage, and to utilize such acquisitions as a means to grow its business. 
 Rosamond Central BESS Drop Down and Financing Activities On June 13, 2024, when the Rosamond Central BESS facility reached substantial completion, the Company paid 279 million to Clearway Renew as additional purchase price to complete its acquisition of the facility, which occurred on December 1, 2023. The additional purchase price consisted of 64 million that was funded by the Company from existing sources of liquidity and 215 million funded through contributions from third-party investors. Including the additional purchase price, the Company s total purchase price was 349 million, 80 million of which was funded by the Company with the remaining 269 million funded through contributions from third-party investors. Clearway Renew utilized the additional proceeds to repay the balance of 184 million on the loan previously issued to its consolidated subsidiary by Rosie Class B LLC and to redeem Rosie Class B LLC s entire equity investment in Rosie Central BESS of 28 million. The Company utilized proceeds from Clearway Renew, along with 39 million held previously in escrow and 56 million of the Company s additional purchase price that was contributed back by CEG, to repay the tax equity bridge loan, to make a distribution to the cash equity investor, to fund construction completion reserves and to pay associated fees. Additionally, on June 13, 2024, the outstanding construction loans were converted to a term loan. 
 Victory Pass and Arica Drop Down On May 1, 2024, when the Victory Pass and Arica solar and BESS facilities reached substantial completion, the Company paid 165 million to Clearway Renew as additional purchase price, in connection with the Company s acquisition of the Class A membership interests in VP-Arica TargetCo LLC on October 31, 2023, which was funded with existing sources of liquidity. Also on May 1, 2024, the cash equity investor contributed an additional 347 million, the tax equity investor contributed an additional 410 million and CEG contributed 52 million, which were utilized, along with 103 million held previously in escrow, to repay the cash equity bridge loan, to repay the tax equity bridge loan, to fund construction completion reserves and to pay associated fees. Prior to the repayment of the tax equity bridge loan, the Company borrowed an additional 62 million during 2024. 
 Cedar Creek Drop Down On April 16, 2024, the Company, through its indirect subsidiary, Cedar Creek Wind Holdco LLC, acquired Cedar Creek Holdco LLC, the indirect owner of Cedar Creek, a 160 MW wind facility that is located in Bingham County, Idaho, from Clearway Renew for cash consideration of 117 million. Cedar Creek Holdco LLC consolidates as primary beneficiary, Cedar Creek TE Holdco LLC, a tax equity fund that owns the Cedar Creek wind facility. Cedar Creek has a 25-year PPA with an investment-grade utility that commenced in March 2024. The acquisition was funded with existing sources of liquidity. Additionally, the Company assumed the facility s financing agreement, which included a construction loan that converted to a term loan at acquisition date along with a cash equity bridge loan and tax equity bridge loan that were both repaid at acquisition date.

Texas Solar Nova 2 Drop Down On March 15, 2024, the Company, through its indirect subsidiary, TSN1 TE Holdco LLC, acquired Texas Solar Nova 2, a 200 MW solar facility that is located in Kent County, Texas, from Clearway Renew for cash consideration of 112 million, 17 million of which was funded by the Company with the remaining 95 million funded through a contribution from the cash equity investor in Lighthouse Renewable Holdco 2 LLC, which is a partnership. Lighthouse Renewable Holdco 2 LLC indirectly consolidates as primary beneficiary, TSN1 TE Holdco LLC, a tax equity fund that owns Texas Solar Nova 1 and Texas Solar Nova 2. Texas Solar Nova 2 has an 18-year PPA with an investment-grade counterparty that commenced in February 2024. The Company s portion of the purchase price was funded with existing sources of liquidity. Additionally, the Company assumed the facility s financing agreement, which included a tax equity bridge loan that was repaid at acquisition date and a term loan. 
 Cash Dividends to Investors 
 The Company intends to use the amount of cash that it receives from its distributions from Clearway Energy LLC to pay quarterly dividends to the holders of its Class A common stock and Class C common stock. Clearway Energy LLC intends to distribute to its unit holders in the form of a quarterly distribution all of the CAFD that is generated each quarter, less reserves for the prudent conduct of the business. Dividends on t he Class A common stock and Class C common stock are subject to available capital, market conditions and compliance with associated laws, regulations and other contractual obligations. The Company expects that, based on current circumstances, comparable cash dividends will continue to be paid in the foreseeable future. 
 The following table lists the dividends paid on the Company s Class A common stock and Class C common stock during the nine months ended September 30, 2024: 
 Third Quarter 2024 Second Quarter 2024 First Quarter 2024 Dividends per Class A share 0.4171 0.4102 0.4033 Dividends per Class C share 0.4171 0.4102 0.4033

NOLs, Deferred Tax Assets and Uncertain Tax Position Implications, under ASC 740 
 As of December 31, 2023, the Company had a cumulative federal NOL carryforward balance of 353 million for financial statement purposes, none of which were subject to expiration. Additionally, as of December 31, 2023, the Company had a cumulative state NOL carryforward balance of 102 million for financial statement purposes, which will expire between 2024 and 2040 if unutilized. The Company does not anticipate material income tax payments through 2026. In addition, as of December 31, 2023, the Company had PTC and ITC carryforward balances totaling 21 million, which will expire between 2035 and 2043 if unutilized. 
 As of December 31, 2023, the Company had an interest disallowance carryforward of 75 million as a result of Internal Revenue Code 163(j). The disallowed interest deduction has an indefinite carryforward period and any limitations on the utilization of this carryforward have been factored into the Company s valuation allowance analysis. 
 The Company, after the utilization of various federal and state NOL carryforwards, paid 1 million in federal and state income taxes during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and does not expect to pay additional material federal or state income taxes for the remainder of the current year. The Company does not anticipate being subject to the corporate minimum tax on financial statement income as enacted by the recently passed the IRA, which is discussed in further detail below. 
 The IRA contains a number of revisions to the Internal Revenue Code, including a 15 corporate minimum income tax for certain taxpayers, a 1 excise tax on corporate stock repurchases in tax years beginning after December 31, 2022 and business tax credits and incentives for the development of clean energy facilities and the production of clean energy. The Company continues to analyze the potential impact of the IRA and monitor guidance to be issued by the United States Department of the Treasury, but it does not anticipate the corporate minimum tax will apply to it or that the IRA will otherwise have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 
 The Company is subject to examination by taxing authorities for income tax returns filed in the U.S. federal and various state jurisdictions. All tax returns filed by the Company for the year ended December 31, 2013 and forward remain subject to audit. As of September 30, 2024, the U.S. federal partnership returns of three of the Company s subsidiaries are under audit by the IRS. The IRS has issued proposed adjustments with respect to one of the subsidiaries under audit, which the Company believes that such proposed adjustments are without merit and would not impact the Company s tax liability or the tax liability of such subsidiary. The IRS has not yet issued any proposed adjustments with respect to the other two subsidiaries under audit. The Company believes that the ultimate resolution of each of these audits will not be material to the Company s financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. The Company believes that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. The outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty and if any issues addressed in tax audits of the Company are resolved in a manner inconsistent with its expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs. 
 The Company has no material uncertain tax benefits as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Fair Value of Derivative Instruments 
 The Company may enter into energy-related commodity contracts to mitigate variability in earnings due to fluctuations in spot market prices. In addition, in order to mitigate interest rate risk associated with the issuance of variable rate debt, the Company enters into interest rate swap agreements. 
 The tables below disclose the activities of non-exchange traded contracts accounted for at fair value in accordance with ASC 820. Specifically, these tables disaggregate realized and unrealized changes in fair value; disaggregate estimated fair values at September 30, 2024 , based on their level within the fair value hierarchy defined in ASC 820; and indicate the maturities of contracts at September 30, 2024 .

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The Company s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with GAAP requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance, as well as the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. The application of these policies necessarily involves judgments regarding future events, including the likelihood of success of particular facilities, legal and regulatory challenges and the fair value of certain assets and liabilities. These judgments, in and of themselves, could materially affect the financial statements and disclosures based on varying assumptions, which may be appropriate to use. In addition, the financial and operating environment may also have a significant effect, not only on the operation of the business, but on the results reported through the application of accounting measures used in preparing the financial statements and related disclosures, even if the nature of the accounting policies has not changed. 
 On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates these estimates, utilizing historic experience, consultation with experts and other methods the Company considers reasonable. Actual results may differ substantially from the Company s estimates. Any effects on the Company s business, financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the information that gives rise to the revision becomes known. 
 The Company identifies its most critical accounting policies as those that are the most pervasive and important to the portrayal of the Company s financial position and results of operations, and that require the most difficult, subjective and/or complex judgments by management regarding estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. The Company s critical accounting policies include income taxes and valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, accounting utilizing HLBV, acquisition accounting and determining the fair value of financial instruments.

ITEM 3 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 The Company is exposed to several market risks in its normal business activities. Market risk is the potential loss that may result from market changes associated with the Company s power generation or with an existing or forecasted financial or commodity transaction. The types of market risks the Company is exposed to are commodity price risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk. The following disclosures about market risk provide an update to, and should be read in conjunction with, Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, of the Company s 2023 Form 10-K. 
 Commodity Price Risk 
 Commodity price risks result from exposures to changes in spot prices, forward prices, volatilities and correlations between various commodities, such as electricity, natural gas and emissions credits. The Company manages the commodity price risk of certain of its merchant generation operations by entering into derivative or non-derivative instruments to hedge the variability in future cash flows from forecasted power sales. The portion of forecasted transactions hedged may vary based upon management's assessment of market, weather, operation and other factors. 
 Based on a sensitivity analysis using simplified assumptions, the impact of a 0.50 per MWh increase or decrease in power prices across the term of the long-term power commodity contracts would cause a change of approximately 6 million to the net value of the related derivatives as of September 30, 2024. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 The Company is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates through its issuance of variable rate debt. Exposures to interest rate fluctuations may be mitigated by entering into derivative instruments known as interest rate swaps, caps, collars and put or call options. These contracts reduce exposure to interest rate volatility and result in primarily fixed rate debt obligations when taking into account the combination of the variable rate debt and the interest rate derivative instrument. See Note 6 , Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities , for more information. 
 Most of the Company s subsidiaries enter into interest rate swaps intended to hedge the risks associated with interest rates on non-recourse facility-level debt. See Item 15 Note 10 , Long-term Debt , to the Company s audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023 included in the 2023 Form 10-K for more information about interest rate swaps of the Company s subsidiaries. 
 If all of the interest rate swaps had been discontinued on September 30, 2024 , the counterparties would have owed the Company 100 million. Based on the credit ratings of the counterparties, the Company believes its exposure to credit risk due to nonperformance by counterparties to its hedge contracts to be insignificant. 
 The Company has long-term debt instruments that subject it to the risk of loss associated with movements in market interest rates. As of September 30, 2024 , a change of 1 , or 100 basis points, in interest rates would result in an approximately 1 million change in market interest expense on a rolling twelve-month basis. 
 As of September 30, 2024 , the fair value of the Company s debt was 6.90 billion and the carrying value was 7.20 billion. The Company estimates that a decrease of 1 , or 100 basis points, in market interest rates would have increased the fair value of its long-term debt by approximately 328 million. 
 Liquidity Risk 
 Liquidity risk arises from the general funding needs of the Company s activities and in the management of the Company s assets and liabilities. 
 Counterparty Credit Risk 
 Credit risk relates to the risk of loss resulting from non-performance or non-payment by counterparties pursuant to the terms of their contractual obligations. The Company monitors and manages credit risk through credit policies that include: (i) an established credit approval process; and (ii) the use of credit mitigation measures such as prepayment arrangements or volumetric limits. Risks surrounding counterparty performance and credit could ultimately impact the amount and timing of expected cash flows. The Company seeks to mitigate counterparty risk by having a diversified portfolio of counterparties. See Note 5 , Fair Value of Financial Instruments , to the consolidated financial statements for more information about concentration of credit risk.

ITEM 4 Controls and Procedures 
 Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Based on this evaluation, the Company s principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

 Disclosure Pursuant to Item 1.01 of Form 8-K Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement 
 In connection with the Company entering into definitive agreements to acquire 100 of the Class A membership interests and 50 of the Class B membership interests in Pine Forest TE HoldCo LLC, as described in Part I, Item 2, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and the Results of Operations Significant Events Drop Down Transactions , on October 28, 2024, the Company, Clearway Energy LLC and CEG amended and restated the Amended and Restated Exchange Agreement, dated as of May 14, 2015, or the First Amended Exchange Agreement, by entering into a Second Amended and Restated Exchange Agreement, or the Second Amended Exchange Agreement, pursuant to which CEG (and certain permitted assignees and permitted transferees who acquire Class B units or Class D units of Clearway Energy LLC, or collectively with CEG, the CEG Unitholders) may from time to time cause Clearway Energy LLC to exchange their Class B units for shares of the Company s Class A common stock, or exchange their Class D units for shares of the Company s Class C common stock, on a one-for-one basis, subject to equitable adjustments for stock splits, stock dividends and reclassifications. 
 The Second Amended Exchange Agreement amends and restates the First Amended Exchange Agreement to, among other things, provide for an equitable cash settlement, to be paid by the exchanging CEG Unitholder to the Company on the applicable exchange date, for the value of certain assets of the Company that are not held by Clearway Energy LLC, including the membership interests of Pine Forest TE HoldCo LLC held by the Company. The amount of any such payment will be calculated based on the net present value of the projected discounted cash flow of such assets, using a discount rate equal to the weighted average cost of capital for such assets, and the daily volume-weighted average closing price of the Company s Class A common stock or Class C common stock, as applicable, for the trailing 30 trading days ending on the second trading day prior to the applicable exchange date. The intent of this amendment is to maintain parity in the value of the shares of Class A or Class C common stock received in return for the Class B or Class D units exchanged, to accommodate investments that may be held directly or indirectly by the Company but that are not held through Clearway Energy LLC. 
 The foregoing description of the Second Amended Exchange Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the Second Amended Exchange Agreement, which is filed herewith as Exhibit 10.2 and is incorporated herein by reference.

Such exchanging Clearway LLC Unitholder shall be treated for all purposes as having become the record holder of such shares of Class A Common Stock or Class C Common Stock, as applicable, on the Exchange Date.

(e) For the avoidance of doubt, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Clearway LLC Unitholder shall not be entitled to Exchange Clearway LLC Units to the extent the Corporation or Clearway LLC reasonably determines in good faith that such Exchange (i) would be prohibited by applicable law or regulation or (ii) would not be permitted under any other agreement 

6 with the Corporation or its subsidiaries to which such Clearway LLC Unitholder is then subject (including, without limitation, the Clearway LLC Operating Agreement) or any written policies of the Corporation or Clearway LLC relating to insider trading then applicable to such Clearway LLC Unitholder.

SECTION 2.2 Adjustment. (a) The Exchange Rate shall be adjusted accordingly if there is: (i) any subdivision (by any unit split, unit distribution, reclassification, reorganization, recapitalization or otherwise) or combination (by reverse unit split, reclassification, reorganization, recapitalization or otherwise) of the Class A Units, Class B Units, Class C Units or Class D Units that is not accompanied by an identical subdivision or combination of the Class A Common Stock, Class B Common Stock, Class C Common Stock or Class D Common Stock; (ii) any subdivision (by any stock split, stock dividend or distribution, reclassification, reorganization, recapitalization or otherwise) or combination (by reverse stock split, reclassification, reorganization, recapitalization or otherwise) of the Class A Common Stock or Class C Common Stock that is not accompanied by an identical subdivision or combination of the Class A Units or Class B Units, or the Class C Units or Class D Units; (iii) other than in connection with a Class A Common Stock Sale or a Class C Common Stock Sale, (A) any issuance of shares of (x) Class A Common Stock or Class C Common Stock by the Corporation or (y) Class A Units or Class C Units to the Corporation that is not accompanied by (B) the issuance of an identical number of (x) Class A Units or Class C Units to the Corporation (in the case of clause (iii)(A)(x)) or (y) shares of Class A Common Stock or Class C Common Stock (in the case of clause (iii)(A)(y)), as applicable; or (iv) (A) any issuance of (x) shares of Class B Common Stock or Class D Common Stock by the Corporation or (y) Class B Units or Class D Units to CEG or its Permitted Transferees that is not accompanied by (B) the issuance of an identical number of (x) Class B Units or Class D Units, as applicable to CEG or to its Permitted Transferees (in the case of clause (iv)(A)(x)) or (y) shares of Class B Common Stock or Class D Common Stock to CEG or its Permitted Transferees (in the case of clause (iv)(A)(y)). (b) If there is (i) any reclassification, reorganization, recapitalization or other similar transaction in which the Class A Common Stock or the Class C Common Stock is converted or changed into another security, securities or other property or (ii) any subdivision (by any split, distribution or dividend, reclassification, reorganization, recapitalization or otherwise) or combination (by reverse split, reclassification, recapitalization or otherwise) of such security, securities or other property that occurs after the effective time of such reclassification, reorganization, recapitalization or other similar transaction, then upon any subsequent Exchange, an exchanging Clearway LLC Unitholder shall be entitled to receive the amount of such security, securities or other property that such exchanging Clearway LLC Unitholder would have received if such Exchange had occurred immediately prior to the effective date of such reclassification, reorganization, recapitalization or other similar transaction, taking into account any adjustment as a result of any such subdivision (by any split, distribution or dividend, reclassification, reorganization, recapitalization or otherwise) or combination (by reverse split, reclassification, recapitalization or otherwise) of such security, securities or other property that occurs after the effective time of such reclassification, reorganization, recapitalization or other similar transaction. For the avoidance of doubt, if there is any reclassification, reorganization, recapitalization or other similar transaction in which the Class A Common Stock or Class C Common Stock is converted or changed into another security, securities or other property, this Section 2.2 shall continue to be applicable, mutatis mutandis, with respect to such security or other property.

This Agreement shall apply to, mutatis mutandis, and all references to Class A Units and Class B Units shall be deemed to include, any security, securities or other property of Clearway LLC which may be issued in respect of, in exchange for or in substitution of Class A Units, Class B Units, Class C Units or Class D Units, as applicable, by reason of any distribution or dividend, split, reverse split, combination, reclassification, reorganization, recapitalization, merger, exchange (other than an Exchange) or other transaction. SECTION 2.3 Class A Common Stock and Class C Common Stock to be Issued. (a) The Corporation covenants and agrees to deliver shares of Class A Common Stock and Class C Common Stock, as applicable, that have been registered under the Securities Act with respect to any Exchange to the extent that a registration statement is effective and available for such shares. In the event that any Exchange in accordance with this Agreement is to be effected at a time when any required registration has not become effective or otherwise is unavailable, upon the request and with the reasonable cooperation of the Clearway LLC Unitholder requesting the Exchange, the Corporation shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to promptly facilitate such Exchange pursuant to any reasonably available exemption from such registration requirements. The Corporation shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to list the Class A Common Stock or the Class C Common Stock, as applicable, required to be delivered upon Exchange prior to such delivery upon each national securities exchange or inter-dealer quotation system upon which the outstanding Class A Common Stock or Class C Common Stock, as applicable may be listed or traded at the time of such delivery. (b) The Corporation shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued Class A Common Stock and Class C Common Stock, solely for the purpose of issuance upon an Exchange, such number of shares of Class A Common Stock or Class C Common Stock, as shall be deliverable upon any such Exchange; provided that nothing contained herein shall be construed to preclude Clearway LLC from satisfying its obligations in respect of the Exchange of Clearway LLC Units by delivery of Class A Common Stock or Class C Common Stock which is held in the treasury of the Corporation or Clearway LLC or any of their subsidiaries or by delivery of purchased shares of Class A Common Stock or Class C Common Stock (which may or may not be held in the treasury of the Corporation or any subsidiary thereof). (c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Corporation and Clearway LLC will take all such steps as may be required to cause to qualify for exemption under Rule 16b-3 (d) or (e), as applicable, under the Exchange Act, and be exempt for purposes of Section 16(b) under the Exchange Act, any acquisitions or dispositions of Equity Securities of the Corporation (including derivative securities with respect thereto) and any securities which may be deemed to be Equity Securities or derivative securities of the Corporation for such purposes that result from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, by each director or officer of the Corporation who may reasonably be expected to be subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Corporation upon the registration of any class of Equity Security of the Corporation pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act (with the authorizing resolutions specifying the name of each such officer or director whose acquisition or disposition of securities is to be exempted and the number of securities that may be acquired and disposed of by each such person pursuant to this Agreement). 

8 (d) If any Takeover Law (as defined below) or other similar law or regulation becomes or is deemed to become applicable to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, the Corporation or Clearway LLC shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to render such law or regulation inapplicable to all of the foregoing. (e) Each of the Corporation and Clearway LLC covenants that all Class A Common Stock and Class C Common Stock issued upon an Exchange will, upon issuance, be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable, will pass to the applicable exchanging Clearway LLC Unitholder free and clear of any liens, security interests and other encumbrances other than any such liens, security interests or other encumbrances imposed by such exchanging Clearway LLC Unitholder and will not be subject to any preemptive right of stockholders of the Corporation or to any right of first refusal or other right in favor of any Person. (f) No Exchange shall impair the right of the exchanging Clearway LLC Unitholder to receive any distributions payable on the Clearway LLC Units so exchanged in respect of a record date that occurs prior to the Exchange Date for such Exchange. For the avoidance of doubt, no exchanging Clearway LLC Unitholder shall be entitled to receive, in respect of a single record date, distributions or dividends both on Clearway LLC Units exchanged by such holder and on Class A Common Stock received by such holder in such Exchange.

(a) If the Corporation or Clearway LLC shall be required to withhold any amounts by reason of any federal, state, local or foreign tax rules or regulations in respect of any Exchange, the Corporation or Clearway LLC, as the case may be, shall be entitled to take such action as it deems appropriate in order to ensure compliance with such withholding requirements, including, without limitation, at its option withholding shares of Class A Common Stock or Class C Common Stock with a fair market value equal to the minimum amount of any taxes which the Corporation or Clearway LLC, as the case may be, may be required to withhold with respect to such Exchange. To the extent that amounts (or property) are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority, such withheld amounts (or property) shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid (or delivered) to the appropriate Clearway LLC Unitholder. (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, each of Clearway LLC and the Corporation may, at its own discretion, require as a condition to the effectiveness of an Exchange that an exchanging Clearway LLC Unitholder deliver to Clearway LLC or the Corporation, as the case may be, a certification of non-foreign status in accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.1445- 2(b). In the event Clearway LLC or the Corporation has required delivery of such certification but an exchanging Clearway LLC Unitholder is unable to do so, Clearway LLC shall nevertheless deliver or cause to be delivered to the exchanging Clearway LLC Unitholder the Class A Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.1 of this Agreement, but subject to potential withholding as provided in Section 2.4(a).

ARTICLE III SECTION 3.1 Class A Common Stock and Class C Common Stock Sale.

Alternatively, the Corporation may purchase Class B Units with the cash proceeds of the sale of Class A Common Stock, or Class D Units with the cash proceeds of the sale of Class C Common Stock, directly from CEG (in which case the corresponding Class B Common Stock or Class D Common Stock held by CEG would be surrendered and cancelled), and such Class B Units or the Class D Units purchased by the Corporation would then immediately convert to Class A Units or Class C Units, as applicable. Upon the receipt of the shares of Class B Common Stock or Class D Common Stock specified in clause (ii) of this Section 3.1(a), the Corporation shall cause such shares to be cancelled. To the extent the Class B Common Stock or Class D Common Stock is settled through the facilities of the DTC, the subject Clearway LLC Unitholder(s) will use their commercially reasonable efforts to deliver the shares of Class B Common Stock or Class D Common Stock deliverable to the Corporation in a Clearway LLC Redemption, through the facilities of the DTC, to the account of the participant of the DTC designated by the Corporation. The purchase price to be paid to a Clearway LLC Unitholder for Clearway LLC Units purchased from such Clearway LLC Unitholder pursuant to this Section 3.1(a) shall be determined by applying an adjustment that takes into account External Asset Value in a manner consistent with Section 2.5. (b) Clearway LLC, the Corporation and the participating Clearway LLC Unitholder(s) shall bear their own expenses in connection with the consummation of any Class A Common Stock Sale, except that Clearway LLC shall bear any transfer taxes, stamp taxes or duties, or 

10 other similar taxes in connection with, or arising by reason of, any Class A Common Stock Sale or Class C Common Stock Sale. SECTION 3.2 Authorization and Issuance of Additional Units. If the Corporation issues another class or series of Equity Securities (other than the Class A Common Stock, the Class B Common Stock, the Class C Common Stock or the Class D Common Stock), Clearway LLC shall authorize and issue in accordance with Section 3.2(d) of the Clearway LLC Operating Agreement, and the Corporation will use the net proceeds therefrom to purchase, an equal number of membership interests with designations, preferences and other rights and terms that are substantially the same as those of the Corporation s newly-issued Equity Securities. In the event the Corporation elects to redeem any shares of its Class A Common Stock, Class B Common Stock, Class C Common Stock, Class D Common Stock or any other class or series of its Equity Securities for cash, Clearway LLC will, immediately prior to such redemption, redeem an equal number of Class A Units, Class B Units, Class C Units, Class D Units, as applicable, or any other units of the corresponding classes or series, upon the same terms and for the same price as the shares of Class A Common Stock, Class B Common Stock, Class C Common Stock, Class D Common Stock or other Equity Securities of the Corporation so redeemed.
