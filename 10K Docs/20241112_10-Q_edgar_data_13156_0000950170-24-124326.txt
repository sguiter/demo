Legal proceedings. In the ordinary course of conducting our business, we are, from time to time, involved in various legal proceedings, administrative proceedings, regulatory government investigations and other matters, including those in which we are a plaintiff or defendant, that are complex in nature and have outcomes that are difficult to predict. See "Litigation Related to the Merger" in Item 1 of Part II of this Quarterly Report. An unexpected adverse judgment in any pending litigation could cause a material impact on our business operations, intellectual property, results of operations or financial position. Unless otherwise expressly stated, we believe costs associated with litigation will not have a material impact on our financial position or liquidity but may be material to the results of operations in any given period and, accordingly, provision for loss has been reflected in the accompanying financial statements related to those matters. Intellectual property agreements. From time to time, the Company purchases intellectual property from third-parties and the Company, in turn, utilizes that intellectual property in certain games licensed to clients. In these purchase agreements, the Company may agree to pay the seller of the intellectual property a fee, if and when, the Company receives revenue from games containing the intellectual property.

The decrease in the ETR for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is mainly attributable to the increase in the forecasted pre-tax book loss as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 .

Revenue 
 Recurring core revenue increased 1,204,673, or 30 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in the prior year. This growth was primarily driven by favorable revenue from our EZ Baccarat distribution arrangement, which began in September 2023, along with the continued success of our side bets and progressive products. Royalties netted against gross core revenue increased 615,084 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in the prior year. This increase was attributable to royalties paid on our EZ Baccarat revenues. Perpetual license sales of our progressive gaming systems reached 705,000, representing a 54 percent increase for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in the prior year. Gross digital revenues of 3,513,194, increased 968,367, or 38 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in the prior year. This favorable growth reflects the ongoing expansion of digital content into new markets and the continued success of our competitive branded products, particularly the well-known 21+3. Net of royalties, digital revenues increased to 2,516,738, representing growth of 39 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in the prior year. 
 19 

Costs and Expenses 
 Cost of ancillary products and assembled component expense increased 155,024, or 83 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in the prior year. This increase reflects the component costs associated with the rise in perpetual license sales of our progressive gaming systems compared to the same period in the prior year. 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 2,074,390, or 50 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in the prior year. This change was due to expenses associated with special projects of 2,244,885, notably legal expenses incurred related to the acquisition by Evolution and to a lesser extent driven by higher internal labor and related expenses (base salary, commissions, payroll-related taxes, bonus accrual and travel), increased repair and maintenance costs of leased machines, and increased information technology costs. Without the costs associated with the acquisition by Evolution and excluding the related transaction fees of 2,244,885, selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased 170,495, or 4 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in the prior year. 
 Research and development expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024, were 261,493 compared to 226,405 for the comparable prior-year period, representing an increase of 35,088, or 15 . This increase was driven by higher payroll costs due to increased headcount, employee bonuses, and the ongoing development of internal software placed in service. 
 Depreciation and amortization increased 133,499, or 24 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in the prior year. This increase was primarily driven by depreciation expense associated with incremental placements of assets deployed at client locations. 
 Stock-based compensation expenses decreased 10 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in the prior year. The decrease was due primarily to a change in the level and the composition of fees paid to members of our Board of Directors in 2024 and lower stock-based compensation for officers and consultants. 
 Interest expense remained relatively flat, with a 0 change for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in the prior year. Interest income increased 2 compared to the prior year period, benefitting from higher cash balances and rising interest rates. 
 
 Income tax provision was 7,197 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to income tax provision of 41,642 for the comparable prior-year period. The decrease in expense is primarily driven by the increase in loss before provision for income taxes. 
 
 Primarily as a result of the factors described above, we had a net loss of 2,197,914 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to a net loss of approximately 1,455,158 for the same period in the prior year. Without the professional fees, acquisition costs and other fees associated with the acquisition by Evolution, and excluding the related transactions fees of 2,244,885 from selling, general, and administrative expenses, we would have net income of 46,971, representing a 1,502,129 or 103 increase for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in the prior year.

Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA includes adjustments to net income to exclude interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, foreign currency exchange (gain) loss and severance and other expenses related to litigation. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of performance defined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, Adjusted EBITDA is used by management to evaluate our operating performance. Management believes that disclosure of the Adjusted EBITDA metric offers investors, regulators and other stakeholders a view of our operations in the same manner management evaluates our performance. When combined with U.S. GAAP results, management believes Adjusted EBITDA provides a comprehensive understanding of our financial results. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income or to net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of operating results or of liquidity. It may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies, and it excludes financial information that some may consider important in evaluating our performance. A reconciliation of U.S. GAAP net income to Adjusted EBITDA is as follows:

 Liquidity and capital resources . We have generally been able to fund our continuing operations, our investments, and the interest expense and principal amortization under our existing borrowings through cash flow from operations. We may require additional capital to undertake acquisitions or to repay in full our indebtedness. Our ability to access capital for these activities will depend on conditions in the capital markets and investors perceptions of our business prospects and such conditions and perceptions may not always favor us. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had total current assets of 24,831,519 and total assets of 41,967,121. As of December 31, 2023, we had total current assets of 22,156,035 and total assets of 40,475,800. The increase in current assets as of September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023 was due to the increased cash and cash equivalents driven by cash provided from operating activities and increased accounts receivable. The increase in total assets as of September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023 was primarily due to the increase of current assets noted above and offset by a decrease in other intangible assets and operating lease right-of-use assets as a result of amortization in the 2024 period. 
 Our total current liabilities as of September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023 increased to 7,065,564 from 4,875,967. This increase was primarily due to an increase in accounts payable related to professional fees in connection with the acquisition by Evolution. 
 Based on our current forecast of operations, we believe we will have sufficient liquidity to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months and to meet the obligations under our financing arrangements as they come due. 
 We continue to file applications for new or enhanced licenses in several jurisdictions, which may result in significant future legal and regulatory expenses. A significant increase in such expenses may require us to postpone growth initiatives or investments in personnel, assemblies in process and research and development of our products. It is our intention to continue such initiatives and investments. 
 23 

However, to the extent we are not able to achieve our growth objectives or raise additional capital, we will need to evaluate the reduction of operating expenses. 
 Our operating activities provided cash of 3,027,456 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 399,450 provided for the comparable prior year period. This change is attributable to a favorable variance of 3,244,234 in use of assets and liabilities that relate to operations. Additionally, depreciation and amortization increased 450,213 related to increased capitalization of intangible assets and offset by a 175,707 decline in stock-based compensation from the vesting of stock options and a 141,408 decrease in bad debt expense. 
 Investing activities used cash of 1,181,403 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to cash used of 1,290,340 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease in cash used was primarily due to the increase in the transfer of title of assets deployed at client locations to perpetual license customers offset by the increase of cash used for the acquisition of assets deployed at client locations. 
 Cash used in financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 648,038. This compares to 1,409,803 cash used by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in cash used was due to the absence of principal payments on our borrowings based on the "Excess Cash Flow" calculation as defined by the terms in the Fortress Credit Agreement (Note 6), in the 2024 period. 
 Critical accounting policies and estimates. Our significant accounting policies and estimates are described in our 2023 Form 10-K. There have been no material changes to those policies. 
 Off-balance sheet arrangements. As of September 30, 2024, there were no off-balance sheet arrangements. 
 Recently issued accounting pronouncements. We do not expect the adoption of recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a significant impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flow.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITAT IVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 A smaller reporting company is not required to provide the information required by this Item. 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Disclosure controls and procedures 
 Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 We carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. This evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
 Changes in internal control over financial reporting 
 No change in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during our last fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Limitations on the effectiveness of control and procedures and internal controls 
 Our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will necessarily prevent all fraud and material error. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving our objectives, and our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at that reasonable assurance level. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the internal control. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

PART II OTHE R INFORMATION 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 We have been named in and have brought lawsuits in the normal course of business. See Note 7 above and Note 10 to our audited financial statements included in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Financial Information in our 2023 10-K. 
 Litigation Related to the Merger 
 Beginning on September 11, 2024, seven purported stockholders of Galaxy have sent demands to the Company and two of which included draft complaints. On October 18, 2024, two purported stockholders filed complaints, relating to the Merger Agreement disclosures, captioned Finger v. Galaxy Gaming, Inc., et al. , Index No. 655536/2024 (N.Y. Sup. Ct.) and Coffman v. Galaxy Gaming, Inc., et al. , Index No. 655530/2024 (N.Y. Sup. Ct.). The demand letters and complaints allege that the definitive proxy statement on Schedule 14A filed by the Company on September 26, 2024 is materially incomplete and misleading because it omitted certain information related to the Merger (as defined herein), including but not limited to information about the Company s financial projections and analyses performed by Galaxy s financial advisor, Macquarie Capital (USA) Inc. While we believe that the disclosures set forth in the proxy statement comply fully with all applicable law and deny the allegations in the demand letters and the complaints, in order to moot plaintiffs disclosure claims, avoid nuisance and possible expense and business delays, and provide additional information to our stockholders, on November 1, 2024, we determined to voluntarily supplement certain disclosures in the proxy statement related to the purported stockholders claims. 
 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 In addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including the risk factors set forth below, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties set forth in our other filings with the SEC, including in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 The announcement and pendency of our agreement to be acquired by Parent may have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and our stock price, and may result in the loss of employees, customers, suppliers, and other business partners. 
 
 On July 18, 2024, we entered into the Merger Agreement. We are subject to risks in connection with the announcement and pendency of the Merger, regardless of whether the Merger is completed, including, but not limited to, the following: 
 
 market reaction to the announcement of the Merger, which could adversely impact investor confidence in us; 

changes in our business, operations, financial position, and prospects; 

market assessments of the likelihood that the Merger will be consummated; 

any delay in the expected timeframe of the Merger; 

the amount of cash offered per share will not be increased to account for positive changes in our business, assets, liabilities, prospects, outlook, financial condition, or results of operations during the pendency of the Merger, including any successful execution of our current strategy as an independent company or in the event of any change in the market price of, analyst estimates of, or projections relating to, our common stock; 

potential adverse effects on our relationships with our current customers, suppliers and other business partners, or those with which we are seeking to establish business relationships, due to uncertainties about the Merger; 

we have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant costs, expenses and fees for professional services and other transaction costs in connection with the Merger, and many of these fees and costs are payable by us regardless of whether the Merger is consummated; 

potential adverse effects on our ability to attract, recruit, retain, and motivate current and prospective employees who may be uncertain about their future roles and relationships with us following the completion of the Merger, and the possibility that our employees could lose productivity as a result of uncertainty regarding their employment following the Merger; 

the pendency and outcome of the legal proceedings that have been or may be instituted against us, our directors, executive officers and others relating to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; 

the possibility of disruption to our business, including increased costs and diversion of management time and resources that could otherwise have been devoted to other opportunities that may have been beneficial to us; 

26 

in certain instances, the Merger Agreement requires us to pay a termination fee to Parent, which could require us to use available cash that would have otherwise been available for general corporate purposes; and 

other developments beyond our control, including, but not limited to, changes in domestic or global economic conditions that may affect the timing or success of the Merger. 

The adverse effects of the pendency of the Merger could be exacerbated by any delays in completion of the Merger or termination of the Merger Agreement. 
 
 While the Merger is pending, we are subject to contractual restrictions that could harm our business, operating results and our stock price. 
 
 The Merger Agreement includes restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to the completion of the Merger, generally requiring us to conduct our businesses in all material respects in the ordinary course of business, to use reasonable best efforts to cooperate in seeking regulatory approvals, and to not engage in certain specified activities without Parent s prior consent. We may find that these and other obligations in the Merger Agreement may delay or prevent us from or limit our ability to respond effectively to competitive pressures, industry developments and future business opportunities that may arise during such period, even if our management and board of directors think they may be advisable. These restrictions could adversely impact our business, operating results and our stock price and our perceived acquisition value, regardless of whether the Merger is completed. 
 
 The failure to complete the Merger within the expected timeframe or at all, may adversely affect our business and our stock price. 
 
 The consummation of the Merger is subject to a number of closing conditions, including, among other things, approval by at least a majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of the Company s common stock of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, and the receipt of certain gaming regulatory approvals. There can be no assurance that these conditions to the completion of the Merger will be satisfied, or that the Merger will be completed on the proposed terms, within the expected timeframe or at all. If the Merger is not completed, we may be subject to negative publicity or be negatively perceived by the investment or business communities and our stock price could fall to the extent that our current stock price reflects an assumption that the Merger will be completed. Furthermore, if the Merger is not completed, regardless of the reason, we may suffer other consequences that could adversely affect our business and results of our operations. 
 
 The Merger Agreement with Parent limits our ability to pursue alternative transactions which could deter a third party from proposing an alternative transaction. 
 
 The Merger Agreement contains provisions that, subject to certain exceptions, limit our ability to initiate, solicit, or knowingly facilitate, (including by way of furnishing non-public information) the submission of any inquiries, regarding, or the making of any inquiry, proposal or offer that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, a Takeover Proposal (as defined in the Merger Agreement), or take certain other restricted actions in connection therewith. It is possible that these or other provisions in the Merger Agreement might discourage a potential competing acquirer that might have an interest in acquiring all or a significant part of our outstanding common stock from considering or proposing an acquisition or might result in a potential competing acquirer proposing to pay a lower per share price to acquire our common stock than it might otherwise have proposed to pay. 
 
 We and our directors may be subject to litigation challenging the Merger, and an unfavorable judgment or ruling in any such lawsuits could prevent or delay the consummation of the Merger and/or result in substantial costs. 
 Beginning on September 11, 2024, seven purported stockholders of Galaxy have sent demands to the Company, two of which included draft complaints. On October 18, 2024, two purported stockholders filed complaints relating to the Merger Agreement disclosures, captioned Finger v. Galaxy Gaming, Inc., et al. , Index No. 655536/2024 (N.Y. Sup. Ct.) and Coffman v. Galaxy Gaming, Inc., et al. , Index No. 655530/2024 (N.Y. Sup. Ct.). The demand letters and complaints allege that the definitive proxy statement on Schedule 14A filed by the Company on September 26, 2024, is materially incomplete and misleading because it omitted certain information related to the Merger (as defined herein), including but not limited to information about the Company s financial projections and analyses performed by Galaxy s financial advisor, Macquarie Capital (USA) Inc. 
 Additional lawsuits and demand letters arising out of the Merger may also be filed or received in the future. The outcome of any such demands and complaints and any litigation ensuing from such demands and complaints cannot be assured, including the amount of fees and costs associated with defending these claims or any other liabilities that may be incurred in connection therewith. Whether or not any plaintiff s claim is successful, this type of litigation can result in significant costs and divert our attention and resources from the Merger and ongoing business activities, which could adversely affect our operations. In addition, if dismissals are not obtained or a settlement is not reached, these lawsuits could prevent or delay completion of the Merger.
