 The accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the SEC's regulations for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and notes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. The following notes should be read in conjunction with the accounting policies and other disclosures as set forth in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in the Company's 2023 Form 10-K. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year. 
 In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements contain all material adjustments consisting of normal and recurring accruals necessary to present fairly the Company's consolidated financial position as of September 30, 2024, and the results of operations, comprehensive (loss)/income, cash flows and stockholders' equity for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 The Company identified an error in the previously issued condensed consolidated financial statements for the period ended September 30, 2023 related to the presentation of cash flows associated with certain borrowings and repayments related to certain credit facilities. The statement of cash flows for the period ended September 30, 2023 has been adjusted to present on a gross basis the certain borrowings from credit facilities of billion and the related repayments of billion. The change had no impact to the total cash used by financing activities for the period ended September 30, 2023.

 Derivative Fair Value Measurements 
 The Company's contracts consist of non-exchange traded contracts valued using prices provided by external sources and exchange-traded contracts with readily available quoted market prices. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2023 and as of September 30, 2024, the fair value of non-exchange traded contracts were primarily based on consensus pricing provided by independent pricing services. The pricing data was compiled from market makers with longer dated tenors as compared to broker quotes, enhancing reliability and increasing transparency. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company valued derivatives based on price quotes from brokers in active markets who regularly facilitate those transactions. The remainder of the assets and liabilities represent contracts for which external sources or observable market quotes are not available. These contracts are valued based on various valuation techniques including, but not limited to, internal models based on a fundamental analysis of the market and extrapolation of the observable market data with similar characteristics. As of September 30, 2024, contracts valued with prices provided by models and other valuation techniques made up of derivative assets and of derivative liabilities. 
 NRG's significant positions classified as Level 3 include physical and financial natural gas, power, capacity contracts and RECs executed in illiquid markets, FTRs and the Consumer Financing Program. The significant unobservable inputs used in developing fair value include illiquid natural gas and power location pricing, which is derived as a basis to liquid locations. The basis spread is based on observable market data when available or derived from historic prices and forward market prices from similar observable markets when not available. Forward capacity prices are based on market information, forecasted future electricity demand and supply, past auctions and internally developed pricing models. REC prices are based on market information and internally developed pricing models. For FTRs, NRG uses the most recent auction prices to derive the fair value. The Consumer Financing Program derivatives are valued using a discounted cash flow model, with inputs consisting of available market data, such as market yield discount rates, as well as unobservable internally derived assumptions, such as collateral prepayment rates, collateral default rates and credit loss rates.

The fair value of each contract is discounted using a risk-free interest rate. In addition, the Company applies a credit reserve to reflect credit risk, which is calculated based on published default probabilities. As of September 30, 2024, the credit reserve resulted in a million decrease primarily within cost of operations. As of December 31, 2023, the credit reserve resulted in a million decrease primarily within cost of operations. 
 Concentration of Credit Risk 
 In addition to the credit risk discussion as disclosed in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , to the Company's 2023 Form 10-K, the following is a discussion of the concentration of credit risk for the Company's contractual obligations. Credit risk relates to the risk of loss resulting from non-performance or non-payment by counterparties pursuant to the terms of their contractual obligations. NRG is exposed to counterparty credit risk through various activities including wholesale sales, fuel purchases and retail supply arrangements, as well as retail customer credit risk through its retail load activities. 
 Counterparty Credit Risk 
 The Company's counterparty credit risk policies are disclosed in its 2023 Form 10-K. As of September 30, 2024, counterparty credit exposure, excluding credit exposure from RTOs, ISOs, registered commodity exchanges and certain long-term agreements, was billion and NRG held collateral (cash and letters of credit) against those positions of million, resulting in a net exposure of billion. NRG periodically receives collateral from counterparties in excess of their exposure. Collateral amounts shown include such excess while net exposure shown excludes excess collateral received. Approximately of the Company's exposure before collateral is expected to roll off by the end of 2025. Counterparty credit exposure is valued through observable market quotes and discounted at a risk free interest rate.

million for the next . 
 Retail Customer Credit Risk 
 The Company is exposed to retail credit risk through the Company's retail electricity and gas providers as well as through Vivint Smart Home, which serve both Home and Business customers. Retail credit risk results in losses when a customer fails to pay for services rendered. The losses may result from both non-payment of customer accounts receivable and the loss of in-the-money forward value. The Company manages retail credit risk by using established credit policies, which include monitoring of the portfolio and the use of credit mitigation measures such as deposits or prepayment arrangements. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company's retail customer credit exposure to Home and Business customers was diversified across many customers and various industries, as well as government entities. Current economic conditions may affect the Company s customers ability to pay their bills in a timely manner or at all, which could increase customer delinquencies and may lead to an increase in credit losses.

 million extending through 2029 to hedge the floating rate of the Term Loans. Additionally, as of September 30, 2024, the Company had billion of interest rate swaps extending through 2027 to hedge the floating rate of the Vivint Term Loans (as defined in Note 7, Long-term Debt and Finance Leases ). In November 2024, in connection with the repayment of the Vivint Term Loans and the increase of the Term Loans, the Company decreased its interest rate swap notional value from billion to million. 
 Foreign Exchange Contracts 
 NRG is exposed to changes in foreign currency primarily associated with the purchase of U.S. dollar denominated natural gas for its Canadian business. To manage the Company's foreign exchange risk, NRG entered into foreign exchange contracts. As of September 30, 2024, NRG had foreign exchange contracts extending through 2028. The Company marks these derivatives to market through the consolidated statement of operations.

 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the million unrealized loss from open economic hedge positions was primarily the result of a decrease in the value of forward positions as a result of decreases in power prices. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the million unrealized loss from open economic hedge positions was primarily the result of a decrease in the value of forward positions as a result of decreases in natural gas and power prices in the East and West. 
 Credit Risk Related Contingent Features 
 Certain of the Company's trading agreements contain provisions that entitle the counterparty to demand that the Company post additional collateral if the counterparty determines that there has been deterioration in the Company's credit quality, generally termed adequate assurance under the agreements, or require the Company to post additional collateral if there were a downgrade in the Company's credit rating. The collateral potentially required for all contracts with adequate assurance clauses that are in a net liability position as of September 30, 2024 was million. The Company is also party to certain marginable agreements under which it has net liability position, but the counterparty has not called for the collateral due, which was approximately million as of September 30, 2024. In the event of a downgrade in the Company's credit rating and if called for by the counterparty, million of additional collateral would be required for all contracts with credit rating contingent features as of September 30, 2024.

On September 9, 2019, Midwest Generation filed a Motion to Reconsider numerous issues, which the court granted in part and denied in part on February 6, 2020. In 2023, the IPCB held hearings regarding the appropriate relief. Midwest Generation has been working with the Illinois EPA to address the groundwater issues since 2010. 
 Consumer Lawsuits 
 Similar to other energy service companies ESCOs operating in the industry, from time-to-time, the Company and/or its subsidiaries may be subject to consumer lawsuits in various jurisdictions where they sell natural gas and electricity. 
 Variable Price Case 
 Mirkin v. XOOM Energy (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 2019) XOOM Energy is a defendant in a putative class action lawsuit pending in New York, alleging that XOOM Energy promised that consumers would pay the same or less than they would have paid if they stayed with their default utility or previous energy supplier. The Court denied XOOM's motion for summary judgment and granted class certification. The Second Circuit denied XOOM's request to appeal the class certification grants. XOOM prevailed in its challenge to Mirkin's expert reports. The Court granted XOOM's motion to exclude both reports on damages. As a result, Mirkin has no method to establish damages for its class. The Court asked for further briefing on whether class certification can stand in light of the recent ruling. This matter was known and accrued for at the time of the XOOM acquisition. 
 Telephone Consumer Protection Act ("TCPA") Cases In the cases set forth below, referred to as the TCPA Cases, such actions involve consumers alleging violations of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, as amended, by receiving calls, texts or voicemails without consent in violation of the federal Telemarketing Sales Rule, and/or state counterpart legislation. The underlying claims of each case are similar. The Company denies the allegations asserted by plaintiffs and intends to vigorously defend these matters. These matters were known and accrued for at the time of the Direct Energy acquisition. 
 There are putative class actions pending against Direct Energy: (1) Holly Newman v. Direct Energy, LP (D. Md Sept 2021) - Direct Energy filed its Motion to Dismiss asserting the ruling in the Brittany Burk v. Direct Energy (S.D. Tex. Feb 2019) preempts the Plaintiff's ability to file suit based on the same facts. The Court denied Direct Energy's motion stating the Court does not have the benefit of all of the facts that were in front of the Burk court to issue a similar ruling. On April 12, 2023, the Court granted Direct Energy s Motion to Transfer Venue, moving to the case to the Southern District of Texas. The parties are proceeding with written discovery; and (2) Matthew Dickson v. Direct Energy (N.D. Ohio Jan. 2018) - The case was stayed pending the outcome of an appeal to the Sixth Circuit based on the unconstitutionality of the TCPA during the period from 2015-2020. The Sixth Circuit found the TCPA was in effect during that period and remanded the case back to the trial court. Direct Energy refiled its motions along with supplements. On March 25, 2022, the Court granted summary judgment in favor of Direct Energy and dismissed the case. Dickson appealed. The Sixth Circuit found that Dickson has standing and reversed the trial court's dismissal of the case. The matter is back at the trial court. The parties conducted fact and expert discovery and Direct Energy submitted its motion for summary judgment in August 2024. 
 Sales Practice Lawsuit 
 A Vivint Smart Home competitor has made a claim against Vivint Smart Home alleging, among other things, that Vivint Smart Home's sales representatives used deceptive sales practices. This matter was known and accrued for at the time of the Vivint Smart Home acquisition. CPI Security Systems, Inc. ("CPI") v. Vivint Smart Home, Inc. (W.D.N.C. Sept. 2020) was filed in 2020, went to trial, and in February 2023, the jury issued a verdict against Vivint Smart Home, in favor of CPI for million of compensatory damages and an additional million of punitive damages. Vivint Smart Home has fully 
 
 44 

million in damages for patent infringement. The patents that were the basis for the claims made by Skybell were ruled invalid by the U.S. International Trade Commission in November 2021. The Company does not believe the verdict is legally supported and is pursuing appellate remedies along with any other legal options available. This matter was known and accrued for at the time of the Vivint Smart Home acquisition. 
 Contract Dispute 
 STP In July 2023, the partners in STP, CPS and Austin Energy, initiated a lawsuit and filed to intervene in the license transfer application with the NRC, claiming a right of first refusal exists in relation to the proposed sale of NRG South Texas' interest in STP to Constellation. The parties entered into a settlement agreement in May 2024, and the litigation was dismissed. There was no incremental impact to NRG as a result of the settlement. 
 Winter Storm Uri Lawsuits 
 The Company has been named in certain property damage and wrongful death claims that have been filed in connection with Winter Storm Uri in its capacity as a generator and a REP. Most of the lawsuits related to Winter Storm Uri are consolidated into a single multi-district litigation matter in Harris County District Court. NRG's REPs have since been dismissed from the multi-district litigation. As a power generator, the Company is named in various cases with claims ranging from: wrongful death; personal injury only; property damage and personal injury; property damage only; and subrogation. The First Court of Appeals conditionally granted the generators' mandamus relief, ordering the trial court to grant the generator defendants' Motion to Dismiss. The plaintiffs challenged the ruling and the matters are stayed pending appeals by the various parties. The Company intends to vigorously defend these matters.

Among other items, the notices allege that the NRG suppliers did not transition existing residential customers to of the compliant products authorized by the NYSPSC following the effective date of the order. NRG responded to the notices in February 2024. The Company believes it has complied with the Retail Reset Order and does not agree with the NYSPSC's assertions made in the notice. The outcome of this process has the potential to negatively impact the retail business in New York.

 rules promulgated during the second quarter of 2024. In general, future laws are expected to require the addition of emissions controls or other environmental controls or to impose additional restrictions on the operations of the Company's facilities, which could have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. The Company has elected to use a million disclosure threshold, as permitted, for environmental proceedings to which the government is a party. 
 Air 
 CPP/ACE Rules The attention in recent years on GHG emissions has resulted in federal and state regulations. In 2019, the EPA promulgated the ACE rule, which rescinded the CPP, which had sought to broadly regulate CO 2 emissions from the power sector. The ACE rule required states that have coal-fired EGUs to develop plans to seek heat rate improvements from coal-fired EGUs. On January 19, 2021, the D.C. Circuit vacated the ACE rule (but on February 22, 2021, at the EPA's request, stayed the issuance of the portion of the mandate that would vacate the repeal of the CPP). On June 30, 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the "generation shifting" approach in the CPP exceeded the powers granted to the EPA by Congress. The Court did not address the related issues of whether the EPA may adopt only measures applied at each source. On May 9, 2024, the EPA promulgated a rule that repealed the ACE rule and significantly revised the manner in which new combustion-turbine and existing steam EGU's GHG emissions will be regulated including capturing and storing/sequestering CO 2 in some instances. This rule has been challenged by numerous parties in the D.C. Circuit including 27 states with 22 states intervening in support of the rule. The Company anticipates that the new U.S. presidential administration will revisit this rule. 
 Cross-State Air Pollution Rule ("CSAPR") On March 15, 2023, the EPA signed and released a prepublication version of a final rule that sought to significantly revise the CSAPR to address the good-neighbor obligations of the 2015 ozone NAAQS for 23 states after earlier having disapproved numerous state plans to address the issue. Several states, including Texas, challenged the EPA's disapproval of their state plans. On May 1, 2023, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit stayed the EPA's disapproval of Texas' and Louisiana's state plans, which disapprovals are a condition precedent to the EPA imposing its plan on Texas and Louisiana. Several other states are also similarly situated because of similar stays. Nonetheless, on June 5, 2023, the EPA promulgated this rule. On July 31, 2023, the EPA promulgated an interim final rule that addresses the various judicial orders that have stayed several State-Implementation-Plan disapprovals by limiting the effectiveness of certain requirements of the final rule promulgated on June 5, 2023 in Texas and several other states. On June 27, 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court stayed the final rule in the 11 states where the rule had not already been stayed. The Company cannot predict the outcome of the legal challenges to the: (i) various state disapprovals; (ii) the final rule promulgated on June 5, 2023; and (iii) the interim final rule promulgated on July 31, 2023 that seeks to address the judicial orders. The Company anticipates that the new U.S. presidential administration will revisit this rule. 
 Regional Haze Proposal In May 2023, the EPA proposed to withdraw the existing Texas Sulfur Dioxide Trading Program and replace it with unit-specific SO 2 limits for 12 units in Texas to address requirements to improve visibility at National Parks and Wilderness areas. If finalized as proposed, it would result in more stringent SO 2 limits for of the Company's coal-fired units in Texas. The Company cannot predict the outcome of this proposal. 
 Mercury and Air Toxics Standards MATS On May 7, 2024, the EPA promulgated a final rule that amends the MATS rule by, among other things, increasing the stringency of the filterable particulate matter standard at coal-burning units. The deadline for complying with this more stringent standard is 2027. states have challenged this rule in the D.C. Circuit. Accordingly, the outcome of this rulemaking is uncertain. The Company anticipates that the new U.S. presidential administration will revisit this rule. 
 Water 
 ELG In 2015, the EPA revised the ELG for Steam Electric Generating Facilities, which imposed more stringent requirements (as individual permits were renewed) for wastewater streams from FGD, fly ash, bottom ash and flue gas mercury control. On September 18, 2017, the EPA promulgated a final rule that, among other things, postponed the compliance dates to preserve the status quo for FGD wastewater and bottom ash transport water by two years to November 2020 until the EPA amended the rule. On October 13, 2020, the EPA amended the 2015 ELG rule by: (i) altering the stringency of certain limits for FGD wastewater; (ii) relaxing the zero-discharge requirement for bottom ash transport water; and (iii) changing several deadlines. In 2021, NRG informed its regulators that the Company intends to comply with the ELG by ceasing combustion of coal by the end of 2028 at its domestic coal units outside of Texas, and installing appropriate controls by the end of 2025 at its plants that have coal-fired units in Texas. On May 9, 2024, the EPA promulgated a rule that revises the ELG by, among

 Energy Regulatory Matters 
 The Company s regulatory matters are described in the Company s 2023 Form 10-K in Item 1, Business Regulatory Matters. These matters have been updated below and in Note 15, Regulatory Matters. 
 As participants in wholesale and retail energy markets and owners and operators of power plants, certain NRG entities are subject to regulation by various federal and state government agencies. These include the CFTC, FERC, NRC and the PUCT, as well as other public utility commissions in certain states where NRG's generation or distributed generation assets are located. In addition, NRG is subject to the market rules, procedures and protocols of the various ISO and RTO markets in which it participates. Likewise, certain NRG entities participating in the retail markets are subject to rules and regulations established by the states and provinces in which NRG entities are licensed to sell at retail. NRG must also comply with the mandatory reliability requirements imposed by NERC and the regional reliability entities in the regions where NRG operates. 
 
 48 

NRG's operations within the ERCOT footprint are not subject to rate regulation by FERC, as they are deemed to operate solely within the ERCOT market and not in interstate commerce. These operations are subject to regulation by the PUCT. 
 State and Provincial Energy Regulation 
 Maryland Legislation On May 9, 2024, Maryland Governor Wes Moore signed Senate Bill 1 into law, which restricts the competitive retail electric and natural-gas market in Maryland, affecting residential customers but not commercial and industrial customers. Key provisions of the law take effect January 1, 2025. The legislation imposes a price cap on residential contracts tied to a trailing 12-month historical average of utility rates, with only a limited exception for renewable power products. Renewable products must now have their price pre-approved pursuant to a process to be established and run by the Maryland Public Service Commission and source their renewable electricity certificates from within the PJM region. The law also requires that any variable-price contract not contain a change in price more than once a year, except time-of-use contracts, and limits contract terms to 12 months. It requires affirmative consent for the renewal of customer contracts for renewable power products. The law also imposes licensing requirements on energy salespersons. The law states that it does not impair existing contracts. On October 1, 2024, Green Mountain Energy Company, a subsidiary of NRG, along with a retail trade association to which NRG belongs, filed a lawsuit in federal court challenging the constitutionality of Senate Bill 1. 
 Regional Regulatory Developments 
 NRG is affected by rule/tariff changes that occur in the ISO regions. For further discussion on regulatory developments, see Note 15, Regulatory Matters . 
 Texas 
 Public Utility Commission of Texas Actions with Respect to Wholesale Pricing and Market Design The PUCT continues to analyze and implement multiple options for promoting increased reliability in the wholesale electric market, including the adoption of a reliability standard for resource adequacy and market-based mechanisms to achieve this standard. The Commission adopted a reliability standard that became effective in September 2024. In 2023, the Texas Legislature authorized implementation of the Performance Credit Mechanism ("PCM"), which will measure real-time contribution to system reliability and provide compensation for resources to be available, subject to certain "guardrails" such as an absolute annual net cost cap, as part of its adoption of the PUCT Sunset Bill (House Bill 1500). The Texas Legislature also directed the PUCT to implement additional market design changes such as the creation of a new ancillary service called Dispatchable Reliability Reserve Service ("DRRS") to further increase ERCOT's capability to manage net load variability and firming requirements for new generation resources which penalize poor performance during periods of low grid reserves. The PUCT directed ERCOT to implement DRRS as a standalone product which will delay implementation until 2026 or 2027. 
 Texas Energy Fund Through Senate Bill 2627, the Texas Legislature created the Texas Energy Fund, which received voter approval in November 2023, and will provide grants and low-interest loans (3 to incentivize the development of more dispatchable generation and smaller backup generation in ERCOT. The PUCT adopted a rule in March 2024, which establishes the application and participation requirements and the process by which the Texas Energy Fund loan proceeds for dispatchable generation in ERCOT will be distributed. The initial window for submitting loan applications was opened on June 1, 2024 and closed on July 27, 2024. NRG, through its subsidiaries, filed for loan proceeds for three separate projects, totaling more than 1,500 MWs of capacity. The PUCT also adopted a rule for the completion bonus grant program in April 2024, which provides for opportunities for grants of 120,000 per MW for dispatchable generation projects interconnected before June 1, 2026, or 80,000 per MW for dispatchable generation projects interconnected on or after June 1, 2026 but before June 1, 2029, subject to performance requirements. Applications for completion bonus grants can be submitted beginning in January 2025. Availability of grant funds may be impacted by the 10,000 MW collective cap on the ERCOT loan and grant program. 
 On August 29, 2024, the PUCT approved a portfolio of projects to move into a due diligence process with its third-party administrator. NRG THW GT LLC's 415 MW gas peakers, which is projected to become commercially operational by May 1, 2026, was among the projects selected to move into diligence, and that process is underway. Approximately 8,500 MW of projects are currently approved to undergo due diligence. 
 Real-time Co-optimization of Energy and Ancillary Services ("RTC") ERCOT is progressing with a multi-year project to upgrade their systems to co-optimize the dispatch of energy and ancillary services in real-time. The RTC project will also replace the Operating Reserve Demand Curve with demand curves for each ancillary service product which will act as the primary scarcity pricing mechanism when energy or ancillary services are in shortage. ERCOT anticipates commencing market trials for testing the RTC project in Spring 2025 with production to go-live in late 2025. 
 Supreme Court of Texas Ruling on Pricing during Winter Storm Uri On June 14, 2024, the Supreme Court of Texas issued an order affirming the validity of two orders issued by the PUCT on February 15 and 16, 2021, respectively, governing scarcity pricing in the ERCOT wholesale electricity market during Winter Storm Uri. The Supreme Court's order reversed the judgment of the Third Court of Appeals, which held that the PUCT exceeded its statutory authority by ordering the market price 
 
 49 

of energy to be set at the high system wide offer cap due to scarcity conditions as a result of firm load shed occurring in ERCOT. In addition to holding that the PUCT's orders were consistent with the agency's statutory authority, the Supreme Court of Texas's order found that the PUCT had substantially complied with the Administrative Procedure Act's procedural rulemaking requirements. 
 Voluntary Mitigation Plan ("VMP") Changes On March 13, 2023, the PUCT Staff determined that a portion of NRG's VMP should be terminated due to the increase in procurement of ancillary services by ERCOT, specifically non-spin reserve services, following Winter Storm Uri. As such, PUCT Staff terminated part of the VMP for NRG which provides protection from wholesale market power abuse accusations related to offers for ancillary services. NRG agreed with these changes to the VMP. At the March 23, 2023 open meeting, the PUCT approved the amended VMP. In February 2024, NRG filed a notice of intent with the PUCT and terminated its existing VMP as of March 1, 2024. 
 Lubbock, Texas Transition to Competition The customers of Lubbock Power and Light ("LP L"), a municipally owned utility, entered the Texas retail competitive market in March 2024. Starting in January 2024, LP L customers were able to shop for a REP. Customers who did not select a REP by February 15, 2024 were assigned to one of three default REPs, one of which is Reliant. LP L customers started transitioning to their chosen REP or a default REP on March 4, 2024. 
 PJM 
 Revisions to PJM Local Deliverability Area Reliability Requirement The Base Residual Auction ("BRA") for the 2024/2025 delivery year commenced on December 7, 2022 and closed on December 13, 2022. On December 19, 2022, PJM announced that it would delay the publication of the auction results. On December 23, 2022, PJM made a filing at FERC to revise the definition of Locational Deliverability Area ("LDA") Reliability Requirement in the Tariff. This would allow PJM to exclude certain resources from the calculation of the Local Deliverability Area Reliability Requirement. On February 21, 2023, FERC accepted PJM's filing. Multiple parties, including NRG, filed for rehearing. Rehearing was denied by operation of law, and multiple parties, including the Company, filed appeals to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. On March 12, 2024, the court vacated the portion of the FERC orders that allow PJM to apply the Local Deliverability Area Reliability Requirement to the 2024/2025 capacity auction. On March 29, 2024, PJM filed a petition seeking confirmation as to the capacity commitments rules for the 2024/2025 auction. On April 22, 2024, multiple parties filed a complaint seeking to find the revised rate unjust and unreasonable and implement rates consistent with FERC's February 2023 decision, which was denied on July 9, 2024. Those parties filed an appeal to the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit on November 5, 2024. 
 On May 6, 2024, FERC directed PJM to recalculate the 2024/2025 auction results under the Initial LDA Reliability Requirement rules, and further directed PJM to rerun the Third Incremental Auction. PJM published the revised BRA and Third Incremental Auction results on May 8, 2024 and May 23, 2024, respectively. On June 14, 2024, multiple parties filed appeals to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals seeking review of the May 6, 2024 FERC orders approving PJM's petition to restore the original capacity commitment rules for PJM to recalculate the 2024/2025 BRA and the rerun of the 2024/2025 BRA. As a result, the capacity for the 2024/2025 delivery year in the Delmarva Power and Light South zone resulted in higher prices. This outcome may change depending upon the disposition of the outstanding complaint and appeals. 
 PJM Base Residual Auction Revisions and Delay On April 11, 2023, PJM filed, and FERC subsequently approved, to delay the BRAs for the 2025/2026 to 2028/2029 delivery years. PJM subsequently made a filing at FERC proposing to develop market reforms. FERC ultimately rejected some of those changes and accepted some of those changes. The approved changes were in effect for the 2025/2026 BRA that occurred in July 2024. PJM sought FERC's approval to delay the 2026/2027 BRA until June 2025. The request is pending at FERC. 
 Changes to RMR in PJM Capacity Auctions On September 27, 2024, various public interest organizations filed a complaint at FERC against PJM seeking changes to the treatment of RMRs in the capacity market. Any changes approved by FERC could affect capacity prices. 
 Indian River RMR Proceeding On June 29, 2021, Indian River notified PJM that it intended to retire Unit 4, effective May 31, 2022, due to expected uneconomic operations. On July 30, 2021, PJM responded to the deactivation notice and stated that PJM had identified reliability violations resulting from the proposed deactivation of Unit 4. NRG filed a cost based RMR rate schedule at FERC on April 1, 2022. FERC accepted the rate schedule with a June 1, 2022 effective date, subject to refund and established hearing and settlement procedures. The Company reached settlement with a number of the intervening parties and the settlement agreement was filed at FERC on April 2, 2024 and is pending FERC review. Delmarva Power submitted to PJM and the Maryland Public Service Commission an update on its projected completion date for the transmission upgrades that would eliminate the need for the Indian River RMR. The new anticipated date is in December 2024, which is sooner than originally estimated by PJM. 
 Independent Market Monitor Market Seller Offer Cap Complaint On March 18, 2021, finding that the calculation of the default Market Seller Offer Cap was unjust and unreasonable, FERC issued an Order, which permitted the PJM May 2021 capacity auction for the 2022/2023 delivery year to continue under the existing rules and set a procedural schedule for parties to 
 
 50 

file briefs with possible solutions. On September 2, 2021, FERC issued an order in response to a complaint filed by the PJM Independent Market Monitor's proposal, which eliminated the Cost of New Entry-based Market Seller Offer Cap, implemented a limited default cap for certain asset classes based on going-forward costs and provided for unit specific cost review by the Independent Market Monitor for all other non-zero offers into the auctions. On October 4, 2021, as required by the Order, PJM submitted its compliance tariff and certain parties filed a motion for rehearing, which was denied by operation of law. On February 18, 2022, FERC addressed the arguments raised on rehearing and rejected the rehearing requests. Multiple parties filed appeals at the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, and on August 15, 2023, the Court denied the petitions for review. On January 12, 2024, the generator trade association filed a petition for review with the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn the August 15, 2023 judgment. On May 28, 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court denied the petition for review. 
 Final Rule on Reactive Power Payments On October 17, 2024, FERC issued its final rule on reactive power, eliminating compensation for a generator s reactive power within the standard power factor. ISOs must make a compliance filing, but FERC will permit ISO-NE, NYISO, and PJM to request a later effective date. This change affects the payments provided to generators providing reactive power service. 
 Change to Energy Efficiency in the PJM Capacity Auction On November 5, 2024, FERC approved PJM s proposal to terminate compensation paid through the PJM capacity market to energy efficiency resources beginning in the 2026/2027 auction year. However, energy efficiency resources will be counted as a reduction in the PJM load forecast that is the basis of the PJM capacity auction. FERC's action will eliminate wholesale market financial support for utility-run programs authorized by state utility commissions, as well as certain third-party providers of energy efficiency services. NRG's demand-side programming is not significantly affected by the modification. 
 Other Regulatory Matters 
 From time to time, NRG entities may be subject to examinations, investigations and/or enforcement actions by federal, state and provincial licensing agencies and may face the risk of penalties for violation of financial services, consumer protections and other applicable laws and regulations. 

Environmental Regulatory Matters 
 NRG is subject to numerous environmental laws in the development, construction, ownership and operation of power plants. These laws generally require that governmental permits and approvals be obtained before construction and maintained during operation of power plants. Federal and state environmental laws have become more stringent over time. Future laws may require the addition of emissions controls or other environmental controls or impose restrictions on the Company's operations including unit retirements. Complying with environmental laws often involves specialized human resources and significant capital and operating expenses, as well as occasionally curtailing operations. NRG decides to invest capital for environmental controls based on the relative certainty of the requirements, an evaluation of compliance options, and the expected economic returns on capital. 
 A number of regulations that affect the Company have been and continue to be revised by the EPA, including requirements regarding coal ash, GHG emissions, NAAQS revisions and implementation and effluent limitation guidelines. NRG will evaluate the impact of these regulations as they are revised but cannot fully predict the impact of each until anticipated revisions, legal challenges and reconsiderations are resolved. The Company s environmental matters are described in the Company s 2023 Form 10-K in Item 1, Business - Environmental Matters and Item 1A, Risk Factors . These matters have been updated in Note 16, Environmental Matters, to the condensed consolidated financial statements of this Form 10-Q and as follows. 
 Air 
 The CAA and related regulations (as well as similar state and local requirements) have the potential to affect air emissions, operating practices and pollution control equipment required at power plants. Under the CAA, the EPA sets NAAQS for certain pollutants including SO 2 , ozone, and PM2.5. Many of the Company's facilities are located in or near areas that are classified by the EPA as not achieving certain NAAQS (non-attainment areas). The relevant NAAQS may become more stringent. In March 2024, the EPA increased the stringency of the PM2.5 NAAQS. The Company maintains a comprehensive compliance strategy to address continuing and new requirements. Complying with increasingly stringent air regulations could require the installation of additional emissions control equipment at some NRG facilities or retiring of units if installing such controls is not economic. Significant changes to air regulatory programs affecting the Company are described below. 
 CPP/ACE Rules The attention in recent years on GHG emissions has resulted in federal and state regulations. In 2019, the EPA promulgated the ACE rule, which rescinded the CPP, which had sought to broadly regulate CO 2 emissions from the power sector. On January 19, 2021, the D.C. Circuit vacated the ACE rule (but on February 22, 2021, at the EPA's request, stayed the issuance of the portion of the mandate that would vacate the repeal of the CPP). On June 30, 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the "generation shifting" approach in the CPP exceeded the powers granted to the EPA by Congress. The Court 
 
 51 

did not address the related issues of whether the EPA may adopt only measures applied at each source. On May 9, 2024, the EPA promulgated a rule that repealed the ACE rule and significantly revised the manner in which new combustion-turbine and existing steam EGU's GHG emissions will be regulated including capturing and storing/sequestering CO 2 in some instances. This rule has been challenged by numerous parties in the D.C. Circuit including 27 states with 22 states intervening in support of the rule. The Company anticipates that the new U.S. presidential administration will revisit this rule. 
 CSAPR On March 15, 2023, the EPA signed and released a prepublication of a final rule that sought to significantly revise the CSAPR to address the good-neighbor obligations of the 2015 ozone NAAQS for 23 states after earlier having disapproved numerous state plans to address the issue. Several states, including Texas, challenged the EPA's disapproval of their state plans. On May 1, 2023, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit stayed the EPA's disapproval of Texas' and Louisiana's state plans, which disapprovals are a condition precedent to the EPA imposing its plan on Texas and Louisiana. Several other states are also similarly situated because of similar stays. Nonetheless, on June 5, 2023, the EPA promulgated this rule. On July 31, 2023, the EPA promulgated an interim final rule that addresses the various judicial orders that have stayed several State-Implementation-Plan disapprovals by limiting the effectiveness of certain requirements of the final rule promulgated on June 5, 2023 in Texas and several other states. On June 27, 2024, the United States Supreme Court stayed the final rule in the 11 states where the rule had not already been stayed. The Company cannot predict the outcome of the legal challenges to the: (i) various state disapprovals; (ii) the final rule promulgated on June 5, 2023; and (iii) the interim final rule promulgated on July 31, 2023 that seeks to address the judicial orders. The Company anticipates that the new U.S. presidential administration will revisit this rule. 
 Regional Haze Proposal On May 2023, the EPA proposed to withdraw the existing Texas Sulfur Dioxide Trading Program and replace it with unit-specific SO 2 limits for 12 units in Texas to address requirements to improve visibility at National Parks and Wilderness areas. If finalized as proposed, the rule would result in more stringent SO 2 limits for two of the Company's coal-fired units in Texas. The Company cannot predict the outcome of this proposal. 
 MATS On May 7, 2024, the EPA promulgated a final rule that amends the MATS rule by, among other things, increasing the stringency of the filterable particulate matter standard at coal-burning units. The deadline for complying with this more stringent standard is 2027. Twenty three states have challenged this rule in the D.C. Circuit. Accordingly, the outcome of this rulemaking is uncertain. The Company anticipates that the new U.S. presidential administration will revisit this rule. 
 Byproducts 
 In April 2015, the EPA finalized the rule regulating byproducts of coal combustion (e.g., ash and gypsum) as solid wastes under the RCRA. On July 30, 2018, the EPA promulgated a rule that amended the ash rule by extending some of the deadlines and providing more flexibility for compliance. On August 21, 2018, the D.C. Circuit found, among other things, that the EPA had not adequately regulated unlined ponds and legacy surface impoundments. On August 28, 2020, the EPA finalized "A Holistic Approach to Closure Part A: Deadline to Initiate Closure," which amended the April 2015 Rule to address the August 2018 D.C. Circuit decision and extend some of the deadlines. On November 12, 2020, the EPA finalized "A Holistic Approach to Closure Part B: Alternative Demonstration for Unlined Surface Impoundments," which further amended the April 2015 Rule to, among other things, provide procedures for requesting approval to operate existing ash impoundments with an alternate liner. On May 8, 2024, the EPA promulgated a rule that establishes requirements for: (i) inactive (or legacy) surface impoundments at inactive facilities and (ii) coal combustion residual ("CCR") management units (regardless of how or when the CCR was placed) at regulated facilities. The rule also creates an obligation to conduct site assessments (at all active and certain inactive facilities) to determine whether CCR management units are present. The rule has been challenged in the D.C. Circuit and the outcome of the legal challenges is uncertain. The Company anticipates that the new U.S. presidential administration will revisit this rule. 
 Domestic Site Remediation Matters 
 Under certain federal, state and local environmental laws, a current or previous owner or operator of a facility, including an electric generating facility, may be required to investigate and remediate releases or threatened releases of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products. NRG may be responsible for property damage, personal injury and investigation and remediation costs incurred by a party in connection with hazardous material releases or threatened releases. These laws impose liability without regard to whether the owner knew of or caused the presence of the hazardous substances, and the courts have interpreted liability under such laws to be strict (without fault) and joint and several. Cleanup obligations can often be triggered during the closure or decommissioning of a facility, in addition to spills during its operations. 
 Water 
 The Company is required under the CWA to comply with intake and discharge requirements, requirements for technological controls and operating practices. As with air quality regulations, federal and state water regulations have become more stringent and imposed new requirements. 
 
 52 

ELG In 2015, the EPA revised the ELG for Steam Electric Generating Facilities, which imposed more stringent requirements (as individual permits were renewed) for wastewater streams from FGD, fly ash, bottom ash and flue gas mercury control. In 2017, the EPA promulgated a final rule that, among other things, postponed the compliance dates to preserve the status quo for FGD wastewater and bottom ash transport water by two years to November 2020 until the EPA amended the rule. On October 13, 2020, the EPA amended the 2015 ELG rule by: (i) altering the stringency of certain limits for FGD wastewater; (ii) relaxing the zero-discharge requirement for bottom ash transport water; and (iii) changing several deadlines. In October 2021, NRG informed its regulators that the Company intends to comply with the ELG by ceasing combustion of coal by the end of 2028 at its domestic coal units outside of Texas, and installing appropriate controls by the end of 2025 at its two plants that have coal-fired units in Texas. On May 9, 2024, the EPA promulgated a rule that revises the ELG by, among other things, further restricting the discharge of (i) FGD wastewater, (ii) bottom ash transport water, and (iii) combustion residual leachate. The rule was challenged in numerous courts, but the cases have been consolidated in the Eighth Circuit of the United States Court of Appeals. The outcome of the legal challenges is uncertain. The Company anticipates that the new U.S. presidential administration will revisit this rule. 
 Regional Environmental Developments 
 Ash Regulation in Illinois On July 30, 2019, Illinois enacted legislation that required the state to promulgate regulations regarding coal ash at surface impoundments. On April 15, 2021, the state promulgated the implementing regulation, which became effective on April 21, 2021. NRG has applied for initial operating permits and construction permits (for closure and retrofits) as required by the regulation and is waiting for most of its permits to be issued by the Illinois EPA. 
 Houston Nonattainment for 2008 Ozone Standard In 2022, the EPA changed the Houston area's classification from Serious to Severe nonattainment for the 2008 Ozone Standard. Accordingly, Texas is required to develop a new control strategy and submit it to the EPA. 

Significant Events 
 The following significant events have occurred during 2024 as further described within this Management's Discussion and Analysis and the condensed consolidated financial statements: 
 Dispositions 
 On September 16, 2024, the Company closed on the sale of its 100 ownership in the Airtron business unit. Proceeds of 500 million were reduced by working capital and other adjustments of 16 million, resulting in net proceeds of 484 million. The Company recorded a gain on the sale of 208 million within the West/Services/Other region of operations. 
 Capital Allocation 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company completed 319 million of open market share repurchases at an average price of 79.26 per share. Through October 31, 2024, an additional 225 million share repurchases were executed at an average price of 89.23 per share. See Note 9, Changes in Capital Structure for additional discussion. 
 In October 2024, the Board of Directors authorized an additional 1.0 billion for share repurchases as part of the existing share repurchase authorization. As of October 31, 2024, 2.0 billion is remaining under the 3.7 billion authorization. 
 On November 6, 2023, the Company executed Accelerated Share Repurchase agreements to repurchase a total of 950 million of NRG's outstanding common stock. The Company received shares of NRG's common stock on specified settlement dates. The ASR program concluded on March 28, 2024, with total of 18,839,372 shares received at an average price of 50.43 per share. 
 In the first quarter of 2024, NRG increased the annual common stock dividend to 1.63 from 1.51 per share, representing an 8 increase from 2023. Beginning in the first quarter of 2025, NRG will increase the annual dividend by 8 to 1.76 per share. The Company expects to target an annual dividend growth rate of 7-9 per share in subsequent years. 
 On April 16, 2024, the Company, as borrower, and certain of its subsidiaries, as guarantors, entered into the Eighth Amendment with, among others, Citicorp North America, Inc., as administrative agent and as the Agent, and certain financial institutions, as lenders, which amended the Credit Agreement, in order to (i) establish a new Term Loan Facility with borrowings of 875 million in aggregate principal amount and the Term Loans and (ii) make certain other modifications to the Credit Agreement as set forth therein. The proceeds from the Term Loans were used to repay a portion of the Company s Convertible Senior Notes, all of the Company's 3.750 senior secured first lien notes due 2024 and for general corporate purposes. For further discussion, see Note 7, Long-term Debt and Finance Leases. 
 
 53 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased 343 million in aggregate principal amount of its Convertible Senior Notes, for 603 million, which included the payment of 3 million of accrued interest, using cash on hand and a portion of the proceeds from the Term Loans. For further discussion, see Note 7, Long-term Debt and Finance Leases. 
 During the second quarter of 2024, the Company entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions with certain counterparties to effectively lock in a conversion premium of 257 million on the remaining 232 million of the Convertible Senior Notes. The option price of 257 million was incurred when the Company entered into the capped call transactions, which will be payable upon the earlier of settlement and expiration of the applicable Capped Call. For further discussion see Note 9, Changes in Capital Structure . 
 On June 21, 2024, NRG Receivables, amended its existing Receivables Facility to, among other things, (i) extend the scheduled termination date to June 20, 2025, (ii) increase the aggregate commitments from 1.4 billion to 2.3 billion (adjusted seasonally) and (iii) add a new originator. For further discussion, see Note 7, Long-term Debt and Finance Leases. 
 During the second quarter of 2024, the Company repaid 600 million in aggregate principal amount of its 3.750 Senior Secured First Lien Notes due 2024. 
 Debt Refinancing Transactions 
 In the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company entered into the following debt transactions: 
 Sources Uses Issuance by NRG of 6.000 Senior Notes due 2033 925 million Repayment of the Vivint Senior Secured Term Loan B 1.310 billion Issuance by NRG of 6.250 Senior Notes due 2034 950 million Cash tender offer for Vivint 6.750 Senior Secured Notes due 2027 (a)

 (b) On November 4, 2024, APX Group, Inc. delivered a notice of redemption with respect to the Vivint 5.750 Senior Notes due 2029 to redeem the approximate 2 million of the Vivint 5.750 Senior Notes due 2029 that remained outstanding following the Exchange Offer on November 14, 2024 
 As part of the above transactions, the Company entered into the Tenth Amendment and Eleventh Amendment to the Credit Agreement to (i) increase the term loan B in an aggregate principal balance of 450 million, (ii) make certain other amendments to the Credit Agreement and (iii) extend the maturity date of its revolving credit facility to October 30, 2029. For further discussion on these amendments and the debt transactions in the table above, see Note 7, Long-term Debt and Finance Leases. 
 Operations 
 NRG has entered into a definitive partnership agreement with Renew Home, a leading Virtual Power Plant platform ("VPP") formed by the combination of Google's Nest Renew and OhmConnect. This first-of-its-kind commercial partnership reinforces NRG's customer focus and brings to market unique products and services which will help customers save money while enjoying the benefits of a seamless energy and smart home experience. Leveraging Google Cloud's AI and cloud platforms, NRG and Renew Home plan to develop a VPP portfolio of up to 1 GW of load management capacity, with instantaneous dispatch value during peak events and tight supply conditions. Participating customers will enroll in an NRG branded energy plan and will be eligible for favorable rates on Vivint Smart Home services and additional products. The partnership will initially focus in Texas, with Renew Home supporting upfront customer acquisition costs and Google Nest integration. 
 A component of the Company's strategy is to procure mid to long-term generation through power purchase agreements. NRG has entered into Renewable PPAs totaling approximately 1.9 GW with third-party project developers and other counterparties, of which all are operational as of September 30, 2024. The average tenure of these agreements is eleven years. The Company expects to continue evaluating and executing similar agreements that support the needs of the business. The total GW procured through Renewable PPAs may be impacted by contract terminations when they occur.

Trends Affecting Results of Operations and Future Business Performance 
 The Company s trends are described in the Company s 2023 Form 10-K in Item 7, M anagement s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Business Environment , except for the update below: 
 Load Growth The electric industry is expected to experience a surge in demand driven primarily by new manufacturing, industrial and data center facilities (inclusive of generative artificial intelligence ("gen AI")). The U.S. Energy Information Administration's 2023 Annual Energy Outlook, combined with external forecasts of gen AI, shows the potential for 500 TWh of incremental load across the U.S. through 2030, as compared to 2023. ERCOT's current long term load forecast shows peak demand increasing from 86 GW in 2024 to 137 GW in 2028. This load growth will require significant planning and construction of new generation and transmission. ERCOT has announced its New Era of Planning effort to prepare for the possibility of very large and rapid load growth. 
 Texas Development Priorities 
 In the third quarter of 2024, the PUCT selected the T.H. Wharton project to move forward in the due diligence process for the Texas Energy Fund. The Company continues to explore its options for the Cedar Bayou 5 and Greens Bayou 6 projects. NRG's shovel ready projects are as follows: 
 Facility Fuel Type Net Generation Capacity (MW) Cedar Bayou 5 Natural Gas 689 Greens Bayou 6 Natural Gas 448 T.H. Wharton Natural Gas 415 Total 1,552

 Gross Margin 
 The Company calculates gross margin in order to evaluate operating performance as revenues less cost of fuel, purchased energy and other costs of sales, mark-to-market for economic hedging activities, contract and emissions credit amortization and depreciation and amortization. 
 Economic Gross Margin 
 In addition to gross margin, the Company evaluates its operating performance using the measure of economic gross margin, which is not a GAAP measure and may not be comparable to other companies presentations or deemed more useful than the GAAP information provided elsewhere in this report. Economic gross margin should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for the Company's presentation of gross margin, which is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Economic gross margin is not intended to represent gross margin. The Company believes that economic gross margin is useful to investors as it is a key operational measure reviewed by the Company's chief operating decision maker. Economic gross margin is defined as the sum of retail revenue, energy revenue, capacity revenue and other revenue, less cost of fuel, purchased energy and other cost of sales. Economic gross margin does not include mark-to-market gains or losses on economic hedging activities, contract amortization, emissions credit amortization, depreciation and amortization, operations and maintenance, or other cost of operations.

 Mark-to-market results consist of unrealized gains and losses on contracts that are not yet settled. The settlement of these transactions is reflected in the same revenue or cost caption as the items being hedged. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the 8 million gain in revenues from economic hedge positions was driven primarily by the reversal of previously recognized unrealized losses on contracts that settled during the period. The 1.6 billion loss in operating costs and expenses from economic hedge positions was driven primarily by a decrease in the value of open positions as a result of decreases in power prices, as well as the reversal of previously recognized unrealized gains on contracts that settled during the period. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2023, the 70 million loss in revenues from economic hedge positions was driven primarily by a decrease in the value of open positions as a result of increases in PJM power prices. The 17 million gain in operating costs and expenses from economic hedge positions was driven primarily by an increase in the value of Texas and East open positions as a result of increases in ERCOT and PJM power prices, partially offset by the reversal of previously recognized unrealized gains on contracts that settled during the period.

 Senior Credit Facility 
 On April 16, 2024, the Company, as borrower, and certain of its subsidiaries, as guarantors, entered into the Eighth Amendment with, among others, Citicorp North America, Inc., as the Agent and as collateral agent, and certain financial institutions, as lenders, which amended the Credit Agreement, in order to (i) establish a new Term Loan Facility with borrowings of 875 million in aggregate principal amount and the Term Loans and (ii) make certain other modifications to the Credit Agreement as set forth therein. The proceeds from the Term Loans were used to repay a portion of the Company s Convertible Senior notes, all of the Company s 3.750 senior secured first lien notes due 2024 and for general corporate purposes. 
 At the Company s election, the Term Loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to either (1) a fluctuating rate equal to the highest of (A) the rate published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in effect on such day, plus 0.50 , (B) the rate of interest per annum publicly announced from time to time by The Wall Street Journal as the Prime Rate in the United States, and (C) a rate of one-month Term SOFR (as defined in the Credit Agreement) (after giving effect to any floor applicable to Term SOFR) plus 1.00 , in each case, plus a margin of 1.00 or (2) Term SOFR (as defined in the Credit Agreement) (which Term SOFR shall not be less than 0.00 for a one-, three- or six-month interest period (or such other period as agreed to by the Agent and the lenders, as selected by the Company), plus a margin of 2.00 . 
 On April 22, 2024, the Company, as borrower, and certain of its subsidiaries, as guarantors, entered into the Ninth Amendment to its Revolving Credit Facility to extend the maturity date of a portion of the revolving commitments thereunder to February 14, 2028.

 Convertible Senior Notes 
 As of October 1, 2024, the Company's Convertible Senior Notes are convertible during the quarterly period ending September 30, 2024 due to the satisfaction of the Common Stock Sale Price Condition. For further discussion, see Note 7, Long-term Debt and Finance Leases. 
 
 76 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company completed repurchases of a portion of the Convertible Senior Notes using cash on hand and a portion of the proceeds from the Term Loans, as detailed in the table below. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a 260 million loss on debt extinguishment was recorded. 
 (In millions, except percentages) Settlement Period Principal Repurchased Cash Paid (a)

 (a) Includes accrued interest of 1 million and 2 million for the March and April repurchases, respectively 
 During the second quarter of 2024, the Company entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions with certain counterparties. The Capped Calls have a cap price of 249.00 per share, subject to certain adjustments, and effectively lock in a conversion premium of 257 million on the remaining 232 million balance of the Convertible Senior Notes. The option price of 257 million was incurred when the Company entered into the Capped Calls, which will be payable upon the earlier of settlement and expiration of the applicable Capped Calls. For further discussion see Note 9, Changes in Capital Structure . 
 Receivables Securitization Facilities 
 On June 21, 2024, NRG Receivables, amended its existing Receivables Facility to, among other things, (i) extend the scheduled termination date to June 20, 2025, (ii) increase the aggregate commitments from 1.4 billion to 2.3 billion (adjusted seasonally) and (iii) add a new originator. As of September 30, 2024, there were no outstanding borrowings and there were 1.5 billion in letters of credit issued. 
 Also on June 21, 2024, the Additional Originator entered into the Joinder Agreement to join as Additional Originator to the Receivables Sale Agreement, dated as of September 22, 2020, among Direct Energy, LP, Direct Energy Business, LLC, Green Mountain Energy Company, NRG Business Marketing, LLC, Reliant Energy Northeast LLC, Reliant Energy Retail Services, LLC, Stream SPE, Ltd., US Retailers LLC and XOOM Energy Texas, LLC, as Originators, NRG Retail, as the servicer, and the Receivables Sale Agreement.

 Concurrently with the amendments to the Receivables Facility, the Company and the originators thereunder terminated the existing uncommitted Repurchase Facility. 
 Senior Secured First Lien Note Repayment 
 During the second quarter of 2024, the Company repaid 600 million in aggregate principal amount of its 3.750 Senior Secured First Lien Notes due 2024. 
 Vivint Term Loan Repricing 
 On April 10, 2024, Vivint, entered into the Second Amendment with, among others, the Vivint Agent, and certain financial institutions, as lenders, which amended the Vivint Credit Agreement, in order to (i) reprice its term loan B facility (the term loans thereunder, the Vivint Term Loans and (ii) make certain other modifications to the Vivint Credit Agreement as set forth therein. 
 At Vivint s election, the Vivint Term Loans will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to either (1) a fluctuating rate equal to the highest of (A) the rate published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in effect on such day, plus 0.50 , (B) the rate of interest per annum publicly announced from time to time by The Wall Street Journal as the Prime Rate in the United States, and (C) a rate of one-month Term SOFR (as defined in the Vivint Credit Agreement), (after giving effect to any floor applicable to Term SOFR) plus 1.00 in each case, plus a margin of 1.75 , or (2) Term SOFR (as defined in the Vivint Credit Agreement) (which Term SOFR shall not be less than 0.50 for a one-, three- or six-month interest period or such other period as agreed to by the Vivint Agent and the lenders, as selected by Vivint, plus a margin of 2.75 . 
 Liability Management 
 The Company previously announced it intended to spend approximately 500 million reducing debt during 2024 to maintain its targeted credit metrics. As the Company has updated the 2024 capital allocation plan, NRG's planned spend on reducing debt has been adjusted to 335 million, as NRG believes it will maintain its targeted credit metrics. 
 
 77 

Market Operations 
 The Company's market operations activities require a significant amount of liquidity and capital resources. These liquidity requirements are primarily driven by: (i) margin and collateral posted with counterparties; (ii) margin and collateral required to participate in physical markets and commodity exchanges; (iii) timing of disbursements and receipts (e.g., buying energy before receiving retail revenues); and (iv) initial collateral for large structured transactions. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had total cash collateral outstanding of 449 million and 2.9 billion outstanding in letters of credit to third parties primarily to support its market activities. As of September 30, 2024, total funds deposited by counterparties were 12 million in cash and 275 million of letters of credit. 
 Future liquidity requirements may change based on the Company's hedging activities and structures, fuel purchases, and future market conditions, including forward prices for energy and fuel and market volatility. In addition, liquidity requirements depend on the Company's credit ratings and general perception of its creditworthiness. 
 First Lien Structure 
 NRG has the capacity to grant first liens to certain counterparties on a substantial portion of the Company's assets, subject to various exclusions including NRG's assets that have project-level financing and the assets of certain non-guarantor subsidiaries, to reduce the amount of cash collateral and letters of credit that it would otherwise be required to post from time to time to support its obligations under out-of-the-money hedge agreements. The first lien program does not limit the volume that can be hedged, or the value of underlying out-of-the-money positions. The first lien program also does not require NRG to post collateral above any threshold amount of exposure. The first lien structure is not subject to unwind or termination upon a ratings downgrade of a counterparty and has no stated maturity date. 
 The Company's first lien counterparties may have a claim on its assets to the extent market prices differ from the hedged prices. As of September 30, 2024, all hedges under the first liens were out-of-the-money on a counterparty aggregate basis. 

Capital Expenditures 
 The following table summarizes the Company's capital expenditures for maintenance, environmental and growth investments for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and the estimated forecast for the remainder of the year.

 Investments and Integration for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 include growth expenditures, integration, small book acquisitions and other investments. 
 
 Environmental Capital Expenditures 
 NRG estimates that environmental capital expenditures from 2024 through 2028 required to comply with environmental laws will be approximately 93 million, primarily driven by the cost of complying with ELG at the Company's coal units in Texas. 
 
 78 

Share Repurchases 
 The Company's long-term capital allocation policy is to target allocating approximately 80 of cash available for allocation after debt reduction to be returned to shareholders. In June 2023, NRG announced an increase to its share repurchase authorization to 2.7 billion, to be executed through 2025 as part of the existing share repurchase authorization. In October 2024, the Board of Directors authorized an additional 1.0 billion for share repurchases as part of the existing share repurchase authorization. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company completed 319 million of open market share repurchases at an average price of 79.26 per share. Through October 31, 2024, an additional 225 million of share repurchases were executed at an average price of 89.23 per share. As of October 31, 2024, 2.0 billion is remaining under the 3.7 billion authorization. See Note 9, Changes in Capital Structure for additional discussion. 
 Common Stock Dividends 
 During the first quarter of 2024, NRG increased the annual dividend to 1.63 from 1.51 per share. A quarterly dividend of 0.4075 per share was paid on the Company's common stock during the three months ended September 30, 2024. On October 11, 2024, NRG declared a quarterly dividend on the Company's common stock of 0.4075 per share, payable on November 15, 2024 to stockholders of record as of November 1, 2024. Beginning in the first quarter of 2025, NRG will increase the annual dividend by 8 to 1.76 per share. The Company expects to target an annual dividend growth rate of 7 -9 per share in subsequent years. 
 Series A Preferred Stock Dividends 
 During the quarters ended March 31, 2024 and September 30, 2024, the Company declared and paid a semi-annual 10.25 dividend of 51.25 per share on its outstanding Series A Preferred Stock, each totaling 33 million. 
 
 Obligations under Certain Guarantees 
 NRG and its subsidiaries enter into various contracts that include indemnifications and guarantee provisions as a routine part of the Company s business activities. For further discussion, see Note 27, Guarantees, to the Company's 2023 Form 10-K. 
 Obligations Arising Out of a Variable Interest in an Unconsolidated Entity 
 Variable interest in equity investments NRG s investment in Ivanpah is a variable interest entity for which NRG is not the primary beneficiary. NRG's pro-rata share of non-recourse debt was approximately 461 million as of September 30, 2024. This indebtedness may restrict the ability of Ivanpah to issue dividends or distributions to NRG. 
 Contractual Obligations and Market Commitments 
 NRG has a variety of contractual obligations and other market commitments that represent prospective cash requirements in addition to the Company's capital expenditure programs, as disclosed in the Company's 2023 Form 10-K. See also Note 7, Long-term Debt and Finance Leases , and Note 14, Commitments and Contingencies , to this Form 10-Q for a discussion of new commitments and contingencies that also include contractual obligations and market commitments that occurred during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.

NOLs, Deferred Tax Assets and Uncertain Tax Position Implications, under ASC 740 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had domestic pre-tax book income of 827 million and foreign pre-tax book loss of 94 million. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had cumulative U.S. Federal NOL carryforwards of 8.4 billion, of which 6.4 billion do not have an expiration date, and cumulative state NOL carryforwards of 6.4 billion for financial statement purposes. NRG also has cumulative foreign NOL carryforwards of 411 million, most of which do not have an expiration date. In addition to the above NOLs, NRG has a 517 million indefinite carryforward for interest deductions, as well as 317 million of tax credits to be utilized in future years. As a result of the Company's tax position, including the utilization of federal and state NOLs, and based on current forecasts, the Company anticipates net income tax payments due to federal, state and foreign jurisdictions of up to 215 million in 2024, which includes the estimated impact of the sale of the Airtron business unit. As of September 30, 2024, there is no impact on the Company's provision for income taxes from the CAMT. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company has 66 million of tax-effected uncertain federal and state tax benefits, for which the Company has recorded a non-current tax liability of 70 million (inclusive of accrued interest) until final resolution is reached with the related taxing authority. 
 
 80 

On December 31, 2021, the OECD released rules which set forth a common approach to a global minimum tax at 15 for multinational companies, which has been enacted into law by certain countries effective for 2024. The Company's preliminary analysis indicates that there is no material impact to the Company's financial statements from these rules. 
 The Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal income tax examinations for years prior to 2020. With few exceptions, state and Canadian income tax examinations are no longer open for years prior to 2015. 
 Deferred tax assets and valuation allowance 
 Net deferred tax balance As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, NRG recorded a net deferred tax asset, excluding valuation allowance, of 2.4 billion and 2.5 billion, respectively. The Company believes certain state net operating losses may not be realizable under the more-likely-than-not measurement and as such, a valuation allowance was recorded as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 as discussed below. 
 NOL Carryforwards As of September 30, 2024, the Company had a tax-effected cumulative U.S. NOLs consisting of carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of 1.8 billion and 367 million, respectively. The Company estimates it will need to generate future taxable income to fully realize the net federal deferred tax asset before the expiration of certain carryforwards commences in 2030. In addition, NRG has tax-effected cumulative foreign NOL carryforwards of 110 million. 
 Valuation Allowance As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company s tax-effected valuation allowance was 275 million, consisting of state NOL carryforwards and foreign NOL carryforwards. The valuation allowance was recorded based on the assessment of cumulative and forecasted pre-tax book earnings and the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences. 

Guarantor Financial Information 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company's outstanding registered senior notes consisted of 375 million of the 2027 Senior Notes and 821 million of the 2028 Senior Notes as shown in Note 7, Long-term Debt and Finance Leases . These Senior Notes are guaranteed by certain of NRG's current and future 100 owned domestic subsidiaries, or guarantor subsidiaries (the Guarantors ). See Exhibit 22.1 to this Form 10-Q for a listing of the Guarantors. These guarantees are both joint and several. On October 30, 2024, NRG redeemed all of its outstanding 6.625 Senior Notes due 2027, of which 375 million aggregate principal amount was outstanding. 
 NRG conducts much of its business through and derives much of its income from its subsidiaries. Therefore, the Company's ability to make required payments with respect to its indebtedness and other obligations depends on the financial results and condition of its subsidiaries and NRG's ability to receive funds from its subsidiaries. There are no restrictions on the ability of any of the Guarantors to transfer funds to NRG. Other subsidiaries of the Company do not guarantee the registered debt securities of either NRG Energy, Inc. or the Guarantors (such subsidiaries are referred to as the Non-Guarantors ). The Non-Guarantors include all of NRG's foreign subsidiaries and certain domestic subsidiaries. 
 The following tables present summarized financial information of NRG Energy, Inc. and the Guarantors in accordance with Rule 3-10 under the SEC's Regulation S-X. The financial information may not necessarily be indicative of the results of operations or financial position of NRG Energy, Inc. and the Guarantors in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

 Fair Value of Derivative Instruments 
 NRG may enter into power purchase and sales contracts, fuel purchase contracts and other energy-related financial instruments to mitigate variability in earnings due to fluctuations in spot market prices and to hedge fuel requirements at power plants or retail load obligations. In order to mitigate interest rate risk associated with the issuance of the Company's variable rate debt, NRG enters into interest rate swap agreements. In addition, in order to mitigate foreign exchange rate risk primarily associated with the purchase of U.S. dollar denominated natural gas for the Company's Canadian business, NRG enters into foreign exchange contract agreements. 
 Under Flex Pay, offered by Vivint Smart Home, subscribers pay for smart home products by obtaining financing from a third-party financing provider under the Consumer Financing Program. Vivint Smart Home pays certain fees to the Financing Providers and shares in credit losses depending on the credit quality of the subscriber. 
 NRG's trading activities are subject to limits in accordance with the Company's Risk Management Policy. These contracts are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value and changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments are recognized in earnings. 
 The following tables disclose the activities that include both exchange and non-exchange traded contracts accounted for at fair value in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures ("ASC 820"). Specifically, these tables disaggregate realized and unrealized changes in fair value; disaggregate estimated fair values as of September 30, 2024, based on their level within the fair value hierarchy defined in ASC 820; and indicate the maturities of contracts at September 30, 2024. For a full discussion of the Company's valuation methodology of its contracts, see Derivative Fair Value Measurements in Note 5, Fair Value of Financial Instruments .

 The Company has elected to disclose derivative assets and liabilities on a trade-by-trade basis and does not offset amounts at the counterparty master agreement level. Also, collateral received or posted on the Company's derivative assets or liabilities are recorded on a separate line item on the balance sheet. Consequently, the magnitude of the changes in individual current and non-current derivative assets or liabilities is higher than the underlying credit and market risk of the Company's portfolio. As discussed in Item 3, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Commodity Price Risk , to this Form 10-Q, NRG measures the sensitivity of the Company's portfolio to potential changes in market prices using VaR, a statistical model which attempts to predict risk of loss based on market price and volatility. NRG's risk management policy places a limit on one-day holding period VaR, which limits the Company's net open position. As the Company's trade-by-trade derivative accounting results in a gross-up of the Company's derivative assets and liabilities, the net derivative asset and liability position is a better 
 
 82 

indicator of NRG's hedging activity. As of September 30, 2024, NRG's net derivative asset was 383 million, a decrease to total fair value of 265 million as compared to December 31, 2023. This decrease was primarily driven by losses in fair value, partially offset by the roll-off of trades that settled during the period. 
 Based on a sensitivity analysis using simplified assumptions, the impact of a 0.50 per MMBtu increase or decrease in natural gas prices across the term of the derivative contracts would result in a change of approximately 1.8 billion in the net value of derivatives as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 NRG's discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based upon the condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with GAAP requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance as well as the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. The application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance involves judgments regarding future events, including the likelihood of success of particular projects, legal and regulatory challenges, and the fair value of certain assets and liabilities. These judgments, in and of themselves, could materially affect the financial statements and disclosures based on varying assumptions, which may be appropriate to use. In addition, the financial and operating environment may also have a significant effect, not only on the operation of the business, but on the results reported through the application of accounting measures used in preparing the financial statements and related disclosures, even if the nature of the accounting policies has not changed. 
 NRG evaluates these estimates, on an ongoing basis, utilizing historic experience, consultation with experts and other methods the Company considers reasonable. In any event, actual results may differ substantially from the Company's estimates. Any effects on the Company's business, financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the information that gives rise to the revision becomes known. 
 The Company identifies its most critical accounting estimates as those that are the most pervasive and important to the portrayal of the Company's financial position and results of operations, and require the most difficult, subjective and/or complex judgments by management regarding estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. 
 The Company's critical accounting estimates are described in Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations , in the Company's 2023 Form 10-K. There have been no material changes to the Company's critical accounting estimates since the 2023 Form 10-K.

ITEM 3 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 NRG is exposed to several market risks in the Company's normal business activities. Market risk is the potential loss that may result from market changes associated with the Company's retail operations, merchant power generation or with existing or forecasted financial or commodity transactions. The types of market risks the Company is exposed to are commodity price risk, credit risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk and currency exchange risk. The following disclosures about market risk provide an update to, and should be read in conjunction with, Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, of the Company's 2023 Form 10-K. 
 Commodity Price Risk 
 Commodity price risks result from exposures to changes in spot prices, forward prices, volatilities and correlations between various commodities, such as natural gas, electricity, coal, oil and emissions credits. NRG manages the commodity price risk of the Company's load serving obligations and merchant generation operations by entering into various derivative or non-derivative instruments to hedge the variability in future cash flows from forecasted sales and purchases of energy and fuel. NRG measures the risk of the Company's portfolio using several analytical methods, including sensitivity tests, scenario tests, stress tests, position reports and VaR. NRG uses a Monte Carlo simulation based VaR model to estimate the potential loss in the fair value of its energy assets and liabilities, which includes generation assets, gas transportation and storage assets, load obligations and bilateral physical and financial transactions, based on historical and forward values for factors such as customer demand, weather, commodity availability and commodity prices. The Company's VaR model is based on a one-day holding period at a 95 confidence interval for the forward 36 months, not including the spot month. The VaR model is not a complete picture of all risks that may affect the Company's results. Certain events such as counterparty defaults, regulatory changes, and extreme weather and prices that deviate significantly from historically observed values are not reflected in the model. 
 The following table summarizes average, maximum and minimum VaR for NRG's commodity portfolio, calculated using the VaR model for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

 The Company also uses VaR to estimate the potential loss of derivative financial instruments that are subject to mark-to-market accounting. These derivative instruments include transactions that were entered into for both asset management and trading purposes. The VaR for the derivative financial instruments calculated using the diversified VaR model for the entire term of these instruments entered into for both asset management and trading, was 149 million, as of September 30, 2024, primarily driven by asset-backed and hedging transactions. 
 Credit Risk 
 Credit risk relates to the risk of loss resulting from non-performance or non-payment by counterparties pursuant to the terms of their contractual obligations. NRG is exposed to counterparty credit risk through various activities including wholesale sales, fuel purchases and retail supply arrangements, and retail customer credit risk through its retail sales. Counterparty credit risk and retail customer credit risk are discussed below. See Note 6, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities , to this Form 10-Q for discussion regarding credit risk contingent features. 
 Counterparty Credit Risk 
 The Company's counterparty credit risk policies are disclosed in its 2023 Form 10-K. As of September 30, 2024, counterparty credit exposure, excluding credit exposure from RTOs, ISOs, registered commodity exchanges and certain long-term agreements, was 1.3 billion and NRG held collateral (cash and letters of credit) against those positions of 128 million, resulting in a net exposure of 1.2 billion. NRG periodically receives collateral from counterparties in excess of their exposure. Collateral amounts shown include such excess while net exposure shown excludes excess collateral received. Approximately 30 of the Company's exposure before collateral is expected to roll off by the end of 2025. Counterparty credit exposure is valued through observable market quotes and discounted at a risk free interest rate. The following tables highlight net

counterparty credit exposure by industry sector and by counterparty credit quality. Net counterparty credit exposure is defined as the aggregate net asset position for NRG with counterparties where netting is permitted under the enabling agreement and includes all cash flow, mark-to-market and NPNS, and non-derivative transactions. The exposure is shown net of collateral held and includes amounts net of receivables or payables.

 Category by Counterparty Credit Quality of Total) Investment grade 59 Non-investment grade/Non-Rated 41 Total as of September 30, 2024 100 
 (a) Counterparty credit exposure excludes coal transportation contracts because of the unavailability of market prices 
 (b) The figures in the tables above exclude potential counterparty credit exposure related to RTOs, ISOs, registered commodity exchanges and certain long-term contracts 
 The Company currently has no exposure to wholesale counterparties in excess of 10 of total net exposure discussed above as of September 30, 2024. Changes in hedge positions and market prices will affect credit exposure and counterparty concentration. 
 RTOs and ISOs 
 The Company participates in the organized markets of CAISO, ERCOT, AESO, IESO, ISO-NE, MISO, NYISO and PJM, known as RTOs or ISOs. Trading in the majority of these markets is approved by FERC, whereas in the case of ERCOT, it is approved by the PUCT, and whereas in the case of AESO and IESO, both exist provincially with AESO primarily subject to Alberta Utilities Commission and the IESO to the Ontario Energy Board. These ISOs may include credit policies that, under certain circumstances, require that losses arising from the default of one member on spot market transactions be shared by the remaining participants. As a result, the counterparty credit risk to these markets is limited to NRG s share of the overall market and are excluded from the above exposures. 
 Exchange Traded Transactions 
 The Company enters into commodity transactions on registered exchanges, notably ICE, NYMEX and Nodal. These clearinghouses act as the counterparty and transactions are subject to extensive collateral and margining requirements. As a result, these commodity transactions have limited counterparty credit risk. 
 Long-Term Contracts 
 Counterparty credit exposure described above excludes credit risk exposure under certain long-term contracts, primarily solar under Renewable PPAs. As external sources or observable market quotes are not always available to estimate such exposure, the Company values these contracts based on various techniques including, but not limited to, internal models based on a fundamental analysis of the market and extrapolation of observable market data with similar characteristics. Based on these valuation techniques, as of September 30, 2024, aggregate credit risk exposure managed by NRG to these counterparties was approximately 890 million for the next five years. 
 Retail Customer Credit Risk 
 The Company is exposed to retail credit risk through the Company's retail electricity and gas providers as well as through Vivint Smart Home, which serve both Home and Business customers. Retail credit risk results in losses when a customer fails to pay for services rendered. The losses may result from both non-payment of customer accounts receivable and the loss of in-the-money forward value. The Company manages retail credit risk through the use of established credit policies, which include monitoring of the portfolio and the use of credit mitigation measures such as deposits or prepayment arrangements. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company's retail customer credit exposure to Home and Business customers was diversified across many customers and various industries, as well as government entities. Current economic conditions may affect the Company s customers ability to pay their bills in a timely manner or at all, which could increase customer delinquencies and may lead to an increase in credit losses. 
 
 85 

Liquidity Risk 
 Liquidity risk arises from the general funding needs of the Company's activities and in the management of the Company's assets and liabilities. The Company is currently exposed to additional collateral posting if natural gas prices decline, primarily due to the long natural gas equivalent position at various exchanges used to hedge NRG's retail supply load obligations. 
 Based on a sensitivity analysis for power and gas positions under marginable contracts as of September 30, 2024, a 0.50 per MMBtu decrease in natural gas prices across the term of the marginable contracts would cause an increase in margin collateral posted of approximately 1.3 billion and a 1.00 MMBtu/MWh decrease in heat rates for heat rate positions would result in an increase in margin collateral posted of approximately 338 million. This analysis uses simplified assumptions and is calculated based on portfolio composition and margin-related contract provisions as of September 30, 2024. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 NRG is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates through its issuance of variable rate debt. Exposures to interest rate fluctuations may be mitigated by entering into derivative instruments known as interest rate swaps, caps, collars and put or call options. These contracts reduce exposure to interest rate volatility and result in primarily fixed rate debt obligations when taking into account the combinations of the variable rate debt and the interest rate derivative instrument. NRG's management policies allow the Company to reduce interest rate exposure from variable rate debt obligations. In the first quarter of 2024, the Company entered into interest rate swaps with a total nominal value of 700 million extending through 2029 to hedge the floating rate of the Term Loans. Additionally, as of September 30, 2024, the Company had 1.0 billion of interest rate swaps extending through 2027 to hedge the floating rate on the Vivint Term Loans. In November 2024, in connection with the repayment of the Vivint Term Loans and the increase of the Term Loans, the Company decreased its interest rate swap notional value from 1.7 billion to 700 million. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the fair value and related carrying value of the Company's debt was 10.9 billion and 10.7 billion, respectively. NRG estimates that a 1 decrease in market interest rates would have increased the fair value of the Company's long-term debt as of September 30, 2024 by 464 million. 
 Currency Exchange Risk 
 NRG is subject to transactional exchange rate risk from transactions with customers in countries outside of the United States, primarily within Canada, as well as from intercompany transactions between affiliates. Transactional exchange rate risk arises from the purchase and sale of goods and services in currencies other than the Company's functional currency or the functional currency of an applicable subsidiary. NRG hedges a portion of its forecasted currency transactions with foreign exchange forward contracts. As of September 30, 2024, NRG is exposed to changes in foreign currency primarily associated with the purchase of U.S. dollar denominated natural gas for its Canadian business and entered into foreign exchange contracts with a notional amount of 433 million. 
 The Company is subject to translation exchange rate risk related to the translation of the financial statements of its foreign operations into U.S. dollars. Costs incurred and sales recorded by subsidiaries operating outside of the United States are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates effective during the respective period. As a result, the Company is exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the U.S. dollar, primarily the Canadian and Australian dollars. A hypothetical 10 appreciation in major currencies relative to the U.S. dollar as of September 30, 2024 would have resulted in a decrease of 9 million to net income within the consolidated statement of operations. 

ITEM 4 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of NRG's management, including its principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer, NRG conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, the Company's principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in NRG's internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred in the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, NRG's internal control over financial reporting.

 AS ADOPTED PURSUANT TO 
 SECTION 906 OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002
