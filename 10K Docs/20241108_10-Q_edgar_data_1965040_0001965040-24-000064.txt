 The following discussion and analysis is intended to provide a summary of significant factors relevant to the financial performance and condition of Fortrea Holdings Inc., which we refer to in this discussion and analysis as Fortrea, the Company, our and we . Prior to the spin-off (the Spin or the Separation ), Fortrea existed and functioned as part of Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings, which we refer to in this discussion and analysis as Labcorp or Former Parent. The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited combined financial statements and corresponding notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the Form 10-K and our unaudited condensed consolidated and combined financial statements and corresponding notes in Item 1. Financial Statements. Unless otherwise noted, the following information and discussion relates to our continuing operations. 
 Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements 
 This Form 10-Q and other materials we have filed or will file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC include or will include forward-looking statements. Some of the forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of terms such as believes, expects, may, will, should, could, seeks, approximately, intends, plans, estimates, anticipates, or other comparable terms. These forward-looking statements include all matters that are not related to present facts or current conditions or that are not historical facts. They appear in a number of places throughout this Form 10-Q and include statements regarding our intentions, beliefs, or current expectations concerning, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, prospects and growth strategies, and the industries in which we operate and include, without limitation, statements relating to our future performance. 
 Forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control. We caution you that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and that our actual results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and industry development may differ materially from those made in or suggested by the forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-Q. In addition, even if our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and industry development are consistent with the forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-Q, those results or developments may not be indicative of results or developments in subsequent periods. A number of important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in or implied by the forward-looking statements, including the risks and uncertainties discussed in the Risk Factors Section of our Form 10-K, as filed with the SEC. Factors that could cause actual results to differ from those reflected in forward-looking statements relating to our operations and business include, among other things: the risk that we may not realize some or all of the benefits expected to result from the Spin, or that such benefits are delayed; risks and consequences that are a result of the Spin; the impacts of becoming an independent public company; our reliance on Labcorp to provide financial reporting and other financial and accounting information for periods prior to the Spin through the end of the relevant transition agreements, as well as IT, accounting, finance, legal, human resources, and other services critical to our businesses; our dependence on third parties generally to provide services critical to our businesses throughout the transition period and beyond; the risk that establishment of our accounting, enterprise resource planning, and other management systems post the transition period could cost more or take longer than anticipated; our identification of existing material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting; the impact of our rebranding; our ability to successfully implement our business strategies and execute our long-term value creation strategy; risks and expenses associated with our international operations and currency fluctuations; our customer or therapeutic area concentrations; any further deterioration in the macroeconomic environment, which could lead to defaults or cancellations by our customers; the risk that our backlog and net new business may not grow to the extent we anticipate or over the time period we anticipate, that such measures may not be indicative of our future revenues and that we might not realize all of the anticipated future revenue reflected in our backlog; our ability to generate sufficient net new business awards, or the risk that net new business awards are delayed, terminated, reduced in scope, or fail to go to contract; the risk that we may underprice our contracts, overrun our cost estimates, or fail to receive approval for, or experience delays in

 Company Overview 
 Fortrea, a Delaware corporation incorporated on January 31, 2023, is a leading global contract research organization CRO providing biopharmaceutical product and medical device development services to pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device customers. We offer customers highly flexible delivery models that include Full Service, Functional Service Provider FSP ), and Hybrid Service structures. We have a rich history of providing clinical development services for over 30 years across more than 20 therapeutic areas, first as Covance and later as Labcorp Drug Development. On June 30, 2023, we completed the Spin from Labcorp. We leverage our global scale, scientific expertise, clinical data insights, technology innovation, industry network and decades of experience as a standalone company and as a business unit prior to the Spin to deliver tailored solutions to our customers. With what we believe is a distinctive market offering, Fortrea meets growing global demand for clinical development services. 
 Our team of approximately 15,500 employees conducts operations in approximately 100 countries and delivers comprehensive phase I IV clinical trial management, clinical pharmacology and consulting services for our customers. Our offering is scaled to deliver focused and agile solutions to customers globally, streamlining the biopharmaceutical product and medical device development process. 
 Separation from Labcorp 
 On June 30, 2023, we completed the Spin from Labcorp through a pro-rata distribution of one share of Fortrea common stock for every share of Labcorp common stock held at the close of business on the record date of June 20, 2023. Fortrea began to trade as a separate public company (NASDAQ: FTRE) on July 3, 2023. 
 Incremental Independent Public Company Expenses 
 The condensed consolidated and combined statements of operations include costs for certain centralized functions and programs provided and administered by Labcorp that were allocated to us in the periods presented prior to the Spin. These centralized functions and programs include, but are not limited to, legal, tax, treasury, risk management, sales expenses, IT, human resources, finance, supply chain, executive leadership and stock-based compensation. 
 These expenses were allocated to us based on direct usage when identifiable or, when not directly identifiable, on the basis of proportional net revenues or headcount or another reasonable driver, as applicable. We consider the basis on which the expenses have been allocated to reasonably reflect the utilization of services provided to, or the benefit received by, us during the periods presented. However, the allocations may not reflect the expenses we would have incurred as an independent company for the periods presented and may not be representative of future expenses that may be incurred. Actual costs that may have been incurred if we had been a standalone company would depend on a number of factors, including the organizational structure, whether functions were outsourced or performed by employees, and strategic decisions made in areas such as IT and infrastructure. For a period following the Separation, however, some of these functions are provided by Labcorp under the Transition Services Agreement. 
 The actual costs of services represented by these allocations may vary significantly from the amounts allocated to us in the accompanying financial statements.

 Sale of Assets Relating to the Enabling Services Segment 
 On March 9, 2024, the Company, together with its wholly-owned subsidiary, Fortrea Inc. (the Seller ), entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement with Endeavor Buyer LLC, an affiliate of Arsenal Capital Partners, pursuant to which the Seller agreed to sell, and to cause its affiliates to sell, certain assets relating to its Enabling Services Segment (the Transaction ), including the sale of equity interests of Fortrea Patient Access Inc. and its subsidiaries and Endpoint Clinical, Inc. and its subsidiaries. The final adjusted purchase price for the Transaction was 340.0, subject to customary purchase price adjustments, with 295.0 paid at closing and 45.0 to be paid upon achievement of certain transition-related milestones, which includes certain services provided through a Transition Services Agreement. The Transaction closed during the second quarter of 2024. The decision to sell such assets relating to the Enabling Services Segment represented a strategic shift that had a significant effect on the Company's results and operations and assets and liabilities for the periods presented. As a result, the Company has classified the assets related to the Enabling Services Segment as assets from discontinued operations and liabilities from discontinued operations on the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023. The operations of the Enabling Services Segment have been classified as income or loss from discontinued operations on the condensed consolidated and combined statements of operations for all periods presented. 
 
 Backlog and Net New Business 
 Our backlog consists of anticipated future revenue from business awards that either have not started, or that are in process and have not been completed. Our backlog also reflects any cancellation or adjustment activity related to these awards. The average duration of our contracts will fluctuate from period to period based on the contracts comprising our backlog at any given time. The majority of our contracts contain early termination provisions that typically require notice periods ranging from 30 to 90 days. We adjust backlog for foreign currency fluctuations and exclude from backlog amounts that have been recognized as revenue in our statements of operations. Our backlog was 7.6 billion as of September 30, 2024. 
 We do not believe that, as a sole measure, our backlog is a consistent indicator of future revenue because it has been, and likely will continue to be, affected by a number of factors, including the variable size and duration of projects, many of which are performed over several years, and changes to the scope of work during the course of projects. Additionally, projects may be canceled or delayed by the customer or regulatory authorities. We generally do not have a contractual right to the full amount of the contract award reflected in our backlog. If a customer cancels a contract, we generally will be reimbursed for the costs we have incurred. For a further discussion of the risks relating to our business, see the Risk Factors section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 
 RESULTS OF CONTINUING OPERATIONS

 The Company s revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 674.9, a decrease of 5.4 from revenues of 713.8 in the corresponding period in 2023.

The Company defines organic growth as the change in revenues excluding the year over year impact of acquisitions, divestitures and currency. The 5.7 decrease in organic revenues was primarily driven by decreased pass through costs and lower service revenues resulting from the quantity and burn rate of new business wins pre-Spin, along with the mix of later stage and longer duration studies in our portfolio.

 The increase in Other, net for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared with the corresponding periods in 2023, is primarily related to the recognition of a contingent consideration payment on a sale of a facility to a third party that is no longer in use by the Company and income related to services provided under Transition Services Agreements.

 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company's effective tax rate was 48.3 compared to the 2023 tax rate of 26.5 . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company's effective tax rate was 1.2 compared to the 2023 tax rate of 30.2 . The fluctuations in the quarter-to-date and year-to-date periods were primarily due to valuation allowance, employee benefits, and a foreign rate differential impact. 
 The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has introduced new global minimum tax regulations, known as Pillar Two, that came into effect beginning on January 1, 2024. We are monitoring this development and evaluating its potential impact on our tax rate and eligibility to qualify for the safe harbor provisions. For 2024, we currently anticipate meeting the transitional safe harbors in all jurisdictions and do not expect a material impact to our financial statements. 
 
 Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position 
 The Company manages cash flow to fund and invest in operational growth, capital expenditures, and credit facility repayments. In connection with the Spin, we incurred indebtedness in an aggregate principal amount of 1,640.0, which consists of borrowings under senior secured term loan facilities and senior secured notes. We have also entered into a senior secured revolving credit facility, which consists of a five-year facility in the principal amount of up to 450.0 as further discussed in Note 6 - Debt to our condensed consolidated and combined financial statements. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we paid down 70.2, on term loan A and 412.5, on term loan B, respectively.

 On May 6, 2024, we entered into a three-year 300.0 accounts receivable securitization program (the Receivables Facility ). Under this program, Fortrea Inc. conveys receivable balances to a wholly-owned, bankruptcy-remote special purpose entity, which in turn, may sell receivables to a third-party financial institution in exchange for cash. As of September 30, 2024, we had sold 300.0 of receivables with net proceeds of 297.9. 
 We believe our existing cash and cash flows generated from operations, plus existing credit facilities, will be sufficient to cover the needs of our current and planned operations for at least the next 12 months. From time to time, we routinely evaluate strategic opportunities, including potential acquisitions, joint ventures or investments in complementary businesses. We may also access capital markets through the issuance of debt or equity, which we may use in connection with the acquisition of complementary businesses or other significant assets, or for other strategic opportunities, or general corporate purposes. 
 Cash Flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 The cash flows related to discontinued operations have not been segregated and are included in the condensed consolidated and combined statements of cash flows and the discussion of the cash flow activity. In summary, the Company s cash flows were as follows: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 245.7 150.0 Net cash provided by (used for) investing activities 248.1 (22.8) Net cash used for financing activities (496.7) (133.1) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (0.4) (0.7) Net change in cash and cash equivalents 
 (3.3) (6.6) 
 Cash and Cash Equivalents 
 Cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2024 and 2023 totaled 105.3 and 103.8, respectively. Cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid instruments, such as commercial paper, time deposits and other money market instruments, which have maturities when purchased of three months or less. 
 Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company s operations provided 245.7 of cash as compared to 150.0 of cash provided by operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of 95.7 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to cash from accounts receivable, including the sale of receivables under the Receivables Facility, offset by higher use of cash for interest and income taxes and the decrease in net income. 
 Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
 Net cash provided by investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 248.1 as compared to net cash used for investing activities of 22.8 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The 270.9 increase in net cash provided by investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to 276.6 of net proceeds from the sale of the Enabling Services Segment and a year over year decrease in capital expenditures. Capital expenditures were 28.7 and 30.9 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Capital expenditures in 2024 were 1.4 of revenues, primarily in connection with projects to support growth in the Company's core businesses. The Company intends to continue to pursue selective investments in key therapeutic areas and geographies to drive growth and to improve efficiency of the Company s operations. Such expenditures are expected to be funded primarily by cash flow from operations.

 Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
 Net cash used for financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 496.7 compared to cash used for financing activities of 133.1 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Cash used for financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was related to principal payments on the term loan A and term loan B. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 The Company does not have any off-balance sheet financing other than normal operating leases and letters of credit. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 We have chosen accounting policies that management believes are appropriate to accurately and fairly report our operating results and financial position in conformity with U.S. GAAP. We apply these accounting policies in a consistent manner. Significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the consolidated and combined financial statements included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 The application of these accounting policies require that we make estimates and assumptions about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, contingent assets and liabilities, and related disclosures. These estimates, assumptions and judgments are based on historical experience, current trends and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. If actual results ultimately differ from previous estimates, the revisions are included in results of operations when the actual amounts become known. 
 The accounting policies that involve the most significant estimates, assumptions and management judgments used in preparation of the condensed consolidated and combined financial statements, or are the most sensitive to change due to outside factors, are discussed in Management s Discussion and Analysis in the Form 10-K. Except as disclosed in Note 1 - Basis of Financial Statement Presentation to our condensed consolidated and combined financial statements in this Form 10-Q, pertaining to the adoption of new accounting pronouncements, there have been no material changes in these policies.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk (in millions) 
 Market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and other relevant market rate or price changes. In the ordinary course of business, we are exposed to various market risks, including changes in foreign currency exchange and interest rates, and we regularly evaluate the exposure to such changes. We address our exposure to market risks, principally the market risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, through a controlled program of risk management that may include, from time to time, the use of derivative financial instruments such as foreign currency forward contracts, cross currency swaps and interest rate swap agreements in an effort to manage or hedge some of our risk. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Refer to Note 7- Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities to the condensed consolidated and combined financial statements for information on how the Company utilizes derivative financial instruments. 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Rates 
 Approximately 17.2 and 16.6 of our revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, were denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar USD ). Our financial statements are reported in USD and, accordingly, fluctuations in exchange rates will affect the translation of revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies into USD for purposes of reporting our condensed consolidated and combined financial results. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the year ended December 31, 2023, the most significant currency exchange rate exposure was the Euro. Excluding the impacts from any outstanding or future hedging transactions, a hypothetical change of 10 in average exchange rates used to translate all foreign currencies to USD would have impacted income before income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 by approximately 1.8. Gross accumulated currency translation adjustments recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity were 38.0 and (6.6) at September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. We do not have significant operations in countries in which the economy is considered to be highly inflationary. 
 We earn revenue from service contracts over a period of several months to many years. Accordingly, exchange rate fluctuations during this period may affect our profitability with respect to such contracts. We are also subject to foreign currency transaction risk for fluctuations in exchange rates during the period of time between the consummation and cash settlement of transactions. We enter into foreign currency forward contracts with external counterparties to hedge certain foreign currency transactions with exposure predominantly to the Euro and British Pound. These contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP and the changes in fair value are recorded directly to earnings. 
 Prior to the Spin, these changes in fair value were included in the combined statements of operations as part of corporate allocations. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. The level of our interest rate risk is dependent on our debt exposure and is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates. Historical fluctuations in interest rates have not been significant for us; however, this may vary in the future as we have incurred certain indebtedness concurrent with the Spin and may incur additional indebtedness in the future. 
 In particular, we face the market risks associated with interest rate movements on our variable rate debt. A majority of this debt bears interest at a variable rate, and we entered into a floating-to-fixed interest rate swap with respect to some of our floating rate debt in August 2023. At September 30, 2024, we had 572.0 outstanding related to our variable rate debt. Excluding the impacts from any outstanding or future floating-to-fixed interest rate swap transactions, a hypothetical 1 increase in interest rates would result in increased interest expenses of 5.7. We expect to manage our interest rate risk but expect to be exposed to an element of market risk from changes to interest rates, including on any refinancing of debt. We expect to regularly assess market risks and to establish policies and business practices to protect against the adverse effects of these exposures. See Note 6- Debt to the condensed consolidated and combined financial statements.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )), are our controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Internal controls over financial reporting, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error and the override of controls. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the reliability of financial reporting and financial statement preparation and presentation. Further, because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of our internal controls may vary over time. 
 Our management evaluated, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to accomplish their objectives at the reasonable assurance level due to the material weaknesses described below. 
 Material Weaknesses in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As reported in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, as filed with the SEC on May 24, 2024, management identified material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting that existed because the company did not have sufficient resources which in turn led to an inability to effectively perform certain control activities and fulfill its internal control and accounting responsibilities. As of September 30, 2024, the previously identified material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting had not been remediated. 
 Management believes that the condensed consolidated and combined financial statements and related financial information included in this Form 10-Q fairly present, in all material respects, our balance sheets, statements of operations, comprehensive income and cash flows as of and for the periods presented. 
 Remediation Efforts to Address a Material Weaknesses in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 Remediation of the identified material weaknesses and strengthening our controls and procedures is a priority. In response to the material weaknesses, we are actively implementing a comprehensive remediation plan. We are hiring, developing and working to retain personnel with appropriate accounting and internal controls expertise. Additionally, we have and will continue to review and update (as appropriate) training programs on relevant internal controls over financial reporting matters. We have also engaged experienced third parties to support our remediation efforts. 
 To further remediate the material weaknesses discussed above, management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, have reaffirmed and re-emphasized the importance of internal controls, control consciousness and a strong control environment. We are committed to maintaining a strong control environment and believe that these remediation efforts represent continued improvement in our control environment. We also expect to continue to review, optimize and enhance our financial reporting controls and procedures. 
 The material weaknesses will not be considered remediated until management completes the remediation plan and keeps it in place for a sufficient period of time. The Company is committed to the improvement of its internal control over financial reporting and, together with its outside consultant(s), will continue to develop, refine and implement its remediation plan for the material weaknesses, including responding as necessary to other internal or external factors that may impact execution of the plan.

 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 The Company is in the process of implementing certain changes in its internal controls to remediate the material weaknesses described above. There has been no change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect its internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act). 
 
 PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 See Note 8 - Commitments and Contingent Liabilities to the condensed consolidated and combined financial statements, which is incorporated herein by reference. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 Other than as set forth below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC on March 13, 2024. For a discussion of the risks relating to our business, see the Risk Factors section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements set forth in Part I, Item 2 of this Form 10-Q, and as updated by following. 
 Failure to establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could materially and adversely affect us. 
 As a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 and are required to prepare our financial statements according to the rules and regulations required by the SEC. In addition, the Exchange Act requires that we file annual, quarterly, and current reports. Our failure to prepare and disclose this information in a timely manner or to otherwise comply with applicable law could subject us to penalties under federal securities laws, expose us to lawsuits, and restrict our ability to access financing. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that, among other things, we establish and maintain effective internal controls and procedures for financial reporting and disclosure purposes. Beginning with our second required Annual Report on Form 10-K, which will be filed in 2025, we intend to comply with the applicable sections of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which will require annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and a report by our independent registered public accounting firm on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is complex and may be revised over time to adapt to changes in our business, or changes in applicable accounting rules. We cannot provide assurance that our internal control over financial reporting will be effective in the future or that a material weakness will not be discovered with respect to a prior period for which we had previously believed that internal controls were effective. For example, in connection with preparing the financial statements as of and for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, management identified material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting that existed because we did not have sufficient resources which resulted in an inability to fulfill our internal control and accounting responsibilities. These material weaknesses did not result in any identified material misstatements to our prior annual or interim financial statements. While we are taking actions to remediate the material weaknesses, if we are not able to successfully remediate and test the affected controls and/or we are not able to maintain or document effective internal control over financial reporting, our independent registered public accounting firm will not be able to certify as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Matters affecting our internal controls may cause us to be unable to report our financial information on a timely basis or may cause us to restate previously issued financial information. As a result, we may face potential adverse regulatory consequences, including sanctions or investigations by the SEC, or violations of applicable stock exchange listing rules. There could also be a negative reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of investor confidence in us and the reliability of our financial statements. Confidence in the reliability of our financial statements is also likely to suffer if we or our independent registered public accounting firm reports a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. This could have a material and adverse effect on us by, for example, leading to a decline in our share price and impairing our ability to raise additional capital.

 Item 5. Other Information 
 Director and Officer Trading Arrangements 
 A portion of the compensation of our directors and officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) under the Exchange Act) is in the form of equity awards and, from time to time, directors and officers may engage in open-market transactions with respect to the securities acquired pursuant to such equity awards or other Company securities, including to satisfy tax withholding obligations when equity awards vest or are exercised and for diversification or other personal reasons. 
 Transactions in our securities by directors and officers are required to be made in accordance with our insider trading policy, which requires that the transactions be in accordance with applicable U.S. federal securities laws that prohibit trading while in possession of material nonpublic information. Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act provides an affirmative defense that enables directors and officers to prearrange transactions in our securities in a manner that avoids concerns about initiating transactions while in possession of material nonpublic information. 
 During the quarterly period covered by this report, (as defined in Item 408(c) of Regulation S-K) except as follows: 
 In September 2024, we adopted a policy for awards that will vest in the year ended December 31, 2025 and beyond (unless and until such policy is subsequently terminated or modified by the Company) pursuant to which any participant in our equity incentive plans is required to sell, upon the vesting or settlement of any restricted stock units RSUs or performance share awards PSAs ), a portion of the shares subject to the award sufficient to cover tax withholding obligations and to remit an amount equal to such tax withholding obligations to the Company. In connection with the adoption of the policy, the Management Development and Compensation Committee of our board of directors (the MDCC approved a new form of Restricted Stock Unit Agreement and Performance Share Award Agreement to institute automatic sell-to-cover, and such forms are filed with this Form 10-Q as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2. Additionally, the MDCC and Thomas Pike amended his current RSU Agreement to implement automatic sell-to-cover, and such amendment to Thomas Pike s RSU agreement is filed with this Form 10-Q as Exhibit 10.3. 
 Additionally, on September [16], 2024, Thomas Pike, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Jill McConnell, our Chief Financial Officer, Mark Morais, our Chief Operations Officer and President, Stillman Hanson, our General Counsel, and Robert Parks, our Chief Accounting Officer, entered into trading instructions intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c) of the Exchange Act and to provide for certain sell-to-cover transactions (as described in Rule 10b5-1(c)(1)(ii)(D)(3) of the Exchange Act) with respect to certain RSUs and PSAs (the Sell-to-Cover Instructions ). The Sell-to-Cover Instructions provide for the pre-arranged sale of shares in amounts necessary to satisfy our tax withholding obligations arising exclusively from the vesting of certain RSUs and PSAs, which will be based on the then fair market value of the shares of our common stock subject to the RSUs or PSAs, as applicable, that are settled on each applicable vesting date. The proceeds of any such sale will be delivered to the Company in satisfaction of such tax withholding obligations. 
 45 

Table of Contents 

 The Sell-to-Cover Instructions are subject to applicable cooling-off periods, consistent with Rule 10b5-1(c)(1)(ii)(B) of the Exchange Act. Each of the relevant officer s Sell-to-Cover Instructions apply with respect to the first award of RSUs or PSAs granted by us after the Separation (including any converted equity grants from Former Parent) or the officer s hire date (if later), and any RSUs or PSAs that may be granted to them by us from time to time following such date, other than any future granted RSUs or PSAs which by the terms of the applicable award agreements or by a policy of the Company then in effect require us to withhold shares to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting and settlement of such RSUs or PSAs or that do not permit sell-to-cover transactions. The amount of shares to be sold to satisfy our tax withholding obligations under these arrangements is dependent on future events which cannot be known at this time, including the future trading price of our shares. The expiration date relating to an officer s Sell-to-Cover Instructions is dependent on future events which cannot be known at this time, including the final vesting date of certain RSUs and PSAs and such officer s termination of service.

 It is intended that the Agreement comply with Section 409A to the extent subject thereto, and, accordingly, to the maximum extent permitted, the Agreement will be interpreted and administered to be in compliance with Section 409A.
