 At February 29, 2024, the date of our annual impairment review, the estimated fair value exceeded the carrying value for all reporting units and accordingly, no impairment charge was taken. The estimates and assumptions made in assessing the fair value of our reporting units and the valuation of the underlying assets and liabilities are inherently subject to significant uncertainties related to future sales, gross margins, and advertising and marketing expenses, which can be impacted by increases in competition, changing consumer preferences, technical advances, supply chain constraints, labor shortages, and inflation. The discount rate assumption may be influenced by such factors as changes in interest rates and rates of inflation, which can have an impact on the determination of fair value.

 At February 29, 2024, the date of our annual impairment review, the estimated fair value exceeded the carrying value for all intangible assets and, accordingly, no impairment charge was taken. The assumptions subject to significant uncertainties in the impairment analysis include the discount rate utilized in the analysis, as well as future sales, gross margins, and advertising and marketing expenses. The discount rate assumption may be influenced by such factors as changes in interest rates and rates of inflation, which can have an impact on the determination of fair value. Additionally, should the related fair values of intangible assets be adversely affected as a result of declining sales or margins caused by competition, changing consumer needs or preferences, technological advances, changes in advertising and marketing expenses, or the potential impacts of supply chain constraints, labor shortages, or inflation, we may be required to record impairment charges in the future. As of September 30, 2024, no events have occurred that would indicate potential impairment of intangible assets.

 and for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was due to the impact of discrete items primarily pertaining to state tax changes and stock-based compensation. The effective tax rates used in the calculation of income taxes were and for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the six months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the six months ended September 30, 2023 was due to discrete items primarily pertaining to the release of a reserve for uncertain tax positions due to the statute of limitations expiring.

Walmart accounted for approximately and , respectively, of our gross revenues for the three and six months ended September 30, 2023.

In both the three and six months ended September 30, 2023, Amazon accounted for approximately of gross revenues. 
 
 Our product distribution in the United States is managed by a third-party through one primary distribution center in Clayton, Indiana. We also operate a manufacturing facility in Lynchburg, Virginia, which manufactures certain of our Fleet , Monistat and Summer's Eve products, and a manufacturing facility in Victoria, Australia, which manufactures some of our Hydralyte products. A natural disaster, such as tornado, earthquake, flood, or fire, at our distribution center or our own or a third-party manufacturing facility could damage our inventory and/or materially impair our ability to distribute our products to customers in a timely manner or at a reasonable cost. In addition, a serious disruption caused by performance or contractual issues with our third-party distribution manager, or labor shortages or contagious disease outbreaks or other public health emergencies at our distribution center or manufacturing facilities could also materially impact our product distribution. Any disruption could result in increased costs, expense and/or shipping times, and could harm our reputation and cause us to incur customer fees and penalties. We could also incur significantly higher costs and experience longer lead times should we be required to replace our distribution center, the third-party distribution manager or the manufacturing facilities. As a result, any serious disruption could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, we had relationships with third-party manufacturers. Of those, we had long-term contracts with manufacturers that produced items that accounted for approximately of gross sales for the six months ended September 30, 2024. At September 30, 2023, we had relationships with third-party manufacturers. Of those, we had long-term contracts with manufacturers that produced items that accounted for approximately of gross sales for the six months ended September 30, 2023. One of our suppliers, a privately owned pharmaceutical manufacturer with whom we have a long-term supply agreement, produced products that accounted for more than 10 of our gross revenues for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. This manufacturer accounted for approximately of our gross revenues for the six months ended September 30, 2024, and approximately of our gross revenues for the six months ended September 30, 2023, while we accounted for a significant portion of their gross revenues over both time periods. No other single third-party supplier produces products that account for 10 or more of our gross revenues. The fact that we do not have long-term contracts with certain manufacturers means that they could cease manufacturing our products at any time and for any reason or initiate arbitrary and costly price increases, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Although we are continually in the process of negotiating long-term contracts with certain key manufacturers, we may not be able to reach a timely agreement, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as well as our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024. This discussion and analysis may contain forward-looking statements that involve certain risks, assumptions and uncertainties. Future results could differ materially from the discussion that follows for many reasons, including the factors described in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024 and in future reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). 
 
 See also Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements on page 31 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 Unless otherwise indicated by the context, all references in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to we, us, our, the Company or Prestige refer to Prestige Consumer Healthcare Inc. and our subsidiaries. Similarly, references to a year (e.g., 2025) refers to our fiscal year ended March 31 of that year. 
 
 General 
 We are engaged in the development, manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution of well-recognized, brand name, over-the-counter ("OTC") health and personal care products to mass merchandisers, drug, food, dollar, convenience, and club stores and e-commerce channels in North America (the United States and Canada) and in Australia and certain other international markets. We use the strength of our brands, our established retail distribution network, a low-cost operating model and our experienced management team to our competitive advantage. 
 
 We have grown our brand portfolio both organically and through acquisitions. We develop our existing brands by investing in new product lines, brand extensions and strong advertising support. Acquisitions of consumer health and personal care brands have also been an important part of our growth strategy. We have acquired well-recognized brands from consumer products and pharmaceutical companies and private equity firms. While many of these brands have long histories of brand development and investment, we believe that, at the time we acquired them, most were considered non-core by their previous owners. As a result, these acquired brands did not benefit from adequate management focus and marketing support during the period prior to their acquisition, which created opportunities for us to reinvigorate these brands and improve their performance post-acquisition. After adding a core brand to our portfolio, we seek to increase its sales, market share and distribution in both existing and new channels through our established retail distribution network. We pursue this growth through increased spending on advertising and marketing support, new sales and marketing strategies, improved packaging and formulations, and innovative development of brand extensions. 
 
 Economic Environment 
 There has been economic uncertainty in the United States and globally due to several factors, including global supply chain constraints, changes in interest rates, a high inflationary environment and geopolitical events. We expect economic conditions will continue to be highly volatile and uncertain, put pressure on prices and supply, and could affect demand for our products. We have continued to see changes in the purchasing patterns of our end customers, including a shift in many markets to purchasing our products online. 
 
 The volatile environment has impacted the supply of labor and raw materials and exacerbated rising input costs. We have and may continue to experience shortages, delays and backorders for certain ingredients and products, difficulty scheduling shipping for our products, as well as price increases from many of our suppliers for both shipping and product costs. Certain of our third-party manufacturers are currently having, and have had in the past, difficulty meeting demand, which is and has caused shortages of our products, particularly eye care products. These shortages negatively impacted our results of operations and we expect further shortages may have a negative impact on our sales. If conditions cause further disruption in the global supply chain, the availability of labor and materials or otherwise further increase costs, it may materially affect our operations and those of third parties on which we rely, including causing material disruptions in the supply and distribution of our products. The extent to which these conditions impact our results and liquidity will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including global supply chain constraints, inflation, global conflicts and instability, and the potential for further outbreaks of severe illnesses. These effects could have a material adverse impact on our business, liquidity, capital resources, and results of operations and those of the third parties on which we rely. 
 
 Global Minimum Tax 
 -21- 

Numerous countries have agreed to a statement in support of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ("OECD") model rules that propose a global minimum tax rate of 15 . Certain countries have enacted legislation incorporating the agreed upon global minimum tax effective in 2024. This legislation has not and is not expected to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. As legislation becomes effective in more countries in which we do business, our taxes could increase and negatively impact our provision for income taxes. We continue to monitor pending legislation and implementation by countries and to evaluate the potential impact on our business in future periods.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Liquidity 
 Our primary source of cash comes from our cash flow from operations. In the past, we have supplemented this source of cash with various debt facilities, primarily in connection with acquisitions. We have financed our operations, and expect to continue to finance our operations for the next twelve months and the foreseeable future, with a combination of funds generated from operations and borrowings. Our principal uses of cash are for operating expenses, debt service, share repurchases, capital expenditures, and acquisitions. Based on our current levels of operations and anticipated growth, excluding acquisitions, we believe that our cash generated from operations and our existing credit facilities will be adequate to finance our working capital and capital expenditures through the next twelve months. See "Economic Environment" above. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 51.5 million, an increase of 5.1 million from March 31, 2024. The following table summarizes the change: 
 Six Months Ended September 30, (In thousands) 2024 2023 Change Cash provided by (used in): Operating Activities 124,576 110,547 14,029 Investing Activities (4,157) (611) (3,546) Financing Activities (116,722) (107,728) (8,994) Effects of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 1,374 (630) 2,004 Net change in cash and cash equivalents 5,071 1,578 3,493 
 
 Operating Activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 124.6 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 110.5 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023. The 14.0 million increase was due to decreased working capital, partly offset by a decrease in net income before non-cash items. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 4.2 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 0.6 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in cash used for investing activities of 3.5 million was primarily attributable to changes in a short term loan receivable, partly offset by a decrease in capital expenditures.

Financing Activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 116.7 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 107.7 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023. The 9.0 million increase was primarily due to an increase in the purchase of shares of our common stock of 12.8 million and a decrease in the proceeds from the exercise of stock options of 5.6 million, partly offset by a decrease in term loan repayments of 10.0 million. 
 
 Capital Resources 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had an aggregate of 1.1 billion of outstanding indebtedness, which consisted of the following: 
 
 400.0 million of 5.125 2019 senior unsecured notes, which mature on January 15, 2028 (the "2019 Senior Notes"); 
 600.0 million of 3.750 2021 senior unsecured notes, which mature on April 1, 2031 (the "2021 Senior Notes"); and 
 60.0 million of borrowings under the Term B-5 Loans under our term loan originally entered into on January 31, 2012 (the "2012 Term Loan due July 1, 2028. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had no outstanding balance on our asset-based revolving credit facility originally entered into on January 31, 2012 (the "2012 ABL Revolver and a borrowing capacity of 173.9 million. 
 
 Since we have made optional payments that exceed all of our required quarterly payments, we will not be required to make another payment on the 2012 Term Loan until maturity.

 Covenants: 
 Our debt facilities contain various financial covenants, including provisions that require us to maintain certain leverage, interest coverage and fixed charge ratios. The credit agreement governing the 2012 Term Loan and the 2012 ABL Revolver and the indentures governing the 2021 Senior Notes and 2019 Senior Notes contain provisions that accelerate our indebtedness on certain changes in control and restrict us from undertaking specified corporate actions, including asset dispositions, acquisitions, payments of dividends and other specified payments, repurchasing our equity securities in the public markets, incurrence of indebtedness, creation of liens, making loans and investments and transactions with affiliates. Specifically, we must: 
 
 Have a leverage ratio of less than 6.50 to 1.0 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 and thereafter (defined as, with certain adjustments, the ratio of our consolidated total net debt as of the last day of the fiscal quarter to our trailing twelve month consolidated net income before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, non-cash charges and certain other items EBITDA )); 
 
 Have an interest coverage ratio of greater than 2.25 to 1.0 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 and thereafter (defined as, with certain adjustments, the ratio of our consolidated EBITDA to our trailing twelve month consolidated cash interest expense); and 
 
 Have a fixed charge ratio of greater than 1.0 to 1.0 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 (defined as, with certain adjustments, the ratio of our consolidated EBITDA minus capital expenditures to our trailing twelve month consolidated interest paid, taxes paid and other specified payments). Our fixed charge requirement remains level throughout the term of the debt facilities. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with the applicable financial and restrictive covenants under the 2012 Term Loan and the 2012 ABL Revolver and the indentures governing the 2021 Senior Notes and the 2019 Senior Notes. 
 -29- 

Management anticipates that in the normal course of operations, we will be in compliance with the financial and restrictive covenants during the next twelve months. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Although these estimates are based on our knowledge of current events and actions that we may undertake in the future, actual results could differ from those estimates. A summary of our critical accounting policies is presented in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024. There were no material changes to our critical accounting policies during the six months ended September 30, 2024.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 
 We are exposed to changes in interest rates because our 2012 Term Loan and 2012 ABL Revolver are variable rate debt. At September 30, 2024, approximately 60.0 million of our debt carries a variable rate of interest. 
 
 Holding other variables constant, including levels of indebtedness, a one percentage point increase in interest rates on our variable rate debt would have had an adverse impact on both pre-tax income and cash flows for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 of approximately 0.2 million and 0.5 million, respectively. 
 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk 
 
 During the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, approximately 15.3 and 14.5 , respectively, of our gross revenues were denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. During the three and six months ended September 30, 2023, approximately 13.5 and 12.7 , respectively, of our gross revenues were denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. As such, we are exposed to transactions that are sensitive to foreign currency exchange rates. These transactions are primarily with respect to the Canadian and Australian Dollars. 
 
 We performed a sensitivity analysis with respect to exchange rates for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Holding all other variables constant, and assuming a hypothetical 10.0 adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates, this analysis resulted in a less than 5.0 impact on pre-tax income of approximately 2.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and approximately 4.1 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024. It represented a less than 5.0 impact on pre-tax income of approximately 2.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 4.1 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 The Company's management, with the participation of its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a 15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act ), as of September 30, 2024. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 
 You should carefully consider the risk factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A. "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2024, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. The risk factors described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K have not materially changed in the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, but such risks are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 
 Our quarterly operating results and revenues may fluctuate as a result of any of these or other factors. Accordingly, results for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year, and revenues for 
 -33- 

any particular future period may decrease. In the future, operating results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors. In that event, the market price of our outstanding securities could be adversely impacted.
