 CAUTION ARY STATEMENT REGARDIN G FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 
 This report contains forward-looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. You can identify these statements by the use of forward-looking terminology such as may, will, should, expect, anticipate, project, target, estimate, intend, continue or believe or the negatives of, or other variations on, these terms or comparable terminology. You should read statements that contain these words carefully because they discuss our plans, strategies, prospects and expectations concerning our business, operating results, financial condition and other similar matters. We believe that it is important to communicate our future expectations to our investors. Our forward-looking statements include information in this report regarding general domestic and global economic conditions, our future financing plans, our ability to operate as a business development company BDC and the expected performance of, and the yield on, our portfolio companies. There may be events in the future, however, that we are not able to predict accurately or control. The factors listed under Risk Factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as well as any cautionary language in this report, provide examples of risks, uncertainties and events that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations we describe in our forward-looking statements. The occurrence of the events described in these risk factors and elsewhere in this report could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. Any forward-looking statement made by us in this report speaks only as of the date of this report. Factors or events that could cause our actual results to differ from our forward-looking statements may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. We undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. You are advised to consult any additional disclosures that we may make directly to you or through reports that we have filed or in the future may file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ), including annual reports on Form 10-K, registration statements on Form N-2, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. The safe harbor provisions of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), which preclude civil liability for certain forward-looking statements, do not apply to the forward-looking statements in this quarterly report because we are an investment company. The following factors are among those that may cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements: 
 
 our future operating results; 

disruptions in the capital markets, market conditions, and general economic uncertainty; 

changes in political, economic, social or industry conditions, the interest rate environment or conditions affecting the financial and capital markets, including the effect of any pandemic or epidemic;

the use of borrowed money to finance a portion of our investments;

the timing of cash flows, if any, from the operations of our portfolio companies;

the impact of changing inflation and interest rates and the risk of recession on our portfolio companies; 

the impact of the 2024 U.S. presidential election; 

the effect of global climate change on our portfolio companies;

The Management Fee for any partial quarter will be appropriately prorated. The Investment Adviser waives a portion of its management fee payable by the Company in an amount equal to the management fees it earns as an investment adviser for any affiliated money market funds in which the Company invests. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, Management Fees amounted to and . As of September 30, 2024, remained payable. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, Management Fees amounted to and . Incentive Fee Pursuant to the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Company pays to the Investment Adviser an incentive fee (the Incentive Fee as follows: a) Incentive Fee is payable to the Investment Adviser until the Company has made cumulative distributions pursuant to this clause (a) equal to aggregate Contributed Capital (as defined below); 

 return per annum, compounded annually, on aggregate unreturned Contributed Capital, from the date each capital contribution is made through the date such capital has been returned; 

 c) Third, subject to clauses (a) and (b), the Investment Adviser is entitled to an Incentive Fee equal to of all amounts designated by the Company as proceeds intended for distribution and Incentive Fee payments, until such time as the cumulative Incentive Fee paid to the Investment Adviser pursuant to this clause (c) is equal to of the amount by which the sum of (i) cumulative distributions to Unitholders pursuant to clauses (a) and (b) above and (ii) the cumulative Incentive Fee previously paid to the Investment Adviser pursuant to this clause exceeds Contributed Capital; and 

 d) Fourth, at any time that clause (c) has been satisfied, the Investment Adviser is entitled to an Incentive Fee equal to of all amounts designated by the Company as proceeds intended for distribution and Incentive Fee payments. 

The Incentive Fee is calculated on a cumulative basis and the amount of the Incentive Fee payable prior to a proposed distribution will be determined and, if applicable, paid in accordance with the foregoing formula each time amounts are to be distributed to the Unitholders. The Incentive Fee is a fee owed by the Company to the Investment Adviser and is not paid out of distributions made to Unitholders. In no event will an amount be paid with respect to the Incentive Fee to the extent it would cause the aggregate amount of the Company s capital gains paid in respect of the Incentive Fee to exceed of the Company s realized capital gains computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation, in each case determined on a cumulative basis from inception of the Company through the date of the proposed payment (the Incentive Fee Cap ). Contributed Capital is the aggregate amount of capital contributions that have been made by all Unitholders in respect of their Units to the Company. All distributions (or deemed distributions), including investment income (i.e. proceeds received in respect of interest payments, dividends and fees) and proceeds attributable to the repayment or disposition of any Investment, to Unitholders will be considered a return of Contributed Capital. Unreturned Contributed Capital equals aggregate Contributed Capital minus cumulative distributions but is never less than zero. The term proceeds intended for distribution and Incentive Fee payments includes proceeds from the full or partial realization of the Company s investments and income from investing activities and may include return of capital, ordinary income and capital gains. If, at the termination of the Company, the Investment Adviser has received aggregate payments of Incentive Fees in excess of the amount the Investment Adviser would have received had the Incentive Fees been determined upon such termination, then the Investment Adviser will reimburse the Company for the difference between the amount of Incentive Fees actually received and the amount determined at termination (the Investment Adviser Reimbursement Obligation ). However, the Investment Adviser will not be required to reimburse the Company an amount greater than the aggregate Incentive Fees paid to the Investment Adviser, reduced by the excess (if any) of (a) the aggregate federal, state and local income tax liability the Investment Adviser incurred in connection with the payment of such Incentive Fees (assuming the highest marginal applicable federal and New York city and state income tax rates applied to such payments), over (b) an amount equal to the U.S. federal and state tax benefits available to the Investment Adviser by virtue of the payment made by the Investment Adviser pursuant to its Investment Adviser Reimbursement Obligation (assuming that, to the extent such payments are deductible by the Investment Adviser, the benefit of such deductions will be computed using the then highest marginal applicable federal and New York city and state income tax rates).

Due To Affiliates The Investment Adviser pays certain general and administrative expenses, including legal expenses, on behalf of the Company in the ordinary course of business. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were and , respectively, included within Accrued expenses and other liabilities paid by the Investment Adviser and its affiliates on behalf of the Company. Co-Investment Activity In certain circumstances, the Company can make negotiated co-investments pursuant to an exemptive order from the SEC permitting it to do so. On November 16, 2022, the SEC granted to the Investment Adviser, the BDCs advised by the Investment Adviser and certain other affiliated applicants exemptive relief on which the Company expects to rely to co-invest alongside certain other client accounts managed by the Investment Adviser (collectively with the Company, the Accounts ), which may include proprietary accounts of Goldman Sachs, in a manner consistent with the Company's investment objectives and strategies, certain Board-established criteria, the conditions of such exemptive relief and other pertinent factors (as amended, the Relief ). On June 25, 2024, the SEC granted an amendment to the Relief, which permits the Company to participate in follow-on investments in the Company s existing portfolio companies with certain affiliates covered by the Relief if such affiliates, that are not BDCs or registered investment companies, have an investment in such existing portfolio company. Additionally, if the Investment Adviser forms other funds in the future, the Company may co-invest alongside such other affiliates, subject to compliance with the Relief, applicable regulations and regulatory guidance, as well as applicable allocation procedures. As a result of the Relief, there could be significant overlap in the Company s investment portfolio and the investment portfolios of other Accounts, including, in some cases, proprietary accounts of Goldman Sachs. The Goldman Sachs Asset Management Private Credit Team is composed of investment professionals dedicated to the Company s investment strategy and to other funds that share a similar investment strategy with the Company. The Goldman Sachs Asset Management Private Credit Team is responsible for identifying investment opportunities, conducting research and due diligence on prospective investments, negotiating and structuring the Company s investments and monitoring and servicing the Company s investments. The team works together with investment professionals who are primarily focused on investment strategies in syndicated, liquid credit. Under the terms of the Relief, a required majority (as defined in Section 57(o) of the Investment Company Act) of the Company s independent directors must make certain conclusions in connection with a co-investment transaction, including that (1) the terms of the proposed transaction are reasonable and fair to the Company and the Company s Unitholders and do not involve overreaching in respect of the Company or its Unitholders on the part of any person concerned, and (2) the transaction is consistent with the interests of the Company s Unitholders and is consistent with the then-current investment objectives and strategies of the Company.

As noted above, the income and market approaches were used in the determination of fair value of certain Level 3 assets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The significant unobservable inputs used in the income approach are the discount rate or market yield used to discount the estimated future cash flows expected to be received from the underlying investment, which include both future principal and interest payments. An increase in the discount rate or market yield would result in a decrease in the fair value. Included in the consideration and selection of discount rates or market yields is risk of default, rating of the investment, call provisions and comparable company investments. The significant unobservable inputs used in the market approach are based on market comparable transactions and market multiples of publicly traded comparable companies. Increase in market comparable transactions or market multiples would result in an increase in the fair value .

Please see Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements for a discussion of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with this discussion and analysis. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by such forward-looking information due to factors discussed under Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements appearing elsewhere in this report. 
 OVERVIEW 
 We are a specialty finance company that has been focused on lending to middle-market companies. We are a closed-end management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a business development company BDC under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "Investment Company Act"). In addition, we have elected to be treated as a regulated investment company RIC under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ), and we expect to qualify annually for tax treatment as a RIC, commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2016. From our commencement of investment operations on July 1, 2016 through September 30, 2024, we originated approximately 2.34 billion in aggregate principal amount of debt and equity investments prior to any subsequent exits and repayments. We have sought to generate current income and, to a lesser extent, capital appreciation primarily through direct originations of secured debt, including first lien, unitranche debt, including last-out portions of such loans, and second lien debt, and unsecured debt, including mezzanine debt, as well as through select equity investments. 
 Unitranche loans are first lien loans that extend deeper in a borrower s capital structure than traditional first lien debt and may provide for a waterfall of cash flow priority between different lenders in such loan. In a number of instances, we may find another lender to provide the first-out portion of a unitranche loan while we retain the last-out portion of such loan, in which case, the first-out portion of the loan would generally receive priority with respect to the payment of principal, interest and any other amounts due thereunder as compared to the last-out portion that we would continue to hold. In exchange for taking greater risk of loss, the last-out portion generally earns a higher interest rate than the first-out portion of the loan. We use the term mezzanine to refer to debt that ranks senior in right of payment only to a borrower s equity securities and ranks junior in right of payment to all of such borrower s other indebtedness. We may make multiple investments in the same portfolio company. 
 During our investment period, we sought to invest, under normal circumstances, at least 80 of our net assets (plus any borrowings for investment purposes), directly or indirectly in private middle-market credit obligations and related instruments. We define credit obligations and related instruments for this purpose as any fixed-income instrument, including loans to, and bonds and preferred stock of, portfolio companies and other instruments that provide exposure to such fixed-income instruments. Middle market is used to refer to companies with between 5 million and 200 million of annual earnings before interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization EBITDA ), excluding certain one-time and non-recurring items that are outside the operations of these companies. While, as a result of fluctuations in the net asset value NAV of one asset relative to other assets, private middle-market credit obligations and related instruments may represent less than 80 of our net assets (plus any borrowings for investment purposes) at any time, we could not invest, under normal circumstances, more than 20 of our net assets (plus any borrowings for investment purposes) in securities and other instruments that were not private middle-market credit obligations and related instruments. To the extent we determined to invest indirectly in private middle-market credit obligations and related instruments, we would invest through certain synthetic instruments, including derivatives that had similar economic characteristics to private middle-market credit obligations. For purposes of determining compliance with our 80 policy, each applicable derivative instrument will be valued based upon its market value. We will notify our unitholders (the "Unitholders") at least 60 days prior to any change to the 80 investment policy described above. 
 We have also originated covenant-lite loans, which are loans with fewer financial maintenance covenants than other obligations, or no financial maintenance covenants. Such covenant-lite loans may not include terms that allow the lender to monitor the performance of the borrower or to declare a default if certain criteria are breached. These flexible covenants (or the absence of covenants) could permit borrowers to experience a significant downturn in their results of operations without triggering any default that would permit holders of their debt (such as us) to accelerate indebtedness or negotiate terms and pricing. In the event of default, covenant-lite loans may recover less value than traditional loans as the lender may not have an opportunity to negotiate with the borrower prior to such default.

 We expect that at least 70 of our total assets will be invested, directly or indirectly, in middle-market companies domiciled in the United States. However, we may from time to time invest opportunistically in large U.S. companies, non-U.S. companies, stressed or distressed debt, structured products, private equity or other opportunities, subject to limits imposed by the Investment Company Act. 
 While our investment program has been focused primarily on debt investments, our investments may include equity features, such as a direct investment in the equity or convertible securities of a portfolio company or warrants or options to buy a minority interest in a portfolio company. Any warrants we may receive with debt securities will generally require only a nominal cost to exercise, so as a portfolio company appreciates in value, we may achieve additional investment return from these equity investments. We may structure the warrants to provide provisions protecting our rights as a minority-interest holder, as well as puts, or rights to sell such securities back to the portfolio company, upon the occurrence of specified events. In many cases, we may also obtain registration rights in connection with these equity investments, which may include demand and piggyback registration rights. 
 For a discussion of the competitive landscape we face, please see Item 1A. Risk Factors Competition We operate in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities and Item 1. Business Competitive Advantages in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 KEY COMPONENTS OF OPERATIONS 
 Investments 
 Our level of investment activity can and does vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors, including the amount of debt and equity capital available to middle-market companies, the level of merger and acquisition activity for such companies, the general economic environment, the amount of capital we have available to us and the competitive environment for the type of investments we make. 
 As a BDC, we may not acquire any assets other than qualifying assets specified in the Investment Company Act, unless, at the time the acquisition is made, at least 70 of our total assets are qualifying assets (with certain limited exceptions). Qualifying assets include investments in eligible portfolio companies. Pursuant to rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ), eligible portfolio companies include certain companies that do not have any securities listed on a national securities exchange and public companies whose securities are listed on a national securities exchange but whose market capitalization is less than 250 million. 
 Revenues 
 We generate revenues in the form of interest income on debt investments and, to a lesser extent, capital gains and distributions, if any, on equity securities that we may acquire in portfolio companies. Some of our investments may provide for deferred interest payments or payment-in-kind PIK income. The principal amount of the debt investments and any accrued but unpaid interest generally becomes due at the maturity date. 
 We generate revenues primarily through receipt of interest income from the investments we hold. In addition, we may generate revenue in the form of commitment, origination, structuring, syndication, exit fees or diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance and consulting fees. Portfolio company fees (directors fees, consulting fees, administrative fees, tax advisory fees and other similar compensation) will be paid to us, unless, to the extent required by applicable law or exemptive relief, if any, therefrom, we receive our allocable portion of such fees when invested in the same portfolio company as other client accounts managed by our Investment Adviser (collectively with the Company, the Accounts ), which other Accounts could receive their allocable portion of such fee. We do not expect to receive material fee income as it is not our principal investment strategy. We record contractual prepayment premiums on loans and debt securities as interest income. 
 Dividend income on preferred equity investments is recorded on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the portfolio company and are expected to be collected. Dividend income on common equity investments is recorded on the record date for private portfolio companies and on the ex-dividend date for publicly traded portfolio companies. Interest and dividend income are presented net of withholding tax, if any.

 Expenses 
 Our primary operating expenses include the payment of the management fee (the Management Fee and the incentive fee (the Incentive Fee to our Investment Adviser, legal and professional fees, interest and other debt expenses and other operating and overhead related expenses. The Management Fee and Incentive Fee compensate our Investment Adviser for its work in identifying, evaluating, negotiating, closing and monitoring our investments. Pursuant to an investment advisory agreement with the Investment Adviser (the Investment Advisory Agreement ), Company expenses borne by us in the ordinary course on an annual basis (excluding Management Fees, Incentive Fees, organizational and start-up expenses and leverage-related expenses) will not exceed an amount equal to 0.5 of the aggregate amount of commitments to us by holders of common units of our limited liability company interests Units provided, however, that expenses incurred outside of the ordinary course, including litigation and similar expenses, are not subject to such cap. We bear all other expenses of our operations and transactions in accordance with our Investment Advisory Agreement and administration agreement (the Administration Agreement ), including: 
 our operational and organizational expenses; 

fees and expenses, including travel expenses, incurred by our Investment Adviser or payable to third parties related to our investments, including, among others, professional fees (including the fees and expenses of consultants and experts) and fees and expenses from evaluating, monitoring, researching and performing due diligence on investments and prospective investments; 

interest, fees and other expenses payable on indebtedness for borrowed money (including through the issuance of notes and other evidence of indebtedness), other indebtedness, financings or extensions of credit, if any, incurred by us; 

fees and expenses incurred by us in connection with membership in investment company organizations; 

brokers commissions; 

fees and expenses associated with calculating our NAV (including expenses of any independent valuation firm); 

legal, auditing or accounting expenses; 

taxes or governmental fees; 

the fees and expenses of our administrator, transfer agent or sub-transfer agent; 

the cost of preparing unit certificates or any other expenses, including clerical expenses of issue or repurchase of our Units; 

the expenses of and fees for registering or qualifying our Units for sale and of maintaining our registration or qualifying and registering us as a broker or a dealer; 

the fees and expenses of our directors who are not affiliated with our Investment Adviser; 

the cost of preparing and distributing reports, proxy statements and notices to our Unitholders, the SEC and other regulatory authorities; 

costs of holding Unitholder meetings; 

the fees or disbursements of custodians of our assets, including expenses incurred in the performance of any obligations enumerated by limited liability company agreement or other organizational documents insofar as they govern agreements with any such custodian; 

insurance premiums; and 

costs incurred in connection with any claim, litigation, arbitration, mediation, government investigation or dispute in connection with our business and the amount of any judgment or settlement paid in connection therewith, or the enforcement of our rights against any person and indemnification or contribution expenses payable by us to any person and other extraordinary expenses not incurred in the ordinary course of our business. 

Our Investment Adviser will not be required to pay expenses of activities which are primarily intended to result in sales of Units. 
 We expect our general and administrative expenses to be relatively stable or to decline as a percentage of total assets during periods of asset growth and to increase during periods of asset declines.

 Leverage 
 We may borrow money and lever our investment portfolio, subject to the limitations of the Investment Company Act, with the objective of increasing our yield. This is known as leverage and could increase or decrease returns to our Unitholders. The use of leverage involves significant risks. As a BDC, with certain limited exceptions, we are only permitted to borrow amounts such that our asset coverage ratio, as defined in the Investment Company Act, equals at least 200 after such borrowing (or 150 if certain requirements are met). As of September 30, 2024, the JPM Revolving Credit Facility had been fully repaid and was terminated, and as a result, there were no senior securities outstanding. As of December 31, 2023, our asset coverage ratio based on the aggregate amount outstanding of our senior securities (which included the JPM Revolving Credit Facility prior to its termination) was 726 . The Small Business Credit Availability Act modified the applicable provisions of the Investment Company Act to reduce the required asset coverage ratio applicable to BDCs to 150 , subject to certain approval and disclosure requirements and, in the case of BDCs without common equity listed on a national securities exchange, such as us, an offer to repurchase shares held by the BDC s stockholders as of the date the requisite approval is obtained. As a result, BDCs are able to increase their leverage capacity if shareholders approve a proposal to do so. If a BDC receives shareholder approval, it would be allowed to increase its leverage capacity on the first day after such approval. Alternatively, the legislation allows the majority of the directors who are not interested persons, as defined in the Investment Company Act, of the BDC to approve an increase in its leverage capacity, and such approval would become effective after one year. Certain trading practices and investments, such as reverse repurchase agreements, may be considered borrowings or involve leverage and thus may be subject to Investment Company Act restrictions. Short-term credits necessary for the settlement of securities transactions and arrangements with respect to securities lending will not be considered borrowings for these purposes. Practices and investments that may involve leverage but are not considered borrowings are not subject to the Investment Company Act s asset coverage requirement. The amount of leverage that we employ will depend on the assessment by our Investment Adviser and our board of directors (the "Board of Directors" or the "Board") of market conditions and other factors at the time of any proposed borrowing.

 The decrease in total portfolio yield at cost was primarily driven by Lithium Technologies, Inc. and Wine.com being placed on non-accrual status. The increase in total portfolio yield at fair value was primarily driven by the financial underperformance of Picture Head Midco LLC. Within First Lien/Senior Secured Debt, the decrease in weighted average yield at cost was primarily driven by Lithium Technologies, Inc being placed on non-accrual status and the increase in weighted average yield at fair value was primarily driven by the financial underperformance of Picture Head Midco LLC. Within Second Lien/Senior Secured Debt, the decrease in weighted average yield at cost and fair value were primarily driven by the exits of Genesis Acquisition Co. and Recipe Acquisition Corp. (dba Roland Foods). Within Unsecured Debt, the decrease in weighted average yield at cost and fair value were primarily driven by Wine.com being placed on non-accrual status and the exit of Recipe Acquisition Corp.

(3) For a particular portfolio company, we calculate the level of contractual indebtedness net of cash net debt owed by the portfolio company and compare that amount to measures of cash flow available to service the net debt. To calculate net debt, we include debt that is both senior and pari passu to the tranche of debt owned by us but exclude debt that is legally and contractually subordinated in ranking to the debt owned by us. We believe this calculation method assists in describing the risk of our portfolio investments, as it takes into consideration contractual rights of repayment of the tranche of debt owned by us relative to other senior and junior creditors of a portfolio company. We typically calculate cash flow available for debt service at a portfolio company by taking EBITDA for the trailing twelve-month period. Weighted average net debt to EBITDA is weighted based on the fair value of our debt investments, excluding investments where net debt to EBITDA may not be the appropriate measure of credit risk, such as cash collateralized loans and investments that are underwritten and covenanted based on recurring revenue. 

For a particular portfolio company, we also calculate the level of contractual interest expense owed by the portfolio company and compare that amount to EBITDA interest coverage ratio ). We believe this calculation method assists in describing the risk of our portfolio investments, as it takes into consideration contractual interest obligations of the portfolio company. Weighted average interest coverage is weighted based on the fair value of our performing debt investments, excluding investments where interest coverage may not be the appropriate measure of credit risk, such as cash collateralized loans and investments that are underwritten and covenanted based on recurring revenue. 
 Median EBITDA is based on our debt investments, excluding investments where net debt to EBITDA may not be the appropriate measure of credit risk, such as cash collateralized loans and investments that are underwritten and covenanted based on recurring revenue. 
 Portfolio company statistics are derived from the most recently available financial statements of each portfolio company as of the reported end date. Statistics of the portfolio companies have not been independently verified by us and may reflect a normalized or adjusted amount. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, investments where net debt to EBITDA may not be the appropriate measure of credit risk represented 15.9 and 25.2 of total debt investments at fair value. 
 Our Investment Adviser, monitors on an ongoing basis, the financial trends of each portfolio company to determine if it is meeting its respective business plan and to assess the appropriate course of action for each portfolio company. Our Investment Adviser has several methods of evaluating and monitoring the performance and fair value of our investments, which may include the following: (i) assessment of success in adhering to the portfolio company s business plan and compliance with covenants; (ii) periodic or regular contact with portfolio company management and, if appropriate, the financial or strategic sponsor to discuss financial position, requirements and accomplishments; (iii) comparisons to our other portfolio companies in the industry, if any; (iv) attendance at and participation in Board meetings or presentations by portfolio companies; and (v) review of monthly and quarterly financial statements and financial projections of portfolio companies. 
 As part of the monitoring process, our Investment Adviser also employs an investment rating system to categorize our investments. In addition to various risk management and monitoring tools, our Investment Adviser grades the credit risk of all investments on a scale of 1 to 4 no less frequently than quarterly. This system is intended primarily to reflect the underlying risk of a portfolio investment relative to our initial cost basis in respect of such portfolio investment (i.e., at the time of origination or acquisition), although it may also take into account in certain circumstances the performance of the portfolio company s business, the collateral coverage of the investment and other relevant factors. The grading system for our investments is as follows: 
 Grade 1 investments involve the least amount of risk to our initial cost basis. The trends and risk factors for this investment since origination or acquisition are generally favorable, which may include the performance of the portfolio company or a potential exit; 

38 

Table of Contents 

 Grade 2 investments involve a level of risk to our initial cost basis that is similar to the risk to our initial cost basis at the time of origination or acquisition. This portfolio company is generally performing as expected and the risk factors to our ability to ultimately recoup the cost of our investment are neutral to favorable. All investments or acquired investments in new portfolio companies are initially assessed a grade of 2; 

Grade 3 investments indicate that the risk to our ability to recoup the initial cost basis of such investment has increased materially since origination or acquisition, including as a result of factors such as declining performance and non-compliance with debt covenants; however, payments are generally not more than 120 days past due; and 

Grade 4 investments indicate that the risk to our ability to recoup the initial cost basis of such investment has substantially increased since origination or acquisition, and the portfolio company likely has materially declining performance. For debt investments with an investment grade of 4, in most cases, most or all of the debt covenants are out of compliance and payments are substantially delinquent. For investments graded 4, it is anticipated that we will not recoup our initial cost basis and may realize a substantial loss of our initial cost basis upon exit. 

Our Investment Adviser grades the investments in our portfolio at least each quarter and it is possible that the grade of a portfolio investment may be reduced or increased over time. For investments with a grade of 3 or 4, our Investment Adviser enhances its level of scrutiny over the monitoring of such portfolio company. The following table shows the composition of our portfolio (excluding investments in money market funds, if any) on the 1 to 4 grading scale:

The decrease in investments with a grade 1 investment performance rating was driven by the exit of an investment with an aggregate fair value of 24.75 million. The increase in investments with a grade 4 investment performance rating was driven by investments with an aggregate fair value of 29.00 million being downgraded from a grade 3 investment performance rating due to financial underperformance.

Investments are placed on non-accrual status when it is probable that principal, interest or dividends will not be collected according to the contractual terms. Accrued interest or dividends generally are reversed when an investment is placed on non-accrual status. Interest or dividend payments received on non-accrual investments may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management s judgment. Non-accrual investments are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest or dividends are paid and, in management s judgment, principal and interest or dividend payments are likely to remain current. We may make exceptions to this treatment if the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection.

Net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) in our investments for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily driven by the reversal of unrealized depreciation in connection with the recapitalization of our second lien debt investment in Zep Inc. 
 FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 The primary use of existing funds and any funds raised in the future is expected to be for our investments in portfolio companies, cash distributions to our Unitholders or for other general corporate purposes, including paying for operating expenses or debt service to the extent we borrow or issue senior securities. 
 We expect to generate cash primarily from the net proceeds of any future offerings of securities, drawdowns of capital commitments, future borrowings and cash flows from operations. To the extent we determine that additional capital would allow us to take advantage of additional investment opportunities, if the market for debt financing presents attractively priced debt financing opportunities, or if our Board of Directors otherwise determines that leveraging our portfolio would be in our best interest and the best interests of our Unitholders, we may enter into credit facilities or issue other senior securities. We would expect any such credit facilities may be secured by certain of our assets and may contain advance rates based upon pledged collateral. The pricing and other terms of any such facilities would depend upon market conditions when we enter into any such facilities as well as the performance of our business, among other factors. As a BDC, with certain limited exceptions, we are only permitted to borrow amounts such that our asset coverage ratio, as defined in the Investment Company Act, is at least 200 after such borrowing (or 150 if certain requirements are met). See Key Components of Operations Leverage. As of September 30, 2024, the JPM Revolving Credit Facility had been fully repaid and was terminated, and as a result, there were no senior securities outstanding. As of December 31, 2023, our asset coverage ratio based on the aggregate amount outstanding of our senior securities (which included the JPM Revolving Credit Facility prior to its termination) was 726 . We may also refinance or repay any of our indebtedness at any time based on our financial condition and market conditions. 
 We may enter into investment commitments through signed commitment letters that may ultimately become investment transactions in the future. We regularly evaluate and carefully consider our unfunded commitments using GSAM s proprietary risk management framework for the purpose of planning our capital resources and ongoing liquidity, including our financial leverage.

 Contractual Obligations 
 We have entered into certain contracts under which we have future commitments. Payments under the Investment Advisory Agreement, pursuant to which GSAM has agreed to serve as our Investment Adviser, are equal to (1) a percentage of our average NAV and (2) an Incentive Fee based on investment performance. Under the Administration Agreement, pursuant to which State Street Bank and Trust Company (the Administrator has agreed to furnish us with the administrative services necessary to conduct our day-to-day operations, we pay our Administrator such fees as may be agreed between us and our Administrator that we determine are commercially reasonable in our sole discretion. Generally, either party may terminate the Investment Advisory Agreement without penalty on at least 60 days written notice to the other party. Either party may terminate the Administration Agreement without penalty upon at least 30 days written notice to the other party.

JPM Revolving Credit Facility (1) 

(1) The Company may borrow amounts in USD or certain other permitted currencies. Debt outstanding denominated in currencies other than USD has been converted to USD using the applicable foreign currency exchange rate as of the applicable reporting date. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had no borrowings outstanding. The JPM Revolving Credit Facility was fully repaid on May 8, 2024 and was terminated effective May 31, 2024. 

JPM Revolving Credit Facility 
 
 On November 21, 2017, Goldman Sachs Private Middle Market Credit SPV LLC SPV ), our wholly-owned subsidiary, entered into the JPM Revolving Credit Facility. JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association JPM serves as administrative agent, State Street Bank and Trust Company serves as collateral agent, collateral administrator, bank and securities intermediary and we serve as portfolio manager under the JPM Revolving Credit Facility. State Street Bank and Trust Company also acts as our transfer agent, disbursing agent, custodian and administrator as well as SPV s custodian. The Company amended the JPM Revolving Credit Facility on numerous occasions between August 17, 2018 and May 10, 2023. 
 Borrowings under the JPM Revolving Credit Facility bore interest (at SPV's election) at a per annum rate equal to either (x) the three-month Term SOFR (or other listed offered rate, depending upon the currency of borrowing) in effect and, (y) a rate per annum equal to the greater of (i) the prime rate of JPM in effect on such day and (ii) the Federal Funds Effective Rate in effect on such day plus 0.50 ; and, with respect to advances denominated in a currency other than USD, the annual rate of interest announced by JPM as being the reference rate then in effect for determining interest rates on commercial loans made in the applicable jurisdiction of such currency, in all cases, plus the applicable margin. The applicable margin was 3.50 per annum. SPV initially paid a commitment fee of 1.00 per annum (or 0.50 per annum during the first nine months from the date the JPM Revolving Credit Facility was entered into) on the average daily unused amount of the financing commitments until the third anniversary of the JPM Revolving Credit Facility. 
 The JPM Revolving Credit Facility was a multicurrency facility. As of September 30, 2024, the total commitments under the JPM Revolving Credit Facility were 0.0 million. All amounts outstanding under the JPM Revolving Credit Facility were fully repaid on May 8, 2024. 
 SPV s obligations to the lenders under the JPM Revolving Credit Facility were secured by a first priority security interest in all of SPV s portfolio of investments and cash. The obligations of SPV under the JPM Revolving Credit Facility were non-recourse to us, and our exposure under the JPM Revolving Credit Facility was limited to the value of our investment in SPV. Effective May 31, 2024, the JPM Revolving Credit Facility was terminated and SPV was released from its obligations to the lenders. 
 In connection with the JPM Revolving Credit Facility, SPV made certain customary representations and warranties and was required to comply with various covenants, reporting requirements and other customary requirements for similar facilities. The JPM Revolving Credit Facility contained customary events of default for similar financing transactions, including if a change of control of SPV occurred or if we were no longer the portfolio manager of SPV. Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an event of default, JPM may have declared the outstanding advances and all other obligations under the JPM Revolving Credit Facility immediately due and payable.

 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We may become a party to investment commitments and to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of our business to fund investments and to meet the financial needs of our portfolio companies. These instruments may include commitments to extend credit and involve, to varying degrees, elements of liquidity and credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet. As of September 30, 2024, we believed that we had adequate financial resources to satisfy our unfunded commitments. Our unfunded commitments to provide funds to portfolio companies were as follows:

HEDGING 
 Subject to applicable provisions of the Investment Company Act and applicable Commodity Futures Trading Commission CFTC regulations, we may enter into hedging transactions in a manner consistent with SEC guidance. To the extent that any of our loans are denominated in a currency other than U.S. dollars, we may enter into currency hedging contracts to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. We may also enter into interest rate hedging agreements. Such hedging activities, which will be subject to compliance with applicable legal requirements, may include the use of futures, options, swaps and forward contracts. Costs incurred in entering into such contracts or in settling them, if any, will be borne by us. Our Investment Adviser has claimed no-action relief from CFTC registration and regulation as a commodity pool operator pursuant to a CFTC Rule 4.5 with respect to our operations, with the result that we will be limited in our ability to use futures contracts or options on futures contracts or engage in swap transactions. Specifically, CFTC Rule 4.5 imposes strict limitations on using such derivatives other than for hedging purposes, whereby the use of derivatives not used solely for hedging purposes is generally limited to situations where (i) the aggregate initial margin and premiums required to establish such positions does not exceed five percent of the liquidation value of our portfolio, after taking into account unrealized profits and unrealized losses on any such contracts it has entered into; or (ii) the aggregate net notional value of such derivatives does not exceed 100 of the liquidation value of our portfolio. Moreover, we anticipate entering into transactions involving such derivatives to a very limited extent solely for hedging purposes or otherwise within the limitations of CFTC Rule 4.5. 
 Rule 18f-4 under the Investment Company Act includes limitations on the ability of a BDC (or a RIC) to use derivatives and other transactions that create future payment or delivery obligations (including reverse repurchase agreements and similar financing transactions). Under the rule, BDCs that make significant use of derivatives are subject to a value-at-risk leverage limit, a derivatives risk management program, testing requirements and requirements related to board reporting. These requirements apply unless the BDC qualifies as a limited derivatives user, as defined in Rule 18f-4. Under the rule, a BDC may enter into an unfunded commitment agreement that is not a derivatives transaction, such as an agreement to provide financing to a portfolio company, if the BDC has, among other things, a reasonable belief, at the time it enters into such an agreement, that it will have sufficient cash and cash equivalents to meet its obligations with respect to all of its unfunded commitment agreements, in each case as it becomes due. Under Rule 18f-4, when we trade reverse repurchase agreements or similar financing transactions, including certain tender option bonds, we need to aggregate the amount of any other senior securities representing indebtedness (e.g., bank borrowings, if applicable) when calculating our asset coverage ratio. We currently operate as a limited derivatives user and these requirements may limit our ability to use derivatives and/or enter into certain other financial contracts. 
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
 Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ materially. 
 For a description of our critical accounting policies, see Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements included in this report. We consider the most significant accounting policies to be those related to our Investments, Revenue Recognition, Non-Accrual Investments, Distributions, and Income Taxes. We consider the most significant critical estimate to be the fair value measurement of investments. The critical accounting policies and estimate should be read in connection with our risk factors listed under Risk Factors in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 45 

Table of Contents 

Fair Value Measurement of Investments 
 Consistent with GAAP and the Investment Company Act, we conduct a valuation of our investments, pursuant to which our NAV is determined. Our investments are valued on a quarterly basis, or more frequently if required under the Investment Company Act. The determination of fair value involves subjective judgments and estimates. The majority of investments are not quoted or traded in an active market and as such their fair values are determined using valuation techniques, primarily discounted cash flows, market multiples, and recent comparable transactions. The most significant inputs in applying the discounted cash flow approach and the market multiples approach are the selected discount rates and multiples, respectively. The selection of these inputs is based on a combination of factors that are specific to the underlying portfolio companies such as financial performance and certain factors that are observable in the market such as current interest rates and comparable public company trading multiples. Accordingly, the notes to our consolidated financial statements express the uncertainty with respect to the possible effect of these valuations and any change in these valuations on the consolidated financial statements. For further details of our investments and fair value measurement accounting policy, see Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies Investments and Note 5 Fair Value Measurement. 
 RECENT DEVELOPMENTS 
 
 We will pay a distribution equal to an amount up to our taxable earnings per unit, including net investment income (if positive) for the period October 1, 2024 through December 31, 2024, payable on or about January 28, 2025 to Unitholders of record as of December 31, 2024. 
 
 On October 31, 2024, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement with Pantheon Silver Holdings LLC, an affiliated entity of the Pantheon Group Buyer ), and Silver Merger Sub LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Buyer Merger Sub ). The Merger Agreement provides that, subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger (the Effective Time ), Merger Sub will merge with us (the Merger ), with us continuing as the surviving company. Each common unit of limited liability company interest issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, except for limited exceptions, will be converted into the right to receive, in cash, without interest, the Per Unit Member Consideration (as defined in the Merger Agreement) determined in accordance with the Merger Agreement. The Merger Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants. 
 
 Our Board of Directors, including all of our independent directors, has unanimously approved the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, and directed that the Merger Agreement be submitted to the members for their adoption. The closing of the Merger is subject to closing conditions as described in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed on November 1, 2024, including, among other things, the adoption of the Merger Agreement and approval of the transactions contemplated thereby by the members and the expiration of the required waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended. 
 
 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 We are subject to financial market risks, most significantly changes in interest rates. Interest rate sensitivity refers to the change in our earnings that may result from changes in the level of interest rates. Because we expect to fund a portion of our investments with borrowings, our net investment income is expected to be affected by the difference between the rate at which we invest and the rate at which we borrow. As a result, we can offer no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net investment income. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, on a fair value basis, approximately 0 and 1.7 , of our performing debt investments bore interest at a fixed rate (including income producing preferred stock investments), and approximately 100 and 98.3 , of our performing debt investments bore interest at a floating rate. Our borrowings under the JPM Revolving Credit Facility bore interest at a floating rate. 
 46 

Table of Contents 

 We regularly measure our exposure to interest rate risk. We assess interest rate risk and manage our interest rate exposure on an ongoing basis by comparing our interest rate sensitive assets to our interest rate sensitive liabilities. 
 
 Based on our September 30, 2024 Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition, the following table shows the annual impact on net income of base rate changes in interest rates (considering interest rate floors for variable rate instruments) assuming no changes in our investment and borrowing structure:

We may, in the future, hedge against interest rate fluctuations by using standard hedging instruments such as futures, options and forward contracts subject to the requirements of the Investment Company Act, applicable CFTC regulations and in a manner consistent with SEC guidance. While hedging activities may insulate us against adverse changes in interest rates, they may also limit our ability to participate in benefits of lower interest rates with respect to our portfolio of investments with fixed interest rates. 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures . As of the end of the period covered by this report, our management carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our Co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, our Co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting . There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our most recently completed fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
