 During each of the first three quarters of 2024, the Company entered into lease agreements with unrelated third parties for distribution centers previously leased by Kellanova. The leases were either transferred to the Company or subleased directly from Kellanova as outlined in the Separation and Distribution Agreement. Payments for these leases are made on a monthly basis. Prior to the execution of these leases, use of the distribution centers was managed under the Transition Services Agreement. 
 The new sublease agreement executed in the third quarter of 2024 resulted in an increase to operating lease assets of million, which is recorded within Operating lease assets on the Unaudited Consolidated Balance Sheet.

 The Company could incur losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to over-the-counter ("OTC") financial and commodity derivatives contracts. Management believes risk of loss with respect to derivative contracts is limited due to the use of master netting agreements with credit-ratings based collateralization requirements for OTC derivatives and the use of exchange-traded commodity contracts. As of September 28, 2024, the Company was not in a material net asset position with any OTC derivatives counterparties.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 The following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD A") is intended to help the reader understand the Company, our operations and our present business environment. MD A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes thereto contained in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q ("Quarterly Report"). 
 Business Overview 
 WK Kellogg Co is an iconic North American cereal company with a differentiated portfolio of brands that have delighted our consumers for over a century. As a leading manufacturer, marketer and distributor of branded ready-to-eat cereal, we endeavor to provide consumers with high-quality products while promoting consumer health and well-being. Our products are manufactured by us in the United States, Mexico, and Canada and marketed in the United States, Canada, and the Caribbean. 
 
 We believe our business' long-standing success is attributable to the strength of our brands, our category expertise, and over a century of institutional knowledge, all of which has created a diverse portfolio of cereals that are intended to enhance the lives of our consumers. Our product offerings are well diversified across the cereal sub-categories of taste, wellness and balance, with strong consumer appeal across the spectrum of ages and demographics. Iconic brands used in our business include Frosted Flakes , Special K , Froot Loops , Raisin Bran , Frosted Mini-Wheats , Rice Krispies , Kashi , Corn Flakes and Apple Jacks , among many others. 
 
 Our products are manufactured through our production platform consisting of six primary facilities and are sold through a variety of channels such as grocery stores, mass merchandisers, club stores, and drugstores. 
 Separation from Kellanova 
 On October 2, 2023, Kellanova (formerly known as Kellogg Company) completed the spin-off (the "Spin-Off") of its North American cereal business through the distribution of all of the shares of WK Kellogg Co (the "Company") common stock to Kellanova s share owners at a ratio of one share of the Company's common stock for every four shares of Kellanova s common stock. Prior to the Spin-Off, the Company underwent an internal reorganization that resulted in it becoming the holder, directly or through its subsidiaries, of the North American cereal business held by Kellanova. Prior to the Spin-Off, the Company was a wholly owned subsidiary of Kellanova. 
 
 In connection with the Spin-Off, the Company entered into several agreements with Kellanova that govern the relationship of the parties following the Spin-Off and allocate between the Company and Kellanova various assets, liabilities, and obligations, including, among other things, employee benefits, intellectual property, and tax related assets and liabilities. The agreements included a Separation and Distribution Agreement, Employee Matters Agreement, Supply Agreement, Master Ownership and License Agreements regarding Patents, Trademarks and Certain Related Intellectual Property, Tax Matters Agreement and Transition Services Agreement. 
 
 Basis of Presentation 
 For periods prior to the Spin-Off, the accompanying Unaudited Financial Statements were derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of Kellanova. For all periods subsequent to the Spin-Off, the Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements are based on actual results as a standalone company. Further information surrounding the Spin-Off and basis of presentation utilized for periods prior to the Spin-Off is included within Note 1 of the Company s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K (the "2023 Annual Report"). 
 
 Our MD A references consumption and net sales in discussing our sales trends for certain brands. We record net sales upon delivery of shipments to our customers. Consumption refers to consumer purchases of our products from our customers. 
 Key Factors Affecting Our Business 
 We believe key industry and economic factors that are currently impacting our business, and which in the near term are expected to continue to impact our business, include the following: 
 Macroeconomic conditions. In recent years, geopolitical instability, including wars and conflicts, as well as other global events have resulted in certain impacts to the global economy, including market disruptions, supply chain challenges and inflationary pressures. We were able to mostly offset the dollar impact of this input-cost inflation 
 21 

Table of Content s 

 through the execution of productivity initiatives and the implementation of revenue growth management actions to realize price. Additionally, from time to time, we may enter into a combination of fixed price contracts with suppliers and commodity derivative instruments to manage the impact of volatility in the price of raw materials. During the current year we have experienced increased supply chain stability and some level of commodity cost moderation while other input costs have continued to be inflationary. 
 The war in Ukraine and the related sanctions, along with the conflict in the Middle East, have increased global economic and geopolitical uncertainty. The Company is a North American-focused company with no direct exposure to Russia, Ukraine or the Middle East. However, sanctions imposed by the United States on Russian oil and gas imports, as well as disruption to Ukraine s wheat and other agricultural supply due to the ongoing military conflict, could cause further inflation of our commodity costs. 
 Highly competitive environment. Our business is concentrated primarily in a single product category that faces intense competition. The principal aspects of our business where we experience competition include brand recognition, taste, nutritional value, price, promotion, innovation, shelf space and customer service. We have competition from both branded and private label product offerings. Our ability to successfully compete in the marketplace is dependent on our strategic execution on the items above. 
 Challenging retail environment. Our business is largely concentrated in the traditional retail grocery trade with a significant percentage of our sales coming from a small group of large U.S. retail customers. The U.S. retail environment continues to face further consolidation. We must leverage our marketing expertise, product innovation and category leadership position to respond to our customers and provide high service levels. 
 These factors contribute to a market environment of intense competition, constant product innovation and continuing cost pressure that creates a challenging commercial and economic environment. We continually evaluate these factors as we develop and execute our strategies. 
 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 The non-GAAP financial measures in this Quarterly Report are supplemental measures of our performance. These non-GAAP financial measures that we provide to management and investors exclude certain items that we do not consider part of on-going operations. Our management team utilizes a combination of GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate business results, to make decisions regarding the future direction of our business, and for resource allocation decisions, including incentive compensation. As a result, we believe the presentation of both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures provides investors with increased transparency into financial measures used by our management team and improves investors understanding of our underlying operating performance which is useful in the analysis of ongoing operating trends. All historical non-GAAP financial measures have been reconciled from the most directly comparable.GAAP financial measures. 
 
 As non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, they may not be comparable to financial measures used by other companies or to non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names. In order to compensate for such limitations of non-GAAP measures, readers should review the reconciliations and should not consider these measures in isolation from, or as alternatives to, the comparable financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. 
 Adjusted Net Income: We adjust the GAAP net income (loss) for: mark-to-market impacts from commodity and foreign currency contracts, separation costs related to the Spin-Off, business, portfolio realignment and restructuring costs, other income (expense) and the tax impacts of these noted items. Management believes that this non-GAAP financial metric provide investors an additional basis to assess results over time. 
 Adjusted Earnings Per Share (EPS): We adjust GAAP EPS for the per share affect of: mark-to-market impacts from commodity and foreign currency contracts, pre-tax separation costs related to the Spin-Off, business, portfolio realignment and restructuring costs, other incomes (expense) and the tax impacts of these noted items. Management believes that these metrics provide investors an additional basis to assess results over time. 
 Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") : We adjust the GAAP net income (loss) for: interest expense, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and amortization expense, mark-to-market impacts from commodity and foreign currency contracts, other income (expense),

 net, separation costs related to the Spin-Off and business, portfolio realignment and restructuring costs. Management believes that these metrics provide investors an additional basis to assess results over time. 
 Adjusted gross profit and adjusted gross margin : We adjust GAAP gross profit and gross margin to exclude the effect of business, portfolio realignment and restructuring costs, separation costs related to the Spin-Off and mark-to-market impacts from commodity and foreign currency contracts. By providing these non-GAAP profitability measures, management intends to provide investors with a meaningful, consistent comparison of the Company's profitability measures for the periods presented. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate the effectiveness of initiatives intended to improve profitability, as well as to evaluate the impacts of inflationary pressures and decisions to invest in new initiatives. 
 Free cash flow : Free cash flow is defined as Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities reduced by expenditures for property additions. Cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. We use this non-GAAP financial measure of cash flow to focus management and investors on the amount of cash available for debt repayment, dividend distributions, acquisition opportunities, and share repurchases once all of the Company s business needs and obligations are met. 
 Significant items impacting comparability 
 Mark-to-market on foreign exchange and commodity hedges 
 The Company recognizes mark-to-market adjustments for commodity contracts and certain foreign currency contracts as incurred. Changes between contract and market prices for commodity contracts and certain foreign currency contracts result in gains/losses that are recognized in the quarter they occur. The Company recorded a pre-tax mark-to-market loss of 3 million and 5 million for the quarter and year-to-date period ended September 28, 2024. The Company recorded a pre-tax mark-to-market gain of 8 million and loss of 3 million for the quarter and year-to-date period ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Separation costs 
 The Company incurred pre-tax charges related to the Spin-Off, primarily related to transition and spin-related employee costs under the Transition Services Agreement of 6 million and 22 million for the quarter and year-to-date period ended September 28, 2024. The Company recorded separation costs, primarily related to legal and consulting costs, of 28 million and 89 million for the quarter and year-to-date period ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Business, portfolio realignment and restructuring costs 
 The Company incurred restructuring and non-restructuring costs related to a reconfiguration of its supply chain network designed to drive increased productivity, resulting in pre-tax charges of 42 million and 44 million for the quarter and year-to-date period ended September 28, 2024. The Company incurred pre-tax costs in connection with its business and portfolio realignment of 1 million and 2 million for the quarter and year-to-date period ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Other income (expense), net 
 The Company excludes the impact of all non-operating items from its Adjusted EBITDA calculation, which primarily includes pension-related income (expense), net and financing fees. As a result, other expense of 2 million and other income of 8 million was excluded for the quarter and year-to-date period ended September 28, 2024. Other income of 38 million and 53 million was excluded for the quarter and year-to-date period ended September 30, 2023.

 Selling, general and administrative expense for the quarter ended September 28, 2024 decreased approximately 9 , driven primarily by a decrease in Spin-Off related costs of 21 million when compared to the prior year quarter. Selling, general and administrative expense for the quarters ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 was 24 and 26 of net sales, respectively. 
 Selling, general and administrative expense for the year-to-date period ended September 28, 2024 decreased approximately 6 , driven primarily by a decrease in spin-off related costs of 55 million. which was partly offset by by an increase of overall costs to operate as a standalone entity. Selling, general and administrative expense for the year-to-date periods ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 was 23 and 24 , of net sales respectively. 
 
 Other income (expense), net 
 Other income (expense), net consists primarily of allocated pension and postretirement benefit plan related mark-to-market, interest cost, and expected return on plan assets. 
 For the quarter ended September 28, 2024, other income (expense), net decreased by 105 to (2) million compared to 38 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was driven by Pension and Postretirement benefit plan remeasurements included in other income (expense) which decreased to (3) million for the quarter ended September 28, 2024 compared to 32 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The plan remeasurements in the current year quarter were driven by the restructuring action impacts to the plan. Prior year quarter remeasurements were triggered by the separation and transfer of certain plan assets and obligations as a result of the Spin-Off. See Note 5 to the accompanying Unaudited Combined Financial Statements for more information. 
 For the year-to-date period ended September 28, 2024, other income (expense), net decreased by 85 to 8 million compared to 53 million in the year-to-date period ended September 30, 2023. This was driven by Pension and Postretirement benefit plan income included in other income (expense) which decreased by 35 million for the year-to-date period ended September 28, 2024. The decrease was due primarily to Pension and Postretirement plan remeasurement losses incurred in the current year-to-date period compared to the prior year-to-date period remeasurement gains. 
 
 Income taxes 
 The Company's consolidated effective tax rate for the quarter and year-to-date period ended September 28, 2024, excluding discrete tax items related to the restructuring action was 27.8 and 26.1 , respectively. The Company recorded a discrete tax benefit of approximately 12 million including 11 million related to the restructuring action during the quarter. The consolidated effective tax rate for the quarter and year-to-date period ended September 28, 2024, including discrete tax was 26.1 and 27.8 , respectively. The consolidated effective tax rate for the quarter and year-to-date period ended September 30, 2023 was 23.9 and 23.7 , respectively. The Company's income tax expense is impacted by the level and mix of earnings among tax jurisdictions. The rate differed from the US statutory rate in both periods primarily due to the impact of US state taxes.

Restructuring 
 On July 31, 2024, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a reorganization plan in connection with the Company's strategic priority to modernize its supply chain. Under this reorganization plan, herein referred to as the restructuring plan, the Company will consolidate its manufacturing network by closing its Omaha, Nebraska plant, with a phased reduction in production beginning in late 2025 and full closure targeted by the end of 2026, and scaling back production (which includes a reduction in the number of manufacturing platforms) at its Memphis, Tennessee facility, commencing in late 2025. The restructuring plan was communicated to impacted employees on August 6, 2024 and remains subject to the satisfaction of certain collective bargaining obligations. The actions under the restructuring plan are expected to be substantially completed by the end of fiscal year 2026. 
 These actions are expected to result in cumulative restructuring pretax charges of between 230 and 270 million, including between 30 and 40 million in cash costs for severance and other termination benefits and between 30 and 40 million in other cash restructuring costs related to equipment dismantlement and other transition costs. The Company estimates between 170 and 190 million in non-cash charges related primarily to accelerated depreciation and asset write-offs. These charges are expected to be incurred through 2027. The amounts expected to be incurred as a result of these actions, including the timing thereof, are estimates only and subject to a number of assumptions. Actual results may differ materially from the Company's current expectations. The Company may also incur additional charges or other cash expenditures not currently contemplated due to unanticipated events that may occur as a result of, or associated with, these actions. 
 For the quarter and year-to-date period ended September 28, 2024, the Company recorded total restructuring charges of 41 million. These charges are comprised of 38 million recorded to restructuring expense and 3 million to OIE. These charges consisted of asset related costs which include accelerated depreciation and asset write-off and impairment charges, employee severance and other termination benefits, pension curtailment loss, and legal and consulting fees. 

Liquidity and capital resources 
 In September of 2023, the Company entered into a Credit Agreement, consisting of a 500 million term loan (the "Term Loan"), a 250 million delayed draw term loan, and a 350 million equivalent multicurrency revolving credit facility (collectively, the Credit Facility ). As of September 28, 2024, outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement were comprised of 472 million in aggregate remaining principal amount of the Term Loan, of which 15 million was recognized as the current portion, less upfront fees paid during debt issuance. As of September 28, 2024, there was an additional 600 million of borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility. 
 Our ability to fund our operating needs will depend on our future ability to continue to generate positive cash flow from operations and on our ability to obtain debt financing on acceptable terms. Management believes that our cash balances and funds provided by operating activities, along with borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility and access to capital markets, taken as a whole, provide (i) adequate liquidity to meet all of our current and long-term obligations when due, including third-party debt that was incurred in connection with the Spin-Off, (ii) adequate liquidity to fund capital expenditures primarily utilized in manufacturing our products, and (iii) flexibility to meet investment opportunities that may arise. However, our access to, and the availability of, financing on acceptable terms and conditions in the future will be impacted by many factors, including (1) our credit ratings, including the lowering of any of our credit ratings, or absence of a credit rating, (2) the liquidity of the overall capital markets and (3) the future state of the U.S. and global economy and, accordingly, there can be no assurances that we will be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on acceptable terms in the future, or at all. 
 
 We believe our operating cash flow, together with borrowings capacity under our Credit Facility, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future, and at a minimum for the next 12 months. We plan to utilize such flexibility to drive an investment philosophy that balances capital investments in areas such as supply chain optimization, cost-saving projects and new capabilities, with the ability to further increase shareowner value through a combination of debt reduction, return of capital to our shareowners in the form of dividends as well as potential acquisitions. In the near term we may increase our indebtedness to fund important capital projects. Thereafter, however, we anticipate being able to reduce indebtedness as a way to increase our financial flexibility and enhance shareowner value.

 The following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows: 
 Year-to-date period ended (millions) September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities 98 184 Investing activities (94) (89) Financing activities (44) (31) Effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents (2) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents (42) 64 
 
 Operating activities 
 Net cash flow provided by (used in) operating activities for the year-to-date period ended September 28, 2024, decreased to 98 million, compared to 184 million in the prior year-to-date period. The change was primarily driven by the settlement of 32 million of transition payables balances due to Kellanova in the first quarter of 2024, pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement and a decrease in accrued advertising and promotional accruals when compared to prior year financial figures prepared on a carve out basis. Overall working capital components were flat and reflect increased accounts receivable monetization and the return to normalized inventory levels. 
 We measure free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities, reduced by expenditures for property additions. We use this non-GAAP financial measure of cash flow to focus management and investors on the amount of cash available for debt repayment, dividend distributions, acquisition opportunities and share repurchases. Our free cash flow metric is reconciled to the most comparable GAAP measure below: 
 Year-to-date period ended (millions) September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 98 184 Additions to properties (96) (93) Free cash flow 2 91 
 
 I nvesting activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 94 million for the year-to-date period ended September 28, 2024 compared to 89 million in the prior year-to-date period due to differences in the timing of capital spending in the current year compared to the prior year. 
 
 Financing activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities for the year-to-date period ended September 28, 2024 was 44 million compared to net cash used in financing activities of 31 million during the prior year-to-date period. The increase is primarily driven by 41 million of dividend payments to shareowners in 2024, partly offset by 25 million in net transfers to Kellanova in the prior year.

 In August of 2024 the Board of Directors of the Company declared a dividend of 0.16 per share of common stock, paid on September 13, 2024 to shareowners of record as of the close of business on August 29, 2024. 
 Monetization and Supplier Finance Programs 
 The Company maintains a monetization agreement with an unaffiliated financial institution specifically designed to factor trade receivables with certain customers that have extended terms. Under this monetization arrangement, from time to time, the Company sells these customers trade receivables at a discount on a non-recourse basis. A portion of the cash proceeds is subject to certain restrictions. Transfers under these agreements are accounted for as sales of receivables resulting in the receivables being de-recognized in the Unaudited Consolidated Balance Sheet. The monetization program provides for the continuing sale of certain receivables on a revolving basis until the arrangement is terminated by either party; however, the maximum receivables that may be sold at any time is approximately 350 million. Prior to the Spin-Off, the Company participated in Kellanova's monetization program, which was structured similarly but resulted in a higher level of receivables allowed to be sold when compared to the current program in place. 
 
 The Company has no retained interest in the receivables sold; however, the Company does have collection and administrative responsibilities for the sold receivables. The Company has not recorded any servicing assets or liabilities as of September 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023 for these agreements as the fair value of these servicing arrangements as well as the fees earned were not material to the financial statements. Accounts receivable sold of 320 million and 266 million remained outstanding under these arrangements as of September 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, respectively. The proceeds from these sales of receivables are included in Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities in the Unaudited Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The recorded net loss on sale of receivables w a s 5 million and 14 million fo r the quarter and year-to-date period ended September 28, 2024, respectively, and 3 million and 11 million for the quart er and year-to-date period ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The recorded loss is included in Other income (expense), net, on the Unaudited Consolidated Statement of Income. 
 
 The Company also has agreements with third parties to provide accounts payable tracking systems which facilitate participating suppliers ability to monitor and, if elected, sell payment obligations from the Company to designated third-party financial institutions. Participating suppliers may, at their sole discretion, make offers to sell one or more payment obligations of the Company prior to their scheduled due dates at a discounted price to participating financial institutions. The Company s goal is to capture overall supplier savings, in the form of payment terms or vendor funding, and the agreements facilitate the suppliers ability to sell payment obligations, while providing them with greater working capital flexibility. The Company has no economic interest in the sale of these suppliers receivables and no direct financial relationship with the financial institutions concerning these services. The Company s obligations to its suppliers, including amounts due and scheduled payment dates, are not impacted by suppliers decisions to sell amounts under the arrangements. However, the Company s right to offset balances due from suppliers against payment obligations is restricted by the agreements for those payment obligations that have been sold by suppliers. 
 
 The payment of these obligations by the Company is included in Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities in the Unaudited Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. As of September 28, 2024, 133 million of the Company s outstanding payment obligations had been placed in the accounts payable tracking system. As of December 30, 2023, 142 million of the Company s outstanding payment obligations had been placed in the accounts payable tracking system.

 Our future results could be affected by a variety of other factors, including, among others, a decline in demand for ready-to-eat cereals; supply chain disruptions and increases in costs and/or shortages of raw materials, labor, fuels and utilities as a result of geopolitical, economic and market conditions; consumers perception of our brands or company; business disruptions; our ability to drive our growth targets to increase revenue and profit; our failure to achieve our targeted cost savings and efficiencies from cost reduction initiatives; our failure to achieve the expected benefits from our supply chain modernization efforts; unanticipated costs and negative financial and other impacts of our planned network consolidation; strategic acquisitions, alliances, divestitures or joint ventures or organic growth opportunities we may pursue in the future; material disruptions at one of our facilities; our ability to attract, develop and retain the highly skilled people we need to support our business; a shortage of labor, our failure to successfully negotiate collectively bargained agreements, or other general inflationary pressures or changes in applicable laws and regulations that could increase labor costs; an increase in our post-retirement benefit-related costs and funding requirements caused by, among other things, volatility in the financial markets, changes in interest rates and actuarial assumptions; our inability to obtain sufficient capital to grow our business and to increase our revenues; an impairment of the carrying value of goodwill or other acquired intangibles; increases in the price of raw materials, including agricultural commodities, packaging, fuel and labor; increases in transportation costs and reduced availability of, or increases in, the price of oil or other fuels; competition, including with respect to retail and shelf space; the changing retail environment and the growing presence of alternative retail channels; the successful development of new products and processes; adverse changes in the global climate or extreme weather conditions; and other risks and uncertainties described in Part I, Item 1A of our 2023 Annual Report . Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report, and we undertake no obligation to publicly update them except as required by law. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 
 The Company is exposed to certain market risks, which exist as a part of our ongoing business operations. We use derivative financial and commodity instruments, where appropriate, to manage these risks. As a matter of policy, we do not engage in trading or speculative transactions. Refer to Note 8 within the Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report for further information on our derivative financial and commodity instruments. 
 
 Refer to disclosures contained within Part I, Item 7A of our 2023 Annual Report for information about market risk to which we are exposed. There have been no material changes in the Company s market risk during the quarter ended September 28, 2024.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Management of the Company, with the participation of its Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and Chief Financial Officer ("CFO"), has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), as of the period ending September 28, 2024. Based upon our evaluation, our CEO and our CFO have concluded that, as of the period ending September 28, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective and provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the applicable rules and forms, and that it is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and our CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 No changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 28, 2024 have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.
