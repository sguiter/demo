interest in the aggregate capital, profits
and losses of the combined Series of the Trust. 

The
Trust has been organized to pool investor funds for the purpose of trading in the United States U.S. and international
markets for currencies, interest rates, stock indices, agricultural and energy products, precious and base metals and other commodities.
The Trust may also engage in trading futures contracts, forwards, option contracts and other interest in derivative instruments, including
swap contracts. 

The
Trust has seven (7) separate and distinct Series of Units issued and outstanding: Frontier Diversified Fund, Frontier Masters Fund, Frontier
Long/Short Commodity Fund, Frontier Balanced Fund, Frontier Select Fund, Frontier Global Fund, and Frontier Heritage Fund, (each a Series 
and collectively, the Series ). The Trust, with respect to the Series, may issue additional Series of Units. 

The
Trust, with respect to each Series: 

engages in the speculative
 trading of a diversified portfolio of futures, forwards (including interbank foreign currencies), options contracts and other derivative
 instruments (including swap contracts), and may, from time to time, engage in cash and spot transactions; 

allocates funds to a limited
 liability trading company or companies Trading Company or Trading Companies or to an unaffiliated series
 limited liability company Galaxy Plus entities or Galaxy Plus entity ). Except as otherwise described
 in these notes, each Trading Company and Galaxy Plus entity has one-year renewable contracts with its own independent commodity trading
 advisor(s), or each, a Trading Advisor, that will manage all or a portion of such Trading Company s and Galaxy Plus assets
 and make the trading decisions for the assets of each Series invested in such Trading Company and Galaxy Plus entity. Each Trading
 Company and Galaxy Plus entity will segregate its assets from any other Trading Company and Galaxy Plus entity; 

maintains separate, distinct
 records for each Series, and separately accounts for the assets of each Series; 

calculates the Net Asset
 Value NAV of its Units for each Series separately from the other Series; 

27 

annually of
the NAV (of the purchase price, in case of the initial service fee) of each Unit purchased, for the benefit of selling agents selling
such Class 1 or Class 1a Units. The initial service fee, which is amortized monthly at an annual rate of up to two percent of the
average daily NAV of Class 1 or Class 1a of such Series, is prepaid to the Managing Owner by each Series, and paid to the selling agents
by the Managing Owner in the month following sale; provided, however, that investors who redeem all or a portion of their Class 1 or Class
1a Units of any Series during the first twelve (12) months following the effective date of their purchase are subject to a redemption
fee of up to two percent of the purchase price at which such investor redeemed to reimburse the Managing Owner for the then-unamortized
balance of the prepaid initial service fee. Investors who have purchased Class 1 or Class 1a Units of Frontier Balanced Fund, Frontier
Heritage Fund, Frontier Select Fund, and Frontier Global Fund are charged a service fee of up to three percent annually of the
NAV (of the purchase price, in case of the initial service fee) of each Unit purchased, for the benefit of selling agents selling such
Class 1 or Class 1a Units. The initial service fee, which is amortized monthly at an annual rate of up to three percent of the
average daily NAV of Class 1 or Class 1a of such Series, is prepaid to the Managing Owner by each Series, and paid to the selling agents
by the Managing Owner in the month following sale. With respect to Class 2 and Class 2a Units of any Series, the Managing Owner pays an
ongoing service fee to selling agents of up to one half percent annually of the NAV of each Class 2 or Class 2a Unit (of which
 will be charged to Limited Owners holding Class 2 Units of the Frontier Diversified Fund, and Frontier Masters Fund or Class 2a
Units of the Frontier Long/Short Commodity Fund sold) until such Class 2 or Class 2a Units which are subject to the fee limitation are
reclassified as Class 3 or Class 3a Units of the applicable Series. Class 1AP was created as a sub-class of Class 1 and it has been presented
separately because the fees applicable to it are different from those applicable to Class 1. Currently the service fee is not charged
to Class 1AP investors. The Managing Owner may also pay selling agents certain additional fees and expenses for administrative and other
services rendered and expenses incurred by such selling agents; and 

all payments made to selling agents who are members of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. FINRA and their associated persons that constitute underwriting compensation will be subject to the limitations set forth in Rule 2310(b)(4)(B)(ii) (formerly Rule 2810(b)(4)(B)(ii)) of the Conduct Rules of FINRA Rule 2310 ). An investor s Class 1 Units or Class 2 Units of any Series, or Class 2a Units of the Frontier Long/Short Commodity Fund or Frontier Balanced Fund will be classified as Class 3 or Class 3a Units of such Series, as applicable, when the Managing Owner determines that the fee limitation set forth in Rule 2310 with respect to such Units has been reached or will be reached. The service fee limit applicable to each unit sold is reached upon the earlier of when (i) the aggregate initial and ongoing service fees received by the selling agent with respect to such unit equals of the purchase price of such unit or (ii) the aggregate underwriting compensation (determined in accordance with FINRA Rule 2310) paid in respect of such unit totals of the purchase price of such unit. No service fees are paid with respect to Class 3 or Class 3a Units. Units of any Class in a Series may be redeemed, in whole or in part, on a daily basis, at the then current NAV per Unit for such Series on the day of the week after the date the Managing Owner is in receipt of a redemption request for at least one (1) business day to be received by the Managing Owner prior to 4:00 PM in New York. 

The
assets of any particular Series include only those funds and other assets that are paid to, held by or distributed to the Trust, with
respect to the Series, on account of and for the benefit of that Series. Under the Inter-Series Limitation on Liability 
expressly provided for under Section 3804(a) of the Trust Act, separate and distinct records of the cash and equivalents, although pooled
for maximizing returns, are maintained in the books and records of each Series.

- of those Series assets are used to support the margin requirements of the
Master Funds. The remaining assets of the Series are split between investments in Trading Companies and a pooled cash management account
that invests primarily in U.S. Treasury securities. All the funds are invested in Galaxy Plus entities. 

Each
of the Series has invested a portion of its assets in several different Trading Companies or Galaxy Plus entities, and one or more Trading
Advisors may manage the assets invested in such Trading Companies or Galaxy Plus entities. 

The
Trust has entered into agreements, which provide for the indemnification of futures clearing brokers, currency trading companies, and
commodity trading advisers, among others, against losses, costs, claims and liabilities arising from the performance of their individual
obligations under such agreements, except for gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct.

of New Net Profits (as
defined in the Prospectus). If the Managing Owner s share of the incentive fee exceeds of new net profits during the period

recorded as Incentive Fee (Rebate) on the consolidated statements of operations. 

 annually of
the NAV (of the purchase price, in case of the initial service fee) of each Unit purchased, for the benefit of selling agents selling
such Class 1 or Class 1a Units. The initial service fee, which is amortized monthly at an annual rate of up to two percent of the
average daily NAV of Class 1 or Class 1a of such Series, is prepaid to the Managing Owner by each Series, and paid to the selling agents
by the Managing Owner in the month following sale; provided, however, that investors who redeem all or a portion of their Class 1 and
Class 1a Units of any Series during the first twelve (12) months following the effective date of their purchase are subject to a redemption
fee of up to two percent of the purchase price at which such investor redeemed to reimburse the Managing Owner for the then-unamortized
balance of the prepaid initial service fee. Investors who have purchased Class 1 or Class 1a Units of Frontier Balanced Fund, Frontier
Heritage Fund, Frontier Select Fund, and Frontier Global Fund are charged a service fee of up to three percent annually of the
NAV (of the purchase price, in case of the initial service fee) of each Unit purchased, for the benefit of selling agents selling such
Class 1 or Class 1a Units. The initial service fee, which is amortized monthly at an annual rate of up to three percent of the
average daily NAV of Class 1 or Class 1a of such Series, is prepaid to the Managing Owner by each Series, and paid to the selling agents
by the Managing Owner in the month following sale; provided, however, that investors who redeem all or a portion of their Class 1 and
Class 1a Units of any Series during the first twelve (12) months following the effective date of their purchase are subject to a redemption
fee of up to three percent of the purchase price at which such investor redeemed to reimburse the Managing Owner for the then-unamortized
balance of the prepaid initial service fee. With respect to Class 2 and Class 2a Units of any Series, the Managing Owner pays an ongoing
service fee to selling agents of up to one half percent annually of the NAV of each Class 2 or Class 2a Unit (of which will
be charged to Limited Owners holding Class 2 Units of the Frontier Diversified Fund and Frontier Masters Fund or Class 2a Units of the
Frontier Long/Short Commodity Fund sold) until such Class 2 or Class 2a Units which are subject to the fee limitation are reclassified
as Class 3 or Class 3a Units of the applicable Series for administrative purposes. Currently the service fee is not charged to Class 1AP
investors. The Managing Owner may also pay selling agents certain additional fees and expenses for administrative and other services rendered
and expenses incurred by such selling agents.

escalated to the Managing Owner s Valuation Committee for evaluation and resolution. The Swap contracts are reported at fair value
using Level 3 inputs. The Series did not hold any swap contracts as of September 30, 2024. 

Investments
in Private Investment Companies . Investments in private investment companies are valued utilizing the net asset values provided
by the underlying private investment companies as a practical expedient. Each Series applies the practical expedient to its investments
in private investment companies on an investment-by-investment basis, and consistently with the Series entire position in a particular
investment, unless it is probable that the Series will sell a portion of an investment at an amount different from the net asset value
of the investment. Investments in Private Investment Companies are excluded from the leveling table below. 

Investment
in Unconsolidated Trading Companies. This investment represents the fair value of the allocation of cash, futures, forwards,
options and swaps to each respective Series relative to its trading allocations from unconsolidated Trading Companies. A Series may redeem
its investment in any of the Trading Companies on a daily basis at the Trading Company s stated net asset value. Each of the Series,
all of which are under the same management as the Trading Companies, has access to the underlying positions of the Trading Companies.

interest Minimum Purchase Commitment in the aggregate capital, profits and losses of all Series and in return will receive units designated as general units in the Series
in which the Managing Owner invests such funds. The general units may only be purchased by the Managing Owner and may be subject to no
management fees or management fees at reduced rates. Otherwise, the general units hold the same rights as the limited units. The Managing
Owner will make contributions to the Series of the Trust necessary to maintain at least a interest in the aggregate capital, profits
and losses of the combined Series of the Trust. Such contribution was made by the Managing Owner before trading commenced for the Trust
and will be maintained throughout the existence of the Trust, and the Managing Owner will make such purchases as are necessary to effect
this requirement. Additionally, the Managing Owner agreed with certain regulatory bodies to maintain a interest specifically in the
Frontier Balanced Fund Class 1AP and 2a Units, aggregated, and each of the Frontier Long/Short Commodity Fund, Frontier Diversified Fund
and Frontier Masters Fund. The interest in these specific Series is included in computing the Minimum Purchase Commitment in aggregate
capital. In addition to the general units the Managing Owner receives in respect of its Minimum Purchase Commitment, the Managing Owner
may purchase limited units in any Series as a Limited Owner. Principals of the Managing Owner or affiliates are allowed to own beneficial
interests in the Trust, with respect to the Series, as well. All Units purchased by the Managing Owner are held for investment purposes
only and not for resale. The Managing Owner may make purchases or redemptions at any time on the same terms as any Limited Owner. The
Trust has and will continue to have certain relationships with the Managing Owner and its affiliates. 

Expenses 

Management
Fees Each Series of Units pays to the Managing Owner a monthly management fee equal to a percentage of the notional assets
of such Series allocated to Trading Companies, calculated on a daily basis. The percentage basis of the fees varies and are in line with
the amounts being disclosed below. In addition, the Managing Owner receives a monthly management fee equal to a certain percentage of
the assets in the Galaxy Plus entities attributable to such Series (including notional assets), calculated on a monthly basis.
The management fees attributable to Galaxy Plus entities are included in unrealized gain/(loss) on private investment companies on the
consolidated statements of operations. The total amount of assets of a Series allocated to Trading Advisors and/or reference programs,
including (i) actual funds deposited in accounts directed by the Trading Advisors or deposited as margin in respect of swaps or other
derivative instruments referencing a reference program plus (ii) any notional equity allocated to the Trading Advisors and any reference
programs, is referred to herein as the notional assets of the Series. The annual rate of the management fee is: 
for the Frontier Balanced Fund Class 1 and Class 2, for the Frontier Balanced Fund Class 1AP, Class 2a and Class 3a, 
for the Frontier Global Fund, Frontier Long/Short Commodity Fund Class 1a, Class 2a, and Class 3a and Frontier Masters Fund, 
for Frontier Diversified Fund, for the Frontier Heritage Fund and Frontier Select Fund, and for the Frontier Long/Short
Commodity Fund Class 2 and Class 3. The Managing Owner may pay all or a portion of such management fees to the Trading Advisor(s) and/or
waive (up to the percentage specified) any such management fee to the extent any related management fee is paid by a trading company
or estimated management fee is embedded in a swap or other derivative instrument. Any management fee embedded in a swap or other derivative
instrument may be greater or less than the management fee that would otherwise be charged to the Series by the Managing Owner. 

The
management fee as a percentage of the applicable Series notional assets will be greater than the percentage of the applicable
Series net asset value to the extent that the notional assets of the Series exceeds its net asset value. The Managing Owner expects
that the notional assets of each Series will generally be maintained at a level in excess of the net asset value of such Series and such
excess may be substantial to the extent the Managing Owner deems necessary to achieve the desired level of volatility. 

Trading
Fees In connection with each Series trading activities the Frontier Balanced Fund, Frontier Select Fund, Frontier Global
Fund and Frontier Heritage Fund pays to the Managing Owner an FCM Fee of up to per annum of notional assets allocated to the trading
advisors, including through investments in commodity pools available on the Galaxy Plus Platform, and any reference programs of the applicable
Series. The Frontier Diversified Fund, Frontier Long/Short Commodity Fund and Frontier Masters Fund pays to the Managing Owner an FCM
Fee of up to of notional assets allocated to the trading advisors, including through investments in commodity pools available on
the Galaxy Plus Platform, and a custodial/due diligence fee of of such Series NAV, calculated daily.

for the Frontier Balanced Fund and the Frontier Diversified Fund and for the Frontier Global Fund,
Frontier Heritage Fund, Frontier Select Fund, Frontier Long/Short Commodity Fund and Frontier Masters Fund. The Managing Owner may pay
all or a portion of such incentive fees to the Trading Advisor(s) for such Series.

With
respect to the service fees, the initial service fee (for the first 12 months) relating to a purchase of Units by an investor is prepaid
by the Managing Owner to the relevant selling agent in the month following such purchase and is reimbursed therefore by the Series monthly
in arrears in an amount based upon a corresponding percentage of NAV, calculated daily. Consequently, the Managing Owner bears the risk
and the benefit of the upside potential of any difference between the amount of the initial service fee prepaid by it and the amount
of the reimbursement thereof, which may result from variations in NAV over the following 12 months.

GAAP. The Series open trade equity/(deficit), options written, and receivables from futures commissions merchants (each, an FCM are subject to master netting arrangements and collateral arrangements and meet the GAAP guidance to qualify for offset. A master netting
arrangement with a counterparty creates a right of offset for amounts due to and from that same counterparty that is enforceable in the
event of a default or bankruptcy. The Series policy is to recognize amounts subject to master netting arrangements on a net basis
on the consolidated statements of financial condition.

. The Trust is a multi-advisor commodity pool, as described in CFTC Regulation 4.10(d)(2).
The Trust has authority to issue separate Series of Units pursuant to the requirements of the Trust Act. The assets of each Series are
valued and accounted for separately from the assets of other Series. The Trust is not registered as an investment company under the Investment
Company Act. It is managed by the Managing Owner. 

Purchasers of Units Unitholders are limited owners
of the Trust Limited Owners with respect to beneficial interests of the Series Units purchased. The Trust Act provides
that, except as otherwise provided in the second amended and restated declaration of trust and trust agreement dated December 9, 2013,
as further amended, by and among the Managing Owner, Wilmington Trust Company as trustee and the Unitholders, as amended from time to
time (the Trust Agreement ), Unitholders of the Trust will have the same limitation of liability as do stockholders of private
corporations organized under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. The Trust Agreement confers substantially the same
limited liability, and contains the same limited exceptions thereto, as would a limited partnership agreement for a Delaware limited partnership
engaged in like transactions as the Trust. In addition, pursuant to the Trust Agreement, the Managing Owner of the Trust is liable for
obligations of a Series in excess of that Series assets. Limited Owners do not have any such liability. The Managing Owner will
make contributions to the Series of the Trust necessary to maintain at least a interest in the aggregate capital, profits and losses
of all Series. 

The
Trust has been organized to pool investor funds for the purpose of trading in the U.S. and international markets for currencies, interest
rates, stock indices, agricultural and energy products, precious and base metals and other commodities. The Trust may also engage in
futures contracts, forwards, option contracts and other interest in derivative instruments, including swap contracts. 

The
Trust has seven (7) separate and distinct Series of Units issued and outstanding: Frontier Diversified Fund, Frontier Masters Fund, Frontier
Long/Short Commodity Fund, Frontier Balanced Fund, Frontier Select Fund, Frontier Global Fund, and Frontier Heritage Fund. The Trust s
combined consolidated financial statements are comprised of each unitized Series consolidated financial statements being combined
to present all Series in aggregate. However, the combined consolidated Trust does not issue units. 

The Trust,
with respect to each Series: 

engages in the speculative
 trading of a diversified portfolio of futures, forwards (including interbank foreign currencies), options contracts and other derivative
 instruments (including swap contracts), and may, from time to time, engage in cash and spot transactions. 

allocates funds to a limited
 liability trading company or companies Trading Company or Trading Companies or to an unaffiliated series
 limited liability company Galaxy Plus entities or Galaxy Plus entity ). Except as otherwise described
 in these notes, each Trading Company and Galaxy Plus entity has one-year renewable contracts with its own independent commodity trading
 advisor(s), or each, a Trading Advisor, that will manage all or a portion of such Trading Company s and Galaxy Plus assets
 and make the trading decisions for the assets of each Series invested in such Trading Company and Galaxy Plus entity. Each Trading
 Company and Galaxy Plus entity will segregate its assets from any other Trading Company and Galaxy Plus entity.

annually of
the NAV (of the purchase price, in case of the initial service fee) of each Unit purchased, for the benefit of selling agents selling
such Class 1 or Class 1a Units. The initial service fee, which is amortized monthly at an annual rate of up to two percent of the
average daily NAV of Class 1 or Class 1a of such Series, is prepaid to the Managing Owner by each Series, and paid to the selling agents
by the Managing Owner in the month following sale; provided, however, that investors who redeem all or a portion of their Class 1 or Class
1a Units of any Series during the first twelve(12) months following the effective date of their purchase are subject to a redemption fee
of up to two percent of the purchase price at which such investor redeemed to reimburse the Managing Owner for the then-unamortized
balance of the prepaid initial service fee. Investors who have purchased Class 1 or Class 1a Units of Frontier Balanced Fund, Frontier
Heritage Fund, Frontier Select Fund, and Frontier Global Fund are charged a service fee of up to three percent annually of the
NAV (of the purchase price, in case of the initial service fee) of each Unit purchased, for the benefit of selling agents selling such
Class 1 or Class 1a Units. The initial service fee, which is amortized monthly at an annual rate of up to three percent of the
average daily NAV of Class 1 or Class 1a of such Series, is prepaid to the Managing Owner by each Series, and paid to the selling agents
by the Managing Owner in the month following sale. With respect to Class 2 and Class 2a Units of any Series, the Managing Owner pays an
ongoing service fee to selling agents of up to one half percent annually of the NAV of each Class 2 or Class 2a Unit (of which
 will be charged to Limited Owners holding Class 2 Units of the Frontier Diversified Fund, and Frontier Masters Fund or Class 2a
Units of the Frontier Long/Short Commodity Fund sold) until such Class 2 or Class 2a Units which are subject to the fee limitation are
reclassified as Class 3 or Class 3a Units of the applicable Series. Class 1AP was created as a sub-class of Class 1 and it has been presented
separately because the fees applicable to it are different from those applicable to Class 1. Currently the service fee is not charged
to Class 1AP investors. The Managing Owner may also pay selling agents certain additional fees and expenses for administrative and other
services rendered and expenses incurred by such selling agents; and 

all payments made to selling agents who are members of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. FINRA and their associated persons that constitute underwriting compensation will be subject to the limitations set forth in Rule 2310(b)(4)(B)(ii) (formerly Rule 2810(b)(4)(B)(ii)) of the Conduct Rules of FINRA Rule 2310 ). An investor s Class 1 Units or Class 2 Units of any Series, or Class 1a Units or Class 2a Units of the Frontier Long/Short Commodity Fund or Frontier Balanced Fund will be classified as Class 3 or Class 3a Units of such Series, as applicable, when the Managing Owner determines that the fee limitation set forth in Rule 2310 with respect to such Units has been reached or will be reached. The service fee limit applicable to each unit sold is reached upon the earlier of when (i) the aggregate initial and ongoing service fees received by the selling agent with respect to such unit equals of the purchase price of such unit or (ii) the aggregate underwriting compensation (determined in accordance with FINRA Rule 2310) paid in respect of such unit totals of the purchase price of such unit. No service fees are paid with respect to Class 3 or Class 3a Units. Units of any Class in a Series may be redeemed, in whole or in part, on a daily basis, at the then current NAV per Unit for such Series on the day of the week after the date the Managing Owner is in receipt of a redemption request for at least one (1) business day to be received by the Managing Owner prior to 4:00 PM in New York. 

The
assets of any particular Series include only those funds and other assets that are paid to, held by or distributed to the Trust on account
of and for the benefit of that Series. Under the Inter-Series Limitation on Liability expressly provided for under Section
3804(a) of the Trust Act, separate and distinct records of the cash and equivalents, although pooled for maximizing returns, are maintained
in the books and records of each Series.

- of those Series assets are used to support the margin requirements of the Master Funds. The
remaining assets of the Series are split between investments in Trading Companies and a pooled cash management account that invests primarily
in U.S. Treasury securities. For those Series that do not invest in the Galaxy Plus Platform, their assets are split between investments
in Trading Companies and investments in the pooled cash management account. 

Each
of the Series has invested a portion of its assets in several different Trading Companies or Galaxy Plus entities and one or more Trading
Advisors may manage the assets invested in such Trading Companies or Galaxy Plus entities. 

The
Trust has entered into agreements, which provide for the indemnification of futures clearing brokers, currency trading companies, and
commodity trading advisers, among others, against losses, costs, claims and liabilities arising from the performance of their individual
obligations under such agreements, except for gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct.

average daily NAV of Class 1 or Class 1a of such Series, is prepaid to the Managing Owner by each Series, and paid to the selling agents
by the Managing Owner in the month following sale; provided, however, that investors who redeem all or a portion of their Class 1 and

Heritage Fund, Frontier Select Fund, and Frontier Global Fund are charged a service fee of up to three percent annually of the
NAV (of the purchase price, in case of the initial service fee) of each Unit purchased, for the benefit of selling agents selling such
Class 1 or Class 1a Units. The initial service fee, which is amortized monthly at an annual rate of up to three percent of the

service fee to selling agents of up to one half percent annually of the NAV of each Class 2 or Class 2a Unit (of which 
will be charged to Limited Owners holding Class 2 Units of the Frontier Diversified Fund and Frontier Masters Fund or Class 2a Units of
the Frontier Long/Short Commodity Fund sold) until such Class 2 or Class 2a Units which are subject to the fee limitation are reclassified
as Class 3 or Class 3a Units of the applicable Series for administrative purposes. Currently the service fee is not charged to Class 1AP
investors. The Managing Owner may also pay selling agents certain additional fees and expenses for administrative and other services rendered

interest in the aggregate capital, profits and losses and in return
will receive units designated as general units in the Series of the Trust in which the Managing Owner invests such funds. The general
units may only be purchased by the Managing Owner and may be subject to no advisory fees or management advisory fees at reduced rates.
Otherwise, the general units hold the same rights as the limited units. The Managing Owner is required to maintain at least a interest Minimum Purchase Commitment in the aggregate capital, profits and losses of the Trust so long as it is acting as the
Managing Owner of the Trust. Such contribution was made by the Managing Owner before trading commenced for the Trust and will be maintained
throughout the existence of the Trust, and the Managing Owner will make such purchases as are necessary to effect this requirement. Additionally,
the Managing Owner agreed with certain regulatory bodies to maintain a interest specifically in the Frontier Balanced Fund Class 1AP
Units and Frontier Balanced Fund Class 2a Units, aggregated, and each of the Frontier Long/Short Commodity Fund, Frontier Diversified
Fund, and Frontier Masters Fund. The interest in these specific Series of the Trust is included in computing the Minimum Purchase
Commitment in aggregate capital. In addition to the general units the Managing Owner receives in respect of its Minimum Purchase Commitment,
the Managing Owner may purchase limited units in any Series as a Limited Owner. Principals of the Managing Owner or affiliates are allowed
to own beneficial interests in the Trust, as well. All units purchased by the Managing Owner are held for investment purposes only and
not for resale. 

The
Managing Owner may make purchases or redemptions at any time on the same terms as any Limited Owner. The Trust has and will continue
to have certain relationships with the Managing Owner and its affiliates. 

Expenses 

Management
Fees Each Series of Units pays to the Managing Owner a monthly management fee equal to a percentage of the notional assets
of such Series allocated to Trading Companies, calculated on a daily basis. The percentage basis of the fees varies and are in line with
the amounts being disclosed below. In addition, the Managing Owner receives a monthly management equal to a certain percentage of the
assets in the Galaxy Plus entities attributable to such Series (including notional assets), calculated on a monthly basis. The
management fees attributable to Galaxy Plus entities are included in unrealized gain/(loss) on private investment companies on the combined
consolidated statements of operations. The total amount of assets of a Series allocated to Trading Advisors and/or reference programs,
including (i) actual funds deposited in accounts directed by the Trading Advisors or deposited as margin in respect of swaps or other
derivative instruments referencing a reference program plus (ii) any notional equity allocated to the Trading Advisors and any reference
programs, is referred to herein as the notional assets of the Series. The annual rate of the management fee is: 
for the Frontier Balanced Fund Class 1 and Class 2, for the Frontier Balanced Fund Class 1AP, Class 2a and Class 3a, 
for the Frontier Global Fund, Frontier Long/Short Commodity Fund Class 1a, Class 2a and Class 3a and Frontier Masters Fund, 
for Frontier Diversified Fund, for the Frontier Heritage Fund and Frontier Select Fund, and for the Frontier Long/Short
Commodity Fund Class 2 and Class 3. The Managing Owner may pay all or a portion of such management fees to the Trading Advisor(s) and/or
waive (up to the percentage specified) any such management fee to the extent any related management fee is paid by a trading company
or estimated management fee is embedded in a swap or other derivative instrument. Any management fee embedded in a swap or other derivative
instrument may be greater or less than the management fee that would otherwise be charged to the Series by the Managing Owner. 

The
management fee as a percentage of the applicable Series notional assets will be greater than the percentage of the applicable
Series net asset value to the extent that the notional assets of the Series exceeds its net asset value. The Managing Owner expects
that the notional assets of each Series will generally be maintained at a level in excess of the net asset value of such Series and such
excess may be substantial to the extent the Managing Owner deems necessary to achieve the desired level of volatility. 

Trading
Fees In connection with each Series trading activities the Frontier Balanced Fund, Frontier Select Fund, Frontier Global
Fund (formerly Frontier Winton Fund) and Frontier Heritage Fund pays to the Managing Owner an FCM Fee of up to per annum of notional
assets allocated to the trading advisors, including through investments in commodity pools available on the Galaxy Plus Platform, and
any reference programs of the applicable Series. The Frontier Diversified Fund, Frontier Long/Short Commodity Fund and Frontier Masters
Fund pays to the Managing Owner an FCM Fee of up to of notional assets allocated to the trading advisors, including through investments
in commodity pools available on the Galaxy Plus Platform, and a custodial/due diligence fee of of such Series NAV, calculated
daily.

for the Frontier Balanced Fund and the Frontier Diversified Fund and for the Frontier Global Fund, Frontier
Heritage Fund, Frontier Select Fund, Frontier Long/Short Commodity Fund and Frontier Masters Fund. The Managing Owner may pay all or
a portion of such incentive fees to the Trading Advisor(s) for such Series. 

Service
Fees In addition, with respect to Class 1 and Class 1a Units of each Series of the Trust, as applicable, the Series pays monthly
or quarterly to the Managing Owner a service fee of up to and annually, for the closed Series and open Series, respectively, which
the Managing Owner pays to selling agents of the Trust. With respect to Class 2 Units of each Series of the Trust, as applicable, the

With
respect to the service fees, the initial service fee (for the first 12 months) relating to a purchase of Units by an investor is prepaid
by the Managing Owner to the relevant selling agent in the month following such purchase and is reimbursed therefore by the Series monthly
in arrears in an amount based upon a corresponding percentage of NAV, calculated daily. Consequently, the Managing Owner bears the risk
and enjoys the benefit of the upside potential of any difference between the amount of the initial service fee prepaid by it and the
amount of the reimbursement thereof, which may result from variations in NAV over the following 12 months.

Item 2. MANAGEMENT S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

Introduction 

The following discussion and analysis contain
forward-looking statements about the Managing Owner s expectations of what may happen in the future. Forward looking statements
are based on a number of assumptions and estimates that are inherently subject to significant risks and uncertainties, and our results
could differ materially from the results anticipated by our forward-looking statements as a result of many known or unknown factors, including,
but not limited to, those factors discussed in Risk Factors . See also the Special Note About Forward-Looking Statements 
set forth at the beginning of this report. 

The following discussion and tables should be read in conjunction with
our unaudited combined consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this quarterly report and our 2023 Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

Overview 

The Trust is a Delaware statutory trust formed
on August 8, 2003. The Trust is a multi-advisor commodity pool, as described in CFTC Regulation 4.10(d)(2). The Trust is authorized
to issue multiple Series of Units, pursuant to the requirements of the Trust Act. The assets of each Series are held and accounted for
in separate and distinct records separately from the assets of other Series. The Trust is managed by the Managing Owner, and its term
will expire on December 31, 2053 (unless terminated earlier in certain circumstances). 

The Trust, with respect to each Series of Units,
engages in the speculative trading of a diversified portfolio of futures, forward (including interbank foreign currencies) and options
contracts and other derivative instruments (including swaps). The Trust allocates funds to affiliated Trading Companies and Galaxy Plus
entities, each of which has one-year renewable contracts with its own independent Trading Advisor(s) that will manage all or a portion
of the applicable Trading Company s or Galaxy Plus entity s assets, and make the trading decisions for the assets of
each Series invested in such Trading Company or Galaxy Plus entity. The assets of each Trading Company and Galaxy Plus entity will be
segregated from the assets of each other Trading Company and Galaxy Plus entity. The Trust has an investment objective of increasing the
value of the Units over the long term (capital appreciation), while controlling risk and volatility; further, to offer exposure to the
investment programs of individual Trading Advisors and to specific instruments (currencies). For additional overview of the Trust s
structure and business activities, see Item 1. 

All management fees, incentive fees, service fees,
risk analysis fee (for closed Series only) and trading fees of the Trust are paid to the Managing Owner. It is the responsibility of the
Managing Owner to pay all Trading Advisor management and incentive fees, selling agent service fees and all other operating expenses and
continuing offering costs of the Trust. Only management fees and incentive fees related to assets allocated through Trading Companies
are included in expense on the Statement of Operations. The Series are all charged management and incentive fees on the assets allocated
through the Galaxy Plus entities. Those fees are included in unrealized gain/(loss) on private investment companies on the Statements
of Operations. As of the date of this report, for a Series that has invested in a swap, the Managing Owner or Trading Advisor(s) do not
receive any management fees or incentive fees directly from the Series for such swap, and instead the relevant Trading Advisor receives
compensation via the fees embedded in the swap. In each case, the embedded incentive fee was accrued based on the net new trading profits
of the swap. The Series are also charged management and incentive fees on assets allocated to swaps. Such fees are embedded in the fair
value of the swap and are included in net unrealized gain (loss) on swap contracts on the Statements of Operations. Embedded in the swap
fair value is management and incentive fees being paid to Trading Advisors. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
none of the Series owned a swap investment and, thus, were not subject to any related embedded management and/or incentive fees. 

For further discussion of fees paid by the Trust,
see Item 1-Notes 2 and 6 Significant Accounting Policies and Transactions with Affiliates , respectively, in
the Notes to Financial Statements (unaudited).

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States GAAP requires the Managing Owner to adopt accounting
policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the Trust s financial statements. The Trust s
most significant accounting policy, described below, includes the valuation of its futures and forward contracts, options contracts, swap
contracts, U.S. treasury securities and investments in unconsolidated Trading Companies and Galaxy Plus entities. The majority of these
investments are exchange traded contracts valued upon exchange settlement prices or non-exchange traded contracts and obligations with
valuation based on third-party quoted dealer values on the Interbank market. 

The Trust s other significant accounting
policies are described in detail in Note 2 of the financial statements. 

Investment Transactions and Valuation 

The Managing Owner has evaluated the nature and
type of transactions processed and estimates that it makes in preparing the Trust s financial statements and related disclosures
and has adopted Accounting Standard Codification ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure , and implemented
the framework for measuring fair value for assets and liabilities. 

The Trust utilizes valuation techniques that are consistent with the
market approach per the requirement of ASC 820 for the valuation of futures (exchange traded) contracts, forward (non-exchange traded)
contracts, option contracts, swap contracts and other non-cash assets. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information
generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. The Trust applies the valuation techniques in
a consistent manner for each asset or liability. The Trust records all investments at fair value in its Combined Consolidated Statements
of Financial Condition, with changes in fair value reported as a component of net gain/(loss) on investments in the Combined Consolidated
Statements of Operations. 

Inputs to valuation techniques refer to the assumptions
that market participants would use in pricing the assets or liabilities. Inputs may be observable, meaning those that reflect the assumptions
market participants would use in pricing the financial asset or liability based on market data obtained from independent sources, or unobservable,
meaning those that reflect the reporting entity s own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing
the financial asset or liability based on the best information available in the circumstances. 

In addition, the Trust monitors counterparty credit risk and incorporates
any identified risk factors when assigning input levels to underlying financial assets or liabilities. In that regard ASC 820 establishes
a fair value hierarchy for valuation inputs that gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical financial
assets and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. A full disclosure of the fair value hierarchy is presented in Note 3 of the combined
consolidated financial statements Fair Value Measurements. 

Selection and Replacement of Trading Advisors 

The Managing Owner is responsible for the selection,
retention and termination of the Trading Advisors and reference programs on behalf of each Series. The actual allocation among Trading
Advisors for each Series will vary based upon the relative trading performance of the Trading Advisors and/or reference programs, and
the Managing Owner may otherwise vary such percentages from time to time in its sole discretion. The Managing Owner will adjust its allocations
and rebalance the portfolio of any Series among Trading Advisors to maintain weightings that it believes will most likely achieve capital
growth within the investment guidelines of the relevant Series. 

87 

The Managing Owner utilizes certain quantitative
and qualitative analysis in connection with the identification, evaluation and selection of the Trading Advisors. The Managing Owner s
proprietary and commercial analytical software programs and comprehensive Trading Advisor database provide the quantitative basis for
the Trading Advisor selection, portfolio implementation process, and ongoing risk management, monitoring, and review. 

The Managing Owner s research department
is continually refining ways to assimilate vast amounts of Trading Advisor performance data and due-diligence information. The proprietary
and commercial database of alternative investment programs is always increasing. Research team members regularly interact with Trading
Advisors throughout the due diligence and monitoring process. Only those programs that have met strict quantitative and qualitative review
are considered as potential managers of client assets. Following is a summary of the quantitative and qualitative analysis: 

Quantitative Analysis 

The Managing Owner s analytical software
system applies a variety of statistical measures towards the evaluation of current and historical advisor performance data. Statistical
measures include but are not limited to: (1) risk/reward analysis, (2) time window analysis, (3) risk analysis, (4) correlation analysis,
(5) statistical overlays and (6) performance cycle analysis. 

Qualitative Analysis 

Although quantitative analysis statistically identifies
the top performing Trading Advisors, qualitative analysis plays a major role in the Trading Advisor evaluation and final selection process.
Each Trading Advisor in the Managing Owner s top docile universe initially undergoes extensive qualitative review by the Managing
Owner s research department, as well as continual monitoring. This analysis generally includes but is not limited to: (1) preliminary
information and due diligence, (2) background review, (3) due diligence questionnaires and (4) written review and periodic
updates. This information allows a thorough review of each Trading Advisor s trading philosophy, trading systems and corporate structure. 

Multi-Manager Approach 

A multi-manager approach to portfolio management
provides diversification of Trading Advisors and access to broader global markets. Portfolios comprised of multiple Trading Advisors can
provide diversification across trading methodologies, trading time horizons, and markets traded, resulting in more consistent performance
returns and overall lower volatility. 

As of September 30, 2024, the trading system of
each of the major Trading Advisors and the means by which the Series access those Trading Advisors were as follows:

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

The Trust will raise additional capital only through
the sale of Units offered pursuant to the continuing offering and does not intend to raise any capital through borrowing. Due to the nature
of the Trust s business, it makes no capital expenditures and has no capital assets that are not operating capital or assets. 

The Managing Owner is responsible for the payment
of all of the ordinary expenses associated with the organization of the Trust and the offering of each Series of Units, except for the
initial and ongoing service fee, if any, and no Series will be required to reimburse these expenses. As a result, 100 of each Series 
offering proceeds are initially available for that Series trading activities. 

A portion of each Trading
Company s assets is used as margin to maintain that Trading Company s forward currency contract positions, and another portion
is deposited in cash in segregated accounts in the name of each Trading Company maintained for each Trading Company at the clearing brokers
in accordance with CFTC segregation requirements. At September 30, 2024, cash deposited at the clearing brokers was 0 for the Trust.
The clearing brokers are expected to credit each Trading Company with approximately 80 -100 of the interest earned on its average net
assets on deposit with the clearing brokers each month. Currently, with the Federal Funds target rate at 4.75 to 5.00 , this amount is
estimated to be 4.75 . In an attempt to increase interest income earned, the Managing Owner also may invest the non-margin assets in U.S.
government securities which include any security issued or guaranteed as to principal or interest by the U.S., or by a person controlled
by or supervised by and acting as an instrumentality of the government of the U.S. pursuant to authority granted by Congress or any certificate
of deposit for any of the foregoing, including U.S. treasury bonds, U.S. treasury bills and issues of agencies of the U.S. government,
and certain cash items such as money market funds and time deposits. Aggregate interest income from all sources, including U.S. treasury
securities assets net of premiums and cash held at clearing brokers, of up to 2 (annualized) is paid to the Managing Owner by the Frontier
Balanced Fund (Class 1 and Class 2 only), Frontier Long/Short Commodity Fund (Class 2 and Class 3), Frontier Global Fund, Frontier Select
Fund and Frontier Heritage Fund. For the Frontier Diversified Fund, Frontier Long/Short Commodity Fund (Class 2a and Class 3a), Frontier
Masters Fund and Frontier Balanced Fund (Class 1AP, Class 2a and Class 3a), 100 of the interest is retained by the respective Series.
The amount reflected in the financial statements for the Trust and Series are disclosed on a net basis. Due to some classes not exceeding
the 2 paid to the Managing Owner, amounts earned by those classes may be zero. 

89 

Approximately 75 to 95 of the Trust s
assets are expected to be committed as required margin for futures contracts and forwards and options trading and held by the respective
broker, although the amount committed may vary significantly. Such assets are maintained in the form of cash or U.S. treasury bills in
segregated accounts with the futures broker pursuant to the CEA and regulations there under. The remaining approximately 5 to 25 of
the Trust s assets will normally be invested in cash equivalents and short-term investments, such as money market funds and time
deposits and held by the clearing broker, the over-the-counter counterparties and by U.S. federally chartered banks. As of September 30,
2024, total cash and cash equivalents held at banking institutions were 44,557 for the Frontier Diversified Fund, 14,885 for the Frontier
Long/Short Commodity Fund, 14,034 for the Frontier Masters Fund, 109,735 for the Frontier Balanced Fund, 34,831 for the Frontier Select
Fund, 30,885 for the Frontier Global Fund, and 54,662 for the Frontier Heritage Fund. 

As a commodity pool, the Trust has large cash
positions. Such cash positions are used to pay margin for the trading of futures, forwards and options, and also to pay redemptions. Generally,
the Trust has not been forced to liquidate positions to fund redemptions. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the redemptions
payable were 21,006 for the Frontier Diversified Fund, 1 for the Frontier Master Fund, 2 for the Frontier Long/Short Commodity Fund,
 12 for the Frontier Balanced Fund, 1 for the Frontier Select Fund, 4 for the Frontier Global Fund, 2 for the Frontier Heritage Fund.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Trust was able to pay all redemptions on a timely basis. 

Off-Balance Sheet Risk 

The term off -balance sheet risk 
refers to an unrecorded potential liability that, even though it does not appear on the balance sheet, may result in future obligation
or loss. Each Trading Company trades in futures, forward and swap contracts and is therefore a party to financial instruments with elements
of off-balance sheet market and credit risk. In entering into these contracts there exists a market risk that such contracts may be significantly
influenced by market conditions, such as interest rate volatility, resulting in such contracts being less valuable. If the markets should
move against all of the futures interests positions held by a Trading Company in respect of any Series at the same time, and if the Trading
Advisor(s) of such Trading Company are unable to offset such futures interests positions, such Trading Company could lose all of its assets
and the holders of Units of such Series would realize a 100 loss. The Managing Owner seeks to minimize market risk through real-time
monitoring of open positions and the level of diversification of each Trading Advisor s portfolio. It is anticipated that any Trading
Advisor s margin-to-equity ratio will typically not exceed approximately 35 although the actual ratio could be higher or lower
from time to time. 

In addition to market risk, trading futures forward
and swap contracts entails credit risk which is the risk that a counterparty will not be able to meet its obligations to a Trading Company.
The counterparty for futures contracts traded in the U.S. and on most foreign exchanges is the clearinghouse associated with such exchange.
In general, clearinghouses are backed by the corporate members of the clearinghouse who are required to share any financial burden resulting
from the non-performance by one of their members and, as such, should significantly reduce this credit risk. In cases where the clearinghouse
is not backed by the clearing members, like some foreign exchanges, it is normally backed by a consortium of banks or other financial
institutions. Some non-U.S. exchanges, in contrast to U.S. exchanges are principals markets in which performance is the responsibility
only of the individual counterparty with whom the Trading Company has entered into the transaction and not of the exchange or clearing
corporation. In these kinds of markets, there is risk of bankruptcy or other failure or refusal to perform by the counterparty. 

In the case of forward contracts traded on the
interbank market and swaps, neither is traded on an exchange. The counterparty is generally a single bank or other financial institution,
rather than a group of financial institutions; thus, there may be a greater counterparty credit risk. The Managing Owner expects the Trading
Advisors to trade only with those counterparties which it believes to be creditworthy. All positions of each Trading Company are valued
each day on a mark-to-market basis. There can be no assurance that any clearing member, clearinghouse or other counterparty will be able
to meet its obligations to any Trading Company. 

90 

The Trust has entered into agreements, which provide
for the indemnification of futures clearing brokers, currency trading companies, and commodity trading advisers, among others, against
losses, costs, claims and liabilities arising from the performance of their individual obligations under such agreements, except for gross
negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct. The Trust has had no prior claims or payments pursuant to these agreements. The Trust s
individual maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown, as this would involve future claims that may be made against the Trust
that have not yet occurred. However, based on experience the Trust expects the risk of loss to be remote. 

Disclosure of Contractual Obligations 

The business of the Trust is the speculative trading
of commodity interests. The majority of the Trust s futures and forward positions, which may be categorized as purchase
obligations under Item 303 of Regulation S-K, are short-term. That is, they are held for less than one year. Because
the Trust does not enter into other long-term debt obligations, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or other long-term
liabilities that would otherwise be reflected on the Trust s Combined Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition, a table of
contractual obligations has not been presented.

Ended September 30, 2024 

Series Returns and Other Information 

The returns for each Series and Class of Units
for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and related information, are discussed below. The activities of the Trust on a
combined consolidated basis are explained through the activity of each underlying Series. Please refer to the discussion of the Series
activities in relation to the Trust on a combined consolidated basis. 

Each Series had exposure to commodity interest
positions within one or more sectors during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The performance of each Series was impacted
over the course of the year by, among other things, the relative performance of the relevant sector or sectors and the commodities within
those sectors, the changing allocations among, and the specific positions taken by, the Series Trading Advisors in, the relevant
sector(s) and commodities, and the timing of entries and exits. For each of the Series, a sector attribution chart has been included at
the end of the relevant discussion. Each chart depicts the performance of the relevant Series positions within each of the relevant
sectors (determined by the Managing Owner using monthly gross return and NAV figures, with various adjustments to net out a proportional
allocation of the fees and expenses chargeable to the Series) during the periods presented.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET
RISK . 

The Trust is a speculative commodity pool. The
market sensitive instruments, which are held by the Trading Companies or Galaxy Plus entities in which the Series are invested, are acquired
for speculative trading purposes, and all or a substantial amount of the Series assets are subject to the risk of trading loss.
Unlike an operating company, the risk of market sensitive instruments is integral, not incidental, to the Series main line of business. 

Market movements result in frequent changes in
the fair market value of each Trading Company s open positions and, consequently, in each Series of the Trust s earnings and
cash flow. The Trading Companies and Galaxy Plus entities and consequently the Series market risk is influenced by
a wide variety of factors, including the level and volatility of exchange rates, interest rates, equity price levels, the market value
of financial instruments and contracts, the diversification effects among the open positions and the liquidity of the markets in which
trades are made. 

Each Trading Company and Galaxy Plus entity rapidly
acquires and liquidates both long and short positions in a wide range of different markets. Consequently, it is not possible to predict
how a particular future market scenario will affect performance, and the past performance for any Series is not necessarily indicative
of the future results of such Series. 

Additional risk of trading loss from investment
in an unaffiliated Trading Company may result from the Managing Owner s inability to directly control or stop trading in the event
of exercise of certain withdrawal provisions in the investment agreement. 

The Trading Companies and Galaxy Plus entities,
and consequently the Series primary market risk exposures as well as the strategies used and to be used by the Trading Advisors
for managing such exposures are subject to numerous uncertainties, contingencies and risks, any one of which could cause the actual results
of the Trust s and the Managing Owner s risk controls to differ materially from the objectives of such strategies. Government
interventions, defaults and expropriations, illiquid markets, the emergence of dominant fundamental factors, political upheavals, changes
in historical price relationships, an influx of new market participants, increased regulation and many other factors could result in material
losses as well as in material changes to the risk exposures and the risk management strategies of the Trading Companies and Galaxy Plus
entities and consequently the Trust. There can be no assurance that the Trading Companies and Galaxy Plus entities current
market exposure and/or risk management strategies will not change materially or that any such strategies will be effective in either the
short- or long-term. Investors must be prepared to lose all or substantially all of their investment in a Series. 

Quantitative Market Risk 

The Series approximate risk exposure in
the various market sectors traded by its Trading Advisors is quantified below in terms of value at risk. Due to the Series mark-to-market
accounting, any loss in the fair value of the Series (through the Trading Companies and Galaxy Plus entities) open positions is
directly reflected in the Series earnings, realized or unrealized gain/loss. 

Exchange maintenance margin requirements have
been used by the Trust as the measure of its value at risk. Maintenance margin requirements are set by exchanges to equal or exceed the
maximum losses reasonably expected to be incurred in the fair value of any given contract in 95 to 99 of any one-day interval. The maintenance
margin levels are established by brokers, dealers and exchanges using historical price studies as well as an assessment of current market
volatility and economic fundamentals to provide a probabilistic estimate of the maximum expected near-term one-day price fluctuation.
Maintenance margin has been used rather than the more generally available initial margin, because initial margin includes a credit risk
component that is not relevant to value at risk. 

In the case of market sensitive instruments that
are not exchange-traded, including currencies and some energy products and metals, the margin requirements for the equivalent futures
positions have been used as value at risk. In those cases in which a futures-equivalent margin is not available, dealers margins
have been used. 

In the case of contracts denominated in foreign
currencies, the value at risk figures include foreign currency margin amounts converted into U.S. dollars with an incremental adjustment
to reflect the exchange rate risk inherent to the Series, which is valued in U.S. dollars, in expressing value at risk in a functional
currency other than U.S. dollars. 

In quantifying each Series value at risk,
100 positive correlation in the different positions held in each market risk category has been assumed. Consequently, the margin requirements
applicable to the open contracts have simply been aggregated to determine each trading category s aggregate value at risk. The diversification
effects resulting from the fact that the Series positions held through the Trading Companies and Galaxy Plus entities are rarely,
if ever, 100 positively correlated have not been reflected.

Material Limitations on Value at Risk as an Assessment of Market
Risk 

The face value of the market sector instruments
held on behalf of the Series is typically many times the applicable maintenance margin requirement, which generally ranges between approximately
1 and 10 of contract face value, as well as many times the capitalization of the Series. The magnitude of each Series open positions
creates a risk of ruin not typically found in most other investment vehicles. Because of the size of their positions, certain market conditions,
although unusual, but historically recurring from time to time, could cause a Series to incur severe losses over a short period of time.
The value at risk table above, as well as the past performance of the Series, gives no indication of this risk of severe losses. 

117 

Non-Trading Risk 

The Series have non-trading market risk on their
foreign cash balances not needed for margin. However, these balances, as well as the market risk they represent, are immaterial. The Series
also have non-trading market risk as a result of investing a portion of their available assets in U.S. government securities which include
any security issued or guaranteed as to principal or interest by the U.S., or by a person controlled by or supervised by and acting as
an instrumentality of the government of the U.S. pursuant to authority granted by Congress of the U.S. or any certificate of deposit for
any of the foregoing, including U.S. treasury bonds, U.S. treasury bills and issues of agencies of the U.S. government, and certain cash
items such as money market funds, certificates of deposit (under three months) and time deposits. The market risk represented by these
investments is also immaterial. 

Qualitative Market Risk 

The following are the primary trading risk exposures
of the Series of the Trust as of September 30, 2024, by market sector. 

Interest Rates 

Interest rate risk is one of the principal market
exposures of each Series. Interest rate movements directly affect the price of interest rate futures positions held and indirectly the
value of a Trading Company s stock index and currency positions. Interest rate movements in one country as well as relative interest
rate movements between countries materially impact profitability. The primary interest rate exposure is to interest rate fluctuations
in the U.S. and the other G-7 countries. However, the Trading Companies and Galaxy Plus entities also may take futures positions on the
government debt of smaller nations. The Managing Owner anticipates that G-7 interest rates will remain the primary market exposure of
each Trading Company and Galaxy Plus entities and accordingly of each Series for the foreseeable future. The changes in interest rates
which are expected to have the most effect on the Series are changes in long-term, as opposed to short-term rates. Most of the speculative
positions to be held by the Trading Companies and Galaxy Plus entities will be in medium- to long-term instruments. Consequently, even
a material change in short term rates is expected to have little effect on the Series if the medium- to long-term rates remain steady.
Aggregate interest income from all sources, including assets held at clearing brokers, of up to 2 (annualized) is paid to the Managing
Owner by the Frontier Balanced Fund (Class 1 and Class 2 only), Frontier Global Fund, Frontier Select Fund and Frontier Heritage Fund.
For the Frontier Diversified Fund, Frontier Long/Short Commodity Fund (Class 1a, Class 2a, Class 3a only), Frontier Masters Fund and Frontier
Balanced Fund (Class 1AP, Class 2a and Class 3a), 20 of the total interest allocated to each Series was paid to the Managing Owner from
January 1, 2017 through April 28, 2017; thereafter 100 of the interest is retained by the respective Series. 

Currencies 

Exchange rate risk is a significant market exposure
of each Series of the Trust in general. For each Series of the Trust in general, currency exposure is to exchange rate fluctuations, primarily
fluctuations that disrupt the historical pricing relationships between different currencies and currency pairs. These fluctuations are
influenced by interest rate changes as well as political and general economic conditions. The Trading Advisors on behalf of a Series trade
in a large number of currencies, including cross-rates, which are positions between two currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The Managing
Owner does not anticipate that the risk profile of the Series currency sector will change significantly in the future. 

118 

Stock Indices 

For each Series, its primary equity exposure is
equity price risk in the G-7 countries as well as other smaller jurisdictions. Each Series of the Trust is primarily exposed to the risk
of adverse price trends or static markets in the major U.S., European and Japanese indices. 

Metals 

For each Series, its metals market exposure is
fluctuations in the price of both precious metals, including gold and silver, as well as base metals including aluminum, copper, nickel
and zinc. Some metals, such as gold, are used as surrogate stores of value, in place of hard currency, and thus have currency or interest
rate risk associated with them relative to their price in a specific currency. Other metals, such as silver, platinum, copper and steel,
have substantial industrial applications, and may be subject to forces affecting industrial production and demand. 

Agriculturals/Softs 

Each Series may also invest in raw commodities
and may thus have exposure to agricultural price movements, which are often directly affected by severe or unexpected weather conditions
or by political events in countries that comprise significant sources of commodity supply. 

Energy 

For each Series its primary energy market exposure
is in oil, gas and other energy product price movements, often resulting from political developments and ongoing conflicts in the Middle
East. Oil and gas prices can be volatile and substantial profits and losses have been and are expected to continue to be experienced in
this market. 

Other Trading Risks 

As a result of leverage, small changes in the
price of a Trading Company s positions may result in substantial losses for a Series. Futures, forwards and options are typically
traded on margin. This means that a small amount of capital can be used to invest in contracts of much greater total value. The resulting
leverage means that a relatively small change in the market price of a contract can produce a substantial loss. Like other leveraged investments,
any purchase or sale of a contract may result in losses in excess of the amount invested in that contract. The Trading Companies and Galaxy
Plus entities may lose more than their initial margin deposits on a trade. 

The Trading Companies and Galaxy Plus entities 
trading is subject to execution risks. Market conditions may make it impossible for the Trading Advisors to execute a buy or sell order
at the desired price, or to close out an open position. Daily price fluctuation limits are established by the exchanges and approved by
the CFTC. When the market price of a contract reaches its daily price fluctuation limit, no trades can be executed at prices outside the
limit. The holder of a contract may therefore be locked into an adverse price movement for several days or more and lose considerably
more than the initial margin put up to establish the position. Thinly traded or illiquid markets also can make it difficult or impossible
to execute trades. The Trading Advisor s positions are subject to speculative limits. The CFTC and domestic exchanges have established
speculative position limits on the maximum futures position which any person, or group of persons acting in concert, may hold or control
in particular futures contracts or options on futures contracts traded on U.S. commodity exchanges. Under current regulations, other accounts
of the Trading Advisors are combined with the positions held by them on behalf of the applicable Trading Company and Galaxy Plus entity
for position limit purposes. This trading could preclude additional trading in these commodities by the Trading Advisors for the accounts
of the Series. 

119 

Systematic strategies do not consider fundamental
types of data and do not have the benefit of discretionary decision making. The assets of the Series are allocated to Trading Advisors
that rely on technical, systematic strategies that do not take into account factors external to the market itself (although certain of
these strategies may have minor discretionary elements incorporated into their systematic strategy). The widespread use of technical trading
systems frequently results in numerous Trading Advisors attempting to execute similar trades at or about the same time, altering trading
patterns and affecting market liquidity. Furthermore, the profit potential of trend-following systems may be diminished by the changing
character of the markets, which may make historical price data (on which technical programs are based) only marginally relevant to future
market patterns. Systematic strategies are developed on the basis of a statistical analysis of market prices. Consequently, any factor
external to the market itself that dominates prices that a discretionary decision maker may take into account may cause major losses for
a systematic strategy. For example, a pending political or economic event may be very likely to cause a major price movement, but a systematic
strategy may continue to maintain positions indicated by its trading method that might incur major losses if the event proved to be adverse. 

However, because certain of the Trading Advisors 
strategies involve some discretionary aspects in addition to their technical factors, certain of the Trading Advisors may occasionally
use discretion in investing the assets of a Trading Company. For example, the Trading Advisors often use discretion in selecting contracts
and markets to be followed. In exercising such discretion, such Trading Advisor may take positions opposite to those recommended by the
Trading Advisor s trading system or signals. Discretionary decision making may also result in a Trading Advisor failing to capitalize
on certain price trends or making unprofitable trades in a situation where another trader relying solely on a systematic approach might
not have done so. Furthermore, such use of discretion may not enable the relevant Series of the Trust to avoid losses, and in fact, such
use of discretion may cause such Series to forego profits which it may have otherwise earned had such discretion not been used. 

Cyber Risks and Security 

The Trust s business requires it to use
and store investor, employee and business partner personally identifiable information PII ). This may include, among other
information, names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, contact preferences, tax identification numbers and payment account information. 

The Trust requires usernames and passwords in
order to access its information technology systems. The Trust also uses encryption and authentication technologies designed to secure
the transmission and storage of data and prevent access to Trust data or accounts. These security measures are subject to third-party
security breaches, employee error, malfeasance, faulty password management, or other irregularities. To help protect investors and the
Trust, the Trust monitors accounts and systems for unusual activity and may freeze accounts under suspicious circumstances. 

The Trust devotes significant resources to network
security, data encryption and other security measures to protect its systems and data, but these security measures cannot provide absolute
security. To the extent the Trust was to experience a breach of its systems and was unable to protect sensitive data, such a breach could
materially damage business partner and investor relationships. Moreover, if a computer security breach affects the Trust s systems
or results in the unauthorized release of PII, the Trust s reputation and brand could be materially damaged and the Trust could
be exposed to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability. While the Trust maintains insurance coverage that, subject to policy
terms and conditions and subject to a significant self-insured retention, is designed to address certain aspects of cyber risks, such
insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise in the continually evolving area of cyber
risk. 

120 

Qualitative Disclosures
Regarding Means of Managing Risk Exposure 

The means by which the Managing Owner attempts
to manage the risk of the Trust s open positions is essentially the same in all market categories traded. The Managing Owner applies
risk management policies to trading which generally are designed to limit the total exposure of assets under management. In addition,
the Managing Owner follows diversification guidelines which are often formulated in terms of the balanced volatility between markets and
correlated groups. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls
and Procedures 

Under the supervision
and with the participation of the management of the Managing Owner, including its Chairman and Chief Financial Officer,
the Trust evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e)
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )), for the Trust and each Series as of September
30, 2024 (the Evaluation Date ). Any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can only provide reasonable
(not absolute) assurance that its objectives will be met. Furthermore, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all
control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. 

Based
upon its evaluation, the management of the Managing Owner concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, the disclosure controls and procedures
for the Trust and each Series were effective to provide reasonable assurance that they are timely alerted to the material information
relating to the Trust and each Series required to be included in the Trust s periodic SEC filing. 

Report on Management s
Assessment of Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

The management of the
Managing Owner is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting by the Trust. 

The Managing Owner s
internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States. 

The internal control
over financial reporting for the Trust and each Series includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets; (ii) provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the
management of the Managing Owner; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements of the Trust or any Series. 

121 

Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. All internal control
systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention of overriding
controls. Accordingly, even effective internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to
financial statement preparation. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls
may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Management assessed the
effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting for the Trust and each Series as of September 30, 2024, based on the framework
set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in its 2013 report entitled Internal
Control-Integrated Framework . 

Based on that assessment,
the Trust s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Trust maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of September 30, 2024. 

This quarterly report
does not include an attestation report of the Trust s independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over
financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by the Trust s independent registered public accounting
firm pursuant to the rules of the SEC that permit the Trust to provide only management s report in this quarterly report.
