 , so that each Newmark Holdings limited partnership interest was exchangeable for share of Newmark Class A common stock; however, such Exchange Ratio is subject to adjustment. For reinvestment, acquisition or other purposes, Newmark may determine on a quarterly basis to distribute to its stockholders a smaller percentage of its income than Newmark Holdings distributes to its equity holders (excluding tax distributions from Newmark Holdings) of the cash that it received from Newmark OpCo. In such circumstances, the Separation and Distribution Agreement provides that the Exchange Ratio will be reduced to reflect the amount of additional cash retained by Newmark as a result of the distribution of such smaller percentage, after the payment of taxes. As of September 30, 2024, the Exchange Ratio equaled . 
 
 On November 15, 2022, BGC Group, BGC Partners, and BGC Holdings, and other affiliated entities, entered into a corporate conversion agreement, which was amended as of March 29, 2023, in order to reorganize and simplify the organizational structure of the BGC entities by converting BGC Partners from an Up-C to a Full C-Corporation through the Corporate Conversion. On July 1, 2023, the Corporate Conversion was completed. As a result of the Corporate Conversion, BGC Group became the public holding company for, and successor to, BGC Partners, and its Class A common stock began trading on Nasdaq, in place of BGC Partners Class A common stock, under the ticker symbol BGC. Upon completion of the Corporate Conversion, the former stockholders of BGC Partners, Inc. and the former limited partners of BGC Holdings, L.P. now participate in the economics of the BGC businesses through BGC Group, Inc. There are no longer any BGC Holdings units outstanding. 
 
 As a result of a series of transactions prior to and in anticipation of the Corporate Conversion, all BGC Holdings units held by Newmark employees were redeemed or exchanged, in each case, for shares of BGC Class A common stock. 
 
 Redeemable Partnership Interests 
 Founding/Working Partners have limited partnership interests in Newmark Holdings. Newmark accounts for FPUs outside of permanent capital as Redeemable partnership interests on the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. This classification is applicable to FPUs because these units are redeemable upon termination of a partner, including a termination of employment, which can be at the option of the partner and not within the control of the issuer. On June 30, 2023, in connection with the Corporate Conversion, all FPUs of BGC Holdings were redeemed or exchanged. The Corporate Conversion had no impact on FPUs held by partners of Newmark Holdings. 
 
 FPUs generally receive quarterly allocations of net income. Upon termination of employment or otherwise ceasing to provide substantive services, the FPUs are generally redeemed, and the unit holders are no longer entitled to participate in the quarterly allocations of net income. These quarterly allocations of net income are contingent upon services being provided by the unit holder and are reflected as a component of compensation expense under Equity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs on the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statements of 
 22 

(which is per calendar year) or such other amount as set forth in the award documentation. These allocations are deducted before the calculation and distribution of the quarterly partnership distribution for the remaining partnership units and are generally contingent upon services being provided by the unit holder. The Preferred Units are not entitled to participate in partnership distributions other than with respect to the Preferred Distribution. Preferred Units may not be made exchangeable into Newmark s Class A common stock and are only entitled to the Preferred Distribution, and accordingly are not included in Newmark s fully diluted share count. The quarterly allocations of net income on Preferred Units are reflected in compensation expense under Equity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs on the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. After deduction of the Preferred Distribution, the remaining partnership units generally receive quarterly allocation of net income based on their weighted-average pro rata share of economic ownership of the operating subsidiaries. In addition, Preferred Units are granted in connection with the grant of certain limited partnership units, such as PSUs, that may be granted exchangeability to cover the withholding taxes owed by the unit holder, rather than issuing the gross amount of shares to employees, subject to cashless withholding of shares to pay applicable withholding taxes. 
 
 Certain Newmark employees hold N Units that do not participate in quarterly partnership distributions and are not allocated any items of profit or loss. N Units become distribution earning limited partnership units, ratably over a vesting term, if certain revenue thresholds are met at the end of each vesting term. 
 
 Cantor Units 
 Cantor holds limited partnership interests in Newmark Holdings. Cantor Units are reflected as a component of Noncontrolling interests on the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. Cantor receives quarterly allocations of net income (loss) which are reflected as a component of Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests on the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
 
 General 
 23 

million shares of Newmark Class B common stock, which are convertible into Class A common stock. Limited partnership interests in Newmark Holdings held by a partner or Cantor may become exchangeable for a number of shares of Newmark Class A or Class B common stock equal to the number of limited partnership interests multiplied by the Exchange Ratio at that time. As of September 30, 2024, the Exchange Ratio equaled . 
 
 Each quarter, net income (loss) is allocated between the limited partnership interests and the common stockholders. In quarterly periods in which Newmark has a net loss, the loss is allocated to Cantor and reflected as a component of Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests on the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. In subsequent quarters in which Newmark has net income, the initial allocation of income to the limited partnership interests is allocated to Cantor, and reflected in, Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests, to recover any losses taken in earlier quarters, with the remaining income allocated to the limited partnership interests. This loss allocation process between limited partners and Cantor has no material impact on the net income (loss) allocated to common stockholders.

These advances and loans are repayable in the time frame outlined in the underlying agreements. Newmark reviews loan balances each reporting period for collectability.

 Basic weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding Basic earnings per share 
 
 Fully diluted EPS is calculated utilizing net income (loss) available to common stockholders plus net income allocations to the limited partnership interests in Newmark Holdings as the numerator. The denominator comprises Newmark s weighted-average number of outstanding shares of Newmark Common Stock and, if dilutive, the weighted-average number of limited partnership interests and other contracts to issue shares of common stock, stock options and RSUs. The limited partnership interests generally are potentially exchangeable into shares of Newmark Class A common stock and are entitled to remaining earnings after the deduction for the Preferred Distribution; as a result, they are included in the fully diluted EPS computation to the extent that the effect would be dilutive.

 Disaggregation of Revenues 
 Newmark s chief operating decision-maker, regardless of geographic location, evaluates the operating results, including revenues, of Newmark as total real estate services (see Note 3 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for further discussion). 
 
 Contract Balances 
 The timing of Newmark s revenue recognition may differ from the timing of payment by its customers. Newmark records a receivable when revenue is recognized prior to payment and Newmark has an unconditional right to payment. Alternatively, when payment precedes the provision of the related services, Newmark records deferred revenue until the performance obligations are satisfied. 
 
 Newmark s deferred revenue primarily relates to customers paying in advance or billed in advance where the performance obligation has not yet been satisfied. Deferred revenue is recorded as a contract liability. Deferred revenue at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was million and million, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, Newmark recognized revenue of million and million, respectively, that was recorded as deferred revenue in a previous period. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, Newmark recognized revenue of million and million, respectively, that was recorded as deferred revenue in a previous period. 
 
 For Knotel and Deskeo, the Company s remaining performance obligations that represent contracted customer revenues, that have not yet been recognized as revenue as of September 30, 2024 and that will be recognized as revenue in future periods over the life of the customer contracts in accordance with ASC 606, are approximately million. Over half of the remaining performance obligations as of September 30, 2024 is scheduled to be recognized as revenue within the next twelve months, with the remaining to be recognized over the remaining life of the customer contracts, which extends through 2030.

 The estimated fair value of the MSRs as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was million and million, respectively. 
 
 Fair values are estimated using a valuation model that calculates the present value of the future net servicing cash flows. The cash flows assumptions used are based on assumptions Newmark believes market participants would use to value the portfolio. Significant assumptions include estimates of the cost of servicing per loan, discount rate, earnings rate on escrow deposits and prepayment speeds. 
 
 The discount rates used in measuring fair value for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and year ended December 31, 2023 were between and and varied based on investor type. An increase in discount rate of basis points or basis points would result in a decrease in fair value by million and million, respectively, as of September 30, 2024, and by million and million, respectively, as of December 31, 2023.

 The fair value of Newmark and BGC RSUs held by Newmark employees is determined on the date of grant based on the market value (adjusted if appropriate based upon the award s eligibility to receive dividends), and is recognized, net of the effect of estimated forfeitures, ratably over the vesting period. Newmark uses historical data, including historical forfeitures and turnover rates, to estimate expected forfeiture rates for RSUs. Each RSU is settled for share of BGC or Newmark Class A common stock, as applicable, upon completion of the vesting period. The compensation expenses under GAAP related to the RSUs are based on the company where the employee is employed. Therefore, compensation expenses related to RSUs of both Newmark and BGC but held by a Newmark employee are recognized by Newmark.

The following generally does not include matters that Newmark has pending against other parties which, if successful, would result in awards in favor of Newmark or its subsidiaries. 
 
 Employment, Competitor-Related and Other Litigation 
 
 From time to time, Newmark and its subsidiaries are involved in litigation, claims and arbitration in the U.S. and internationally relating to various employment matters, including with respect to termination of employment, hiring of employees currently or previously employed by competitors, terms and conditions of employment and other matters. In light of the competitive nature of the real estate services industry, litigation, claims and arbitration between competitors regarding employee hiring are not uncommon. 
 
 Legal reserves are established in accordance with U.S. GAAP guidance on Accounting for Contingencies , when a material legal liability is both probable and reasonably estimable. Once established, reserves are adjusted when there is more information available or when an event occurs requiring a change. The outcome of such items cannot be determined with certainty. Newmark is unable to estimate a possible loss or range of loss in connection with specific matters beyond its current accrual and any other amounts disclosed. Management believes that, based on currently available information, the final outcome of these current pending matters will not have a material adverse effect on Newmark s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and disclosures taken as a whole. 
 
 Risks and Uncertainties 
 
 Newmark generates revenues by providing financial intermediary and brokerage activities and commercial real estate services to institutional customers. Revenues for these services are transaction-based. As a result, revenues could vary based on the transaction volume of global financial and real estate markets. Additionally, financing is sensitive to interest rate fluctuations, which could have an impact on Newmark s overall profitability.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 The following discussion of Newmark s financial condition and results of operations should be read together with Newmark s accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes, as well as the Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Information relating to forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act, included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 This discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting our results of operations and financial condition during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. We operate in one reportable segment, real estate services. This discussion is provided to increase the understanding of, and should be read in conjunction with, our accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

Overview 
 
 Newmark is a leading commercial real estate advisor and service provider to large institutional investors, global corporations, and other owners and occupiers. We offer a diverse array of integrated services and products designed to meet the full needs of our clients. 
 
 Our investor/owner services and products include: 
 
 capital markets, which consists of investment sales and commercial mortgage brokerage (including the placement of debt, equity raising, structured finance, and loan sales on behalf of third parties); 
 landlord (or agency) leasing; 
 valuation and advisory; 
 property management; 
 our leading commercial real estate technology platform and capabilities for owners; 
 business rates for U.K. property owners; 
 due diligence consulting and other advisory services; 
 GSEs and FHA multifamily lending and loan servicing; 
 limited and special loan servicing and asset management; and 
 flexible workspace solutions for owners. 
 
 Our corporate or occupier services and products include: 
 
 tenant representation leasing; 
 GCS, which provides integrated client solutions typically under long-term agreements, including project management, transaction management, lease administration, and facilities management, as well as corporate consulting services with respect to clients needs across real estate and supply chain optimization, site selection, workplace strategy, and occupancy; 
 our leading commercial real estate technology platform and capabilities for occupiers; 
 business rates for U.K. occupiers; and 
 flexible workspace solutions for occupiers. 
 
 Our goal is to lead with extraordinary talent, data, and analytics, which together allow us to provide strategic and specialized advice. This combination enables our revenue-generating employees, including brokers, originators, and other customer-facing professionals, to be highly productive and to help clients increase their efficiency and profits while optimizing their real estate portfolios. Our goal is also to continue recruiting and retaining the greatest talent in the industry and to be recognized as the leading advisor in commercial real estate services. 
 
 With respect to our overall business, our near-term goals include becoming number one in capital markets in the United States and growing significantly larger in key international markets. This is partly because our investment sales and debt businesses have historically had a multiplier effect that drives outsized growth across many of our other service lines. When overall capital markets activity rebounds and our recently hired producers reach full productivity, we believe that our market share, revenues, and earnings can outperform the industry across our suite of services. We are also focused on increasing the percentage of our total revenues from our recurring and/or contractual businesses, such as servicing, V A, GCS, agency leasing, and property management. Our goals also include increasing cross-selling opportunities with and between many of these service lines and our capital markets and overall leasing businesses. We expect this to create a virtuous circle that will continue to bolster our long-term market share gains over time.

Newmark was founded in New York City in 1929, with an emphasis on local investor/owner and occupier services and products and became known for having dedicated, knowledgeable, and client-focused advisors/intermediaries. Our acquisition by Cantor Fitzgerald s subsidiary BGC in 2011 and its subsequent investments in our business contributed to Newmark s strong growth. This growth continued following our 2017 IPO. Between 2011 and 2023, we increased our total revenues by a CAGR of 22 . Based on reported results, we believe that this improvement was greater than any of our publicly traded commercial real estate services peers listed in the U.S. or U.K. that have reported revenues over this period (based on actual results reported by our peers). 
 
 We have relationships with many of the world s largest commercial property owners, real estate developers and investors, as well as Fortune 500 and Forbes Global 2000 companies. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we generated revenues of approximately 1.9 billion, primarily from commissions on leasing and capital markets transactions, consulting and technology user fees, property and facility management fees, and mortgage origination and loan servicing fees. 
 
 Business Environment 
 
 As discussed in greater detail in Economic Growth and Outlook in the United States and the United Kingdom and Market Statistics, origination and investment volumes in the commercial real estate industry declined year-on-year each quarter from the second half of 2022 to the fourth quarter of 2023, and were generally lower in the first half of 2024, due to the rise in global interest rates. Industry investment sales volumes stabilized in the third quarter of 2024, while commercial and multifamily origination activity accelerated its year-on-year improvement in the U.S. We gained market share in the U.S. capital markets in 2023, particularly in the third and fourth quarters, as our corresponding transaction volumes either improved or decreased at rates less than those for the industry as a whole. Our share gains continued in the first through third quarters of 2024. Most major central banks have stopped increasing short-term target interest rates or have begun lowering them. This, coupled with the significant amount of commercial and multifamily debt maturities due over the next three years, leads us to expect industry volumes to continue rebounding, although there remains uncertainty with respect to the exact timing of sustained recovery. 
 
 We believe that during stressed or challenging times, our clients value having a trusted advisor like Newmark. We believe our partnership and collaboration with our clients during the recent uncertainty has helped us develop long-lasting relationships and gain market share over time. During the recent slowdown in industry transactional activity levels, we continued to see strong client dialogue and engagement as owners and occupiers sought our advice with respect to executing on their strategic and real estate-focused objectives. 
 
 Institutional investors have accumulated significant amounts of undeployed real estate-focused capital, with Preqin estimating that there was approximately 373 billion of investible funds held by closed-end funds at real estate focused institutions as of October 23, 2024, of which 245 billion was held by North America focused funds and 65 billion by funds focused on Europe. This is in addition to the significant amount of real estate assets held by other types of investors and owners such as publicly traded REITs, non-traded REITs, and open-ended core property funds. According to the most recent data from MSCI, the overall size of the professionally managed global real estate investment market was 13.2 trillion in 2023, while the size of the overall investible market was 19.5 trillion in 2022 (the last year for which this information was released). 
 
 Furthermore, there was approximately 4.7 trillion in U.S. commercial and multifamily mortgage debt outstanding as of June 30, 2024, per the MBA (excluding loans for acquisitions, development, and construction, as well as loans collateralized by owner-occupied commercial properties). Of this amount, approximately 2.6 trillion is expected to mature between 2024 and 2028, with approximately 2.0 trillion of this debt expected to mature by 2026. With the increase in interest rates since early 2022, and generally rising capitalization rates, as well as the pullback in commercial real estate lending by banks and other traditional lenders, we believe a large and growing percentage of investors and owners will need to find alternative solutions, including via the growing share of loans we expect to be originated by alternative lenders such as private credit funds and insurance companies. We anticipate a significant portion of debt maturities to be resolved not only through refinancing, which should help our mortgage brokerage and GSE/FHA origination businesses, but also through the kinds of more complex and sophisticated financing solutions in which Newmark specializes, including restructurings, loan sales, equity joint ventures, and recapitalizations. Our capital markets clients have sought, and we believe will continue to seek, our counsel with respect to addressing their related investing and financing needs. In addition, we anticipate better office market leasing fundamentals as the recapitalization of properties at lower values leads to a more attractive market. 
 
 We believe factors such as those discussed above will drive strong levels of leasing and capital markets activity over the intermediate and long-term time horizons, even as volumes for certain property types and in certain geographies remain muted in the near-term. We expect our professionals to not only provide our clients with innovative capital markets solutions, but to offer integrated services from our experts across leasing, V A, property management, and other Newmark service lines. 
 61 

By using a collaborative and multidisciplinary approach, we can provide our clients with extensive industry and product expertise along regional, national, and increasingly global reach across a wide variety of property types. 
 
 Key Business Drivers 
 We continue to invest in our businesses by adding high profile and talented producers and other revenue-generating professionals. Historically, newly hired commercial real estate producers tend to generate dramatically higher revenues in their second and third years with the Company, although we incur related expenses immediately. As newly hired producers ramp up and increase their productivity, our commission revenues and earnings growth accelerate, all else equal, due to our strong operating leverage. 
 
 We operate a leading capital markets business in the United States with a growing international presence. We have access to many of the world s largest owners of commercial real estate, and we believe this will drive growth throughout the life cycle of each real estate asset by allowing us to provide best-in-class agency leasing and property management during the ownership period. We also supply investment sales and arrange debt and equity financing to assist owners in maximizing the return on investment in each of their real estate assets. With respect to multifamily assets, we are a leading GSE/FHA lender by loan origination volume and loan servicing portfolio size. In addition to our traditional servicing business, we acquired the remainder of Spring11, an entity in which we had otherwise held a controlling stake since 2017, in the first quarter of 2023. Spring11 s recently launched asset management and servicing business focuses on bank, fund, and commercial mortgage-backed securities clients. As of September 30, 2024, our overall loan servicing and asset management portfolio was 179.1 billion (of which 62.5 was limited servicing and asset management, 36.0 was higher margin primary servicing, and 1.4 was special servicing). 
 
 We believe that for the industry, commercial and multifamily servicing and asset management companies earn 40 to 50 basis points on their Fannie Mae servicing book, eight to 10 basis points on Freddie Mac loans, approximately 15 basis points for FHA loans, and one to three basis points for limited servicing. The fees for special servicing and asset management can vary depending on a variety of factors. Spring11 s portfolio currently earns closer to the low end of the latter range but is targeting higher fees over time as it expands its offerings across special servicing and asset management. Limited servicing, special servicing, and asset management together generally produce higher profit margins than Newmark as a whole, but lower profit margins versus GSE/FHA primary servicing. We expect our overall portfolio to continue providing a steady stream of income and cash flow over the life of the serviced loans. 
 
 In addition, there are various trends that we expect to continue benefiting our various service lines with respect to industrial real estate. According to Newmark Research, several factors, including disruptions in global supply chains, tensions between the U.S. and China, and U.S. government spending on infrastructure and subsidies for industries associated with electrification, green energy, and strategically important technologies notably the federal spending provided by the CHIPS and Science Act, Inflation Reduction Act, and Infrastructure and Investment and Jobs Act could increase the size of the U.S. manufacturing base by 6 to 10 over the next ten years. According to Newmark Research, CoStar, and the U.S. Census Bureau, during the third quarter of 2024, annualized manufacturing construction spending in the U.S. was approximately 277 higher than the annual average for the ten years ended 2019 in nominal terms, or more than 130 higher based on chain linked 2007 dollars. The impact of reshoring manufacturing would likely have far-reaching effects in terms of industrial real estate, local and national tax revenues, increases in jobs, and growth in regional and national economies. Most of the new manufacturing construction will be build-to-suit or owner-built, but demand will also exist for speculative manufacturing space. 
 
 The expansion of domestic manufacturing is also expected to generate demand for logistics space and other types of commercial real estate in the communities surrounding new plants. The amount of additional demand generated by this construction will vary depending on a project s sector, existing supply chains, and local market dynamics. Several of the trends driving onshoring in the U.S. are also contributing to nearshoring of manufacturing to Mexico and Canada, with Mexico attracting the most nearshoring investment. This investment is generating demand for logistics and complementary manufacturing facilities along the U.S. border with Mexico, pushing down vacancy rates and spurring new construction near key border crossings such as Laredo, Texas. 
 
 Furthermore, Newmark Research estimates that annualized data center construction spending has surged by approximately 265 in the U.S. since 2019, fueled by expanding needs of hyperscalers, artificial intelligence, and other high-performance computing users, as well as large enterprises. The increased demand has spurred a surge in new development and land banking for future development, with data center construction pipelines hitting new all-time highs in 2024. The increase in data center usage has also led to increased demand for electricity generation and transmission. 
 
 62 

Newmark has advised and provided services for a number of industrial clients with respect to reshoring of manufacturing, logistics, data center, and power generation, and expects to benefit across several of its service lines as these trends continue for the foreseeable future. 
 
 Commercial real estate leasing activity has historically been positively correlated with job creation, particularly with respect to office-based employment, and GDP growth. While the solid U.S. economic improvement over the past several quarters has provided a tailwind to leasing activity across industrial, retail and office properties, this has been offset by the negative impact of the post-pandemic rise in remote working. In the U.S., and to a lesser extent in Europe, this has reduced demand for all but premium Class A office properties generally, as well as for retail space in many business districts. 
 
 Commercial real estate capital markets transactions involving financing generally utilize medium- or long-term debt, and the interest rates for such debt tend to correlate with movements in benchmark rates with similar tenors, including U.S. Treasuries. Such benchmark rates can be meaningfully impacted by movements in key short-term rates, such as the Fed Funds Target rate. Sudden increases in short term interest rates can therefore have pronounced effects on commercial mortgage origination and investment sales volumes. In 2022, global benchmark interest rates rose at the fastest pace since at least the early 1990s, according to Fitch. U.S. and U.K. ten-year government yields continued to rise through October of 2023, fell over the remainder of that year, but gradually rose over the first nine months of 2024. This led to challenging market conditions across commercial real estate capital markets for Newmark and the industry. Real estate capital market transactions were also lower due to the pullback in commercial and multifamily real estate lending activity as a response to recent bank failures and higher interest rates, as well as the gap between buyer and seller expectations. Most major central banks recently began lowering their short term rates. Partly as a result of this, industry capital markets volumes generally declined by less or grew year-over-year in the third quarter of 2024, as discussed below. 
 
 Economic Growth and Outlook in the United States and the United Kingdom 
 
 U.S. GDP expanded by 2.5 and 2.9 , in 2022 and 2023, respectively, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce (with all GDP figures herein inflation adjusted, unless otherwise stated). According to the same source, U.S. GDP expanded at an annualized rate of 1.6 , 3.0 , and 2.8 , respectively, in the first through third quarters of 2024. Economists generally expect U.S. GDP to grow in 2024 and 2025 at levels somewhat below pre-pandemic levels. For example, based on the October 25, 2024, Bloomberg consensus of economists, U.S. real GDP should expand at respective rates of 2.6 , 1.9 , and 2.0 in 2024, 2025, and 2026. For context, over the ten years ended December 31, 2019, real U.S. GDP grew at a CAGR of 2.4 , measured in chain linked 2017 dollars. Actual and projected growth has been and is expected be lower in the U.K., which is now our second largest market. According to the most recent data from The Office for National Statistics, U.K. GDP increased by 0.4 in 2023 and by 0.3 and 0.7 year-on-year in the first and second quarters of 2024, respectively. The October 15, 2024, Bloomberg consensus was for U.K. GDP to grow by 1.0 , 1.3 , and 1.5 in full years 2024, 2025, and 2026, respectively. In comparison, real U.K. GDP grew at an annual CAGR of 2.0 over the ten years ended December 31, 2019, measured in chain linked 2019 pounds, also per Bloomberg. 
 
 According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data from November 1, 2024, the seasonally adjusted monthly average of non-farm payroll employment increased by approximately 377,000 and approximately 251,000 in 2022 and 2023, respectively. Their estimate as of the same date was that an average of approximately 267,000, 147,000, and 148,000 jobs, respectively, were created per month in the first through third quarters of 2024. For context, this seasonally adjusted monthly figure averaged approximately 183,000 over the ten years ended December 31, 2019. The October 2024 U.S. unemployment rate (based on U-3) was 4.1 compared with 3.8 a year earlier, while the initial estimate for the number of jobs created in October was 12,000. The October figures were in line with the Bloomberg consensus of 4.1 and below the consensus of 100,000, respectively. The Bureau of Labor Statistics said two hurricanes that hit the Southeast U.S. likely affected hiring in some industries, but it was not possible to quantify the net effect on the change in employment, hours or earnings in October 2024. Their report also showed manufacturing jobs were negatively impacted by strike activity in October. The most recent Bloomberg consensus also showed U-3 remaining at or below 4.4 through the end of 2026. According to recent figures and/or the forward consensus from Bloomberg, the U.K. unemployment rate was 3.9 and 3.8 at the end of 2022 and 2023, respectively, rose to 4.0 in August 2024 (the most recent month available), and is expected to be at or below 4.5 through the end of 2026. 
 
 The ten-year U.S. Treasury yield decreased by approximately 62 basis points quarter on quarter and by 79 basis points year-on-year to 3.8 as of September 30, 2024, but increased by 60 basis points to 4.4 as of November 1, 2024. The recent rise was due largely to uncertainty with respect to the pace at which inflation will subside and at which the FOMC will lower short term rates. For context, on September 21, 2022 and November 2, 2022, the FOMC announced two separate increases to the upper bound of its target range for the federal funds rate of 75 basis points each, in order to curb inflation. The FOMC increased the upper bound by another 50 basis points in December of 2022, and then by 25 basis points each in February 2023, March 2023, May 2023, and July 2023. The FOMC kept the rate unchanged at 5.5 between July 2023 and September 2024. 
 63 

Citing progress on inflation, it lowered the upper bound to 5.0 on September 18, 2024. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell emphasized that inflation was much closer to its 2 target and the U.S. labor market is less tight than pre-pandemic in 2019. On November 7, 2024, the FOMC again lowered the upper bound of its target range to 4.75 , noting that inflation has made progress toward the committee s 2 objective but remains somewhat elevated. 
 
 In addition, the FOMC stated that it plans to continue reducing the 7.0 trillion portfolio of securities it holds (as of October 30, 2024), including long-term agency mortgage-backed securities and U.S. Treasuries. These securities were purchased as part of the Federal Reserve s quantitative easing program designed to hold down long-term interest rates, with the total amount of securities having increased from less than 900 billion in the second quarter of 2008 to a peak of approximately 8.9 trillion in the first quarter of 2022. The FOMC previously indicated that a monthly maximum of 60 billion in U.S. Treasury purchases and 35 billion in mortgage-backed securities purchases (or a total of up to 95 billion) would be allowed to roll off, phased in over three months starting June 1, 2022. As quantitative easing is reversed in this manner through so-called quantitative tightening, long-term rates should rise, all else equal. In its annual report issued April 17, 2024, the New York Federal Reserve Bank predicted that the central bank s holdings will fall to 6.0 trillion by the middle of 2025. It then expects holdings to again grow to in-line with the growth of the economy as reserves reach 8.0 of nominal U.S. GDP. After its May 1, 2024 meeting, the FOMC said that it will reduce the monthly redemption cap on Treasury securities from 60 billion to 25 billion. It will maintain the monthly redemption cap on agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities at 35 billion per month and will reinvest any principal payments in excess of this cap into Treasury securities. 
 
 Similar to what has happened in the U.S., the MPC has both raised short term U.K. rates to combat post-pandemic inflation and begun quantitative tightening. With respect to short term rates, the MPC raised the Official Bank Rate several times recently, or from 0.1 in November 2021 to 5.25 in August 2023. On August 1, 2024, the MPC delivered its first interest rate cut in more than four years, lowering the Official Bank Rate to 5.0 . On November 7, 2024, the MPC again lowered its target rate to 4.75 . However, it updated its forecasts after taking government budget measures into account, saying that it expected inflation would now peak at 2.75 by the middle of next year and then remain above the 2 target in 2026, until falling back in 2027. This is a year longer than it had expected in its previous forecasts, published in August. 
 
 With respect to quantitative tightening, the MPC stopped buying bonds at the end of 2021, stopped reinvesting the proceeds from maturing bonds in February 2022, and began actively selling bonds in November of 2022. As a result, the amount of bonds the Bank of England holds has started to fall. From the end of 2021 through October 30, 2024, their notional value has declined from approximately 895 billion to 655 billion. 
 
 U.S. inflation measures have gradually declined since 2022. The consumer-price index for 2024 rose by 2.4 year-over-year in September 2024, which was lower than the 3.0 year-over-year rate for June 2024 and 3.7 rate for September 2023, and a significant improvement versus the recent peak of 9.1 observed in June of 2022. Other U.S. inflation measures, such as Core CPI and the Core Personal Consumption Expenditure Price Index, which exclude more volatile food and energy prices, have also come down meaningfully since their 2022 peak. As a result, economists generally expect long-term U.S. interest rates to stabilize or decline slightly, and to remain below the long-term historical averages for the foreseeable future. For example, the most recent Bloomberg consensus was for the ten-year U.S. Treasury yield to be approximately 3.9 , 3.7 and 3.7 , respectively, as of year-ends 2024, 2025, and 2026. In comparison, this 10-year yield was approximately 4.4 as of November 1, 2024, and reached a five year closing high of 5.0 on October 19, 2023, also according to Bloomberg. For context, ten-year U.S. Treasury yields still remain below their 50-year average (through November 1, 2024) of 5.9 . 
 
 Inflation in the U.K. has also gradually fallen, albeit from much higher recent levels compared with the U.S. According to Bloomberg, the retail price index was 2.7 for September 2024 versus 2.9 and 8.9 three months and a year earlier, respectively. This inflation measure reached a post-pandemic high of 14.2 for October of 2023. According to the OECD, the U.K. has had a higher inflation rate compared with the G-7 average since 2016, and this trend is expected to continue through 2025. Conversely, the U.K. had lower than average GDP growth among G-7 nations in 2023 and the first half of 2024, according to Bloomberg. As a result, the Bank of England has had a more challenging time than certain other central banks with respect to balancing inflation and growth rates. U.K. benchmark long-term rates have therefore been somewhat below those of the U.S. According to Bloomberg, the yield on 10-year U.K. government bonds was approximately 4.4 as of November 1, 2024, compared with 4.0 and 4.4 , respectively, as of the end of the third quarters of 2024 and 2023. The most recent Bloomberg consensus was for this 10-year yield to be approximately 3.9 , 3.7 , and 3.7 , respectively as of year-ends of 2024, 2025 and 2026. For context, the monthly closing yield for ten-year Gilts has averaged approximately 6.8 over the 50 years ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 While shor t-term yields are expected to be higher compared with most of the period from the end of 2008 through early 2022, they are expected to stabilize and gradually fall from more recent levels. For context, the upper bound of the Fed Funds Target rate averaged 0.64 from December 31, 2008 through February 28, 2022, and averaged approximately 4.9 and 
 64 

3.1 over the 50 years and 25 years ended December 31, 2022, respectively, according to Bloomberg. The most recent Bloomberg consensus was for this target rate to be 4.5 , 3.3 , and 3.1 , respectively, by the ends of 2024, 2025, and 2026. The CME s Fed Funds futures market indicated that, as of November 1, 2024, traders expected broadly similar declines in this FOMC rate. 
 
 The most recent Bloomberg consensus was for the Bank of England s short-term target rate to be 4.7 , 3.6 , and 3.2 , respectively, by the ends of 2024, 2025, and 2026. As of November 1, 2024, the U.K. futures market implies that short term rates (as measured by overnight index swaps) will fall in a manner largely consistent with this consensus. For context, the Official Bank Rate averaged approximately 6.2 over the 50 years ended September 30, 2024, according to Bloomberg. 
 
 Market Statistics 
 
 While industrial and retail have increased as a percentage of leasing revenues since 2019, office remains the majority of activity for Newmark and the industry. Newmark Research estimates that third quarter 2024 U.S. office leasing activity was approximately 9 higher compared with a year earlier, an improvement versus having been up 5 and down 3 , respectively, in the second and first quarters of 2024. CoStar estimates that third quarter 2024 U.K. office leasing office take-up reached its highest level since the fourth quarter of 2021, but that office leasing activity is still running comfortably below historic norms. Based on data from Newmark Research and CoStar, the scarcity of available U.S. retail space cannot satisfy strong demand, which has dampened leasing activity for this property type but kept vacancies near all-time lows and rents near their historical highs. Newmark Research estimates that the U.S. industrial market is nearing peak vacancy amid steady net positive demand and falling deliveries, while vacancy has increased as a result of an increased supply, as a higher-than-normal pipeline of available space is being constructed. Against this backdrop, our revenues from Leasing and other commissions increased by 5.6 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 We expect demand for office space to be driven by the reset in values due to near-term debt maturities. We also continue to see increased need for office space in certain markets, led by ongoing return-to-work plans, as well as new demand driven by companies in technology including artificial intelligence as well as financial services. According to the Freespace Index, the proportion of those attending work in person rose to 81 of 2019 levels in the Americas in September of 2024 compared with 67 a year earlier. The Freespace Index also reports that attendance increased to 73 of 2019 levels from 65 over the same timeframe across locations they track in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, and to 77 from 69 in the Asia-Pacific region. Other measures with different methodologies also show in-person attendance increasing. For example, the Kastle Barometer, which measures daily occupancy in ten large U.S. cities versus pre-pandemic levels, increased to 52 as of October 11, 2024, versus 47 a year earlier. Placer.ai data comparing September 2024 versus a year earlier indicates that in-person attendance in the U.S. increased to 69 versus 64 . Our management services, leasing, origination, and capital markets professionals continue to actively collaborate with clients to repurpose underutilized spaces and assets, including with respect to conversion of obsolete office or retail properties. 
 
 According to estimates from Green Street, prices for U.S. commercial real estate were flat month-over-month in September 2024, declined by approximately 3 over the twelve months ended September 30, 2024, and were down 19 from their March 2022 peak. With respect to specific property types differing the most from the mean, mall prices were up 5 year-on-year, while strip retail and apartment prices increased by less. Self-storage, traditional industrial, and office prices decreased by more than average over the same period. Since notional volumes are based on both prices and transaction count, lower prices have contributed to tepid industry-wide capital markets volumes. MSCI s preliminary investment sales figures indicate that industry volumes across all property types were roughly flat in U.S. year-over-year in the third quarter of 2024 and were down by approximately 2 in Europe. MSCI volumes are generally revised upwards at later dates. However, even before any revisions, these recent figures are an improvement from the double-digit percentage declines reported over most of the prior eight quarters. In comparison, Newmark s third quarter 2024 investment sales revenues and volumes were up by 4.8 and down 9.7 , respectively. In the third quarter of 2023, Newmark served as the Co-Lead Advisor to Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust, Inc. on its sale of Simply Self Storage to Public Storage for 2.2 billion, and this amount was included in our volumes for that period. We have gained considerable market share over the past several years. For example, our U.S. investment sales volumes were approximately 8.7 of overall U.S. MSCI volumes over the twelve months ended September 30, 2024, versus 3.4 in 2015. 
 
 We have also gained market share in our commercial mortgage origination businesses. According to the MBA, overall U.S. commercial and multifamily originations increased by 59 in the third quarter of 2024 versus a year earlier. Industry-wide GSE placement activity declined by 5 over the same period, according to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. In comparison, we increased our mortgage brokerage and debt placement volumes by 76.8 and our GSE/FHA origination volumes by 27.5 . T he Company also improved its third quarter 2024 revenues from Commercial mortgage origination, net, by 45.2 year-on-year. Certain GSE multifamily statistics for the industry are based on when loans are sold and/or securitized, and typically lag those reported by the MBA or by Newmark and its competitors by 30 to 45 days. Based on their analysis of MBA data and 
 65 

preliminary MSCI lending data, we believe that we have meaningfully outperformed the industry in total debt over the last several years. According to data or estimates from MSCI, the MBA, and/or Newmark Research, our total debt volumes were approximately 6.2 of U.S. commercial and multifamily mortgage originations over the twelve months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 1.5 in 2015. 
 
 Over 90 of Newmark s 2023 investment sales volumes (which included the equity portion of the Signature transactions) were generated in the U.S., while approximately 93 were from the U.S. in first nine months of 2024. Most of Newmark s international volume was from the Company s U.K. operations. Essentially all of Newmark s total debt volumes were generated in the U.S. in both periods. Given our continued investments, we believe we can continue gaining market share over time in the U.S. and globally, and we anticipate non-U.S. transactions to make up a greater percentage of our revenues and volumes over time. 
 
 We expect the record amounts of commercial and multifamily mortgage maturities and interest rate stabilization to lead to continued improvement in industry debt volumes, followed by increased investment sales activity. We anticipate better office market leasing fundamentals as more companies mandate returns to the workplace, less new inventory is constructed, and the recapitalization of properties at lower values leads to a more attractive market. We also continue to expect solid fundamentals for industrial and retail properties. We believe that these factors, along with our leading presence in capital markets, will drive growth across nearly all of Newmark s service lines. 
 
 We also think that the current market conditions have created an opportunity for us to solidify what we believe is our position as the platform of choice for many of the real estate industry s top professionals. During the nine months of 2024, we hired one of the top multifamily GSE/FHA originators in the U.S., who will work closely with the preeminent U.S. affordable housing investment sales team that we added earlier in the year. We also hired some of the most prolific and experienced debt and structured finance professionals in the U.S. and U.K., as well as some of the most innovative and active U.S. leasing teams. Newmark also opened a flagship office in France, continental Europe s second largest transaction market, where we attracted some of the most talented leasing and capital markets professionals. In October of this year, our European expansion continued with the launch of our capital markets and leasing businesses in Germany. We believe that these additions further demonstrate the strength of our global brand, and that our substantial investments in data, analytics, and talent position Newmark to capitalize on ongoing macroeconomic trends. Furthermore, our revenue-generating headcount was relatively flat year-on-year as of the end of the third quarter of 2024. Therefore, productivity gains drove the large majority of our total revenue growth, as well as our increased fees across capital markets, leasing, and V A. As more of our recently hired revenue-generating professionals ramp up, we expect further productivity gains over time. 

Financial Overview 
 
 Revenues 
 
 We generally derive revenues from the following three sources: 
 
 Management Services, Servicing Fees and Other . We provide commercial services to tenants and landlords. In this business, we provide property and facilities management services along with project management, V A services, and other consulting services, as well as technology services, to customers who may also utilize our commercial real estate brokerage services, and flexible workspace solutions. Servicing fees are derived from the servicing of loans originated by us as well as loans originated by third parties. 
 Leasing and Other Commissions . We offer a diverse range of commercial real estate brokerage and advisory services, including tenant and landlord (or agency) representation, which includes comprehensive lease negotiations, strategic planning, site selection, lease auditing, and other financial and market analysis. 
 Capital Markets. This consists of investment sales and commercial mortgage origination, net. Our investment sales business specializes in the arrangement of acquisitions and dispositions of commercial properties, as well as equity placement and other related services. Our commercial mortgage origination, net business offers services and products to facilitate debt financing for our clients and customers. Commercial mortgage origination revenue is comprised of commissions generated from mortgage brokerage and debt placement services, as well as the origination fees and premiums derived from the origination of GSE/FHA loans with borrowers. Our commercial mortgage origination revenue also includes the revenue recognized for the fair value of expected net future cash flows from servicing recognized at commitment. 
 
 Fees are generally earned when a lease is signed. In many cases, landlords are responsible for paying the fees. In capital markets, fees are earned and recognized when the sale of a property closes, and title passes from seller to buyer for investment sales and when debt or equity is funded to a vehicle for debt and equity transactions. Loan originations related fees and sales premiums, net, are recognized when a derivative asset is recorded upon the commitment to originate a loan with a 
 66 

borrower and sell the loan to an investor. The derivative is recorded at fair value and includes loan origination fees, sales premiums and the estimated fair value of the expected net servicing cash flows. Loan originations related fees and sales premiums, net, are recognized net of related fees and commissions to affiliates or third-party brokers. For loans we broker, revenues are recognized when the loan is closed. 
 
 Servicing fees are recognized on an accrual basis over the lives of the related mortgage loans. We typically receive monthly management fees based upon a percentage of monthly rental income generated from the property under management, or in some cases, the greater of such percentage or a minimum agreed upon fee. We are often reimbursed for our administrative and payroll costs, as well as certain out-of-pocket expenses, directly attributable to properties under management. We follow U.S. GAAP, which provides guidance when accounting for reimbursements from clients and when accounting for certain contingent events for leasing and capital markets transactions. See Note 3 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a more detailed discussion. 
 
 Expenses 
 
 (i) Compensation and Employee Benefits 
 The majority of our operating costs consist of cash and non-cash compensation expenses, which include base salaries, producer commissions based on production, forgivable loans for term contracts, discretionary and other bonuses and all related employee benefits and taxes. Our employees consist of commissioned producers, executives and other administrative support. Our producers are largely compensated based on the revenue they generate for the firm, keeping these costs variable in nature. 
 
 As part of our compensation plans, certain employees have been granted limited partnership units in Newmark Holdings and, prior to the Newmark IPO, BGC Holdings, which generally receive quarterly allocations of net income and are generally contingent upon services being provided by the unit holders. As a result of the Corporate Conversion, there are no longer any limited partnership units in BGC Holdings outstanding. Certain Newmark employees also hold N Units that do not participate in quarterly partnership distributions and are not allocated any items of profit or loss. These N Units vest into distribution earnings units over a three- to ten-year period. As prescribed in U.S. GAAP guidance, the quarterly allocations of net income on such limited partnership units are reflected as a component of compensation expense under Equity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs in our accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
 
 Newmark has granted certain conversion rights on limited partnership units in Newmark Holdings and, prior to the Corporate Conversion, then-outstanding limited partnership units in BGC Holdings, to Newmark employees to convert the limited partnership units to a capital balance within Newmark Holdings or BGC Holdings. Generally, such units are not considered share-equivalent limited partnership units and are not in the fully diluted share count. 
 
 Certain of these limited partnership units entitle the holders to receive post-termination payments. These limited partnership units are accounted for as post-termination liability awards under U.S. GAAP guidance, which requires that we record an expense for such awards based on the change in value at each reporting period and include the expense in our accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations as part of Equity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs. The liability for limited partnership units with a post-termination payout amount is included in Other long-term liabilities on our accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
 
 Certain limited partnership units are granted exchangeability into Class A common stock or may be redeemed in connection with the grant of shares of Class A common stock. At the time exchangeability is granted, or the shares are issued, Newmark recognizes an expense based on the fair value of the award on that date, which is included in Equity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs in our accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
 
 Certain of our employees have been awarded Preferred Units in Newmark Holdings and, prior to the Corporate Conversion, BGC Holdings. Each quarter, the net profits of Newmark Holdings and BGC Holdings are or were allocated to such units at a rate of either 0.6875 (which is 2.75 per calendar year) or such other amount as set forth in the award documentation, which is deducted before the calculation and distribution of the quarterly partnership distribution for the remaining partnership units in Newmark Holdings. The Preferred Units are not entitled to participate in partnership distributions other than with respect to the Preferred Distribution. Preferred Units may not be made exchangeable into our Class A common stock and are only entitled to the Preferred Distribution, and accordingly they are not included in our fully diluted share count. The quarterly allocations of net income on Preferred Units are also reflected in compensation expense under Equity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs in our accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. After deduction of the Preferred Distribution, the remaining 
 67 

partnership units generally receive quarterly allocation of net income based on their weighted-average pro rata share of economic ownership of the operating subsidiaries. In addition, Preferred Units are granted in connection with the grant of certain limited partnership units, such as PSUs, that may be granted exchangeability to cover the withholding taxes owed by the unit holder upon such exchange. This is an acceptable alternative to the common practice among public companies of issuing the gross number of shares to employees, subject to cashless withholding of shares to pay applicable withholding taxes. 
 
 We have also entered into various agreements with certain of our employees and partners whereby these individuals receive loans, which may be either wholly or in part repaid from the distribution earnings that the individual receives on their limited partnership interests or from the proceeds of the sales of the employees shares of our Class A common stock. The forgivable portion of these loans is recognized as compensation expense over the service period. 
 
 From time to time, we may also enter into agreements with employees and partners to grant bonus and salary advances or other types of loans. These advances and loans are repayable in the timeframes outlined in the underlying agreements. In addition, we also enter into deferred compensation agreements with employees providing services to us. The costs associated with such plans are generally amortized over the period in which they vest. (See Note 27 Compensation and Note 28 Commitments and Contingencies to our accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q). 
 
 (ii) Other Operating Expenses 
 We have various other operating expenses. We incur leasing, equipment and maintenance expenses. We also incur selling and promotion expenses, which include entertainment, marketing and travel-related expenses. We incur communication expenses, professional and consulting fees for legal, audit and other special projects, and interest expense related to short-term operational funding needs, and notes payable and collateralized borrowings. 
 
 We pay fees to Cantor for performing certain administrative and other support, including charges for occupancy of office space, utilization of fixed assets and accounting, operations, human resources, legal services and technology infrastructure support. Management believes that these charges are a reasonable reflection of the utilization of services rendered. However, the expenses for these services are not necessarily indicative of the expenses that would have been incurred if we had not obtained these services from Cantor. In addition, these charges may not reflect the costs of services we may receive from Cantor in the future. 
 
 (iii) Other Income (loss), Net 
 Other income (loss), net is comprised of gains (losses) on equity method investments which represent our pro rata share of the net gains (losses) on investments over which we have significant influence but which we do not control, and the mark-to-market gains or losses on marketable and non-marketable investments. 
 
 (iv) Provision for Income Taxes 
 We incur income tax expenses based on the location, legal structure, and jurisdictional taxing authorities of each of our subsidiaries. Certain of the Company s entities are taxed as U.S. partnerships and are subject to the UBT in New York City. U.S. federal and state income tax liability or benefit related to the partnership income or loss, with the exception of the UBT, rests with the partners (see Note 2 Limited Partnership Interests in Newmark Holdings and BGC Holdings to our accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q) rather than the partnership entity. Our accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include U.S. federal, state and local income taxes on Newmark s allocable share of the U.S. results of operations. Outside of the U.S., we operate principally through subsidiary corporations subject to local income taxes. 
 
 Newmark is subject to the tax laws and regulations of the U.S. and various non-U.S. jurisdictions. The OECD Pillar Two Framework provides for a minimum global effective tax rate of 15 . The EU Member States formally adopted the EU s Pillar Two Directive with a subset of rules that became effective January 1, 2024. Other countries are also expected to implement similar legislation. We do not believe this will have a material impact on our tax rate. 
 
 Business Mix and Seasonality 
 
 Our pre-tax margins are affected by the mix of revenues generated. For example, servicing revenues tend to have higher pre-tax margins than Newmark as a whole, and margins from originating GSE/FHA loans, which are included in Capital markets in our unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations, tend to be lower, as we retain rights to service loans over time, and because this item includes non-cash GAAP gains attributable to OMSRs, which represent the fair value of expected net future cash flows from servicing recognized at commitment, net. Capital markets transactions tend to have higher pre-tax margins than leasing transactions. Pre-tax earnings margins on our property management and parts of our other GCS businesses are at the lower end of margins for the Company as a whole because they include some revenues that 
 68 

equal their related expenses. These revenues represent fully reimbursable compensation and non-compensation costs and may be referred to as pass through revenues. 
 
 Due to the strong desire of many market participants to close real estate transactions prior to the end of a calendar year, our business exhibits certain seasonality, with our revenue tending to be lowest in the first quarter and strongest in the fourth quarter. For the five years from 2019 through 2023, we generated an average of approximately 22 of our revenues in the first quarter and 29 of our revenues in the fourth quarter. Because approximately 30 of our expenses are fixed in a typical year, this seasonality generally leads to higher profitability in the fourth quarter and lower margins in the first quarter, all else equal. 
 
 Independent Business Partners 
 
 In certain smaller U.S. and international markets where we do not maintain Newmark-owned offices, we have agreements in place to operate on a collaborative and cross-referral basis with select independently owned offices in return for contractual and referral fees paid to us and/or certain mutually beneficial co-branding and other business arrangements. These independent offices are referred to as business partners. These business partners may use some variation of our branding in their names and marketing materials. These agreements typically take the form of multi-year contracts, and provide for mutual referrals in their respective markets, generating additional contract and brokerage fees. While we do not derive a significant portion of our revenue from these relationships, they do enable us to seamlessly provide service to our mutual clients. These business partners give our clients access to local brokerage professionals, research, and commercial real estate services in locations where the Company does not have a physical presence. The discussion of our financial results and other metrics reflects only the business owned by us and does not include the results for business partners.

 Capital markets increased by 65.5 million, or 15.7 , to 481.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase reflects a 28.0 increase in commercial mortgage origination, net and a 7.2 improvement in investment sales fees.

Financial Position, Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Overview 
 The primary sources of liquidity for our business are the cash on our balance sheet, cash flow provided by operations, and the 600.0 million revolving Credit Facility. 
 
 Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our growth, the expansion of our sales and marketing activities, our expansion into other markets, our acquisitions of other companies and hiring of teams of producers, and our results of operations. To the extent that existing cash, cash from operations and credit facilities are insufficient to fund our future activities, we may need to raise additional funds through public equity or debt financing. As of September 30, 2024, our debt consisted of 600.0 million aggregate principal amount of 7.500 Senior Notes with a carrying amount of 595.2 million and 175.0 million outstanding under the Credit Facility with a carrying amount of 175.0 million, in each case exclusive of our warehouse facilities described under Warehouse Facilities Collateralized by U.S. Government Sponsored Enterprises. 

Financial Position

Total assets were 5.0 billion at September 30, 2024 and 4.5 billion at December 31, 2023. 
 
 Total liabilities were 3.5 billion at September 30, 2024 and 2.9 billion at December 31, 2023. 
 
 Liquidity 
 At September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 178.6 million. Additionally, we had 425.0 million available under our committed senior unsecured revolving Credit Facility.

 Delayed Draw Term Loan Credit Agreement 
 On August 10, 2023, Newmark entered into a Delayed Draw Term Loan Credit Agreement, by and among the Company, the several financial institutions from time to time party thereto, as Lenders, and Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent (as such terms are defined in the Delayed Draw Term Loan Credit Agreement), pursuant to which the Lenders committed to provide to the Company a senior unsecured Delayed Draw Term Loan in an aggregate principal amount of 420.0 million, which could be increased, subject to certain terms and conditions, to up to 550.0 million. The proceeds of the Delayed Draw Term Loan could only be used to repay the 6.125 Senior Notes at their maturity. The Delayed Draw Term Loan had a maturity date of November 14, 2026. 
 
 As set forth in the Delayed Draw Term Loan Credit Agreement, the Delayed Draw Term Loan could bear interest at a per annum rate equal to, at the Company s option, either (a) Term SOFR for interest periods of one or three months (as selected by the Company) or upon the consent of all Lenders, such other period that is 12 months or less (in each case, subject to availability), as selected by the Company, plus an applicable margin or (b) a base rate equal to the greatest of (i) the federal funds rate plus 0.50 , (ii) the prime rate as established by the Administrative Agent, and (iii) Term SOFR plus 1.00 , in each case plus an applicable margin. Upon funding, the applicable margin was 2.625 with respect to Term SOFR borrowings in (a) above and 1.625 with respect to base rate borrowings in (b) above. Depending on the Company s credit ratings, the applicable margin could range, with respect to Term SOFR borrowings, from 2.125 to 3.375 through and including August 10, 2024, and 2.5 to 3.875 thereafter; and base rate borrowings, from 1.125 to 2.375 through and including August 10, 2024, and 1.5 to 2.875 thereafter. 
 
 The Delayed Draw Term Loan Credit Agreement contained financial covenants with respect to minimum interest coverage and maximum leverage ratio. The Delayed Draw Term Loan Credit Agreement also contained certain other customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default. The covenants in the Delayed Draw Term Loan Credit Agreement were consistent with those within the Company s existing 600.0 million Credit Facility, which matures on April 26, 2027 and remains available to the Company. 
 
 On November 8, 2023, Newmark provided notice to Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent, to borrow the 420.0 million available under the Delayed Draw Term Loan Credit Agreement with the funds made available on November 14, 2023.

On January 12, 2024, the outstanding balance under the Delayed Draw Term Loan was repaid with the proceeds of the offering of the 7.500 Senior Notes.

The interest rate on the Credit Facility was LIBOR plus 1.75 per annum, subject to a pricing grid linked to Newmark s credit ratings from S P Global Ratings and Fitch. 
 
 On March 10, 2022, Newmark amended and restated the Credit Agreement, as amended. Pursuant to the amended and restated Credit Agreement, the lenders agreed to: (a) increase the amount available to the Company under the Credit Facility to 600.0 million, (b) extend the maturity date of the Credit Facility to March 10, 2025, and (c) improve pricing to 1.50 per annum with respect to Term SOFR (as defined in the amended and restated Credit Agreement) borrowings. 
 
 Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at a per annum rate equal to, at the Company s option, either (a) Term SOFR for interest periods of one or three months, as selected by the Company, or upon the consent of all lenders, such other period that is 12 months or less (in each case, subject to availability), as selected by the Company, plus an applicable margin, or (b) a base rate equal to the greatest of (i) the federal funds rate plus 0.50 , (ii) the prime rate as established by the Administrative Agent (as such term is defined in the amended and restated Credit Agreement), and (iii) Term SOFR plus 1.00 , in each case plus an applicable margin.

The applicable margin with respect to Term SOFR borrowings in (a) above could range from 1.00 to 2.125 depending upon the Company s credit rating, and with respect to base rate borrowings in (b) above could range from 0.00 to 1.125 depending upon the Company s credit rating. The Credit Agreement also provides for certain upfront and arrangement fees and for an unused facility fee. 
 
 On November 8, 2023, Newmark provided notice to Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent, to borrow 130.0 million under the Credit Facility with the funds made available on November 14, 2023. The Company used the proceeds of the Credit Facility draw to pay the remaining maturing principal and interest of the Company s 550.0 million 6.125 Senior Notes due November 15, 2023 that was not paid for with the proceeds of the Delayed Draw Term Loan.

 On April 26, 2024, Newmark amended and restated the Credit Agreement, which amendment and restatement, among other things, extends the maturity date of the Credit Facility to April 26, 2027. The borrowing rates and financial covenants under the Credit Agreement are substantially consistent with the Credit Agreement prior to such amendment and restatement. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , there were 235.0 million of borrowings and 60.0 million of repayments under the Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2024, there were 175.0 million of borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2024, borrowings under the Credit Facility carried an interest rate of 6.81 , with a weighted-average interest rate of 6.91 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As of December 31, 2023, there were no borrowings under the Credit Facility. 
 
 7.500 Senior Notes 
 On January 12, 2024, Newmark closed its offering of 600.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 7.500 Senior Notes. The notes are general senior unsecured obligations of Newmark. Cantor purchased 125.0 million aggregate principal amount of 7.500 Senior Notes in the offering, and still holds such notes as of November 8, 2024. The Company received net proceeds from the offering of the 7.500 Senior Notes of approximately 594.7 million after deducting the initial purchasers discounts and estimated offering expenses. The notes bear interest at a rate of 7.500 per year, payable in cash on January 12 and July 12 of each year, commencing July 12, 2024. The 7.500 Senior Notes will mature on January 12, 2029. The Company used the net proceeds of the offering of the 7.500 Senior Notes to repay all of the 420.0 million outstanding under its Delayed Draw Term Loan Credit Agreement. Additional net proceeds were used to repay all 130.0 million of then outstanding revolving debt, including with respect to borrowings under the Cantor Credit Agreement. 
 
 The 7.500 Senior Notes were initially offered and sold in a private offering exempt from the registration requirements under the Securities Act. Customary registration rights were provided to purchasers of the 7.500 Senior Notes. On May 10, 2024, we filed a Registration Statement on Form S-4, which was declared effective by the SEC on June 6, 2024. On June 10, 2024, we launched an exchange offer in which holders of the 7.500 Senior Notes which were issued in the January 12, 2024 private placement could exchange such notes for new registered notes with substantially identical terms. The exchange offer expired on July 17, 2024, at which point the tendered 7.500 Senior Notes were exchanged for new registered notes with substantially identical terms.

See Certain Related Party Transactions 7.500 Senior Notes below for further discussion. 
 
 Cantor Credit Agreement 
 On November 30, 2018, Newmark entered into an unsecured credit agreement with Cantor. The Cantor Credit Agreement provides for each party to issue loans to the other party in the lender s discretion. Pursuant to the Cantor Credit Agreement, the parties and their respective subsidiaries (with respect to Cantor, other than BGC and its subsidiaries) may borrow up to an aggregate principal amount of 250.0 million from each other from time to time at an interest rate which is the higher of Cantor or Newmark s short-term borrowing rate then in effect, plus 1.0 . 
 
 On December 20, 2023, Newmark entered into a first amendment to the Cantor Credit Agreement. Pursuant to the First Cantor Credit Agreement Amendment, Cantor agreed to make certain loans to Newmark from time to time in an aggregate outstanding principal amount of up to 150.0 million under the Cantor Credit Agreement. The Newmark Revolving Loans have substantially the same terms as other loans under the Cantor Credit Agreement, except that until April 15, 2024, the Newmark Revolving Loans would bear interest at a rate equal to 25 basis points less than the interest rate borne by the revolving loans made pursuant to the Credit Facility. Unlike other loans made under the Cantor Credit Agreement, Cantor may demand repayment of the Newmark Revolving Loans prior to the final maturity date of the Cantor Credit Agreement upon three business days prior written notice. Also on December 20, 2023, Newmark drew 130.0 million of Newmark Revolving Loans, and used the proceeds to repay the 130.0 million balance then outstanding under the Credit Facility.

As of September 30, 2024, there were no borrowings outstanding under the Cantor Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2023, there was 130.0 million outstanding under the Cantor Credit Agreement. 
 
 Warehouse Facilities Collateralized by U.S. Government Sponsored Enterprises 
 As of September 30, 2024, Newmark had 1.5 billion of committed loan funding, 1.1 billion of uncommitted loan funding available through three commercial banks, and an uncommitted 400.0 million Fannie Mae loan repurchase facility. Consistent with industry practice, these warehouse facilities are short-term, requiring annual renewal. These warehouse facilities are collateralized by an assignment of the underlying mortgage loans originated under various lending programs and third-party purchase commitments and are recourse only to our wholly owned subsidiary, Berkeley Point Capital, LLC. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 we had 1.0 billion and 0.5 billion, respectively, outstanding under Warehouse facilities collateralized by U.S. Government Sponsored Enterprises on our accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
 
 On June 19, 2020, Newmark established a 125.0 million sublimit line of credit to fund potential principal and interest servicing advances on its Fannie Mae portfolio during the forbearance period related to the CARES Act. The sublimit was included within the Company s then-existing 450 million warehouse facility. The advance line provided 100 of the principal and interest advance payment at a rate of SOFR plus 1.80 and was collateralized by Fannie Mae s commitment to repay advances. There were no outstanding draws under this sublimit as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. Newmark did not have any Fannie Mae loans in forbearance as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023. On May 7, 2024, the related warehouse line was renewed, removing the 125.0 million sublimit line of credit. 
 
 Leases

Additionally, the Company is authorized to make any such repurchases of Company debt securities through CF Co (or its affiliates), in its capacity as agent or principal, or such other broker-dealers as management shall determine to utilize from time to time upon customary market terms or commissions.

 76 

Rating Outlook Fitch Ratings Inc. BBB- Stable JCRA BBB+ Stable Kroll Bond Rating Agency BBB- Stable S P Global Ratings BB+ Stable 

Credit ratings and associated outlooks are influenced by several factors including, but not limited to: operating environment, earnings and profitability trends, the prudence of funding and liquidity management practices, balance sheet size composition and resulting leverage, cash flow coverage of interest, composition and size of the capital base, available liquidity, outstanding borrowing levels and the firm s competitive position in the industry. A credit rating and/or the associated outlook can be revised upward or downward at any time by a rating agency if such rating agency decides that circumstances warrant such a change. Any reduction in our credit ratings and/or the associated outlook could adversely affect the availability of debt financing on terms acceptable to us, as well as the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain any such financing. In addition, credit ratings and associated outlooks may be important to customers or counterparties when we compete in certain markets and when we seek to engage in certain transactions. The interest rate on our 7.500 Senior Notes may increase by up to 2 in the event of credit ratings downgrades. 

Certain Related Party Transactions 
 Transactions with Executive Officers and Directors 
 Howard W. Lutnick, Executive Chairman 
 On October 23, 2024, pursuant to the Standing Policy for Mr. Lutnick, and in connection with the grant of exchangeability made to Mr. Rispoli pursuant to the terms of Mr. Rispoli s employment agreement, the Company granted exchange rights and/or monetization rights with respect to rights available to Mr. Lutnick, and Mr. Lutnick (i) elected to accept 712,347 exchange rights with respect to 712,347 previously awarded PSUs that were previously non-exchangeable; and (ii) received the right to monetize, and accepted such monetization right regarding, 81,274 previously awarded non-exchangeable PPSUs for a future cash payment of 1,250,000. As of November 8, 2024, Mr. Lutnick s balance under the Standing Policy was zero. 
 
 On January 2, 2024, pursuant to the Standing Policy for Mr. Lutnick, and in connection with grants of exchangeability made to Mr. Gosin pursuant to the terms of the employment agreement that Mr. Gosin executed on February 10, 2023, the Company granted exchange rights and/or monetization rights with respect to rights available to Mr. Lutnick, and Mr. Lutnick (i) elected to accept 617,262 exchange rights with respect to 617,262 previously awarded PSUs that were previously non-exchangeable; and (ii) received the right to monetize, and accepted such monetization right of 81,275 previously awarded nonexchangeable PPSUs for a future cash payment of 1,250,000. Mr. Lutnick waived all remaining rights, which shall be cumulative. The aggregate number of Mr. Lutnick s units for which he waived exchange rights or other monetization rights was 617,262 non-exchangeable Newmark Holdings PSUs/NPSUs and 81,274 non-exchangeable Newmark Holdings PPSUs with an aggregate determination amount of 1,250,000 at that time. 
 
 In connection with the Corporate Conversion, on May 18, 2023, Mr. Lutnick s 1,474,930 BGC Holdings HDUs were redeemed for a cash capital account payment of 9.1 million, 7.0 million of which was paid by Newmark, with the remainder paid by BGC. 
 
 On December 27, 2021, the Compensation Committee approved a one-time bonus award to Mr. Lutnick, which was evidenced by the execution and delivery of a Retention Bonus Agreement, dated December 28, 2021, and described below, in consideration of his success in managing certain aspects of the Company s performance as its principal executive officer and Chairman. The bonus award rewarded Mr. Lutnick for his efforts in delivering superior financial results for the Company and its stockholders, including in particular his success in creating substantial value for the Company and its stockholders in connection with creating, structuring, hedging and monetizing the forward share contract to receive over time shares of common stock of Nasdaq held by the Company and the strong balance sheet and significant amount of income created from this. A principal reason for structuring the bonus award with a substantial portion to be paid out over three years was also to further incentivize Mr. Lutnick to continue to serve as both the Company s principal executive officer and its Chairman for the benefit of the Company s stockholders. The bonus award is the subject of legal challenge. See the heading Legal Proceedings below. 
 
 The Retention Bonus Agreement provides for an aggregate cash payment of 50 million, payable as follows: 20 million within three days of the date of the Retention Bonus Agreement (which payment was made on December 31, 2021), and 10 million within thirty days following vesting on each of the first, second and third anniversaries of the date of the Retention Bonus Agreement. Any entitlement to future amounts not vested will be forfeited immediately if, prior to the applicable anniversary date, Mr. Lutnick ceases to serve as both the Company s Chairman and its principal executive officer, unless Mr. Lutnick ceasing to serve in either such capacity occurs pursuant to a Vesting Termination, as that term is defined in the 
 77 

Retention Bonus Agreement. Mr. Lutnick has purchased Newmark Class A common stock with the after-tax proceeds of the initial tranche of the bonus award. The Retention Bonus Agreement describes a Vesting Termination as (i) a termination of Mr. Lutnick s employment by the Company without Cause (as that term is defined in the Retention Bonus Agreement) or (ii) an involuntary removal of Mr. Lutnick from the position of Chairman of the Board on or after the occurrence of a Change in Control (as that term is defined in the Change of Control Agreement, dated as of December 13, 2017, by and between Mr. Lutnick and the Company). In the event that Mr. Lutnick ceases to serve as both the Company s Chairman and its principal executive officer pursuant to a Vesting Termination, any amounts not vested will immediately become fully vested. The Retention Bonus Agreement provides that Mr. Lutnick ceasing to serve as the Company s Chairman and principal executive officer pursuant to his death or disability does not constitute a Vesting Termination. The provisions of Mr. Lutnick s Change of Control Agreement do not apply to the bonus award. A copy of the Retention Bonus Agreement was attached as Exhibit 10.1 to the Company s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on December 30, 2021 and is described in detail under the heading 2021 Lutnick Award in our definitive proxy statement for our 2024 annual meeting of stockholders, filed with the SEC on September 6, 2024.

The terms of those awards provided that on or about each April 1 of 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023, Newmark Holdings shall grant an aggregate award of 125,000 non-exchangeable Newmark Holdings PSUs and 125,000 non-exchangeable PPSUs in replacement of 125,000 Newmark Holdings NPSUs and 125,000 Newmark Holdings NPPSUs (which, upon replacement, shall be cancelled and no longer exist), provided that (i) Newmark, inclusive of its affiliates thereof, earns, in aggregate, at least 5 million in gross revenues in the calendar quarter in which the applicable award of Newmark Holdings PSUs or PPSUs is to be granted and (ii) except in the event of death prior to the applicable grant date, Mr. Lutnick remains an employee of Newmark or an affiliate thereof and has at all times remained in compliance with the Newmark Holdings partnership agreement. Mr. Lutnick exercised his rights on December 21, 2021, pursuant to the Standing Policy for Mr. Lutnick to redeem his remaining 250,000 Newmark Holdings NPPSUs issued effective April 1, 2019. Pursuant to this grant, on April 1, 2023, the Company granted Mr. Lutnick an aggregate award of 125,000 non-exchangeable PSUs in replacement of the remaining 125,000 NPSUs.

The transaction was approved by the Compensation Committee, was exempt under Rule 16b-3 of the Exchange Act, and was made pursuant to the Company s unit purchase authorization. 
 
 On August 7, 2024, Mr. Gosin entered into the 2024 Gosin Employment Agreement with Newmark OpCo and Newmark Holdings, which superseded and replaced the 2023 Gosin Employment Agreement.

In connection with the execution of the 2024 Gosin Employment Agreement and as consideration for his continued service, in addition to the awards previously provided for by the 2023 Gosin Employment Agreement, the Compensation Committee approved the grant to Mr. Gosin of (i) a one-time cash payment of 5,000,000; (ii) an award of 1,694,915 NPSUs, calculated by dividing the total NPSU award by the closing stock price on August 7, 2024, of which 5,000,000 of NPSUs are attributable to calendar year 2025 and 15,000,000 of NPSUs are attributable to calendar year 2026; and (iii) a cash bonus in the gross amount of 1,500,000 with respect to calendar year 2026, payable in calendar year 2027 at such time as bonuses with respect to calendar year 2026 are generally distributed to other similarly situated employees of Newmark OpCo in connection with the year-end compensation review process. Mr. Gosin s annual total contractual compensation would be 17,500,000 for each of calendar years 2024, 2025, and 2026 (comprised of 1,000,000 salary and 16,500,000 in combined NPSUs and cash awards attributed by the Company) and consistent with his total compensation for calendar year 2023 pursuant to the 2023 Gosin Employment Agreement. 
 
 Subject to the terms of the 2024 Gosin Employment Agreement and the grant documents under which the grant of NPSUs to Mr. Gosin was awarded, 25 of such NPSUs shall convert into non-exchangeable PSUs on December 31, 2025, and 75 of such NPSUs shall convert into non-exchangeable PSUs on December 31, 2026, in each case as adjusted by the then current exchange ratio, subject to the requirement that, as of each applicable conversion date (i) the Company (including its affiliates) earns, in the aggregate, at least 10,000,000 in gross revenues in the calendar quarter in which the applicable conversion is to occur, and (ii) except as otherwise provided in the 2024 Gosin Employment Agreement, Mr. Gosin continues to perform substantial services exclusively for Newmark OpCo or any of its affiliates, remains a partner in Newmark Holdings, and complies with the terms of the 2024 Gosin Employment Agreement and any of his obligations to Newmark Holdings, Newmark OpCo or any affiliate. 25 of each of the 2025 and 2026 tranches in non-exchangeable PSUs received upon conversion of the 2024 NPSU grant will receive exchange rights on December 31 of each year after such conversion, consistent with the schedule for the grant of exchange rights provided for the NPSUs Mr. Gosin received in connection with the 2023 
 78 

Gosin Employment Agreement, which remains unchanged other than that 1,145,476 of Mr. Gosin s NPSUs previously awarded under the 2023 Gosin Employment Agreement were adjusted by the exchange ratio and converted into 1,238,620 non-exchangeable PSUs in connection with the signing of the 2024 Gosin Employment Agreement, rather than on their previously scheduled conversion date of December 31, 2024. 25 of such PSUs will continue to receive exchange rights on December 31 of each year starting December 31, 2026, as previously contemplated in the 2023 Gosin Employment Agreement. 
 
 A copy of the 2024 Gosin Employment Agreement was attached as Exhibit 99.1 to the Company s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on August 12, 2024 and is described in detail therein. 
 
 On December 31, 2023, 1,145,494 of Mr. Gosin s Newmark Holdings NPSUs were converted into 1,240,901 Newmark Holdings PSUs as adjusted by the then applicable exchange ratio of 0.9231 pursuant to the 2023 Gosin Employment Agreement. 
 
 Pursuant to the 2023 Gosin Employment Agreement, on April 1, 2023, 1,145,494 of Mr. Gosin s Newmark Holdings NPSUs were converted into 1,237,644 Newmark Holdings PSUs as adjusted by the then applicable exchange ratio of 0.9252. On December 31, 2023, Mr. Gosin received exchange rights on 1/7th of the 1,237,644 Newmark Holdings PSUs converted on April 1, 2023, resulting in 176,804 exchangeable Newmark Holdings PSUs. 
 
 Pursuant to the 2023 Gosin Employment Agreement, on March 30, 2023, (a) 203,186 of Mr. Gosin s non-exchangeable Newmark Holdings PSUs were redeemed and an aggregate of 189,024 shares of Class A common stock of Newmark were issued, as adjusted by the then applicable exchange ratio of 0.9303, and (b) 3,125,001 associated with Mr. Gosin s non-exchangeable Newmark Holdings PPSUs was redeemed and used for tax purposes.

 Contemporaneously with the acquisition of Berkeley Point, on September 8, 2017, Newmark invested 100.0 million in a newly formed commercial real estate-related financial and investment business, Real Estate LP, which is controlled and managed by Cantor.

This loan is secured by the single-purpose company s interest in property in Pennsylvania that is subject to a ground lease. While CCRE Lending initially provided the full loan amount, on August 16, 2019, a third-party bank purchased approximately 80 of the loan value from CCRE Lending, with CCRE Lending retaining approximately 20 . This loan matures on August 6, 2029, and is payable monthly at a fixed interest rate of 4.38 per annum. 
 
 Transactions Related to Ordinary Course Real Estate Services 
 
 On November 4, 2020, the Audit Committee authorized entities in which executive officers have a non-controlling interest to engage Newmark to provide ordinary course real estate services to them as long as Newmark s fees are consistent with the fees that Newmark ordinarily charges for these services. 
 
 Cantor Rights to Purchase Cantor Units from Newmark Holdings 
 
 Cantor has a right to purchase from Newmark Holdings exchangeable limited partnership interests in the event that any Newmark Holdings Founding Partner interests that have not become exchangeable are redeemed by Newmark Holdings upon termination or bankruptcy of a Founding Partner or upon mutual consent of the general partner of Newmark Holdings and Cantor. Cantor has the right to purchase such Newmark Holdings exchangeable limited partnership interests at a price equal to the lesser of (1) the amount that Newmark Holdings would be required to pay to redeem and purchase such Newmark Holdings Founding Partner interests and (2) the amount equal to (a) the number of units underlying such Founding Partner interests, multiplied by (b) the Exchange Ratio as of the date of such purchase, multiplied by (c) the then-current market price of our Class A common stock. Cantor may pay such price using cash, publicly traded shares or other property, or a combination of the foregoing. If Cantor (or the other member of the Cantor group acquiring such limited partnership interests, as the case may be) so purchases such limited partnership interests at a price equal to clause (2) above, neither Cantor nor any member of the Cantor group nor Newmark Holdings nor any other person is obligated to pay Newmark Holdings or the holder of such Founding Partner interests any amount in excess of the amount set forth in clause (2) above. 
 
 In addition, the Newmark Holdings limited partnership agreement provides that (1) where either current, terminating or terminated partners are permitted by us to exchange any portion of their Founding Partner units and Cantor consents to such exchangeability, we will offer to Cantor the opportunity for Cantor to purchase the same number of new exchangeable limited partnership interests in Newmark Holdings at the price that Cantor would have paid for exchangeable limited partnership interests in the event we had redeemed the Founding Partner units; and (2) the exchangeable limited partnership interests to be offered to Cantor pursuant to clause (1) above would be subject to, and granted in accordance with, applicable laws, rules and regulations then in effect. 
 
 If Cantor acquires any units as a result of the purchase or redemption by Newmark Holdings of any Founding Partner interests, Cantor will be entitled to the benefits (including distributions) of the units it acquires from the date of termination or bankruptcy of the applicable Founding Partner. In addition, any such units will be exchangeable by Cantor for a number of 
 81 

shares of our Class B common stock or, at Cantor s election, shares of our Class A common stock, in each case, equal to the then-current Exchange Ratio, on the same basis as the limited partnership interests held by Cantor, and will be designated as Newmark Holdings exchangeable limited partnership interests when acquired by Cantor. The Exchange Ratio was initially one, but is subject to adjustment as set forth in the Separation and Distribution Agreement and was 0.9257 as of September 30, 2024. This may permit Cantor to receive a larger share of income generated by our business at a less expensive price than through purchasing shares of our Class A common stock, which is a result of the price payable by Cantor to Newmark. 
 
 On April 16, 2023, Cantor purchased from Newmark Holdings an aggregate of (i) 309,631 exchangeable limited partnership interests for aggregate consideration of 1,282,265 as a result of the redemption of 309,631 Founding Partner interests, and (ii) 38,989 exchangeable limited partnership interests for aggregate consideration of 166,364 as a result of the exchange of 38,989 Founding Partner interests. 
 
 On June 30, 2023, Cantor purchased from Newmark Holdings an aggregate of 74,026 exchangeable limited partnership interests for aggregate consideration of 310,976 as a result of the redemption of 74,026 Founding Partner interests. 
 
 On October 23, 2024, Cantor purchased from Newmark Holdings an aggregate of (i) 500,617 exchangeable limited partnership interests for aggregate consideration of 1,824,045 as a result of the redemption of 500,617 Founding Partner interests, and (ii) 162,086 exchangeable limited partnership interests for aggregate consideration of 506,022 as a result of the exchange of 162,086 Founding Partner interests. Following such purchase, there were no Founding Partner interests in Newmark Holdings remaining in which the partnership had the right to redeem or exchange and with respect to which Cantor had the right to purchase an equivalent number of Cantor Units following such redemption or exchange. 
 
 First Amendment to Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of Newmark Holdings 
 
 On March 10, 2023, Newmark Holdings entered into the LPA Amendment to the Newmark Holdings limited partnership agreement. The LPA Amendment revises certain restrictive covenants pertaining to the Partner Obligations and Competitive Activity provisions in the Newmark Holdings limited partnership agreement. Specifically, the LPA Amendment (i) reduces the length of the post-termination period during which a partner must refrain from soliciting or doing business with customers, soliciting employees, engaging in a Competing Business (as defined therein), or otherwise refraining from harming the partnership; and (ii) revises the scope of the non-compete provisions under the Partner Obligations and Competitive Activity provisions in the Newmark Holdings limited partnership agreement to cover Competing Businesses for which a partner performs the same or similar services as provided to a Protected Affiliate (as defined therein) and (a) involving a product, product line or type, or service of a Protected Affiliate within a specific geographic area, (b) involving a Client or a Client Representative (each as defined therein) of a Protected Affiliate, or (c) for which the disclosure of confidential information is likely to be inevitable. The LPA Amendment was approved by the Board of Directors and Audit and Compensation Committees. 
 
 Knotel Assets 
 
 As part of the Knotel acquisition in March 2021, Newmark assigned the rights to acquire certain Knotel assets to a subsidiary of Cantor, on the terms that if the subsidiary monetized the sale of these assets, Newmark would receive 10 of the proceeds of the sale after the subsidiary recoups its investment in the assets. 
 
 Employment Matters 
 
 On June 28, 2021, Newmark hired a son of our Executive Chairman as a full-time employee, providing for salary, bonus, reimbursement of ordinary course expenses and travel, and a potential profit participation consistent with other entrepreneurial arrangements in the event of certain liquidity events related to businesses developed by him. This employment arrangement was approved by the Audit Committee. For 2023, total compensation under the arrangement was approximately 400,000. 
 
 Referral Fees to Cantor 
 
 In September 2021, the Audit Committee authorized Newmark and its subsidiaries to pay referral fees to Cantor and its subsidiaries (other than Newmark and its subsidiaries) in respect of referred business, pursuant to ordinary course arrangements in circumstances where Newmark would customarily pay referral fees to unrelated third parties and where Newmark is paying a referral fee to Cantor in an amount that is no more than the applicable percentage rate set forth in Newmark s intra-company referral policies, as then in effect, with such fees to be at referral rates no less favorable to Newmark than would be paid to unrelated third parties. 
 
 Acquisition of Spring11 Ownership Interest from Cantor 
 
 82 

In February 2023, Newmark s subsidiary, Newmark S11 entered into an equity purchase agreement with CFS11, a subsidiary of Cantor, pursuant to which Newmark acquired CFS11 s 33.78 ownership interest in Newmark S11 LP, LLC, the joint venture that owns a controlling interest in Spring11, for a total purchase price of 11,530,598. CFS11 s 33.78 ownership in Newmark S11 LP, LLC was 25.62 of Spring11 s economic interest. The transaction, which also included Newmark S11 buying the remaining minority interests from other third-party owners on substantially the same terms, resulted in Newmark S11 owning 100 of Spring11. The CFS11 transaction was approved by our Audit Committee. 
 
 Placement Agent Authorization with CF Co 
 
 On August 8, 2023, our Audit Committee authorized us to engage CF Co as a non-exclusive placement agent on behalf of us or our subsidiaries in connection with certain capital markets transactions (with the ability to also mandate certain third-party banks as additional advisors and co-placement agents alongside CF Co), pursuant to customary terms and conditions, including percentage of proceeds, and provided the terms are no less favorable to us than terms that an unaffiliated third-party investment bank would provide to us in similar transactions. 
 
 7.500 Senior Notes 
 
 On January 12, 2024, the Company issued an aggregate of 600.0 million principal amount of 7.500 Senior Notes due 2029. In connection with this issuance of 7.500 Senior Notes, the Company recorded approximately 0.5 million in underwriting fees payable to CF Co. These fees were recorded as a deduction from the carrying amount of the debt liability, which is amortized as interest expense over the term of the notes. Cantor purchased 125.0 million aggregate principal amount of such senior notes. On August 8, 2024, the Company filed a registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC, which was effective upon filing, pursuant to which Cantor, or its successors, assigns, and direct and indirect transferees, may resell their 7.500 Senior Notes from time to time. The Company will not receive any of the proceeds from the resale of the 7.500 Senior Notes, and the selling securityholders will pay any underwriting discounts and commissions, brokerage commissions, and transfer taxes, if any, applicable to the notes sold by them. Cantor still holds such notes as of November 8, 2024. 
 
 Services Agreement with Cantor Fitzgerald Europe for the Provision of Real Estate Investment Banking Services 
 
 On February 21, 2024, the Audit Committee of the Company authorized NHL, a subsidiary of Newmark, to enter into an agreement with CFE pursuant to which CFE will employ and support an individual to enhance Newmark s capital markets platform by providing real estate investment banking services for the benefit of Newmark s client. Under this agreement, NHL will reimburse CFE for the individual s fully allocated costs, plus a mark-up of 7 and CFE will be entitled to 10 of revenues generated by such individual on behalf of Newmark. In addition, the Audit Committee of the Company authorized NHL to include additional individuals to perform such services on substantially the same terms; provided that, in any case, the mark-up charged for such additional individuals is between 3.0 and 7.5 , depending on the level of support required for such individuals. 

Regulatory Requirements 
 
 Newmark is subject to various capital requirements in connection with seller/servicer agreements that Newmark has entered into with the various GSEs. Failure to maintain minimum capital requirements could result in Newmark s inability to originate and service loans for the respective GSEs and could have a direct material adverse effect on our accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. As of September 30, 2024, Newmark had met all capital requirements. As of September 30, 2024, the most restrictive capital requirement was Fannie Mae s net worth requirement. Newmark exceeded the minimum requirement by 385.2 million. 
 
 Certain of Newmark s agreements with Fannie Mae allow Newmark to originate and service loans under the Fannie Mae DUS program. These agreements require Newmark to maintain sufficient collateral to meet Fannie Mae s restricted and operational liquidity requirements based on a pre-established formula. Certain of Newmark s agreements with Freddie Mac allow Newmark to service loans under the Freddie Mac TAH. These agreements require Newmark to pledge sufficient collateral to meet Freddie Mac s liquidity requirement of 8 of the outstanding principal of Freddie Mac TAH loans serviced by Newmark. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, Newmark had met all liquidity requirements. 
 
 In addition, as a servicer for Fannie Mae, Ginnie Mae, and FHA, Newmark is required to advance to investors any uncollected principal and interest due from borrowers. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, outstanding borrower advances were 0.3 million and 1.6 million, respectively, and are included in Other assets in our accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets.

 255,376 243,882 
 (1) Common stock consisted of Class A shares and Class B shares. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the weighted-average number of Class A shares was 151.5 million shares and Class B shares was 21.3 million that were included in our fully diluted EPS computation. 
 (2) Partnership units collectively include FPUs, limited partnership units, and Cantor Units (see Note 2 Limited Partnership Interests in Newmark Holdings and BGC Holdings to our accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for more information). In general, these partnership units are potentially exchangeable into shares of Newmark Class A common stock. In addition, the partnership units held by Cantor as of September 30, 2024 are generally exchangeable into up to 24.9 million shares of Newmark Class A common stock and/or Newmark Class B common stock. These partnership units also generally receive quarterly allocations of net income, after the deduction of the Preferred Distribution, based on their weighted-average pro rata share of economic ownership of the operating subsidiaries. As a result, these partnership units are included in the fully diluted share count calculation shown above. 
 (3) For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the weighted-average share count included 0.3 million anti-dilutive securities, which were excluded in the computation of fully diluted earnings per share.

 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , Newmark was committed to fund approximately 0.3 billion and 0.4 billion , respectively, which is the total remaining draws on construction loans originated by Newmark under the HUD 221(d)4, 220 and 232 programs, rate locked loans that have not been funded, and forward commitments, as well as the funding 
 84 

for Fannie Mae structured transactions. Newmark also has corresponding commitments to sell these loans to various purchasers as they are funded. 
 
 Contingent Payments Related to Acquisitions 
 
 Newmark completed acquisitions from 2019 through the third quarter of 2024 with contingent consideration of 23.1 million. The contingent equity instruments and cash liability is recorded at fair value in Accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities on Newmark s accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. 

Legal Proceedings 
 
 On August 5, 2022, Robert Garfield filed a complaint in the Delaware Court of Chancery, captioned Robert Garfield v. Howard W. Lutnick, et al. (Case No. 2022-0687) (the Garfield action ), against the members of the Board and Mr. Lutnick in his capacity as Chairman of the Board and controlling stockholder. This derivative complaint alleges that in connection with the December 2021 bonus award, payable over a three-year period, granted to Mr. Lutnick: (i) the Board breached its fiduciary duty, (ii) neither the award nor the approval process employed by the Compensation Committee were entirely fair to the Company and its stockholders, and (iii) the members of the Compensation Committee did not exercise independent judgment. The complaint alleges that Mr. Lutnick breached his fiduciary duty as Chairman and controlling shareholder by forcing the Company to grant the award and by accepting it. The complaint seeks rescission of the award and other compensation, as well as damages and other relief. 
 
 On October 7, 2022, Cardinal Capital Management, LLC filed a complaint in the Delaware Court of Chancery, captioned Cardinal Capital Management, LLC v. Howard W. Lutnick, et al. (Case No. 2022-0909-SG) (the Cardinal action ), against Mr. Lutnick, the members of the Compensation Committee in 2021, who were Virginia S. Bauer, Kenneth A. McIntyre and Michael Snow as members of the Compensation Committee, and Barry Gosin, Michael Rispoli and Stephen Merkel, as Newmark s executive officers. The derivative complaint alleges that in connection with the Company s June 2021 partnership units exchange for Mr. Lutnick and Officers (as such term is defined in the Cardinal action) and the December 2021 bonus award, payable over a three-year period, granted to Mr. Lutnick: (i) the Compensation Committee and Officers breached their fiduciary duties and wasted corporate assets; and (ii) Mr. Lutnick and the Officers were unjustly enriched. The complaint also alleges that Mr. Lutnick breached his fiduciary duty as Chairman and controlling shareholder, and wasted corporate assets, by forcing the Company to grant the award and by accepting it. The complaint seeks recoupment of the partnership units exchange and the bonus award, as well as damages and other relief. 
 
 On December 13, 2022, the Delaware Court of Chancery entered an order consolidating the Garfield and Cardinal actions into a single, consolidated action (Consolidated C.A. No. 2022-0687) deemed to have commenced on August 5, 2022, when the Garfield action was filed. On January 10, 2023, plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint, whose claims, as well as requested relief, mirror the claims and relief sought in the Cardinal action in all material respects. The Company s position is that the partnership units exchange was appropriate and in the best interests of the Company, and that the bonus award was properly approved by the Compensation Committee comprised of independent directors (which does not include Mr. Lutnick) after careful consideration of his contributions to the Company, including the Company s superior financial results, and following an extensive process that included advice from independent legal counsel and an independent compensation. The Company believes the lawsuit has no merit. However, as with any litigation, the outcome cannot be determined with certainty. The case is in the discovery phase. Trial is scheduled for July 2025. 
 
 On March 9, 2023, a purported class action complaint was filed against Cantor, BGC Holdings, and Newmark Holdings in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware (Civil Action No. 1:23-cv-00265). The collective action, which was filed by seven former limited partners on their own behalf and on behalf of other similarly situated limited partners, alleges a claim for breach of contract against all defendants on the basis that the defendants failed to make payments due under the relevant partnership agreements. Specifically, the plaintiffs allege that the non-compete and economic forfeiture provisions upon which the defendants relied to deny payment are unenforceable under Delaware law. The plaintiffs allege a second claim against Cantor and BGC Holdings for antitrust violations under the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, as amended, on the basis that the Cantor and BGC Holdings partnership agreements constitute unreasonable restraints of trade. In that regard, the plaintiffs allege that the non-compete and economic forfeiture provisions of the Cantor and BGC Holdings partnership agreements, as well as restrictive covenants included in partner separation agreements, cause anticompetitive effects in the labor market, insulate Cantor and BGC Holdings from competition, and limit innovation. The plaintiffs seek a determination that the case may be maintained as a class action, an injunction prohibiting the allegedly anticompetitive conduct, and monetary damages of at least 5,000,000. The Company believes the lawsuit has no merit. However, as with any litigation, the outcome cannot be determined with certainty. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss and in response, on May 31, 2023, plaintiffs filed an Amended Class Action Complaint alleging similar allegations as a basis for claims for breach of contract and violation of the Sherman Act. Defendants moved to dismiss the Amended Complaint. On February 23, 2024, plaintiffs filed a Second Amended Complaint, repleading claims for violation of federal antitrust laws and challenging economic forfeiture and non-compete 
 85 

obligations as violative of federal competition law. Defendants have filed a motion to dismiss the Second Amended Complaint. The motion is fully briefed as of May 2024 and a decision is forthcoming. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 The preparation of our accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP guidance requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of the assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. These accounting estimates require the use of assumptions about matters, some which are highly uncertain at the time of estimation. To the extent actual experience differs from the assumptions used, our accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets, unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations and unaudited condensed consolidated statements of cash flows could be materially affected. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity. 
 
 Revenue Recognition 
 
 We derive our revenues primarily through commissions from brokerage services, commercial mortgage origination, net, revenues from real estate management services, servicing fees and other revenues. Revenue from contracts with customers is recognized when, or as, we satisfy our performance obligations by transferring the promised goods or services to the customers as determined by when, or as, the customer obtains control of that good or service. A performance obligation may be satisfied over time or at a point in time. Revenue from a performance obligation satisfied over time is recognized by measuring our progress in satisfying the performance obligation as evidenced by the transfer of the goods or services to the customer. Revenue from a performance obligation satisfied at a point in time is recognized at the point in time when the customer obtains control over the promised good or service. 
 
 The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those promised goods or services (i.e., the transaction price ). In determining the transaction price, we consider consideration promised in a contract that includes a variable amount, referred to as variable consideration, and estimate the amount of consideration due to us. Additionally, variable consideration is included in the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. In determining when to include variable consideration in the transaction price, we consider all information (historical, current and forecast) that is available, including the range of possible outcomes, the predictive value of past experiences, the time period of when uncertainties are expected to be resolved and the amount of consideration that is susceptible to factors outside of our influence. 
 
 We also use third-party service providers in the provision of services to our customers. In instances where a third-party service provider is used, we perform an analysis to determine whether we are acting as a principal or an agent with respect to the services provided. To the extent that we are acting as a principal, the revenue and the expenses incurred are recorded on a gross basis. In instances where we are acting as an agent, the revenue and expenses are presented on a net basis within the revenue line item. 
 
 In some instances, we perform services for customers and incur out-of-pocket expenses as part of delivering those services. Our customers agree to reimburse us for those expenses, and those reimbursements are part of the contract s transaction price. Consequently, these expenses and the reimbursements of such expenses from the customer are presented on a gross basis because the services giving rise to the out-of-pocket expenses do not transfer a good or service. The reimbursements are included in the transaction price when the costs are incurred, and the reimbursements are due from the customer. 
 
 MSRs, Net 
 
 We initially recognize and measure the rights to service mortgage loans at fair value and subsequently measure them using the amortization method. We recognize rights to service mortgage loans as separate assets at the time the underlying originated mortgage loan is sold, and the value of those rights is included in the determination of the gains on loans held for sale. Purchased MSRs, including MSRs purchased from CCRE, are initially recorded at fair value, and subsequently measured using the amortization method. 
 
 We receive up to a three-basis point servicing fee and/or up to a one-basis point surveillance fee on certain Freddie Mac loans after the loan is securitized in a Freddie Mac pool. The Freddie Mac Strip is also recognized at fair value and subsequently measured using the amortization method, but is recognized as a MSR at the securitization date. 
 
 86 

MSRs are assessed for impairment, at least on an annual basis, based upon the fair value of those rights as compared to the amortized cost. Fair values are estimated using a valuation model that calculates the present value of the future net servicing cash flows. In using this valuation method, we incorporate assumptions that management believes market participants would use in estimating future net servicing income. The fair value estimates are sensitive to significant assumptions used in the valuation model such as prepayment rates, cost of servicing, escrow earnings rates, discount rates and servicing multiples, which are affected by expectations about future market or economic conditions derived, in part, from historical data. It is reasonably possible that such estimates may change. We amortize the MSRs in proportion to, and over the period of, the projected net servicing income. For purposes of impairment evaluation and measurement, we stratify MSRs based on predominant risk characteristics of the underlying loans, primarily by investor type (Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac, FHA/Ginnie Mae, commercial mortgage-backed securities and other). To the extent that the carrying value exceeds the fair value of a specific MSR strata, a valuation allowance is established, which is adjusted in the future as the fair value of MSRs increases or decreases. Reversals of valuation allowances cannot exceed the previously recognized impairment up to the amortized cost. 
 
 Equity-Based and Other Compensation 
 
 Discretionary Bonus: A portion of our compensation and employee benefits expense comprises discretionary bonuses, which may be paid in cash, equity, partnership awards or a combination thereof. We accrue expense in a period based on revenues in that period and on the expected combination of cash, equity and partnership units. Given the assumptions used in estimating discretionary bonuses, actual results may differ. 
 
 RSUs: We account for equity-based compensation under the fair value recognition provisions of U.S. GAAP guidance. RSUs provided to certain employees are accounted for as equity awards, and in accordance with U.S. GAAP guidance, we are required to record an expense for the portion of the RSUs that is ultimately expected to vest. Further, U.S. GAAP guidance requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Because significant assumptions are used in estimating employee turnover and associated forfeiture rates, actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 
 The fair value of RSU awards to employees is determined on the date of grant, based on the fair value of our Class A common stock. Generally, RSUs granted by us as employee compensation do not receive dividend equivalents; as such, we adjust the fair value of the RSUs for the present value of expected forgone dividends, which requires us to include an estimate of expected dividends as a valuation input. This grant-date fair value is amortized to expense ratably over the awards vesting periods. For RSUs with graded vesting features, we have made an accounting policy election to recognize compensation cost on a straight-line basis. The amortization is reflected as non-cash equity-based compensation expense in our accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
 
 Restricted Stock: Restricted stock provided to certain employees is accounted for as an equity award, and as per U.S. GAAP guidance, we are required to record an expense for the portion of the restricted stock that is ultimately expected to vest. We have granted restricted stock that is not subject to continued employment or service; however, transferability is subject to compliance with our and our affiliates customary non-compete obligations. Such shares of restricted stock are generally saleable by partners in five to 10 years. Because the restricted stock is not subject to continued employment or service, the grant-date fair value of the restricted stock is expensed on the date of grant. The expense is reflected as non-cash equity-based compensation expense in our accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
 
 Limited Partnership Units: Limited partnership units in Newmark Holdings are held by Newmark employees and receive quarterly allocations of net income and are generally contingent upon services being provided by the unit holders. As discussed above, Preferred Units in Newmark Holdings are not entitled to participate in partnership distributions other than with respect to a distribution at a rate of either 0.6875 (which is 2.75 per calendar year) or such other amount as set forth in the award documentation. The quarterly allocations of net income to such limited partnership units are reflected as a component of compensation expense under Equity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs in our accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. Prior to the Corporate Conversion, certain Newmark employees held BGC Holdings limited partnership units with similar entitlements. 
 
 Certain of these limited partnership units entitle the holders to receive post-termination payments equal to the notional amount in four equal yearly installments after the holder s termination. These limited partnership units are accounted for as post-termination liability awards under U.S. GAAP guidance, which requires that Newmark record an expense for such awards based on the change in value at each reporting period and include the expense in our accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations as part of Equity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs. The liability for limited partnership units with a post-termination payout is included in Other long-term liabilities on our accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
 
 87 

Certain limited partnership units held by Newmark employees are granted exchangeability into Class A common stock or may be redeemed in connection with the grant of shares of Class A common stock. At the time exchangeability is granted, or the shares are issued, Newmark recognizes an expense based on the fair value of the award on that date, which is included in Equity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs in our accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
 
 Employee Loans: We have entered into various agreements with certain of our employees and partners whereby these individuals receive loans that may be either wholly or in part repaid from distributions that the individuals receive on some or all of their limited partnership interests and from proceeds of the sale of the employees shares of our Class A common stock or may be forgiven over a period of time. Cash advance distribution loans are documented in formal agreements and are repayable in timeframes outlined in the underlying agreements. We intend for these advances to be repaid in full from the future distributions on existing and future awards granted or the proceeds of the sales of the employees shares. The allocations of net income to the awards are treated as compensation expense and the proceeds from distributions are used to repay the loan. The forgivable portion of any loans is recognized as compensation expense in our accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations over the life of the loan. We review the loan balances each reporting period for collectability. If we determine that the collectability of a portion of the loan balances is not expected, we recognize a reserve against the loan balances. Actual collectability of loan balances may differ from our estimates. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the aggregate balance of employee loans, net of reserve, was 788.2 million and 651.2 million, respectively, and is included as Loans, forgivable loans and other receivables from employees and partners, net in our accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. Compensation expense for the above-mentioned employee loans for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 23.5 million and 28.3 million, respectively, and 72.7 million and 78.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The compensation expense related to these loans was included as part of Compensation and employee benefits in our accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
 
 Goodwill 
 
 Goodwill is the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in a business combination. As prescribed in U.S. GAAP guidance, Intangibles Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets , goodwill is not amortized, but instead is periodically tested for impairment. We review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or whenever an event occurs, or circumstances change that could reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. 
 
 When reviewing goodwill for impairment, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the results of the qualitative assessment indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, or if we choose to bypass the qualitative assessment, we perform a quantitative goodwill impairment analysis as follows. 
 
 The quantitative goodwill impairment test, used to identify both the existence of impairment and the amount of impairment loss, compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss should be recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is deemed not to be impaired. To estimate the fair value of the reporting unit, we use a discounted cash flow model and data regarding market comparables. The valuation process requires significant judgment and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These assumptions include cash flow projections, estimated cost of capital and the selection of peer companies and relevant multiples. Because significant assumptions and estimates are used in projecting future cash flows, choosing peer companies and selecting relevant multiples, actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 
 Credit Losses 
 
 The CECL methodology, which became effective on January 1, 2020, requires us to estimate lifetime expected credit losses by incorporating historical loss experience, as well as current and future economic conditions over a reasonable and supportable period beyond the balance sheet date. The adoption of CECL resulted in the recognition of reserves relating to our loss sharing guarantee provided to Fannie Mae under the Fannie Mae DUS program and to Freddie Mac under the Freddie Mac TAH program which was previously accounted for under the incurred loss model. The incurred loss model generally required that a loss be incurred before it was recognized. Additional reserves were recognized for our receivables from customers including certain employee receivables carried at amortized cost. 
 
 The expected credit loss is modeled based on our historical loss experience adjusted to reflect current conditions. A significant amount of judgment is required in the determination of the appropriate reasonable and supportable period, the methodology used to incorporate current and future macroeconomic conditions, determination of the probability of and 
 88 

exposure at default, all of which are ultimately used in measuring the quantitative components of our reserves. Beyond the reasonable and supportable period, we estimate expected credit losses using our historical loss rates. We also consider whether to adjust the quantitative reserves for certain external and internal qualitative factors, which consequentially may increase or decrease the reserves for credit losses and receivables. In order to estimate credit losses, assumptions about current and future economic conditions are incorporated into the model using multiple economic scenarios that are weighted to reflect the conditions at each measurement date. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there was a decrease of 3.4 million in our reserves. These reserves were based on macroeconomic forecasts which are critical inputs into our model and material movements in variables such as the U.S. unemployment rate and U.S. GDP growth rate which could significantly affect our estimated expected credit losses. These macroeconomic forecasts, under different conditions or using different assumptions or estimates, could result in significantly different changes in reserves for credit losses. It is difficult to estimate how potential changes in specific factors might affect the overall reserves for credit losses and current results may not reflect the potential future impact of macroeconomic forecast changes. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 
 Newmark accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method as prescribed in U.S. GAAP guidance, Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to basis differences between our accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Certain of Newmark s entities are taxed as U.S. partnerships and are subject to the UBT in New York City. Therefore, the tax liability or benefit related to the partnership income or loss except for the UBT rests with the partners, rather than the partnership entity. As such, the partners tax liability or benefit is not reflected in our accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. The tax-related assets, liabilities, provisions or benefits included in our accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements also reflect the results of the entities that are taxed as corporations, either in the U.S. or in foreign jurisdictions. 
 
 Newmark provides for uncertain tax positions based upon management s assessment of whether a tax benefit is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. Management is required to determine whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. Because significant assumptions are used in determining whether a tax benefit is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities, actual results may differ from Newmark s estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Newmark recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in Provision for income taxes in our accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
 
 A valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets if it is deemed more likely than not that those assets will not be realized. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, Newmark considers all available evidence, including past operating results, the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent fiscal years, estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning strategies. 
 
 The measurement of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities is based on provisions of enacted tax laws and involves uncertainties in the application of tax regulations in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions. Because Newmark s interpretation of complex tax law may impact the measurement of current and deferred income taxes, actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions regarding the application of tax law. 
 
 Derivative Financial Instruments 
 
 We have loan commitments to extend credit to third parties. The commitments to extend credit are for mortgage loans at a specific rate (rate lock commitments). These commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require a fee. We are committed to extend credit to the counterparty as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the commitment contracts. Whenever we commit to extend credit, we simultaneously enter into a Forward Sales Contract. 
 
 Both the commitment to extend credit and the forward sale commitment qualify as derivative financial instruments. We recognize all derivatives on our accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets as assets or liabilities measured at fair value. The change in the derivatives fair value is recognized in current period earnings. 
 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements

See Note 1 Organization and Basis of Presentation to our accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, for information regarding recent accounting pronouncements. 

Capital Deployment Priorities, Dividend Policy and Repurchase and Redemption Program 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we have returned 193.5 million dollars to shareholders through share repurchases and unit purchases. In addition, we paid dividends and distributions. We expect to continue returning capital to shareholders. 
 
 Since 2022, the Board has declared a quarterly dividend of 0.03 per share. In addition, Newmark has paid an after-tax distribution to its partners. The Exchange Ratio is adjusted in accordance with the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement in the event of any difference between our dividend policy and the distribution policy of Newmark Holdings. 
 
 Any dividends, if and when declared by our Board, will be paid on a quarterly basis. No assurance can be made, however, that a dividend will be paid each quarter. The declaration, payment, timing, and amount of any future dividends payable by us will be at the sole discretion of our Board. With respect to any distributions which are declared, amounts paid to or on behalf of partners will at least cover their related tax payments. Whether any given post-tax amount is equivalent to the amount received by a stockholder also on an after-tax basis depends upon stockholders and partners domiciles and tax status. 
 
 We are a holding company, with no direct operations, and therefore we are able to pay dividends only from our available cash on hand and funds received from distributions from Newmark OpCo. Our ability to pay dividends may also be limited by regulatory considerations as well as by covenants contained in financing or other agreements. In addition, under Delaware law, dividends may be payable only out of surplus, which is our net assets minus our capital (as defined under Delaware law), or, if we have no surplus, out of our net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and/or the preceding fiscal year. Accordingly, any unanticipated accounting, tax, regulatory or other charges against net income may adversely affect our ability to declare and pay dividends. While we intend to declare and pay dividends quarterly, there can be no assurance that our Board will declare dividends at all or on a regular basis or that the amount of our dividends will not change. 

Our Organizational Structure 
 
 Current Organizational Structure 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, there were 219,910,910 shares of Newmark Class A common stock issued and 146,962,810 outstanding. Cantor and CFGM held no shares of Newmark Class A common stock. Each share of Newmark Class A common stock is generally entitled to one vote on matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders. As of September 30, 2024, Cantor and CFGM held 21,285,533 shares of Newmark Class B common stock representing all of the outstanding shares of Newmark Class B common stock. The shares of Newmark Class B common stock held by Cantor and CFGM, as of September 30, 2024, represented approximately 59.2 of our total voting power. Each share of Newmark Class B common stock is generally entitled to the same rights as a share of Newmark Class A common stock, except that, on matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders, each share of Newmark Class B common stock is entitled to 10 votes. The Newmark Class B common stock generally votes together with the Newmark Class A common stock on all matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders. 
 
 Shares of Newmark Class B common stock are convertible into shares of Newmark Class A common stock at any time in the discretion of the holder on a one-for-one basis. Accordingly, if Cantor and CFGM converted all of their shares of Newmark Class B common stock into shares of Newmark Class A common stock, Cantor and CFGM would hold 12.7 of the voting power in Newmark and the stockholders of Newmark other than Cantor and CFGM would hold 87.3 of the voting power in Newmark (and the indirect economic interests in Newmark OpCo would remain unchanged). In addition, if Cantor and CFGM continued to hold shares of Newmark Class B common stock and if Cantor exchanged all of the exchangeable limited partnership units held by Cantor for shares of Newmark Class B common stock, Cantor and CFGM would hold 76.6 of the voting power in Newmark, and the stockholders of Newmark other than Cantor and CFGM would hold 23.4 of the voting power in Newmark (and the indirect economic interests in Newmark OpCo would remain unchanged). 
 
 We expect to retain our dual class structure, and there are no circumstances under which the holders of Newmark Class B common stock would be required to convert their shares of Newmark Class B common stock into shares of Newmark Class A common stock. Our Certificate of Incorporation does not provide for automatic conversion of shares of Newmark Class B common stock into shares of Newmark Class A common stock upon the occurrence of any event. 
 
 90 

We hold the Newmark Holdings general partnership interest and the Newmark Holdings special voting limited partnership interest, which entitle us to remove and appoint the general partner of Newmark Holdings and serve as the general partner of Newmark Holdings, which entitles us to control Newmark Holdings. Newmark Holdings, in turn, holds the Newmark OpCo general partnership interest and the Newmark OpCo special voting limited partnership interest, which entitle Newmark Holdings to remove and appoint the general partner of Newmark OpCo, and serve as the general partner of Newmark OpCo, which entitles Newmark Holdings (and thereby us) to control Newmark OpCo. In addition, as of September 30, 2024, we directly held Newmark OpCo limited partnership interests consisting of approximately 170,552,249 units representing approximately 68.4 of the outstanding Newmark OpCo limited partnership interests. We are a holding company that holds these interests, serves as the general partner of Newmark Holdings and, through Newmark Holdings, acts as the general partner of Newmark OpCo. As a result of our ownership of the general partnership interest in Newmark Holdings and Newmark Holdings general partnership interest in Newmark OpCo, we consolidate Newmark OpCo s results for financial reporting purposes. 
 
 Cantor, Founding Partners, Working Partners and Limited Partnership Unit Holders directly hold Newmark Holdings limited partnership interests. Newmark Holdings, in turn, holds Newmark OpCo limited partnership interests and, as a result, Cantor, Founding Partners, Working Partners and Limited Partnership Unit Holders indirectly have interests in Newmark OpCo limited partnership interests. 
 
 The Newmark Holdings limited partnership interests held by Cantor and CFGM are designated as Newmark Holdings exchangeable limited partnership interests. The Newmark Holdings limited partnership interests held by the Founding Partners are designated as Newmark Holdings Founding Partner interests. The Newmark Holdings limited partnership interests held by the Working Partners are designated as Newmark Holdings Working Partner interests. The Newmark Holdings limited partnership interests held by the Limited Partnership Unit Holders are designated as limited partnership units. 
 
 Each unit of Newmark Holdings limited partnership interests held by Cantor and CFGM is generally exchangeable with us for a number of shares of Class B common stock (or, at Cantor s option or if there are no additional authorized but unissued shares of Class B common stock, a number of shares of Class A common stock) equal to the Exchange Ratio. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, 2,622,079 Founding/Working Partner interests were outstanding. These Founding/Working Partner interests were issued in the Separation to holders of BGC Holdings Founding/Working Partner interests, who received such Founding/Working Partner interests in connection with BGC Partners acquisition of the BGC Partners business from Cantor in 2008. The Newmark Holdings limited partnership interests held by Founding/Working Partners are not exchangeable with us unless (1) Cantor acquires Cantor Units from Newmark Holdings upon termination or bankruptcy of the Founding/Working Partners or redemption of their units by Newmark Holdings (which it has the right to do under certain circumstances), in which case such interests will be exchangeable with us for shares of Newmark Class A common stock or Newmark Class B common stock as described above, or (2) Cantor determines that such interests can be exchanged by such Founding/Working Partners with us for Newmark Class A common stock, with each Newmark Holdings unit exchangeable for a number of shares of Newmark Class A common stock equal to the Exchange Ratio (which was initially one, but is subject to adjustment as set forth in the Separation and Distribution Agreement), on terms and conditions to be determined by Cantor (which exchange of certain interests Cantor permits from time to time). Once a Newmark Holdings Founding/Working Partner interest becomes exchangeable, such Founding/Working Partner interest is automatically exchanged upon a termination or bankruptcy with us for Newmark Class A common stock. 
 
 Further, we provide exchangeability for partnership units under other circumstances in connection with (1) our partnership redemption, compensation and restructuring programs, (2) other incentive compensation arrangements and (3) business combination transactions. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 78,759,443 limited partnership units were outstanding (including Founding/Working Partner interests and Working Partner interests, and units held by Cantor). Limited partnership units will be only exchangeable with us in accordance with the terms and conditions of the grant of such units, which terms and conditions are determined in our sole discretion, as the Newmark Holdings general partner, with the consent of the Newmark Holdings exchangeable limited partnership interest majority in interest, in accordance with the terms of the Newmark Holdings limited partnership agreement. 
 
 The Exchange Ratio between Newmark Holdings limited partnership interests and our common stock was initially one. However, this Exchange Ratio will be adjusted in accordance with the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement if our dividend policy and the distribution policy of Newmark Holdings are different. As of September 30, 2024, the Exchange Ratio was 0.9257. 
 
 91 

With each exchange, our direct and indirect interest in Newmark OpCo will proportionately increase because, immediately following an exchange, Newmark Holdings will redeem the Newmark Holdings unit so acquired for the Newmark OpCo limited partnership interest underlying such Newmark Holdings unit. 
 
 The profit and loss of Newmark OpCo and Newmark Holdings, as the case may be, are allocated based on the total number of Newmark OpCo units and Newmark Holdings units, as the case may be, outstanding. 
 
 The following diagram illustrates the ownership structure of Newmark as of September 30, 2024. The diagram does not reflect the various subsidiaries of Newmark, Newmark OpCo or Cantor (including certain operating subsidiaries that are organized as corporations whose equity is either wholly owned by Newmark or whose equity is majority-owned by Newmark with the remainder owned by Newmark OpCo) or the results of any exchange of Newmark Holdings exchangeable limited partnership interests or, to the extent applicable, Newmark Holdings Founding Partner interests, Newmark Holdings Working Partner interests or Newmark Holdings limited partnership units. 
 92 

STRUCTURE OF NEWMARK AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 

(1) Excludes unrestricted Class A common stock owned by employees. 
 (2) Cantor includes Cantor Fitzgerald, L.P. and CFGM. Cantor Fitzgerald, L.P. has 12.4 of the economics and 58.2 of the voting power in Newmark Group, Inc. CFGM has 0.2 of the economics and 1.0 of the voting power in Newmark Group, Inc. 
 
 93 

The diagram reflects Newmark Class A common stock and Newmark Holdings partnership unit activity from January 1, 2024 through September 30, 2024 as follows: (a) an aggregate of 12,853,718 limited partnership units granted by Newmark Holdings; (b) 15,745,930 shares of Newmark Class A common stock repurchased by us; (c) 212,220 shares of restricted Newmark Class A common stock forfeited; (d) 1,856,950 shares of Newmark Class A common stock issued for RSUs; (e) 344,459 shares of Class A common stock issued by us under our acquisition shelf registration statement on Form S-4 (Registration No. 333-231616), but not the 17,461,432 of such shares and rights to acquire such shares remaining available for issuance by us under such registration statement; and (f) 512,840 terminated limited partnership units. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 Credit Risk 
 Our multifamily origination business under the Fannie Mae DUS program originates and services multifamily loans for Fannie Mae without having to obtain Fannie Mae s prior approval for certain loans, as long as the loans meet the underwriting guidelines set forth by Fannie Mae. In return for the delegated authority to make loans and the commitment to purchase loans by Fannie Mae, we must maintain minimum collateral and generally are required to share risk of loss on loans sold through Fannie Mae. With respect to most loans, we are generally required to absorb approximately one-third of any losses on the unpaid principal balance of a loan at the time of loss settlement. Some of the loans that we originate under the Fannie Mae DUS program are subject to reduced levels or no risk-sharing. However, we generally receive lower servicing fees with respect to such loans. Although our Berkeley Point business s average annual losses from such risk-sharing programs have been a minimal percentage of the aggregate principal amount of such loans, if loan defaults increase, actual risk-sharing obligation payments under the Fannie Mae DUS program could increase, and such defaults could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In addition, a material failure to pay its share of losses under the Fannie Mae DUS program could result in the revocation of Berkeley Point s license from Fannie Mae and the exercise of various remedies available to Fannie Mae under the Fannie Mae DUS program. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 On January 12, 2024, Newmark closed its offering of 600.0 million aggregate principal amount of 7.500 Senior Notes. These debt obligations are not currently subject to fluctuations in interest rates, although in the event of refinancing or issuance of new debt, such debt could be subject to changes in interest rates. Newmark had an outstanding principal balance of 600.0 million of 7.500 Senior Notes and 175.0 million outstanding on the Credit Facility as of September 30, 2024. The interest rate on the Credit Facility is currently based upon SOFR. 
 
 Berkeley Point is an intermediary that originates loans which are generally pre-sold prior to loan closing. Therefore, for loans held for sale to the GSEs and HUD, we are not currently exposed to unhedged interest rate risk. Prior to closing on loans with borrowers, we enter into agreements to sell the loans to investors, and originated loans are typically sold within 45 days of funding. The coupon rate for each loan is set concurrently with the establishment of the interest rate with the investor. 
 
 Some of our assets and liabilities are subject to changes in interest rates. Earnings from escrows are generally based on SOFR. 30-day SOFR as of September 30, 2024 was 516 basis points and 532 basis points at September 30, 2023. A 100-basis point increase in the 30-day SOFR would increase our annual earnings by 12.7 million based on our escrow balances as of September 30, 2024 and by 10.9 million based on our escrow balances as of September 30, 2023. A 100-basis point decrease in the 30-day SOFR would decrease our annual earnings by 12.7 million based on our escrow balances as of September 30, 2024 and by 10.9 million based on the escrow balances as of September 30, 2023. 
 
 We use warehouse facilities and repurchase agreements to fund loans we originate under our various lending programs. The borrowing costs of our warehouse facilities and the repurchase agreement is based on SOFR. A 100-basis point increase in 30-day SOFR would decrease our annual earnings by 9.9 million based on our outstanding balances as of September 30, 2024 and by 6.1 million based on our outstanding balances as of September 30, 2023. A 100 basis-point decrease in 30-day SOFR would increase our annual earnings by approximately 9.9 million based on our outstanding warehouse balance as of September 30, 2024 and by approximately 6.1 million based on our outstanding warehouse balance as of September 30, 2023. During 2024, the borrowing costs we incurred on our warehouse facilities exceeded the amount of interest income we earned from loans held for sale due to the inverted yield curve. Our borrowing costs are based on a short term SOFR rate, while the interest rate we earn on loans held for sale are based on US Treasury rates plus a credit spread. 
 
 Foreign Currency Risk 
 We are exposed to risks associated with changes in foreign exchange rates. Changes in foreign exchange rates create volatility in the U.S. dollar equivalent of our revenues and expenses. While our international results of operations, as measured in U.S. dollars, are subject to foreign exchange fluctuations, we do not consider the related risk to be material to our results of 
 94 

operations. While our exposure to foreign exchange risk is not currently material to us, we expect to grow our international revenues in the future, and any future potential exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations may present a material risk to our business. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Newmark Group, Inc. maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by Newmark Group, Inc. is recorded, processed, accumulated, summarized and communicated to its management, including its Executive Chairman and its Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. The Executive Chairman and the Chief Financial Officer have performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of Newmark Group, Inc. s disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, the Executive Chairman and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that Newmark Group, Inc. s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
