As a result, the Adviser will not earn this incentive fee for any quarter until the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income for such quarter exceeds the hurdle rate of . Once the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income in any quarter exceeds the hurdle rate, the Adviser will be entitled to a catch-up fee equal to the amount of the pre-incentive fee net investment income in excess of the hurdle rate, until the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income for such quarter equals , or annually, of net assets.

 of the average weekly value of the Company s gross assets excluding cash and cash equivalents (gross assets equal the total assets of the Company as set forth on the Company s consolidated balance sheets) and an incentive fee based on the Company s performance. Effective June 15, 2019, in connection with stockholder approval of the modification of the asset coverage requirement applicable to senior securities from to , the Adviser reduced (by permanent waiver) the annual base management fee payable under the investment advisory agreement from to on all assets financed using leverage over 1.0x debt-to-equity. The base management fee is payable quarterly in arrears. All or any part of the base management fee not taken as to any quarter will be deferred without interest and may be taken in such other quarter as the Adviser determines. The prior investment advisory agreement had substantially similar terms as the investment advisory agreement, except that the investment advisory agreement amended the prior investment advisory agreement to (i) reduce the Company s income incentive fee rate from to ; and (ii) remove the total return lookback provision applicable to the subordinated incentive fee on income from the prior investment advisory agreement. Under the prior investment advisory agreement, the subordinated incentive fee on income was subject to a cap equal to (i) of the per share pre-incentive fee return for the then-current and eleven preceding calendar quarters minus the cumulative per share incentive fees accrued and/or payable for the eleven preceding calendar quarters multiplied by (ii) the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the calendar quarter (or any portion thereof) for which the subordinated incentive fee on income was being calculated. The definitions of per share pre-incentive fee return and per share incentive fees under the prior investment advisory agreement took into account the historic per share pre-incentive fee return of both the Company and CCT, together with the historic per share incentive fees paid by both the Company and CCT. For the purpose of calculating the per share pre-incentive fee return, any unrealized appreciation or depreciation recognized as a result of the purchase accounting for the Company s acquisition of CCT was excluded. See Note 2 for a discussion of the capital gains and subordinated income incentive fees that the Advisor may be entitled to under the investment advisory agreement. 
 On June 16, 2021, the Company completed its acquisition, or the 2021 Merger, of FSKR pursuant to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, or the 2020 Merger Agreement, dated as of November 23, 2020, by and among the Company, FSKR, Rocky Merger Sub, Inc., a former wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, or Merger Sub, and the Adviser. In connection with the entry into the investment advisory agreement, the Adviser agreed to waive income incentive fees in the amount of per quarter for the first six full fiscal quarters of operations following the closing of the 2021 Merger, commencing on July 1, 2021, for a total waiver of . The fee waiver expired on December 31, 2022. In addition, the Adviser has agreed to exclude from the calculation of the subordinated incentive fee on income and the incentive fee on capital gains any changes to the fair value recorded for the assets and liabilities of FSKR resulting solely from the new cost basis of the acquired FSKR investments determined in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 805-50, Business Combinations Related Issues as a result of the 2021 Merger. 
 On April 9, 2018, the Company entered into an administration agreement with the Adviser, or the administration agreement. Pursuant to the administration agreement, the Adviser oversees the Company s day-to-day operations, including the provision of general ledger accounting, fund accounting, legal services, investor relations, certain government and regulatory affairs activities, and other administrative services. The Adviser also performs, or oversees the performance of, the Company s corporate operations and required administrative services, which includes being responsible for the financial records that the Company is required to maintain and preparing reports for the Company s stockholders and reports filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC. In addition, the Adviser assists the Company in calculating its net asset value, overseeing the preparation and filing of tax returns and the printing and dissemination of reports to the Company s stockholders, and generally overseeing the payment of the Company s expenses and the performance of administrative and professional services rendered to the Company by others. 
 Pursuant to the administration agreement, the Company reimburses the Adviser for expenses necessary to perform services related to its administration and operations, including the Adviser s allocable portion of the compensation and related expenses of certain personnel of Franklin Square Holdings, L.P., which does business as FS Investments, or FS Investments, and KKR Credit Advisors (US), LLC, or KKR Credit, providing administrative services to the Company on behalf of the Adviser. The Company reimburses the Adviser no less than quarterly for all costs and expenses incurred by the Adviser in performing its obligations and providing personnel and facilities under the administration agreement. The Adviser allocates the cost of such services to the Company based on factors such as total assets, revenues, time allocations and/or other reasonable metrics. The Company s board of directors reviews the methodology employed in determining how the expenses are allocated to the Company and the proposed allocation of administrative expenses among the Company and certain affiliates of the Adviser. The Company s board of directors then assesses the reasonableness of such reimbursements for expenses allocated to it based on the breadth, depth and quality of such services as compared to the estimated cost to the Company of obtaining similar services from third-party service providers known to be available. In addition, the Company s board of directors considers whether any single third-party service provider would be capable of providing

Broken deal costs were for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company paid and , respectively, in administrative services expenses to the Adviser during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 Potential Conflicts of Interest 
 The members of the senior management and investment teams of the Adviser serve or may serve as officers, directors or principals of entities that operate in the same or a related line of business as the Company does, or of investment vehicles managed by the same personnel. For example, the Adviser is the investment adviser to KKR FS Income Trust and KKR FS Income Trust Select, and the officers, managers and other personnel of the Adviser may serve in similar or other capacities for the investment advisers to future investment vehicles affiliated with FS Investments or KKR Credit. In serving in these multiple and other capacities, they may have obligations to other clients or investors in those entities, the fulfillment of which may not be in the Company s best interests or in the best interest of the Company s stockholders. The Company s investment objectives may overlap with the investment objectives of such investment funds, accounts or other investment vehicles. For additional information regarding potential conflicts of interest, see the Company s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Exemptive Relief 
 As a BDC, the Company is subject to certain regulatory restrictions in making its investments. For example, BDCs generally are not permitted to co-invest with certain affiliated entities in transactions originated by the BDC or its affiliates in the absence of an exemptive order from the SEC. However, BDCs are permitted to, and may, simultaneously co-invest in transactions where price is the only negotiated term. 
 In an order dated June 4, 2013, or the FS Order, the SEC granted exemptive relief permitting the Company, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, to co-invest in certain privately negotiated investment transactions with certain affiliates of its former investment adviser and any future BDCs that are advised by its former investment adviser or its affiliated investment advisers. However, in connection with the investment advisory relationship with the Adviser, and in an effort to mitigate potential future conflicts of interest, the Company s board of directors authorized and directed that the Company (i) withdraw from the FS Order, except with respect to any transaction in which the Company participated in reliance on the FS Order prior to April 9, 2018, and (ii) rely on an exemptive relief order, dated January 5, 2021, that permits the Company, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, to co-invest in certain privately negotiated investment transactions, including investments originated and directly negotiated by the Adviser or KKR Credit, with certain affiliates of the Adviser. 
 Affiliated Purchaser Program 
 As previously disclosed, certain affiliates of the owners of the Adviser committed to a investment vehicle that may invest from time to time in shares of the Company s common stock. In September 2021 and December 2021, that investment vehicle entered into a written trading plan with a third-party broker in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 and Rule 10b-18 promulgated under the Exchange Act to facilitate the purchase of shares of the Company s common stock pursuant to the terms and conditions of such plan.

 Foreign Currency Forward Contracts and Cross Currency Swaps 
 The Company may enter into foreign currency forward contracts and cross currency swaps from time to time to facilitate settlement of purchases and sales of investments denominated in foreign currencies and to economically hedge the impact that an adverse change in foreign exchange rates would have on the value of the Company s investments denominated in foreign currencies. A foreign currency forward contract is a commitment to purchase or sell a foreign currency at a future date at a negotiated forward rate. These contracts are marked-to-market by recognizing the difference between the contract forward exchange rate and the forward market exchange rate on the last day of the period presented as unrealized appreciation or depreciation. Realized gains or losses are recognized when forward contracts are settled. Risks arise as a result of the potential inability of the counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts. The Company attempts to limit counterparty risk by only dealing with well-known counterparties. 
 Cross currency swaps are interest rate swaps in which interest cash flows are exchanged between two parties based on the notional amounts of two different currencies. These swaps are marked-to-market by recognizing the difference between the present value of cash flows of each leg of the swaps as unrealized appreciation or depreciation. Realized gain or loss is recognized when periodic payments are received or paid and the swaps are terminated. The entire notional value of a cross currency swap is subject to the risk that the counterparty to the swap will default on its contractual delivery obligations. The Company attempts to limit counterparty risk by only dealing with well-known counterparties. The Company utilizes cross currency swaps from time to time in order to hedge a portion of its investments in foreign currency. 
 The average notional balance for foreign currency forward contracts during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was and , respectively. 
 Interest Rate Swaps 
 In connection with the Company s issuance of aggregate principal amount of its notes due 2029, or the Notes, the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements for a total notional amount of that mature on August 15, 2029 to reduce the exposure to changes in fair value associated with the Notes. Under the first interest rate swap agreement, entered into on June 13, 2024, the Company receives a fixed interest rate of and pays a floating interest rate of one-month SOFR plus on a notional amount of . Under the second interest rate swap agreement, entered into on June 27, 2024, the Company receives a fixed interest rate of and pays a floating interest rate of one-month SOFR plus on a notional amount of . The Company designated these interest rate swaps and the Notes as a qualifying fair value hedge accounting relationship. See Note 9 for more information on the Notes. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the counterparty to the Company s interest rate swap agreements was ING Capital Markets LLC. 
 As a result of the Company s designation of the interest rate swaps as hedging instruments in a qualifying fair value hedge accounting relationship, the Company is required to fair value the hedging instruments and the related hedged items, with the changes

 Overview 
 We were incorporated under the general corporation laws of the State of Maryland on December 21, 2007 and formally commenced investment operations on January 2, 2009. We are an externally managed, non-diversified, closed-end management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act and has elected to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and intends to qualify annually, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. 
 We are externally managed by the Adviser pursuant to the investment advisory agreement and supervised by our board of directors, a majority of whom are independent.

 Revenues 
 The principal measure of our financial performance is net increase in net assets resulting from operations, which includes net investment income, net realized gain or loss on investments, net realized gain or loss on foreign currency, net unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments and net unrealized gain or loss on foreign currency. Net investment income is the difference between our income from interest, dividends, fees and other investment income and our operating and other expenses. Net realized gain or loss on investments is the difference between the proceeds received from dispositions of portfolio investments and their amortized cost, including the respective realized gain or loss on foreign currency for those foreign denominated investment transactions. Net realized gain or loss on foreign currency is the portion of realized gain or loss attributable to foreign currency fluctuations. Net unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments is the net change in the fair value of our investment portfolio, including the respective unrealized gain or loss on foreign currency for those foreign denominated investments. Net unrealized gain or loss on foreign currency is the net change in the value of receivables or accruals due to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. 
 We principally generate revenues in the form of interest income on the debt investments we hold. In addition, we generate revenues in the form of non-recurring commitment, closing, origination, structuring or diligence fees, monitoring fees, fees for providing managerial assistance, consulting fees, prepayment fees and performance-based fees. We may also generate revenues in the form of dividends and other distributions on the equity or other securities we hold. 
 Expenses 
 Our primary operating expenses include the payment of management and incentive fees and other expenses under the investment advisory agreement and the administration agreement, interest expense from financing arrangements and other indebtedness, and other expenses necessary for our operations. The management and incentive fees compensate the Adviser for its work in identifying, evaluating, negotiating, executing, monitoring and servicing our investments. 
 The Adviser oversees our day-to-day operations, including the provision of general ledger accounting, fund accounting, legal services, investor relations, certain government and regulatory affairs activities, and other administrative services. The Adviser also performs, or oversees the performance of, our corporate operations and required administrative services, which includes being responsible for the financial records that we are required to maintain and preparing reports for our stockholders and reports filed with the SEC. In addition, the Adviser assists us in calculating our net asset value, overseeing the preparation and filing of tax returns and the printing and dissemination of reports to our stockholders, and generally overseeing the payment of our expenses and the performance of administrative and professional services rendered to us by others. 
 Pursuant to the administration agreement, we reimburse the Adviser for expenses necessary to perform services related to our administration and operations, including the Adviser s allocable portion of the compensation and related expenses of certain personnel of FS Investments and KKR Credit providing administrative services to us on behalf of the Adviser. We reimburse the Adviser no less than quarterly for all costs and expenses incurred by the Adviser in performing its obligations and providing personnel and facilities under the administration agreement. The Adviser allocates the cost of such services to us based on factors such as total assets, revenues, time allocations and/or other reasonable metrics. Our board of directors reviews the methodology employed in determining how the expenses are allocated to us and the proposed allocation of administrative expenses among us and certain affiliates of the Adviser. Our board of directors then assesses the reasonableness of such reimbursements for expenses allocated to us based on the breadth, depth and quality of such services as compared to the estimated cost to us of obtaining similar services from third-party service providers known to be available. In addition, our board of directors considers whether any single third-party service provider would be capable of providing all such services at comparable cost and quality. Finally, our board of directors compares the total amount paid to the Adviser for such services as a percentage of our net assets to the same ratio as reported by other comparable BDCs. 
 We bear all other expenses of our operations and transactions, including all other expenses incurred by the Adviser or us in connection with administering our business, including expenses incurred by the Adviser in performing administrative services for us and administrative personnel paid by the Adviser, to the extent they are not controlling persons of the Adviser or any of its affiliates, subject to the limitations included in the investment advisory agreement and the administration agreement.

Portfolio Asset Quality 
 In addition to various risk management and monitoring tools, the Adviser uses an investment rating system to characterize and monitor the expected level of returns on each investment in our portfolio. The Adviser uses an investment rating scale of 1 to 4. The following is a description of the conditions associated with each investment rating: 
 
 Investment Rating Summary Description 1 Performing investment generally executing in accordance with plan and there are no concerns about the portfolio company s performance or ability to meet covenant requirements. 
 2 Performing investment no concern about repayment of both interest and our cost basis but company s recent performance or trends in the industry require closer monitoring. 
 3 Underperforming investment some loss of interest or dividend possible, but still expecting a positive return on investment. 
 4 Underperforming investment concerns about the recoverability of principal or interest.

 The following table shows the distribution of our investments on the 1 to 4 investment rating scale at fair value as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023: 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Investment Rating Fair Value Percentage of Portfolio Fair Value Percentage of Portfolio 1 9,895 71 10,429 71 2 3,393 24 3,165 22 3 508 4 550 4 4 147 1 505 3 Total 13,943 100 14,649 100 
 The amount of the portfolio in each grading category may vary substantially from period to period resulting primarily from changes in the composition of the portfolio as a result of new investment, repayment and exit activities. In addition, changes in the grade of investments may be made to reflect our expectation of performance and changes in investment values. 
 
 Results of Operations 
 Comparison of the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 
 Revenues 
 Our investment income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was as follows: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Amount Percentage of Total Income Amount Percentage of Total Income Amount Percentage of Total Income Amount Percentage of Total Income Interest income 290 65.8 316 67.9 915 69.6 963 69.6 Paid-in-kind interest income 66 15.0 58 12.5 144 11.0 156 11.3 Fee income 21 4.8 12 2.6 56 4.3 23 1.7 Dividend income 64 14.4 79 17.0 199 15.1 241 17.4 Total investment income (1) 
 441 100.0 465 100.0 1,314 100.0 1,383 100.0 
 ___________ 
 (1) Such revenues represent 365 and 395 of cash income earned as well as 76 and 70 in non-cash portions relating to accretion of discount and PIK interest for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and represent 1,136 and 1,186 of cash income earned as well as 178 and 197 in non-cash portions relating to accretion of discount and PIK interest for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Cash flows related to such non-cash revenues may not occur for a number of reporting periods or years after such revenues are recognized. 
 The level of interest income we receive is generally related to the balance of income-producing investments, multiplied by the weighted average yield of our investments. Fee income is transaction based, and typically consists of amendment and consent fees, prepayment fees, structuring fees and other non-recurring fees. As such, fee income is generally dependent on new direct origination investments and the occurrence of events at existing portfolio companies resulting in such fees. 
 The decrease in interest and PIK income during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 is primarily attributable to the repayment of higher yielding positions and lost interest income on certain assets that were placed on non-accrual status during the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 The increase in fee income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 is primarily attributable to increased origination activity during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 The decrease in dividend income during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 is primarily attributable to lower dividends on certain asset based finance investments during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024.

 Expenses 
 Our operating expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Management fees 54 56 163 170 Subordinated income incentive fees 44 47 132 140 Administrative services expenses 2 3 7 10 Accounting and administrative fees 1 1 3 3 Interest expense 118 117 349 349 Other expenses 7 7 18 19 Total operating expenses 226 231 672 691

 2.39 2.35 7.02 6.95 Ratio of net operating expenses, excluding certain expenses, to average net assets 0.94 0.96 2.78 2.87 
 __________ 
 (1) Ratio data may be rounded in order to recompute the ending ratio of net operating expenses to average net assets or net operating expenses, excluding certain expenses, to average net assets. 
 The decrease in expenses during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 can primarily be attributed to a decrease in subordinated income incentive fees and management fees as a result of the lower asset base and lower investment income as discussed above. 
 Incentive fees and interest expense, among other things, may increase or decrease our expense ratios relative to comparative periods depending on portfolio performance and changes in amounts outstanding under our financing arrangements and benchmark interest rates such as SOFR, among other factors. 
 Net Investment Income 
 Our net investment income totaled 215 0.77 per share) and 234 0.84 per share) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our net investment income totaled 642 2.29 per share) and 692 2.47 per share) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 The decrease in net investment income during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 can primarily be attributed to lower investment income during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as discussed above. 
 Net Realized Gains or Losses 
 Our net realized gains (losses) on investments, foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows:

 Net Change in Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) 
 Our net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments, foreign forward currency forward contracts and unrealized gain (loss) on foreign currency for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments 22 79 160 237 Net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on foreign currency forward contracts (6) (19) (3) Net change in unrealized gain (loss) on foreign currency (27) 14 (10) 7 Total net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) (11) 93 131 241 
 The net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was driven primarily by depreciation on several specific assets in the portfolio along with the conversion of unrealized depreciation to realized losses during the quarter. The net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was driven primarily by depreciation on several specific assets in the portfolio, partially offset by appreciation on several assets in the portfolio. 
 Net Increase (Decrease) in Net Assets Resulting from Operations 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the net increase in net assets resulting from operations was 160 0.57 per share) compared to a net increase in net assets resulting from operations of 265 0.95 per share) during the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the net increase in net assets resulting from operations was 438 1.56 per share) compared to a net increase in net assets resulting from operations of 606 2.16 per share) during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Overview 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 371 in cash, cash equivalents and foreign currency, which we or our wholly-owned financing subsidiaries held in custodial accounts, and 3,537 in borrowings available under our financing arrangements, subject to borrowing base and other limitations. As of September 30, 2024, we also held broadly syndicated investments and opportunistic investments that we believe could be sold to create additional liquidity. As of September 30, 2024, we had unfunded debt investments with aggregate unfunded commitments of 1,600.5, unfunded equity/other commitments of 533.8 and unfunded commitments of 735.2 of COPJV. We maintain sufficient cash on hand, available borrowings and liquid securities to fund such unfunded commitments should the need arise. 
 We currently generate cash primarily from cash flows from fees, interest and dividends earned from our investments, as well as principal repayments and proceeds from sales of our investments. To seek to enhance our returns, we also employ leverage as market conditions permit and at the discretion of the Adviser, but in no event will leverage employed exceed the maximum amount permitted by the 1940 Act. Prior to June 14, 2019, in accordance with the 1940 Act, we were allowed to borrow amounts such that our asset coverage, calculated pursuant to the 1940 Act, was at least 200 after such borrowing. Effective June 15, 2019, our asset coverage requirement applicable to senior securities was reduced from 200 to 150 . As of September 30, 2024, the aggregate amount outstanding of the senior securities issued by us was 8.1 billion. As of September 30, 2024, our asset coverage was 183 . See Financing Arrangements. 
 Prior to investing in securities of portfolio companies, we invest the cash received from fees, interest and dividends earned from our investments and principal repayments and proceeds from sales of our investments primarily in cash, cash equivalents, including money market funds, U.S. government securities, repurchase agreements and high-quality debt instruments maturing in one year or less from the time of investment, consistent with our BDC election and our election to be taxed as a RIC.

 RIC Status and Distributions 
 We have elected to be subject to tax as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. In order to qualify for RIC tax treatment, we must, among other things, make distributions of an amount at least equal to 90 of our investment company taxable income, determined without regard to any deduction for distributions paid, each tax year. As long as the distributions are declared by the later of the fifteenth day of the tenth month following the close of a tax year or the due date of the tax return for such tax year, including extensions, distributions paid up to twelve months after the current tax year can be carried back to the prior tax year for determining the distributions paid in such tax year. We intend to make sufficient distributions to our stockholders to qualify for and maintain our 
 83 

Table of Contents 

 RIC tax status each tax year. We are also subject to a 4 nondeductible federal excise tax on certain undistributed income unless we make distributions in a timely manner to our stockholders generally of an amount at least equal to the sum of (1) 98 of our net ordinary income (taking into account certain deferrals and elections) for the calendar year, (2) 98.2 of our capital gain net income, which is the excess of capital gains in excess of capital losses, or capital gain net income (adjusted for certain ordinary losses), for the one-year period ending October 31 of that calendar year and (3) any net ordinary income and capital gain net income for the preceding years that were not distributed during such years and on which we paid no U.S. federal income tax. Any distribution declared by us during October, November or December of any calendar year, payable to stockholders of record on a specified date in such a month and actually paid during January of the following calendar year, will be treated as if it had been paid by us, as well as received by our stockholders, on December 31 of the calendar year in which the distribution was declared. We can offer no assurance that we will achieve results that will permit us to pay any cash distributions. If we issue senior securities, we will be prohibited from making distributions if doing so causes us to fail to maintain the asset coverage ratios stipulated by the 1940 Act or if distributions are limited by the terms of any of our borrowings . 
 Subject to applicable legal restrictions and the sole discretion of our board of directors, we intend to authorize, declare and pay regular cash distributions on a quarterly basis. We will calculate each stockholder s specific distribution amount for the period using record and declaration dates and each stockholder s distributions will begin to accrue on the date that shares of our common stock are issued to such stockholder. From time to time, we may als o pay special interim distributions in the form of cash or shares of our common stock at the discretion of our board of directors. 
 During certain periods, our distributions may exceed our earnings. As a result, it is possible that a portion of the distributions we make may represent a return of capital. A return of capital generally is a return of a stockholder s investment rather than a return of earnings or gains derived from our investment activities. Each year a statement on Form 1099-DIV identifying the sources of the distributions will be mailed to our stockholders. No portion of the distributions paid during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023 represented a return of capital. 
 We intend to make our regular distributions in the form of cash, out of assets legally available for distribution, except for those stockholders who receive their distributions in the form of shares of our common stock under the DRP. Any distributions reinvested under the plan will nevertheless remain taxable to a U.S. stockholder. 
 The following tables reflect the distributions per share that we have declared on our common stock during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our financial statements are prepared in conformity with GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Management has utilized available information, including our past history, industry standards and the current economic environment, among other factors, in forming the estimates and judgments, giving due consideration to materiality. Actual results may differ from these estimates. In addition, other companies may utilize different estimates, which may impact the comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses. Understanding our accounting policies and the extent to which we use management judgment and estimates in applying these policies is integral to understanding our financial statements. We describe our most significant accounting policies in Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our consolidated financial statements. Critical accounting policies are those that require the application of management s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often because of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods. We evaluate our critical accounting estimates and judgments required by our policies on an ongoing basis and update them as necessary based on changing conditions. We have identified one of our accounting policies, valuation of portfolio investments, specifically the valuation of Level 3 investments, as critical because it involves significant judgments and assumptions about highly complex and inherently uncertain matters, and the use of reasonably different estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on our reported results of operations or financial condition. As we execute our operating plans, we will describe additional critical accounting policies in the notes to our future financial statements in addition to those discussed below. 
 Valuation of Portfolio Investments 
 Our board of directors is responsible for overseeing the valuation of our portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith pursuant to the Adviser s valuation policy. As permitted by Rule 2a-5 of the 1940 Act, our board of directors has designated the Adviser as our valuation designee with day-to-day responsibility for implementing the portfolio valuation process set forth in the Adviser s valuation policy. 
 Accounting Standards Codification Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure , or ASC Topic 820, issued by the FASB clarifies the definition of fair value and requires companies to expand their disclosure about the use of fair value to measure assets and liabilities in interim and annual periods subsequent to initial recognition. ASC Topic 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. ASC Topic 820 also establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. These tiers include: Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical securities; Level 2, which includes inputs such as quoted prices for similar securities in active markets and quoted prices for identical securities where there is little or no activity in the market; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions. 
 The Adviser determines the fair value of our investment portfolio each quarter. Securities that are publicly-traded with readily available market prices will be valued at the reported closing price on the valuation date. Securities that are not publicly-traded with readily available market prices will be valued at fair value as determined in good faith by the Adviser. In connection with that determination, the Adviser will prepare portfolio company valuations which are based on relevant inputs, including, but not limited to, indicative dealer quotes, values of like securities, recent portfolio company financial statements and forecasts, and valuations prepared by independent third-party pricing and valuation services. 
 With respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, we undertake a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below: 
 our quarterly fair valuation process begins by the Adviser facilitating the delivery of updated quarterly financial and other information relating to each investment to an independent third-party pricing or valuation service; 
 the independent third-party pricing or valuation service then reviews and analyzes the information, along with relevant market and economic data, and determines proposed valuations for each portfolio company or investment according to the valuation methodologies in the Adviser s valuation policy and communicates the information to the Adviser in the form of a valuation range for Level 3 assets; 
 85 

Table of Contents 

 the Adviser then reviews the preliminary valuation information for each portfolio company or investment and provides feedback about the accuracy, completeness and timeliness of the valuation-related inputs considered by the independent third-party pricing or valuation service and any suggested revisions thereto prior to the independent third-party pricing or valuation service finalizing its valuation range; 
 the Adviser then provides the valuation committee with its valuation determinations and valuation-related information for each portfolio company or investment, along with any applicable supporting materials; and other information that is relevant to the fair valuation process as required by the Adviser s board reporting obligations; 
 the valuation committee meets with the Adviser to receive the relevant quarterly reporting from the Adviser and to discuss any questions from the valuation committee in connection with the valuation committee's role in overseeing the fair valuation process; and 
 following the completion of its fair value oversight activities, the valuation committee (with the assistance of the Adviser) provides our board of directors with a report regarding the quarterly valuation process. 
 In circumstances where the Adviser deems appropriate, the Adviser s internal valuation team values certain investments. When performing the internal valuations, the Adviser utilizes similar valuation techniques as an independent third-party pricing service would use. Such valuations are approved by an internal valuation committee of the Adviser, as well as the valuation committee of the board of directors, as described above. 
 Determination of fair value involves subjective judgments and estimates. Accordingly, the notes to our consolidated financial statements refer to the uncertainty with respect to the possible effect of such valuations and any change in such valuations on our consolidated financial statements. In making its determination of fair value, the Adviser may use any independent third-party pricing or valuation services for which it has performed the appropriate level of due diligence. However, the Adviser is not required to determine fair value in accordance with the valuation provided by any single source, and may use any relevant data, including information sourced by the Adviser or provided by any independent third-party valuation or pricing service that the Adviser deems to be reliable in determining fair value under the circumstances. Below is a description of factors that the Adviser and any independent third-party valuation services may consider when determining the fair value of our investments. 
 The valuation methods utilized for each portfolio company may vary depending on industry and company-specific considerations. Typically, the first step is to make an assessment as to the enterprise value of the portfolio company's business in order to establish whether the portfolio company's enterprise value is greater than the amount of its debt as of the valuation date. This analysis helps to determine a risk profile for the applicable portfolio company and its related investments, and the appropriate valuation methodology to utilize as part of the security valuation analysis. The enterprise valuation may be determined using a market or income approach. 
 Valuation of fixed income investments, such as loans and debt securities, depends upon a number of factors, including prevailing interest rates for like securities, expected volatility in future interest rates, call features, put features and other relevant terms of the debt. For investments without readily available market prices, the Adviser may incorporate these factors into discounted cash flow models to arrive at fair value. Various methods may be used to determine the appropriate discount rate in a discounted cash flow model. 
 Other factors that may be considered include the borrower s ability to adequately service its debt, the fair market value of the borrower in relation to the face amount of its outstanding debt and the quality of collateral securing the debt investments. 
 For convertible debt securities, fair value generally approximates the fair value of the debt plus the fair value of an option to purchase the underlying security (i.e., the security into which the debt may convert) at the conversion price. To value such an option, a standard option pricing model may be used. 
 Our equity interests in portfolio companies for which there is no liquid public market are valued at fair value. Generally, the value of our equity interests in public companies for which market quotations are readily available is based upon the most recent closing public market price. 
 When we receive warrants or other equity securities at nominal or no additional cost in connection with an investment in a debt security, the cost basis in the investment will be allocated between the debt securities and any such warrants or other equity securities received at the time of origination. The Adviser subsequently values these warrants or other equity securities received at their fair value. 
 See Note 8 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information regarding the fair value of our financial instruments.

 Contractual Obligations 
 We have entered into agreements with the Adviser to provide us with investment advisory and administrative services. Payments for investment advisory services under the investment advisory agreement are equal to (a) an annual base management fee based on the average weekly value of our gross assets (excluding cash and cash equivalents) and (b) an incentive fee based on our performance. The Adviser is reimbursed for administrative expenses incurred on our behalf. See Note 4 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included herein for a discussion of these agreements and for the amount of fees and expenses accrued under these agreements during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We currently have no off-balance sheet arrangements, including any risk management of commodity pricing or other hedging practices. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We are subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates. As of September 30, 2024, 68.6 of our portfolio investments (based on fair value) were debt investments paying variable interest rates and 8.2 were debt investments paying fixed interest rates while 15.8 were other income producing investments, 5.7 consisted of non-income producing investments, and the remaining 1.7 consisted of investments on non-accrual status. A rise in the general level of interest rates can be expected to lead to higher interest rates applicable to any variable rate investments we hold and to declines in the value of any fixed rate investments we hold. However, many of our variable rate investments provide for an interest rate floor, which may prevent our interest income from increasing until benchmark interest rates increase beyond a threshold amount. To the extent that a substantial portion of our investments may be in variable rate investments, an increase in interest rates beyond this threshold would make it easier for us to meet or exceed the hurdle rate applicable to the subordinated incentive fee on income, and may result in a substantial increase in our net investment income and to the amount of incentive fees payable to the Adviser with respect to our increased pre-incentive fee net investment income. 
 Pursuant to the terms of the Ambler Credit Facility, CCT Tokyo Funding Credit Facility, Darby Creek Credit Facility, Meadowbrook Run Credit Facility, Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility and the CLO-1 Notes, we borrow at a floating rate based on a benchmark interest rate. Under the indentures governing the 1.650 notes, the 4.125 notes, the 4.250 notes, the 8.625 notes, the 3.400 notes, the 2.625 notes, the 3.250 notes, the 3.125 notes, the 7.875 notes and the 6.875 notes, we pay interest to the holders of such notes at a fixed rate. To the extent that any present or future credit facilities or other financing arrangements that we or any of our subsidiaries enter into are based on a floating interest rate, we will be subject to risks relating to changes in market interest rates. In periods of rising interest rates when we or our subsidiaries have such debt outstanding, or financing arrangements in effect, our interest expense would increase, which could reduce our net investment income, especially to the extent we hold fixed rate investments. To hedge the risks associated with a changing interest rate environment, the Company utilizes interest rate swap strategies. For more information on the Company s swap strategies, please see Note 2 and Note 7.

 The following table shows the effect over a twelve month period of changes in interest rates on our interest income, interest expense and net interest income, assuming no changes in the composition of our investment portfolio, including the accrual status of our investments, and our financing arrangements in effect as of September 30, 2024 (dollar amounts are presented in millions):

 (2) Assumes current debt outstanding as of September 30, 2024, and no changes over the next twelve months. Includes the affect of interest rate swaps designed as hedging instruments. 
 We expect that our long-term investments will be financed primarily with equity and debt. If deemed prudent, we may use interest rate risk management techniques in an effort to minimize our exposure to interest rate fluctuations. These techniques may include various interest rate hedging activities to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act. Adverse developments resulting from changes in interest rates or hedging transactions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Foreign Currency Risk 
 From time to time, we may make investments that are denominated in a foreign currency that are subject to the effects of exchange rate movements between the foreign currency of each such investment and the U.S. dollar, which may affect future fair values and cash flows, as well as amounts translated into U.S. dollars for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements. 
 The table below presents the effect that a 10 immediate, unfavorable change in the foreign currency exchange rates (i.e. strengthening of the U.S. dollar) would have on the fair value of our investments denominated in foreign currencies as of September 30, 2024, by foreign currency, all other valuation assumptions remaining constant. In addition, the table below presents the par value of our investments denominated in foreign currencies and the notional amount of foreign currency forward contracts in local currency in place as of September 30, 2024 to hedge against foreign currency risks.

 As illustrated in the table above, we use derivative instruments from time to time, including foreign currency forward contracts and cross currency swaps, to manage the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. In addition, we have the ability to borrow in foreign currencies under our Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility, which provides a natural hedge with regard to changes in exchange rates between the foreign currencies and U.S. dollar and reduces our exposure to foreign exchange rate

 differences. We are typically a net receiver of these foreign currencies as related for our international investment positions, and, as a result, our investments denominated in foreign currencies, to the extent not hedged, benefit from a weaker U.S. dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger U.S. dollar. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the net contractual amount of our foreign currency forward contracts totaled 143.1, all of which related to hedging of our foreign currency denominated debt investments. As of September 30, 2024, we had outstanding borrowings denominated in foreign currencies of 464, CAD3 and 146 under our Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility. 
 In addition, we may have risk regarding portfolio valuation. See Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies Valuation of Portfolio Investments.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 As required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. 
 Based on the foregoing, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that we would meet our disclosure obligations. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the three month period ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 Share Repurchase Program 
 In November 2020, the Company s board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program, which went into effect in September 2021, or the Share Repurchase Program. Under the Share Repurchase Program originally approved by the Company's board of directors, the Company was permitted to repurchase up to 100 in the aggregate of its outstanding common stock in the open market at prices below the then-current net asset value per share. On September 15, 2022, the program expired and was terminated pursuant to the terms of the program. On October 31, 2022, the board of directors approved a renewal of the Share Repurchase Program. The program provided for aggregate purchases of the Company s common stock in amounts up to 54, which was the aggregate amount remaining of the 100 amount originally approved by the board of directors. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company repurchased 1,665,317 shares of common stock pursuant to the Share Repurchase Program at an average price per share (inclusive of commissions paid) of 18.89 (totaling 32).
