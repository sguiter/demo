units (the Units and, with respect to the shares of common stock included in the Units sold, the Public Shares ), generating gross proceeds of , which is described in Note 3 . 
 
 Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company consummated the sale of warrants (the Private Placement Warrants at a price of per Private Placement Warrant in a private placement to Breeze Sponsor, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the Sponsor and I-Bankers Securities, Inc, generating gross proceeds of , which is described in Note 4 . 
 
 Following the closing of the Initial Public Offering on November 25, 2020, an amount of per Unit) from the net proceeds of the sale of the Units in the Initial Public Offering and from the sale of the Private Placement Warrants was placed in a trust account (the Trust Account and invested in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2 (a)( 16 of the Investment Company Act, with a maturity of 185 days or less or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund selected by the Company meeting the conditions of Rule 2 a- 7 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 , as amended (the Investment Company Act ), as determined by the Company, until the earlier of: (i) the completion of a Business Combination or (ii) the distribution of the Trust Account to the Company s stockholders, as described below. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 all funds in the trust account were held in cash in an interest-bearing account. 
 
 Transaction costs incurred in connection with the Initial Public Offering amounted to , consisting of of underwriting fees, of representative share offering costs, and of other offering costs. As of September 30, 2024 , cash of was held outside of the Trust Account and was available for working capital purposes. 
 
 The Company s management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating a Business Combination. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to complete a Business Combination successfully. The Company must complete an initial Business Combination having an aggregate fair market value of at least of the assets held in the Trust Account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable) at the time of the agreement to enter into the initial Business Combination. The Company will only complete a Business Combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 , as amended (the Investment Company Act ). 
 
 The Company will provide its stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of a Business Combination either (i) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the Business Combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether the Company will seek stockholder approval of a Business Combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by the Company, solely in its discretion. The stockholders will be entitled to redeem their shares for a pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account (initially per share), plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay its tax obligations. The per-share amount to be distributed to stockholders who redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions the Company will pay to the underwriters (as discussed in Note 6 ). There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of a Business Combination with respect to the Company s warrants. 

The Company will proceed with a Business Combination only if the Company has net tangible assets of at least upon such consummation of a Business Combination and, if the Company seeks stockholder approval, a majority of the outstanding shares voted are voted in favor of the Business Combination. If a stockholder vote is not required and the Company does not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other legal reasons, the Company will, pursuant to its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC and file tender offer documents containing substantially the same information as would be included in a proxy statement with the SEC prior to completing a Business Combination. If the Company seeks stockholder approval in connection with a Business Combination, the Company s Sponsor has agreed to vote its Founder Shares (as defined in Note 5 and any Public Shares purchased by it during or after the Initial Public Offering in favor of approving a Business Combination. Additionally, each public stockholder may elect to redeem their Public Shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against a Business Combination. 
 
 If the Company seeks stockholder approval of a Business Combination and it does not conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, the Company s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a group (as defined under Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 , as amended (the Exchange Act )), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to or more of the Public Shares, without the Company s prior written consent. 
 
 The Sponsor has agreed (a) to waive its redemption rights with respect to any Founder Shares and Public Shares held by it in connection with the completion of a Business Combination, (b) to waive its liquidation rights with respect to the Founder Shares and (c) not to propose an amendment to the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (i) to modify the substance or timing of the Company s obligation to allow redemption in connection with the Company s initial Business Combination or to redeem of its Public Shares if the Company does not complete a Business Combination or (ii) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders rights or pre-initial business combination activity, unless the Company provides the public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their Public Shares in conjunction with any such amendment. However, if the Sponsor acquires Public Shares in or after the Initial Public Offering, such Public Shares will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the approved time period through December 26, 2024, (the "Combination Period"). 

The Company held a meeting of its stockholders on March 22, 2023 where the Company s stockholders approved (i) a proposal to amend the Company s A R COI to authorize the Company to extend the date of March 26, 2023, up to six 6 times for an additional one 1 month each time (ultimately until as late as September 26, 2023), and (ii) a proposal to amend the Trust Agreement to authorize the Extension and its implementation by the Company. 
 
 The Company held a meeting of its stockholders on September 22, 2023 where the Company s stockholders approved (i) a proposal to amend the Company s A R COI to authorize the Company to extend the date of September 26, 2023, up to nine 9 times for an additional one 1 month each time (ultimately until as late as June 26, 2024), and (ii) a proposal to amend the Trust Agreement to authorize the Extension and its implementation by the Company. On September 27, 2023, October 25, 2023, November 27, 2023, December 27, 2023, January 26, 2024, February 27, 2024, March 26, 2024, May 7, 2024 and June 3, 2024 Breeze executed the thirteenth, fourteenth, fifteenth, sixteenth, seventeenth, eighteenth, nineteenth, twentieth and twenty -first one -month extensions through June 26, 2024. 
 
 The Company held a meeting of its stockholders on June 21, 2024 where the Company s stockholders approved (i) a proposal to amend the Company s A R COI to authorize the Company to extend the date of December 26, 2024, up to six 6 times for an additional one 1 month each time (ultimately until as late as December 26, 2024), and (ii) a proposal to amend the Trust Agreement to authorize the Extension and its implementation by the Company. On June 26, 2024 and August 1, 2024, Breeze executed the twenty -second and twenty -third extensions, and on November 22, 2024, Breeze executed (including accrued interest) the twenty -fourth, twenty -fifth and twenty -sixth one -month extensions for the period from September 26, 2024 through November 26, 2024. On November 29, 2024, the Company filed a definitive proxy statement to hold a meeting of its stockholders on December 23, 2024 to approve (i) a proposal to amend the Company s A R COI to authorize the Company, and (ii) a proposal to amend the Trust Agreement to authorize and implement by the Company, an extension in one -month intervals up to June 26, 2025. 
 
 If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period, the Company will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay its tax obligations (less up to of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the Company s remaining stockholders and the Company s board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to the Company s obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to the Company s warrants, which will expire worthless if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. 
 
 In order to protect the amounts held in the Trust Account, the Sponsor has agreed to be liable to the Company if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below 1 per Public Share or 2 the actual amount per Public Share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the interest which may be withdrawn to pay our taxes. This liability will not apply with respect to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the Trust Account and will not apply to any claims under the Company s indemnity of the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933 , as amended (the Securities Act ). Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, the Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. The Company will seek to reduce the possibility that the Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (except the Company s independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses or other entities with which the Company does business, execute agreements with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account. 

On October 31, 2022, Breeze entered into the Original Merger Agreement, by and among Breeze, BH Velocity Merger Sub, Inc. Company Merger Sub ), and TV Ammo, Inc., an advanced technology manufacturing and licensing company focused on revolutionizing the global ammunition and weapons industry through the introduction of its composite-cased ammunition, innovative weapons systems and advanced manufacturing technology TV Ammo ).

("True Velocity"), Breeze Merger Sub, Inc. ("Parent Merger Sub"), Company Merger Sub, and TV Ammo, which amended and restated the Original Merger Agreement in its entirety. 
 
 On August 5, 2024, the A R Merger Agreement was terminated by written notice from TV Ammo. As a result of the termination, the Company is no longer pursuing a business Combination with TV Ammo. 
 
 On May 24, 2024, the Company received written notice (the Notice Letter from the Panel indicating that the Panel had determined to delist our securities from The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC Nasdaq and that trading in our securities would be suspended at the open of trading on May 29, 2024, due to our failure to satisfy the terms of the Panel s Decision. Pursuant to the terms of the Decision, amongst other things, we were required to close our initial business combination, with the new entity demonstrating compliance with the initial listing criteria set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5500 on or before May 28, 2024. On May 24, 2024, we notified the Panel that we would not be able to close our initial business combination by the Panel s May 28, 2024 deadline. Accordingly, the Panel determined to delist our securities from Nasdaq as set forth in the Notice Letter. 
 On August 21, 2024, the Company's common stock, rights and warrants began trading on the OTCQX Best Market. 
 On September 24, 2024, Breeze Holdings Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation Breeze or "Parent"), entered into a Merger Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (the Merger Agreement ), by and among (i) Breeze, (ii) a Cayman Islands exempted company and wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent named YD Bio Limited, (f/k/a True Velocity, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Breeze) which name was changed YD Bio Limited on November 18, 2024, which will enter into a joinder to the Merger Agreement Pubco ), (iii) Breeze Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and which is a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of Pubco Parent Merger Sub ), (iv) a Cayman Islands exempted company which will be a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pubco, expected to be named BH Biopharma Merger Sub Limited, and once formed, will enter into a joinder to the Merger Agreement Company Merger Sub, with Company Merger Sub and Parent Merger Sub together referred to herein as the Merger Subs ), and (v) YD Biopharma Limited, a Cayman Islands exempted company YD Biopharma ). YD Biopharma is the operating company of the target. Capitalized terms used herein and not defined shall have the meaning attributed to them in the Merger Agreement. 

 Going Concern 

As of September 30, 2024 , the Company had in cash held outside of the Trust Account and negative working capital of , excluding prepaid income taxes, prepaid franchise taxes and excise tax payable. 
 
 The Company s liquidity needs prior to the consummation of the Initial Public Offering were satisfied through proceeds of from the sale of the Founder Shares, and a loan of under an unsecured and non-interest bearing promissory note (see Note 5 ). Subsequent to the consummation of the Initial Public Offering, the Company s liquidity needs have been satisfied from the net proceeds from the private placement held outside of the Trust Account. 
 
 The Company has incurred and expects to continue to incur significant costs in pursuit of its acquisition plans. I n order to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination, the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor, or certain of the Company s officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds as may be required Working Capital Loans ). There is no assurance that the Company s plans to consummate a business combination or obtain Working Capital Loans will be successful or successful within the Combination Period. 

We believe we will need to raise additional funds in order to meet the expenditures required for operating our business. If our estimate of the costs of identifying a target business, undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating a business combination are less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may have insufficient funds available to operate our business prior to our business combination. Moreover, we may need to obtain additional financing either to complete our business combination or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our public shares upon consummation of our business combination, in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such business combination. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would only complete such financing simultaneously with the completion of our business combination. If we are unable to complete our business combination because we do not have sufficient funds available to us, we will be forced to cease operations and liquidate the trust account. In addition, following our business combination, if cash on hand is insufficient, we may need to obtain additional financing in order to meet our obligations. 
 
 The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are available to be issued. The Company's business plan is dependent on the completion of a business combination and the Company's cash and working capital as of September 30, 2024 are not sufficient to complete its planned activities. If the Company does not complete a business combination within the prescribed timeline, the Company will trigger an automatic winding up, dissolution and liquidation pursuant to the terms of the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 
 Risks and uncertainties 
 
 With rising tensions around the world based on the current conflict between Israel and Hamas and the current conflict between Ukraine and Russia, we may be unable to complete a business combination if concerns related to this and other potential conflicts impact global capital markets, the ability to transfer money, currency exchange rates, cyber attacks and infrastructure including power generation and transmission, communications, and travel. Escalating conflicts could also have an impact on global demands for health care, international trade including vendor supply chains, and energy. In addition, there have been recent threats to infrastructure and equipment including cyber attacks, physical facility destruction and equipment destruction. 
 Our operations and financial performance may also be subject to significant risks arising from geopolitical tensions, particularly in relation to China, South Korea and Taiwan. As a major global economic power, China s political policies, trade practices, and regulatory environment may directly impact our business. Additionally, rising political tensions and potential conflicts in the Asia-Pacific region, such as territorial disputes, trade disagreements, or military confrontations, could disrupt supply chains, increase costs, or adversely affect market demand. These risks are compounded by the potential for government interventions, such as trade restrictions, tariffs, sanctions, export controls or blockades, which may affect our ability to operate or source products from Taiwan and/or other affected regions. Moreover, changes in laws and regulations, including those relating to technology, intellectual property, labor practices, and environmental regulations, may also introduce additional uncertainty and operational challenges.

 On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the Inflation Reduction Act was signed into law, which, among other things, imposes a excise tax on the fair market value of stock repurchased by a domestic corporation beginning in 2023 , with certain exceptions. Because the Company is a Delaware corporation and its securities were traded on the Nasdaq Stock Market, the Company is a covered corporation within the meaning of the Inflation Reduction Act, and while not free from doubt, it is possible that the excise tax will apply to any redemptions of its common stock after December 31, 2022, including redemptions in connection with an initial Business Combination and any amendment to its certificate of incorporation to extend the time to consummate an initial Business Combination, unless an exemption is available. Consequently, the value of an investment in the Company s securities may decrease as a result of the excise tax. In addition, the excise tax may make a transaction with the Company less appealing to potential Business Combination targets, and thus, potentially hinder the Company s ability to enter into and consummate an initial Business Combination. Further, the application of the excise tax in the event of a liquidation is uncertain absent further guidance.

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company recorded excise tax liability of and , respectively, calculated as of shares redeemed. Any reduction to this liability resulting from either a subsequent stock issuance or an event giving rise to an exception that occurs within this tax year, will be recognized in the period (including an interim period) that such stock issuance or event giving rise to an exception occurs.

Public Warrants
and Private Placement Warrants
outstanding. The Company classifies the outstanding Public Warrants and Private
Placement Warrants as warrant liabilities on the balance sheet in accordance
with the guidance contained in ASC 815 - 40 . Under the guidance in ASC 815-40, certain warrants do not meet the
criteria for equity treatment. These warrants include a clause whereby the
warrant holder may be entitled to receive a net cash settlement upon the
acceptance by the holders of the Company s common stock of a tender, exchange
or redemption offer. Upon such a qualifying tender cash offer (an event which
could be outside the control of the Company), all Warrant holders would be
entitled to cash. This factor precludes the Company from applying equity
accounting as the warrant holder could receive a net cash settlement value that
is greater than a holder of the Company s common stock. Accordingly, the
Company has concluded that liability accounting is required. As such, these
warrants are recorded at fair value as of each reporting date with the change
in fair value reported within other income in the accompanying condensed consolidated
statements of operations as Change in fair value of warrant liability until
the warrants are exercised, expired or other facts and circumstances lead the
warrant liability to be reclassified to stockholders equity. The Company
utilized a Modified Black Scholes Model to estimate the fair values of the
warrants, which incorporates significant inputs that are not observable in the
market, and thus represents a Level 3 measurement as defined in ASC 820. The
unobservable inputs utilized for measuring the fair value of the contingent
consideration reflect management s own assumptions about the assumptions that
market participants would use in valuing the contingent consideration. The
Company determined the fair value by using the below key inputs to the Modified
Black Scholes Model. 
 
 Public Warrants may only be exercised for a whole number of shares. fractional shares are issued upon exercise of the Public Warrants. The Public Warrants are exercisable on the later of (a) days after the consummation of a Business Combination or (b) months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering. The Public Warrants will expire from the consummation of a Business Combination or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. 
 
 The Company will not be obligated to deliver any shares of common stock pursuant to the exercise of a warrant and will have no obligation to settle such warrant exercise unless a registration statement under the Securities Act with respect to the shares of common stock underlying the warrants is then effective and a prospectus relating thereto is current, subject to our satisfying our obligations described below with respect to registration. warrant will be exercisable for cash, and the Company will not be obligated to issue any shares to holders seeking to exercise their warrants, unless the issuance of the shares upon such exercise is registered or qualified under the securities laws of the state of the exercising holder, or an exemption is available. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a registration statement covering the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the public warrants is not effective within a specified period following the consummation of our initial business combination, warrant holders may, until such time as there is an effective registration statement and during any period when the Company shall have failed to maintain an effective registration statement, exercise warrants on a cashless basis pursuant to the exemption provided by Section 3 (a)( 9 of the Securities Act, provided that such exemption is available. If that exemption, or another exemption, is not available, holders will not be able to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis. 

The Company has agreed that as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 15 business days, after the closing of our initial business combination, it will use our reasonable best efforts to file, and within 60 business days after the closing of our initial business combination, to have declared effective, a registration statement relating to the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants and to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement, and a current prospectus relating thereto, until the expiration of the warrants in accordance with the provisions of the warrant agreement. Notwithstanding the above, if our common stock is at the time of any exercise of a warrant not listed on a national securities exchange such that it satisfies the definition of a covered security under Section 18 (b)( 1 of the Securities Act, the company may, at its option, require holders of public warrants who exercise their warrants to do so on a cashless basis in accordance with Section 3 (a)( 9 of the Securities Act and, in the event the company so elect, it will not be required to file or maintain in effect a registration statement, but will use its best efforts to qualify the shares under applicable blue sky laws to the extent an exemption is not available. 
 
 Once the warrants become exercisable, the company may call the warrants for redemption: 

in whole and not in part; 

at a price of per warrant; 

upon not less than days prior written notice of redemption (the 30 -day redemption period to each warrant holder; and 

if, and only if, the reported last sale price of the common stock equals or exceeds per share for any trading days within a -trading day period ending on the third trading day prior to the date we send to the notice of redemption to the warrant holders. 

The Company may not redeem the warrants when a holder may not exercise such warrants. 
 
 In addition, if (x) the Company issues additional shares of common stock or equity-linked securities for capital raising purposes in connection with the closing of our initial business combination at an issue price or effective issue price of less than per share of common stock (with such issue price or effective issue price to be determined in good faith by our board of directors and, in the case of any such issuance to our initial stockholders or their affiliates, without taking into account any founder shares held by our initial stockholders or such affiliates, as applicable, prior to such issuance), (the Newly Issued Price (y) the aggregate gross proceeds from such issuances represent more than of the total equity proceeds, and interest thereon, available for the funding of our initial business combination on the date of the consummation of our initial business combination (net of redemptions), and (z) the volume weighted average trading price of our common stock during the trading day period starting on the trading day after the day on which the company consummates its initial business combination (such price, the Market Value is below per share, the exercise price of the warrants will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to of the higher of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price, and the per share redemption trigger price described above will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to of the higher of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price. 
 
 The warrants may be exercised upon surrender of the warrant certificate on or prior to the expiration date at the offices of the warrant agent, with the exercise form on the reverse side of the warrant certificate completed and executed as indicated, accompanied by full payment of the exercise price (or on a cashless basis, if applicable), by certified or official bank check payable to the company, for the number of warrants being exercised. The warrant holders do not have the rights or privileges of holders of common stock and any voting rights until they exercise their warrants and receive shares of common stock. After the issuance of shares of common stock upon exercise of the warrants, each holder will be entitled to one vote for each share held of record on all matters to be voted on by stockholders. 
 
 No fractional shares will be issued upon exercise of the warrants. If, upon exercise of the warrants, a holder would be entitled to receive a fractional interest in a share, the company will, upon exercise, round down to the nearest whole number of shares of common stock to be issued to the warrant holder. 

T he Private Placement Warrants (including the common stock issuable upon exercise of the Private Placement Warrants) will not be transferable, assignable or salable until days after the completion of the initial Business Combination and they will be non-redeemable so long as they are held by the original holders or their permitted transferees. If the Private Placement Warrants are held by someone other than the original holders or their permitted transferees, the Private Placement Warrants will be redeemable by the Company and exercisable by such holders on the same basis as the Warrants included in the Units being sold in the Initial Public Offering. Otherwise, the Private Placement Warrants have terms and provisions that are substantially identical to those of the Warrants being sold as part of the Units in the Initial Public Offering.

Trust Account pending completion of the Company s initial Business Combination. 

If the Company does not complete a Business Combination, then the proceeds will be part of the liquidating distributions to the public stockholders and the Warrants issued to the Sponsor and I-Bankers Securities will expire worthless. 
 
 The warrant liabilities were initially measured at fair value upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering and subsequently re-measured at each reporting period using a Modified Black-Scholes model.

 Rights Except in cases where the Company is not the surviving company in a Business Combination, each holder of a Right will automatically receive one -twentieth 1/20 of a share of common stock upon consummation of the Business Combination, even if the holder of a Right converted all shares held by him, her or it in connection with the Business Combination or an amendment to the Company s certificate of incorporation with respect to its pre-business combination activities. In the event that the Company will not be the surviving company upon completion of the Business Combination, each holder of a Right will be required to affirmatively convert his, her or its Rights in order to receive the one -twentieth 1 / 20 of a share of common stock underlying each Right upon consummation of the Business Combination. No additional consideration will be required to be paid by a holder of Rights in order to receive his, her or its additional share of common stock upon consummation of the Business Combination. The shares issuable upon exchange of the Rights will be freely tradable (except to the extent held by affiliates of the Company). If the Company enters into a definitive agreement for a Business Combination in which the Company will not be the surviving entity, the definitive agreement will provide for the holders of Rights to receive the same per share consideration the holders of shares of common stock will receive in the transaction on an as-converted into common stock basis. 

The Company will not issue fractional shares in connection with an exchange of Rights. As a result, the holders of the Rights must hold Rights in multiples of 20 in order to receive shares for all of the holders Rights upon closing of a Business Combination. If the Company is unable to complete an initial Business Combination within the required time period and the Company liquidates the funds held in the Trust Account, holders of Rights will not receive any of such funds with respect to their Rights, nor will they receive any distribution from the Company s assets held outside of the Trust Account with respect to such Rights, and the Rights will expire worthless. Additionally, in no event will the Company be required to net cash settle the Rights. 

The following table presents information about the Company s financial assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2023 , and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation inputs the Company utilized to determine such fair value:

The Company utilized a back-solve lattice model for the initial valuation of the Public Warrants. The subsequent measurement of the Public Warrants as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , are classified as Level 1 due to the use of an observable market quote in an active market under the ticker BRZHW and BREZW, respectively. The quoted prices of the Public Warrants were and per warrant as of September 30 , 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively. 
 
 The Company utilizes a Modified Black-Scholes model to value the Private Placement Warrants at each reporting period, with changes in fair value recognized in the condensed consolidated statement of operations. The estimated fair value of the Private Placement warrant liability is determined using Level 3 inputs. Inherent in a binomial options pricing model are assumptions related to expected share-price volatility, expected life, risk-free interest rate and dividend yield. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury zero -coupon yield curve on the grant date for a maturity similar to the expected remaining life of the warrants. The probability of completing the business combination is derived by taking a sample of other special purpose acquisition companies and calculating the implied probability of completion for each company in the sample set. The average and 1 st and 3 rd quartiles of the implied probability of completion then formulates the basis for the probability utilized for the Company in the models. The expected life of the warrants is assumed to be equivalent to their remaining contractual term. The dividend rate is based on the historical rate, which the Company anticipates to remain at zero . 
 
 The aforementioned warrant liabilities are not subject to qualified hedge accounting.

and , and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was - and - respectively. The Company's effective tax rate differs from the statutory income tax rate of primarily due to the recognition of gains or losses from the change in the fair value of warrants, non-deductible transaction costs, and the valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 , respectively. The Company has used a discrete effective tax rate method to calculate taxes for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 . The Company believes that, at this time, the use of the discrete method for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 is more appropriate than the estimated annual effective tax rate method as the estimated annual effective tax rate method is not reliable due to a high degree of uncertainty in estimating annual pre-tax earnings or loss.

 Overview 
 
 We are a blank check company formed under the laws of the State of Delaware on June 11, 2020 for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses. We intend to effectuate our business combination using cash from the proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the private placement warrants, our capital stock, debt or a combination of cash, stock and debt. 
 
 As indicated in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , we had 2 and 4,228 in cash, respectively, and a working capital deficit of 9,819,425 and 7,849,292 , respectively (excluding prepaid income taxes, prepaid franchise taxes and excise tax payable). We expect to continue to incur significant costs in the pursuit of our acquisition plans. We cannot assure you that our plans to complete our initial business combination will be successful. 
 
 Results of Operations 
 
 We have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenues to date. Our only activities from June 11, 2020 (inception) through September 30, 2024 were organizational activities, those necessary to prepare for the Initial Public Offering, described below, and, after our Initial Public Offering, identifying a target company for a business combination. We do not expect to generate any operating revenues until after the completion of our business combination. We generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on marketable securities held in the trust account, and changes in the fair value of warrant liabilities. We incur expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses. 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 , we had a net income of 2,189,744 which consisted of operating costs of 260,084 offset by a gain of 2,302,250 in the fair value of warrant liabilities and interest income of 135,536 on our Trust Account.

 For the three months ended September 30, 2023, we had a net loss of 1,076,594 , which consisted of a loss of 846,250 in the fair value of warrant liabilities, interest income on the Trust Account of 166,547 , partially offset by operating costs of 369,952 and income tax expense of 26,939 . 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we had a net loss of 3,241,155 , which consisted of a loss of 2,031,000 in the fair value of warrant liabilities, and interest income on the Trust Account of 387,058 , partially offset by operating costs of 1,563,416 and income tax expense of 33,797 .

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, we consummated the sale of 5,425,000 private placement warrants to the Sponsor at a price of 1.00 per warrant, generating gross proceeds of 5,425,000 . 
 
 Following the Initial Public Offering, the exercise of the over-allotment option and the sale of the private placement warrants, a total of 116,725,000 was placed in the trust account. We incurred 4,099,907 in transaction costs, including 2,300,000 of underwriting fees, 1,322,350 of representative share offering costs, and 477,557 of other offering costs. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 , we had cash held in an interest-bearing trust account of 10,578,352.

As of September 30, 2024 , we had cash held in the trust account of 10,578,352 , including 476,103 of interest. Interest income on the balance in the trust account may be used by us to pay taxes. On May 10, 2022, 109,000 was withdrawn from the Trust Account for payment of franchise and income taxes, on September 8, 2022, 122,247 was withdrawn from the Trust Account for payment of franchise and income taxes, on September 27, 2023, 209,650 was withdrawn of interest income from the Trust Account for payment of franchise and income taxes, and on June 24, 2024, 59,000 of interest income was withdrawn from the Trust Account for payment of franchise and income taxes. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , cash used in operating activities was 1,243,826 which was due to a net loss of 2,722,429 , a non-cash decrease in fair value of warrant liabilities of 2,302,250 , interest income of 476,103 on the Trust Account, and a decrease in working capital of 600,706 . For the same period cash provided by investing activities was 2,875,279 which was due to an investment of cash in the Trust Account of 265,433 a redemption of common stock of 3,081,712 , and a withdrawal of 59,000 to pay for franchise and income taxe s, and net cash used in financing activities was 1,635,679 which was due to proceeds from working capital loans and a promissory note from Sponsor of 1,180,600 and 265,433 respectively, and a redemption of common stock of 3,081,712 . 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2023 , cash used in operating activities was 1,336,181 which was due to net loss of 3,241,155 , primarily offset by a non-cash increase in fair value of warrant liabilities of 2,031,000 , interest of 387,058 on the Trust Account, and a decrease in working capital of 147,193 . For the same period cash provided by investing activities was 5,429,866 which was due to investment in the Trust Account of 406,790 , a redemption of common stock of 5,627,006 , and net cash used in financing activities was 3,926,133 which was due to proceeds from a related party working capital loan of 1,335,400 and proceeds from a related party promissory note of 365,473 and, a redemption of common stock of 5,627,006 . 
 
 We intend to use substantially all of the funds held in the trust account, including any amounts representing interest earned on the trust account (less deferred underwriting commissions and income taxes payable), to complete our business combination. To the extent that our capital stock or debt is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to complete our business combination, the remaining proceeds held in the trust account will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses, make other acquisitions and pursue our growth strategies. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , the Company had 2 and 4,228 , respectively, in cash held outside the Trust Account and a working capital deficit of 9,819,425 and 7,849,292 , respectively (excluding prepaid income taxes, prepaid franchise taxes and excise tax payable). 
 
 In order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with a business combination, the initial stockholders or their affiliates may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete a business combination, we would repay such loaned amounts. In the event that a business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust account would be used for such repayment. Up to 1,000,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants identical to the private placement warrants, at a price of 1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. However, all working capital promissory notes specifically state that the Sponsor has elected not to covert. The terms of such loans by our officers and directors, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. We do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our Sponsor or an affiliate of our Sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account. 
 
 On November 19, 2021, the Sponsor loaned the Company an aggregate of 1,150,000 pursuant to an unsecured promissory note to extend the date by which the Company has to consummate a business combination from November 25, 2021 to February 25, 2022. This unsecured promissory note is non-interest bearing and payable on the earlier of (i) the consummation of an initial Business Combination, or (ii) December 26, 2024. 
 
 On February 1, 2022, the Company signed a Promissory Note with Sponsor, with a Maturity Date of March 26, 2023, for a total of up to 1,500,000 . On October 1, 2022, the Company signed an Amended Promissory Note with Sponsor, with a Maturity Date of September 26, 2023 for a total of up to 4,000,000 . On April 1, 2023, the Company signed an Amended Promissory Note with Sponsor, with a Maturity Date of September 26, 2023 for a total of up to 5,000,000 . On October 1, 2023, the Company signed an Amended Promissory Note with Sponsor, with a Maturity Date of June 26, 2024 for a total of up to 6,000,000 . On March 1, 2024, the Company signed an Amended Promissory Note with Sponsor, with a Maturity Date of June 26, 2024 for a total of up to 7,000,000 . On July 1, 2024, the Company signed an Amended Promissory Note with Sponsor, with a Maturity Date of December 26, 2024 for a total of up to 7,500,000 . As of September 30, 2024, the amount outstanding under this working capital loan was 5,792,709 for direct working capital, and 989,258 for monthly SPAC extension funds for the months of September 2022 through September 2024 for a total of 6,781,967 from Sponsor. The Promissory Note is non-interest bearing and payable on the earlier of (i) the consummation of an initial Business Combination, or (ii) December 26, 2024. 

27 

On February 18, 2022, the Sponsor loaned the Company an aggregate of 1,150,000 pursuant to an unsecured promissory note to extend the date by which the Company has to consummate a business combination from February 25, 2022 to May 25, 2022. This unsecured promissory note is non-interest bearing and payable on the earlier of (i) the consummation of an initial Business Combination, or (ii) December 26, 2024. 
 
 Going Concern 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 2 in cash held outside of the Trust Account and negative working capital of 9,819,425 , excluding prepaid income taxes, prepaid franchise taxes and excise tax payable. 
 The Company s liquidity needs prior to the consummation of the Initial Public Offering were satisfied through proceeds of 25,000 from the sale of the Founder Shares, and a loan of 300,000 under an unsecured and non-interest bearing promissory note (see Note 5 ). Subsequent to the consummation of the Initial Public Offering, the Company s liquidity needs have been satisfied from the net proceeds from the private placement held outside of the Trust Account. 
 The Company has incurred and expects to continue to incur significant costs in pursuit of its acquisition plans. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of time within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. Management plans to address this uncertainty through a business combination. In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination, the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor, or certain of the Company s officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds as may be required Working Capital Loans ). There is no assurance that the Company s plans to consummate a business combination or obtain Working Capital Loans will be successful or successful within the Combination Period. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 
 We believe we will need to raise additional funds in order to meet the expenditures required for operating our business. If our estimate of the costs of identifying a target business, undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating a business combination are less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may have insufficient funds available to operate our business prior to our business combination. Moreover, we may need to obtain additional financing either to complete our business combination or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our public shares upon consummation of our business combination, in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such business combination. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would only complete such financing simultaneously with the completion of our business combination. If we are unable to complete our business combination because we do not have sufficient funds available to us, we will be forced to cease operations and liquidate the trust account. In addition, following our business combination, if cash on hand is insufficient, we may need to obtain additional financing in order to meet our obligations. 
 The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are available to be issued. The Company's business plan is dependent on the completion of a business combination and the Company's cash and working capital as of September 30, 2024 are not sufficient to complete its planned activities. These conditions raise a substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We base our estimates on our own historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable after taking account of our circumstances and expectations for the future based on available information. We evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. 
 We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if: (i) the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made, and (ii) changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. The critical accounting estimates, assumptions, judgements and the related policies that we believe have the most significant impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements are described below 
 Warrant Liabilities 
 In determining the fair value of the Company s Public Warrants and Private Placement Warrants our third party valuation firm uses the most observable inputs available. The valuation approach for our Public Warrants utilizes a back-solve lattice model and for our Private Placement Warrants uses a Modified Black-Scholes model. Some of the inputs used in the models include the dividend yield on the Company s common stock, expected common stock price volatility, risk-free interest rate, expected business combination date and probability of completing the business combination. Several of these inputs are known and several use judgements. For instance, the probability of completing the business combination is derived by taking a sample of other special purpose acquisition companies and calculating the implied probability of completion for each company in the sample set. The average and 1 st and 3 rd q uartiles of the implied probability of completion then formulates the basis for the probability utilized for the Company in the models. Changes in any or all of these estimates and assumptions, or the relationships between these assumptions, impact the Company s valuation of its Public Warrants and Private Placement Warrants as of each valuation date and may have a material impact on the valuation of these warrants.

Item 3 . Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12 b- 2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information otherwise required under this item. 
 
 Item 4 . Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer, who serves as our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13 a- 15 (e) and 15 d- 15 (e) under the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2024, because of the identified material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting described below. 
 
 During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company determined that it failed to accurately prepare its income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2023. The control deficiencies related to the preparation, reviews and accounting of the Company's income tax provision and related expense represents a material weakness related to financial reporting. 
 
 We do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all our control deficiencies and instances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 During the most recently completed fiscal quarter, there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13 a- 15 (f) and 15 d- 15 (f) under the Exchange Act) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
