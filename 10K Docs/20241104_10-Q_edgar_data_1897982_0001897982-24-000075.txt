 Russia 
 In June 2024, the United States government announced new expanded restrictions that prohibit the sale, service, maintenance, and support (such as bug fixes and updates) of enterprise management software and design and manufacturing software in the Russian market. As a result, the Company announced that it had suspended all commercial activities in Russia in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. This includes the discontinuation of the following activities: all commercial discussions with customers, initiating or processing renewals, providing proposals to customers or selling products or services. In addition, the Company has written-off certain assets that are related to its operations in Russia, and will be closing certain facilities, and terminating or relocating substantially all employees based in Russia during fiscal 2025. 
 Beginning with the consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2024, the Company classifies cash balances that are both held in Russia and in excess of what it estimates will be required to wind down its operations in Russia as restricted cash due to current restrictions impacting the Company s ability to transfer funds from bank accounts located in Russia to other countries. As of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, the restricted cash held in Russia was million and million, respectively, which is included within other non-current assets on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.

 The Company utilizes some aspects of Emerson s centralized treasury function to manage the working capital and financing needs of its business operations. This function oversees a cash pooling arrangement which sweeps certain Company cash accounts into pooled Emerson cash accounts on a daily basis which are reflected as receivables from related parties in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Conversely, any cash funded to the Company from these pooled Emerson cash accounts are reflected as due to related parties in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The aggregate net activity between the Company and Emerson associated with the cash pooling arrangement is reflected within cash flows from financing activities as net transfers from parent within the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. 
 Before the closing of the Transaction, the Industrial Software Business was charged for costs directly attributable to the DGM and SSE businesses and was allocated a portion of Emerson s costs, including general corporate costs, information technology costs, insurance and other benefit costs, and shared service and other costs. All of these costs are reflected in the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements. Management believes the methodologies and assumptions used to allocate these costs are reasonable. 
 At the closing of the Transaction, Emerson and the Company entered into a transition service agreement (the Transition Service Agreement for the provision of certain transitionary services from Emerson to the Company. Pursuant to the Transition Service Agreement, Emerson provides the Company with certain services, including information technology, human resources and other specified services, as well as access to certain of Emerson s existing facilities. Transition Service Agreement related activities have been recorded as cost of goods sold or operating expenses from related parties and resulting balances have been presented as receivable from or due to related parties in the condensed consolidated financial statements. The Transition Services Agreement expires on December 31, 2024. 
 
 In connection with the closing of the Transaction, the Company entered into a registration rights agreement (the Registration Rights Agreement and a tax matters agreement (the Tax Matters Agreement with Emerson. The Registration Rights Agreement grants Emerson certain market registration rights, including demand registration rights and piggyback registration rights, with respect to its registrable securities. The Company has agreed to pay out-of-pocket fees and expenses in connection with such registration, subject to certain exceptions. The Tax Matters Agreement governs the rights and obligations that the Company and Emerson have with respect to taxes of the Company and certain Emerson subsidiaries. In addition, under the terms of the Tax Matters Agreement, the Company agreed to indemnify Emerson and its affiliates against any and all tax-related liabilities incurred by them relating to the Transaction and certain related business reorganizations to the extent such tax-related liabilities are caused by any action taken by the Company.

 Recent Events 
 On August 6, 2024, we announced that our Board of Directors approved the Fiscal 2025 Share Repurchase Authorization, pursuant to which we may repurchase up to an aggregate amount of 100.0 million of our outstanding shares of common stock. During the first quarter of fiscal 2025, we repurchased 92,819 shares for 20.5 million under the Fiscal 2025 Share Repurchase Authorization and the total remaining value under the Fiscal 2025 Share Repurchase Authorization as of September 30, 2024 was 79.5 million. 
 On October 25, 2024, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire OGS, which is a global provider of network model management technology and a pioneer in developing model-driven applications supporting open access to data through industry standards. The Company has agreed to pay 45 million, plus the value of any cash acquired and any necessary net working capital adjustments. The Company currently intends to finance the transaction through cash on hand. The acquisition is expected to close in the second fiscal quarter of 2025, subject to receipt of regulatory approvals. 
 
 Key Business Metrics 
 Background 
 We utilize key business metrics to track and assess the performance of our business. We have identified the following set of appropriate business metrics in the context of our evolving business: 
 Annual contract value ACV 
 Total contract value TCV 
 Bookings 
 We also use the following non-GAAP business metrics in addition to GAAP measures to track our business performance: 
 Free cash flow 
 Non-GAAP operating income 
 We make these measures available to investors and none of these metrics should be considered as an alternative to any measure of financial performance calculated in accordance with GAAP. 
 Annual Contract Value 
 ACV is an estimate of the annual value of our portfolio of term license and software maintenance and support SMS contracts, the annual value of SMS agreements purchased with perpetual licenses, and the annual value of standalone SMS agreements purchased with certain legacy term license agreements, which have become an immaterial part of our business. 
 Comparing ACV for different dates can provide insight into the growth and retention rates of our recurring software business because ACV represents the estimated annual billings associated with our recurring license and SMS agreements at any point in time. Management uses the ACV business metric to evaluate the growth and performance of our business as well as for planning and forecasting purposes. We believe that ACV is a useful business metric to investors as it provides insight into the growth component of our software business. 
 ACV generally increases as a result of new term license and SMS agreements with new or existing customers, renewals or modifications of existing term license agreements that result in higher license fees due to contractually-agreed price escalation or an increase in the number of tokens (units of software usage) or products licensed, or an increase in the value of licenses delivered. 
 ACV is adversely affected by term license and SMS agreements that are renewed at a lower entitlement level or not renewed, a decrease in the value of licenses delivered, and, to a lesser extent, by customer agreements that become inactive during the agreement s term because, in our determination, amounts due (or which will become due) under the agreement are not collectible. As ACV is an estimate of annual billings, it will generally not include contracts with a term of less than one year. Because ACV represents all other active term software and SMS agreements, it may include amounts under agreements with customers that are delinquent in paying invoices, that are in bankruptcy proceedings, and agreements that are subject to termination by the customer or where payment is otherwise in doubt. 
 20 

Table of Contents 

 As of September 30, 2024, customer agreements representing approximately 85.3 of our ACV (by value) were denominated in U.S. dollars. For agreements denominated in other currencies, we use a fixed historical exchange rate to calculate ACV in U.S. dollars rather than using current exchange rates, so that our calculation of growth in ACV is not affected by fluctuations in foreign currencies. 
 For term license agreements that contain professional services or other products and services, we have included the portion of those agreements that are reflective of the relative fair value of the term license, rather than the portion of the actual invoice attributed to the term license, as outlined in the agreement within ACV. We believe that this methodology more accurately allocates any discounts or premiums to the different elements of the agreement. 
 Beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, we suspended all commercial activities in Russia following the announcement of expanded commercial sanctions in the country. Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, we no longer include Russia within ACV for all periods presented. ACV grew by approximately 9.4 , from 860.5 million as of September 30, 2023 to 941.4 million as of September 30, 2024, and by approximately 0.9 from 932.9 million as of June 30, 2024 to 941.4 million as of September 30, 2024. 
 Total Contract Value 
 TCV is the aggregate value of all payments received or to be received under all active term license and SMS agreements, including maintenance and escalation. Our TCV was 4.0 billion as of September 30, 2024, and 3.7 billion as of September 30, 2023. Excluding TCV associated with the Company s Russia business, TCV was 3.6 billion as of September 30, 2023. 
 Bookings 
 Bookings is the total value of customer term license and perpetual license SMS contracts signed and delivered in the current period, less the value of such contracts signed in the current period where the initial licenses and SMS agreements are not yet deemed delivered, plus the customer term license and perpetual license SMS contracts signed in a previous period for which the initial licenses are deemed delivered in the current period. 
 Bookings were 151.4 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 211.8 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The change in bookings is primarily driven by the timing of contract renewals and a higher concentration of attrition. 
 Non-GAAP Business Metrics 
 Free cash flow (non-GAAP) excludes certain non-cash and non-recurring expenses, and is used as a supplement to net cash (used in) provided by operating activities presented on a GAAP basis. We believe that free cash flow (non-GAAP) is a useful financial measure because it permits investors to view our performance using tools that our management uses to gauge progress in achieving goals and as an indication of cash flow that may be available to fund future investments and other capital uses, such as to repay borrowings under our credit facilities or to fund acquisitions or share repurchase authorizations. 
 The following table provides a reconciliation of net cash (used in) provided by operating activities (GAAP) to free cash flow (non-GAAP) for the indicated periods: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (Dollars in Thousands) Net cash (used in) provided by operating activities (GAAP) (4,397) 16,981 Purchase of property, equipment, and leasehold improvements (2,022) (937) Free cash flow (non-GAAP) (6,419) 16,044 
 Non-GAAP income from operations excludes certain non-cash and non-recurring expenses, and is used as a supplement to loss from operations presented on a GAAP basis. We believe that non-GAAP income from operations is a useful financial measure because removing certain non-cash and other items provides additional insight into recurring profitability.

 Revenue 
 Total revenue decreased by 33.4 million, or 13.4 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year, due to a decrease of 47.0 million in license and solutions revenue, partially offset by an increase of 5.7 million in maintenance revenue, and an increase of 7.8 million in services and other revenue. 
 License and Solutions Revenue 
 License and solutions revenue decreased by 47.0 million, or 31.6 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year, primarily due to the timing of renewals and new contracts signed in the same period in the prior fiscal year. 
 Maintenance Revenue 
 Maintenance revenue increased by 5.7 million, or 6.7 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year, primarily due to growth of our base of customer arrangements through both natural renewals of, and amendments to, existing customer arrangements. 
 Services and Other Revenue 
 Services and other revenue increased by 7.8 million, or 50.0 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year, primarily due to increased activities from certain customer contracts where the related professional services revenue is recognized as a distinct performance obligation, and the timing and volume of professional services engagements 
 Cost of Revenue 
 Total cost of revenue decreased by 2.6 million, or 2.7 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year. 
 Cost of License and Solutions Revenue 
 Cost of license and solutions revenue decreased by 7.9 million, or 11.1 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year, primarily due to the business transformation activities in which we began recognizing distinct performance obligations for certain customer contracts effective beginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2023, whereby costs associated with these customer contracts are recognized in cost of services and other revenue. Gross profit margin on license and solutions revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased to 37.4 , from 51.8 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to lower license and solutions revenue in the current period. 
 Cost of Maintenance Revenue 
 Cost of maintenance revenue increased by 0.5 million, or 4.8 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year. Gross profit margin on maintenance revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased to 88.2 , from 88.0 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to higher maintenance revenue. 
 Cost of Services and Other Revenue 
 Cost of services and other revenue increased by 4.8 million, or 29.6 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year, primarily due to the increased activities from customer contracts where the related professional services revenue is recognized as a distinct performance obligation and the corresponding cost is recognized in cost of services and other revenue. Gross profit margin on services and other revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased to 10.3 , from (3.8) for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to higher services and other revenue resulting from better leveraging our costs with increased projects. 
 Gross Profit 
 Overall gross profit decreased by 30.8 million, or 20.4 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year, primarily due to lower licensing and solutions revenue. Gross profit margin during the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased to 55.8 , from 60.7 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in license and solutions revenue compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year, which has a relatively fixed cost base.

 Operating Expenses 
 Selling and Marketing Expense 
 Selling and marketing expense increased by 3.3 million, or 2.7 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year, primarily due to the expansion of our sales capacity in new and existing markets. 
 Research and Development Expense 
 Research and development expense decreased by 3.7 million, or 6.8 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year, primarily due to lower compensation costs of 3.5 million, related to a reduction of salary and stock-based compensation expenses resulting from the reorganization of our corporate structure that was announced in August 2024. See Note 6 Restructuring Costs to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report for further information. 
 General and Administrative Expense 
 General and administrative expense decreased by 2.4 million, or 6.8 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year, primarily due to lower compensation costs of 2.5 million related to lower salary, benefits, bonus, and stock-based compensation expenses resulting from the reorganization of our corporate structure that was announced in August 2024. See Note 6 Restructuring Costs to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report for further information. 
 Restructuring Costs 
 Restructuring costs increased by 7.7 million, or 100.0 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year. This is a result of the reorganization of our corporate structure that was announced in August 2024, which resulted in the elimination of certain roles and our winding down of operations in Russia. 
 Non-Operating (Expense) Income 
 Other Income (Expense), Net 
 Other income (expense), net increased by 7.9 million, or 135.0 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year, primarily due to 7.3 million in unrealized and realized foreign currency exchange gains. 
 Interest Income, Net 
 Interest income, net increased by 3.1 million, or 22.3 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year, primarily due to an increase in interest income earned on long-term revenue contracts of 2.3 million. 
 Benefit for Income Taxes 
 The Company computes its tax benefit for interim periods by applying the estimated annual effective tax rate AETR to year-to-date income from operations and adjusting for discrete items arising in that quarter. However, if the Company is unable to make a reliable estimate of its AETR, then the actual effective tax rate for the year-to-date period may be the best estimate. For both the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 the Company recorded the actual effective tax rate as it was determined that the AETR approach was not the most appropriate estimate. 
 
 Benefit for income taxes was 16.3 million and 17.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, resulting in effective tax rates of 21.2 and 33.6 , respectively. Income tax benefit decreased primarily due to the lower Foreign-Derived Intangible Income FDII deduction taken this year compared to last year resulting from lower taxable income in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2024. The first quarter of fiscal 2024 included a significant temporary item that increased taxable income relating to a change in the methodology for recording revenue for tax purposes on multi-year software licenses. There was no such temporary item in the first quarter of fiscal 2025.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Resources 
 As of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of 221.1 million and 237.0 million, in cash and cash equivalents, respectively. 
 We believe our existing cash on hand and cash flows generated by operations are sufficient for at least the next 12 months to meet our operating requirements, including those related to salaries and wages, working capital, capital expenditures, and other liquidity requirements associated with operations. We may need to raise additional funds if we decide to make one or more acquisitions of businesses, technologies or products. If additional funding for such purposes is required beyond existing resources and our Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement described below, we may not be able to affect a receivable, equity or debt financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. 
 Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement 
 On June 27, 2024, the Company entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association. The Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement has an expiration date of June 27, 2029, and provides for aggregate borrowing commitments of 200.0 million. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with the covenants associated with the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, and, after considering eligible outstanding letters of credit allowable in the aggregate amount of 5.5 million, the Company had 194.5 million available for borrowing. 
 For a more detailed description of the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, see Note 12, Debt to the consolidated and combined financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. 
 Cash Flows 
 Operating Cash Flows 
 Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by 21.4 million during the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in prior fiscal year, primarily driven by one-time charges related to the Company s workforce reduction and Russia exit, as well as the timing of collections in the first quarter of fiscal 2025. 
 Investing Cash Flows 
 Net cash used in investing activities decreased by 19.8 million during the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in prior fiscal year, primarily driven by a decrease of 12.5 million in cash used for asset acquisitions and a decrease of 8.3 million in cash used for business acquisitions. 
 Financing Cash Flows 
 Net cash used in financing activities decreased by 98.9 million during the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in prior fiscal year, primarily driven by a decrease of 93.7 million in cash used for common stock repurchases. 
 Free Cash Flows 
 Free cash flow (non-GAAP) decreased by 22.5 million during the three-month period ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year, primarily driven by the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities.

 Contractual Obligations 
 Letters of Credit 
 Standby letters of credit in the aggregate amounts of 24.5 million and 32.9 million secured our performance on professional services contracts, certain facility leases and potential liabilities as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively. The letters of credit expire at various dates through fiscal 2029. 
 Effects of Inflation 
 We do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our business or operating results during the periods presented. However, inflation may in the future have an impact on our ability to execute on our acquisition strategy. Inflationary costs could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, increased inflation has had, and may continue to have, an effect on interest rates. Increased interest rates may adversely affect our borrowing rate and our ability to obtain, or the terms under which we can obtain, any potential additional funding. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 Foreign Currency Risk 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, 9.9 and 7.1 of our total revenue was denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar, respectively. In addition, certain of our operating costs incurred outside the United States are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We conduct business on a worldwide basis and as a result, a portion of our revenue, earnings, net assets, and net investments in foreign affiliates is exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We measure our net exposure for cash balance positions and for cash inflows and outflows in order to evaluate the need to mitigate our foreign exchange risk. We may enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the impact related to unfavorable exchange rate movements related to our cash positions and cash flows, although we have not done so during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Currently, our largest exposures to foreign exchange rates exist primarily with the Euro, Pound Sterling, Japanese Yen, Indonesian Rupiah, Kuwaiti Dinar, Brazilian Reais, Norwegian Krone, Australian Dollar, and Canadian Dollar. 
 We recorded net foreign currency exchange gains of 2.1 million and losses of 5.9 million, respectively, during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, related to the settlement and remeasurement of transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our operating units. Our analysis of operating results transacted in various foreign currencies indicated that a hypothetical 10 change in foreign currency exchange rates could have increased or decreased our results of operations by approximately 2.9 million and 4.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We place our investments in money market instruments. Our analysis of our investment portfolio and interest rates as of September 30, 2024 indicated that a hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio determined in accordance with an income-based approach utilizing portfolio future cash flows discounted at the appropriate rates.

 Investment Risk 
 We own an interest in a limited partnership investment fund. The primary objective of this partnership is investing in equity and equity-related securities (including convertible debt) of venture growth-stage businesses. We account for the investment in accordance with Topic 323, Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures . Our total commitment under this partnership is 11.8 million Canadian dollars, or 8.7 million U.S. dollars. Under the conditions of the equity method investment, unfavorable future changes in market conditions could lead to a potential loss up to the full value of our 11.8 million Canadian dollars, or 8.7 million U.S. dollars commitment. As of September 30, 2024, the fair value of this investment was 3.3 million Canadian dollars, or 2.5 million U.S. dollars, representing our payment towards the total commitment, and is recorded in non-current assets in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 a) Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Securities Exchange Act means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
 b) Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting 
 There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. We will continue to review and document our disclosure controls and procedures, including our internal control over financial reporting, and may from time to time make changes aimed at enhancing their effectiveness and to ensure that our systems evolve with our business.

 Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 The risks described in Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. These risk factors do not identify all risks that we face our operations could also be affected by factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations. The Risk Factors section in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024 remains current in all material respects, with the exception of the risk factor described below. 
 An escalation of the conflict in the Middle East may have a material adverse impact on our business and operations in the region. 
 We have operations and customers in the Middle East. Since the initial commencement of the Israeli-Hamas conflict, there have been continued hostilities along Israel s northern border with Lebanon (with the Hezbollah terror organization) and on other fronts from various extremist groups in the region, such as the Houthis in Yemen and various rebel militia groups in Syria and Iraq. Israel has carried out a number of targeted strikes on sites belonging to these terror organizations. In October 2024, Israel began limited ground operations against Hezbollah in Lebanon. In addition, Iran recently launched direct attacks on Israel and has threatened to continue to attack Israel. Iran is also believed to have a strong influence among extremist groups in the region, such as Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthis in Yemen and various rebel militia groups in Syria and Iraq. A further escalation of the conflict or an extension of the conflict for a longer period of time could result in additional armed conflict in other regions in the Middle East and elsewhere, terrorist activities, and political or macroeconomic instability in the Middle East region. This, in turn, could cause our customers in the region to reduce their capital expenditures, resulting in a reduction of our sales to such customers. A decline in our sales to our customers in the affected region and any further impact of such conflict or instability on our operations could materially adversely affect our business and operations in the region, and our financial condition and results of operations generally. 
 
 Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds

DEFINITIONS Accrued Amounts means (i) any unpaid base salary accrued by the Participant through the Participant s termination date; (ii) any unpaid annual incentive bonus earned by the Participant for a prior fiscal year; and (iii) any vested employee benefits that the Participant is entitled to receive as of the termination date under any employee benefit plan of the Company or one of its subsidiaries (in accordance with the terms of the plan).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the 

5 Participant has an effective employment agreement with the Company or a subsidiary which contains a Cause definition, that definition will govern for purposes of the Plan. Change in Control has the meaning set forth in the Aspen Technology, Inc. 2022 Omnibus Incentive Plan, as in effect on the Effective Date; provided that, if at any time following the Effective Date, EMR Worldwide, Inc. ceases to be the beneficial owner (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) of 50 or more of either (x) the then-outstanding shares of common stock of the Company or (y) the combined voting power of the then-outstanding securities of the Company entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, then at the time the beneficial ownership falls below either that 50 level, then after that date the following clauses will be deemed to have been deleted from such definition for purposes of this Plan: (1) clause (D) of Section 15.3.2(i), the proviso to Section 15.3.2(ii) and (3) clause (B) of Section 15.3.2(iii).

Good Reason means the occurrence of any of the following without the prior written consent of the Participant: (a) a reduction in the Participant s annual base salary or annual cash bonus opportunity as in effect on the Effective Date or, if later, the date upon which the Participant is selected as a Participant (and as Participant s base salary may be increased from time to time), other than pursuant to an across-the-board reduction in base salary for all similarly-situated executives of the Company and its affiliates; (b) a change by the Company to the Participant s primary work location to a new location that is more than 50 miles away from Participant s primary work location immediately prior to the change; or (c) a material reduction in the Participant s authority, duties or responsibilities as of immediately before the Effective Date or, if later, the date upon which the Participant is selected as a Participant (and as Participant s authority, duties or responsibilities may be increased from time to time); provided however, that following a Control Event, Good Reason does not exist if the Participant is employed by the Company with substantially the same authority, duty and responsibilities with respect to the Company s business that participant had immediately prior to the Effective Date (or, if later, the date upon which the Participant is selected as a Participant (and as Participant s authority, duties or responsibilities may be increased from time to time)) and shall not be deemed to exist solely because the Participant s title or reporting relationship is revised to reflect the Participant s placement, solely by virtue of a Control Event, within the overall corporate hierarchy of the post-transaction entity. 

6 Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Participant has an effective employment agreement with the Company or a subsidiary which contains a Good Reason definition, that definition will govern for purposes of the Plan.

SECTION 280G If it is determined that any payment or benefit provided to the Participant or for the Participant s benefit (whether or not paid under this Plan) (the Total Payments would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code, (the Excise Tax ), then the Total Payments payable under this Plan will be reduced to the highest amount which would not be subject to the Excise Tax, but only if the reduction would result in the Participant keeping a larger amount, on an after-tax basis (accounting for federal, state and local income taxes and the imposition of the Excise Tax), than if the Participant received all of the Total Payments. Any reduction will be effected in a manner which is intended to comply with any applicable requirements under Section 409A of the Code. NOTICES All notices, instructions and other communications related to the Plan will be in writing. Any notice, instruction or communication will be sent either (i) by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, or (ii) prepaid via a reputable nationwide overnight courier service, in each case addressed to the Company, at Aspen Technology, Inc.; ATTN: Secretary (or, if the Participant is the Secretary, to the attention of the President); 20 Crosby Drive, Bedford MA 01730, and to the Participant at the address the Company has on file for the Participant.

After a Change in Control has occurred, the Company will pay as incurred all legal, accounting and other fees and expenses which the Participant may reasonably incur as a result of any claim or contest (regardless of the outcome thereof) by the Company, the Participant or others regarding the validity or enforceability of, or liability under, any provision of this Plan. ADMINISTRATION The Board has the authority to administer and interpret the Plan.

AMENDMENT; TERMINATION The Plan may be amended or terminated by the Board at any time; provided, however, that the Plan may not be amended or terminated during the 12 months immediately after a Change in Control or Control Event. TAX MATTERS Withholding. The Company will have the right to withhold from any amount payable under the Plan any Federal, state and local taxes in order for the Company to satisfy any withholding tax obligation it may have under any applicable law or regulation. Section 409A. The intent of the parties is that payments and benefits under this Plan be exempt from, or comply with, Section 409A of the Code, and accordingly, to the maximum extent permitted, this Plan will be interpreted and administered to be in accordance with Section 409A. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Plan to the contrary, the Participant will not be considered to have terminated employment with the Company for purposes of any payments under this Plan which are subject to Section 409A of the Code until the Participant would be considered to have has a separation from service from the Company within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code. Each amount to be paid or benefit to be provided under this Plan will be construed as a separate payment for purposes of Section 409A of the Code, and any payments described in this Plan that are due within the short term deferral period as defined in Section 409A of the Code will not be treated as deferred compensation unless applicable law requires otherwise. Without limiting the 

8 foregoing and notwithstanding anything contained in this Plan to the contrary, if needed in order to avoid accelerated taxation and/or tax penalties under Section 409A of the Code, amounts that would otherwise be payable and benefits that would otherwise be provided pursuant to this Plan during the 6- month period immediately after a Participant s separation from service will instead be paid on the first business day after the date that is 6 months after the Participant s separation from service (or, if earlier, death). If needed to avoid accelerated taxation and/or tax penalties under Section 409A of the Code, amounts reimbursable to the Participant under this Plan will be paid to the Participant on or before the last day of the year after the year in which the expense was incurred and the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement (and in-kind benefits provided) during any one year may not effect amounts reimbursable or provided in any subsequent year. The Company makes no representation that any or all of the payments described in this Plan will be exempt from or comply with Section 409A of the Code and makes no undertaking to preclude Section 409A of the Code from applying to any payment. The Participant will be solely responsible for the payment of any taxes and penalties incurred under Section 409A. GENERAL PROVISIONS At-Will Employment. The Plan does not alter the status of each Participant as an at-will employee of the Company. Nothing in the Plan gives any Participant the right to remain employed by the Company or limits the Company s right to terminate the employment of any Participant at any time, with or without Cause. Severability. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of the Plan will not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of the Plan. If any provision of the Plan is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable, the provision will be deemed modified as needed to make the provision legal, valid and enforceable, and the other remaining provisions of the Plan will not be affected. Successors. The Plan will be binding upon any successor to the Company, its assets, its businesses or its interest (whether as a result of a Change in Control or otherwise), as if no succession had taken place. If any successor would not automatically be bound by the Plan, the Company will require the successor to expressly assume the Plan in writing and honor the obligations of the Company under the Plan under the Plan, as if no succession had taken place. All payments and benefits that become due to a Participant under the Plan will inure to the benefit of his or her heirs, assigns, designees or legal representatives. Compensation Recovery Policy.. Payments and benefits hereunder shall be subject to the Company s Compensation Recovery Policy or or incentive compensation recoupment policy as in effect from time to time. Transfer and Assignment. Neither a Participant nor any other person will have any right to sell, assign or otherwise transfer any amounts payable under the Plan before the date that the amounts are paid, except that, if a Participant dies, those amounts will be paid to the Participant s beneficiaries. 

9 Governing Law. If not pre-empted by federal law, the Plan will be governed by the internal laws of The Commonwealth of Massachusetts, without regard to conflicts of law principles.
