Helium and CO 2 Properties As the Company's development work progresses and the reserves on the Company's properties are proven, capitalized costs attributed to the properties and mineral interest are subject to depletion. Depletion of capitalized costs is provided using the units-of-production method based on proved helium and CO 2 reserves. Depletion expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was and , respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was and , respectively. These capitalized costs are subject to a ceiling test that limits such pooled costs, net of applicable deferred taxes, to the aggregate of the present value of future net revenues attributable to proved helium and CO 2 reserves discounted at . Any costs in excess of the ceiling are written off as a non-cash expense. The Company did t record an impairment to proved helium and CO 2 properties during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Costs associated with unproved properties are excluded from the amortization base until the properties are evaluated or impairment is indicated. The costs associated with unproved leasehold acreage and related seismic data, are initially excluded from the amortization base. Leasehold costs are either transferred to the amortization base with the costs of drilling and/or completing a well on the lease or are assessed at least annually for possible impairment or reduction in value. The Company s decision to withhold costs from amortization and the timing of the transfer of those costs into the amortization base involves judgment and may be subject to changes over time based on several factors, including drilling plans, availability of capital, project economics and drilling results from adjacent acreage. The Company did t record an impairment to unproved helium and CO 2 properties during the three or nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023. Other Property, Plant and Equipment The Company's other property, plant and equipment include a vehicle and its helium processing plant costs. The vehicle is depreciated using the straight-line method over an estimated useful life of years and the helium processing plant is depreciated using the straight-line method over an estimated useful life of years. The Company recorded depreciation expense on vehicles during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , of , and during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 of .

. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has U.S. net operating loss NOLs carryforwards of approximately to offset taxable income, if any, in future years. Federal NOLs generated in 2023 and 2024 may be carried forward indefinitely. In assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on the assessment, management has established a full valuation allowance against all of the deferred tax asset relating to NOLs for every period because it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Tax periods for all fiscal years after 2021 re main open to examination by the federal and state taxing jurisdictions to which the Company is subject.

 General 
 
 Overview 
 
 Cyber App Solutions Corp. (the Company , CYRB , we , us , or ours is a corporation established under the corporation laws in the State of Nevada on February 19, 2021. Our corporate office is in Houston, Texas. 
 
 We are focused on the acquisition, exploration, development and production of helium and beverage grade CO 2 and we have CO 2 reservoirs that are capable of storing captured CO 2 . Our assets are concentrated in the St. Johns Field located in Apache County, Arizona of the United States (the St. Johns Field"). 
 
 Market Conditions 
 
 Helium 
 
 Helium is a unique element in that it is the second most abundant in the universe, the most stable, yet rare and difficult to capture and store on the Earth, found in only a few locations spanning about twenty production fields globally. Its unique qualities make it a non-renewable and limited natural resource, highly demanded in many growing industries such as medical technology, high-tech, space exploration and national defense. Specific uses for helium include: semiconductor and fiber-optics manufacturing, cooling superconducting magnets in MRI machines, leak detection, as a purge gas and pressurizing agent in spacecraft, leak detection, airbags, deep sea diving oxygen tanks, and more. 
 
 Production of helium goes back to 1900s. Since that time, the industry has experienced four notable periods of shortage between 2006 and today, with helium production currently experiencing a shortage started in 2022 driven by the increased demand from growing industries and technologies and decreased production. Decreased production is partially attributable to the US government, one of the world s largest and most dependable suppliers of helium, selling off its national helium reserve located near the Hugoton-Panhandle field that spans across Texas, Oklahoma, and Kansas and sanctions imposed on Russian exports. The demand for helium was estimated at 5.9 billion cubic feet (Bcf) for 2023 and expected to increase to about 8 Bcf by 2030 1 . The United States has been a leading producer of helium 2 and currently holds roughly 40 of the global production market share, which is expected to decrease to about 30 by year 2030. The next leading producers of helium have been Russia, Algeria and Qatar. 
 
 We believe that demand for helium will continue to grow as applications in the manufacturing, medical device and aerospace industries expands. The pricing of helium is normally set through direct negotiations with either distributors or end-users and generally are not disclosed. We have opportunities to enter into long-term agreements with a fixed price which we will consider based upon alternative options available to us. 
 
 CO 2 
 
 The U.S. carbon dioxide market size was valued at 3.2 billion in 2021 and is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.4 from 2022 to 2030. The food beverages segment led with a revenue share of 34.52 in the year 2021 3 . In the U.S. beverage industry, CO 2 is commonly utilized for carbonating soft drinks and beer. Additional uses for CO 2 are enhanced oil recovery, dry ice production, wastewater treatment, welding, fire suppression, plant growth, food preservation, food refrigeration and freezing, and more. Characteristics of its use include creating carbonation for desired fizziness, diverse sources (industrial processes, fermentation), adherence to food-grade standards, reliance on a stable supply chain, and transportation/storage in liquid or compressed gas forms. Industry-specific details are recommended for the latest information. 
 
 CO 2 for beverages can come from various sources: fermentation processes (alcoholic beverage production), industrial processes (chemical manufacturing), natural sources (natural springs), dry ice production, biogas production (anaerobic digestion), and upstream oil and gas operations (natural gas processing). Regardless of the source, CO 2 must meet strict quality standards to ensure safety and taste in the final beverage product, often involving purification processes by manufacturers. 
 The largest single food and beverage grade CO 2 supplier in the U.S. is located at Jackson Dome, Mississippi (the Jackson Dome ). Supply was disrupted recently due to geologic contamination of the reservoir, although it has begun to come back online. Additionally, ExxonMobil announced in a November 2, 2023 press release that it had completed the acquisition of Denbury, Inc., who was the primary operator at the Jackson Dome. Based on ExxonMobil s July 13, 2023 press release, the acquisition allows them to serve a range of hard-to-decarbonize industries with a comprehensive carbon capture and sequestration offering, which we believe means they are focused on 
 21 

carbon capture and sequestration in the Jackson Dome rather than CO 2 production. The curtailment of CO 2 plants here and elsewhere in the country, we believe, has led and will lead to a shortage of CO 2 supply to the food and beverage industry. 
 
 Pricing for CO 2 is often negotiated between the producer, and wholesalers or end buyers. We believe that the food and beverage grade market will continue to need to secure supply of CO 2 providing us with multiple potential customer relationships. Furthermore, we will work with distribution companies to negotiate direct-to-customer sales and delivery agreements. We anticipate that we will sell a portion of our produced CO 2 on fixed price, fixed delivery sales contractions and a portion will be sold month to month at prevailing prices.

U.S. Department of Energy Program 
 
 In August 2023, we received notice regarding a potential financial award from the U.S. Department of Energy DoE that we, as a member of a consortium of companies, which includes us, Black Veatch, Carbon Collect, CarbonCapture, Carbon Solutions, Arizona State University, University of New Mexico, University of Utah, Tallgrass, and the Arizona Geological Survey, had been selected to receive an approximately 11,600,000 grant for plans to develop the Southwest Regional Direct Air Capture DAC Hub to advance the design of a regional DAC hub. The program aims to expedite the deployment of a nationwide network of large-scale DAC CO 2 removal sites to address legacy CO 2 pollution and complement rapid emission reduction in the region. We will work alongside our consortium partners to develop a storage field development plan to securely sequester CO 2 captured from the atmosphere into our St. Johns Field basin. Under the program, we expect that we will receive reimbursement for certain personnel time. The DoE award officially received funding for the DAC Hub proposal in October 2024 and a project kickoff meeting is expected for late November 2024. 
 
 Segment Information 
 
 We manage our business globally within one reportable segment, which is consistent with how our management reviews the business, prioritizes investment and resource allocation decisions and assesses operating performance. 
 
 Fair Value Measurement 
 
 Our financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis consist of convertible promissory notes issued on November 21, 2023 (the 2023 Convertible Notes ), the freestanding warrants issued along with the 2023 Convertible Notes, and the Series A Preferred Stock conversion options. We use significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) to measure the fair value of the instruments. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, there was an unrealized loss of 744,297 and 0, respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, there was an unrealized gain of 1,432,324 and and an unrealized gain of 185,011, respectively, on mark-to-market of the warrants and change in fair value of the notes payable recorded in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations.

Revenue 
 
 Helium revenue. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, helium revenue was 0 and 121,958, respectively. The 100 decrease in helium revenues was due to the Company idling our helium processing plant in the St. Johns Field during June 2024, resulting in no production and sales during the three months ended September 30, 2024. We sold approximately 250 thousand cubic feet of helium during the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Operating Expenses 
 
 Depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion was 33,025 and 56,832, respectively. The 42 decrease in depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion primarily relates to the Company recording no depletion expense on our helium and CO 2 property costs, which is calculated using units of production, during the three months ended September 30, 2024 because we had no production and sales. We recorded depletion expense in the amount of approximately 25,000 during three months ended September 30, 2023 when we had production and sales. 
 
 Lease and well operating expenses . For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, lease and well operating expenses were 42,422 and 45,333, respectively. The 6 decrease is primarily due to operator fees of approximately 6,000 incurred during the three months ended September 30, 2023 compared to 0 incurred during the same period in 2024 due to the well being shut-in while our helium processing plant is idled. The decrease was partially offset by approximately 3,000 of repair fees incurred during the three months ended September 30, 2023 compared to 0 incurred during the same period in 2024. 
 
 Shut-in expenses . For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, shut-in expenses were 51,684 and 10,880, respectively. The 375 increase in shut-in expenses was due to a shut-in royalty reimbursement of approximately 41,000 received during the three months ended September 30, 2023, which reduced the expense during such period. 
 
 Gathering and processing expenses . For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, gathering and processing expenses were 150,000 and 250,712, respectively. Gathering and processing expenses are the cost incurred to operate the helium processing plant. The 40 decrease is primarily related to a decrease in electricity costs incurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 because our helium processing plant was idled during the three months ended September 30, 2024. Although the helium processing plant is idled, we will continue to incur costs for leased equipment. 
 23 

Production taxes . For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, production taxes were 0 and 5,240, respectively. The 100 decrease is due to the decrease in helium revenues. We expect production taxes to be approximately 3.437 of helium revenues. 
 
 General and administrative expenses . For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, general and administrative expenses were 1,318,454 and 927,311, respectively. The 42 increase in general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 is primarily due to an increase in professional fees such as legal and accounting, an increase in headcount to operate as a public company, and other costs required to operate as a public company. The increase was primarily due to increases of approximately 201,000 in payroll and payroll related costs due to an increase in full-time employees, approximately 90,000 for Board of Director fees, and approximately 70,000 in insurance primarily for adding a Directors Officers policy. The remaining increase was for office supplies and equipment, travel, filing fees, and other overhead costs. 
 
 General and administrative expenses - related parties . For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, general and administrative expenses - related parties were 110,000 and 0, respectively. The 100 increase, as detailed in Note 16 - Transactions with Related Parties , was primarily due to 95,000 incurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024 for Front-end engineering design studies for our next planned helium and CO 2 processing plant with an entity that is affiliated with one of our Board members. The remaining increase of 15,000 is due to an increase in fees incurred for human resource consulting services provided by an immediate family member of one of our name executive officers. 
 
 Other income (expense) 
 
 Interest expense . For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, interest expense was 723,299 and 850,867, respectively. The 15 decrease in interest expense for three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 is primarily due to a decrease of approximately 303,000 of interest incurred on short-term borrowing during the three months ended September 30, 2023 that did not occur in the same period during 2024. The Company issued the short-term borrowings at significant discounts. Such decrease is partially offset by an increase of approximately 60,000 on our outstanding convertible notes, primarily related to an increase in principal balance outstanding during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, and approximately 5,000 of interest on our financed insurance premium. 
 
 Event of default fees . For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, event of default fees were 767,680 and 1,987,387, respectively. We had outstanding convertible notes in default during both periods. The 61 decrease is due to the Company s convertible notes outstanding during the three months ended September 30, 2024 having lower default fees compared to the default fees incurred on the convertible notes outstanding during the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Notes payable modification costs . On September 16, 2024, the Company issued 1,708,320 shares of common stock to Kips Bay Select LP and 1,254,986 shares of common stock to Cyber One LTD in connection with the forbearance and settlement agreement, as further detailed in Note 7 - Debt . The Company measured the total fair value of the award at 9,157,801 based on the price per share the Company received when it sold common stock in private placements near the time of the issuance. 
 
 Unrealized gain on fair value of notes payable . For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, unrealized loss on fair value of notes payable was 1,171,298 and 0, respectively. The Company elected the fair value option on the 2023 Convertible Notes and such notes were still outstanding during the three months ended September 30, 2024. There were no notes outstanding during the three months ended September 30, 2023 with the fair value option elected. 
 
 Unrealized gain on derivatives mark-to-market . For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, unrealized gain on derivatives mark-to-market was 427,001 and 0, respectively. Our notes payable contained conversion features and warrants that were embedded derivatives that required bifurcation. This balance represents the change in fair value of the conversion features and warrants.

Revenue 
 
 Helium revenue. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, helium revenue was 418,042 and 121,958, respectively. The 243 increase in helium revenues was due to the completion and startup of our helium processing plant in the St. Johns Field during the third quarter of 2023. We sold approximately 861 thousand cubic feet of helium during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to approximately 250 thousand cubic feet of helium during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Realized helium prices in both periods were consistent. 
 
 Operating Expenses 
 
 Depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion was 184,119 and 83,742, respectively. The 120 increase in depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion primarily relates to an increase of approximately 61,000 in depletion of our helium and CO 2 property costs, which is calculated using units of production, due to the Company having helium production of approximately 861 thousand cubic feet during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to approximately 250 thousand cubic feet during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The depletion rate in both periods were consistent. There was also an increase of approximately 37,000 in depreciation on our helium processing plant costs due to our helium processing plant commencing during the third quarter of 2023 and had only three months of depreciation during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to nine months of depreciation during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Lease and well operating expenses . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, lease and well operating expenses were 145,862 and 98,210, respectively. The 49 increase is primarily due an increase of approximately 27,000 for compression costs, 11,000 for lease operator fees, and approximately 10,000 for gas testing and repairs and maintenance, all due to more months of operations during the nine months ending September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. As noted above, the completion and startup of our helium processing plant in the St. Johns Field occurred during the third quarter of 2023. 
 
 Shut-in expenses . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, shut-in expenses were 155,049 and 145,513, respectively. The 7 increase in shut-in expenses was due to a shut-in royalty reimbursement of approximately 41,000 received during the three months ended September 30, 2023, which reduced the expense during such period, and it was partially offset by an expense of approximately 31,000 during the same period in 2023 related to the same royalty owner. 
 
 25 

Gathering and processing expenses . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, gathering and processing expenses were 666,685 and 400,712, respectively. Gathering and processing expenses are the cost incurred to operate the helium processing plant. As noted above, the completion and startup of our helium processing plant in the St. Johns Field occurred during the third quarter of 2023. The 66 increase was primarily due to an increase of approximately 117,000 for electricity to power the equipment, 90,000 related to the amortization of leased equipment recorded in right-of-use assets and 60,000 related to labor and maintenance. Although the helium processing plant is idled, we will continue to incur costs for leased equipment. 
 
 Production taxes . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, production taxes were 14,368 and 5,240, respectively. The 174 increase is due to the increase in helium revenues. We expect production taxes to be approximately 3.437 of helium revenues. 
 
 General and administrative expenses . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, general and administrative expenses were 4,018,329 and 2,238,060, respectively. The 80 increase in general and administrative expenses for the six months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 is primarily due to an increase in professional fees such as legal and accounting, an increase in headcount to operate as a public company, and other costs required to operate as a public company. Note that our wholly owned subsidiary, Proton Green, LLC, was considered the accounting acquirer in our reverse asset acquisition in July 2023 resulting in Proton Green, LLC's historical financial statements being presented for the nine months ended September 30 2023, which did not include increased professional fees for compliance as a public company. The increase was primarily due to an increase of approximately 651,000 related to audit fees and accounting and legal professionals to prepare and/or review our SEC filings, approximately 443,000 in payroll and payroll related costs due to an increase in full-time employees, approximately 251,000 for Board of Director fees, and approximately 199,000 in insurance primarily for adding a Directors Officers policy. We also recorded a one-time payment of 122,500 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 for software. The remaining increase was for office supplies and equipment, travel, filing fees, and other general and administrative costs. 
 
 General and administrative expenses - related parties . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, general and administrative expenses - related parties were 140,000 and 37,500, respectively. The 273 increase, as detailed in Note 16 - Transactions with Related Parties , was primarily due to 95,000 incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 for Front-end engineering design studies for our next planned helium and CO 2 processing plant with an entity that is affiliated with one of our Board members and an increase of 27,500 due to an increase in fees incurred for human resource consulting services provided by an immediate family member of one of our name executive officers. This increase was partially offset by a decrease of 20,000 in advisory consulting fees with an entity in which a principal owner of either directly or indirectly more than 10 of the Company s common stock, is the President/Owner. 
 
 Other income (expense) 
 
 Interest expense . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, interest expense was 2,255,081 and 1,929,501, respectively. The 17 increase in interest expense for three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 is due to an increase of approximately 421,000 of interest on our outstanding convertible notes, primarily related to an increase in principal balance outstanding during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 and an increase of approximately 22,000 of interest on our financed insurance premium. The increase is partially offset by a decrease of approximately 218,000 of interest incurred on short-term borrowing during the three months ended September 30, 2023 that did not occur in the same period during 2024. The Company issued the short-term borrowings at significant discounts. 
 
 Event of default fees . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, event of default fees were 2,301,440 and 5,875,111, respectively. We had outstanding convertible notes in default during both periods. The 61 decrease is due to the Company s convertible notes outstanding during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 having lower default fees compared to the default fees incurred on the convertible notes outstanding during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Notes payable modification costs . On September 16, 2024, the Company issued 1,708,320 shares of common stock to Kips Bay Select LP and 1,254,986 shares of common stock to Cyber One LTD in connection with the forbearance and settlement agreement, as further detailed in Note 7 - Debt . The Company measured the total fair value of the award at 9,157,801 based on the price per share the Company received when it sold common stock in private placements near the time of the issuance. 
 
 Unrealized gain on fair value of notes payable . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, unrealized gain on fair value of notes payable was 897,549 and 0, respectively. The Company elected the fair value option on the 2023 Convertible Notes and such notes were still outstanding during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. There were no notes outstanding during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 with the fair value option elected. 
 
 26 

Unrealized gain on derivatives mark-to-market . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, unrealized gain on derivatives mark-to-market was 534,775 and 185,011, respectively. Our notes payable contained conversion features and warrants that were embedded derivatives that required bifurcation. This balance represents the change in fair value of the conversion features and warrants. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 
 Income taxes have been accounted for in accordance with ASC 740, Accounting for Income Taxes . We are subject to income taxes in the United States and the State of Arizona. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had a full valuation allowance against all of our deferred tax assets, including our NOLs. The factors assumed to make the full valuation allowance includes that we have disclosed in Note 3 Liquidity that we have significant doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern and we have a history of pretax operating losses. 
 
 Contractual Obligations, Commitments, and Contingencies 
 
 Helium Recovery Unit . On January 3, 2022, we entered into a Master Services Agreement (the MSA with a contractor for the contractor to provide certain helium removal equipment and purification services at the helium processing plant in the St. Johns Field. The service consist of processing our feed gas using the contractor s pressure swing absorption process and equipment. It is a five-year lease that commenced on April 1, 2023. The fee is 50,000 per month for the service. We attributed 30,000 per month to the rental of equipment and accounted for it as an operating lease under ASC 842 and recorded it to the balance sheet. 
 
 Houston Office Lease . On September 30, 2022, we amended the lease for our corporate office in Houston, Texas. The commencement date of the amendment was October 15, 2022 and the lease expiration date was October 31, 2025. On October 25, 2023, we entered into a second amendment on the lease for our corporate office in Houston, Texas to expand the amount of square feet leased. The commencement date for the expansion is January 1, 2024 and the expiration date will be extended to January 31, 2027. We accounted for this lease under ASC 842 as an operating lease that s been recorded to the balance sheet. The lease payments escalate annually. We have co-tenants with the expansion. This amended lease will result in a straight-line amortization of approximately 3,762 per month in General and administrative expenses over the life of the contract. 
 
 Legal . On March 1, 2022, a potential lender filed a motion for a default judgment against our wholly owned subsidiary, Proton Green, LLC ("Proton Green") seeking a 1,000,000 break-up fee related to a commitment letter for a proposed senior secured term loan facility. The parties unsuccessfully attempted to mediate the case on October 23, 2023. Discovery is complete and the parties have filed cross-motions for summary judgment. On September 6, 2024, the court granted the potential lender s motion for summary judgment and denied Proton Green s cross-motion. We intend to appeal the ruling. No accrual has been recorded to the condensed consolidated financial statements because we are unable to conclude that an unfavorable outcome is probable. 
 
 We were served a lawsuit on May 2, 2024, in which we were named as one of several defendants in a complaint filed in the Federal District Court of the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division by Alpha Carta, Ltd. et al (the Alpha Carta Litigation ). Alpha Carta, Ltd. Alpha Carta alleges that Proton Green breached three promissory notes (the Notes ), a Forbearance Agreement, and a proposed unexecuted revised Forbearance Agreement with respect to payments due on the Notes and that Proton Green owes, with an aggregate balance of principal and interest, in excess of 30,000,000 (the AC Debt ). Other claims against the defendants include conspiracy to commit fraud, rescission, and declaratory judgment, all related to the AC Debt. We assert, in contrast, that we reached a loan settlement agreement Loan Settlement Agreement with Alpha Carta to settle the AC Debt for 8,000,000, which has been paid. Alpha Carta denies the existence of such Loan Settlement Agreement and alleges that if such Loan Settlement Agreement does exist, it was executed fraudulently. 
 
 We believe that the claims asserted in the Alpha Carta Litigation have no merit and intends to vigorously defend them. We have challenged the personal and subject matter jurisdiction, and the court has permitted the plaintiff to conduct limited jurisdictional discovery. We are unable to reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of loss, if any, associated with these claims, and accordingly, we have not accrued any liability associated with the Alpha Carta Litigation. 
 
 Company assets . As of September 30, 2024, all of the assets of the Company have been pledged as collateral for the 2023 Convertible Notes. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Since inception, we have generated significant losses. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 61,444,879. We have only generated limited revenue to date. Our primary sources of capital have been proceeds from the issuance of debt and equity. The primary uses of capital to date has been for the acquisition of our mineral leases in the St. Johns Field, which gave us operating control over approximately 170,500 acres in Apache County, Arizona, development of the St. Johns Field, paying debt service costs, start-up and operating costs in the St. Johns Field, helium plant installation and funding corporate overhead. 
 27 

We define working capital as current assets less current liabilities. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had a working capital deficit of 23,236,019 and 23,739,229, respectively. The deficits were primarily due to the amounts outstanding under our notes, as they are classified as current liabilities, and the fair value of outstanding warrants. 
 
 As of November 15, 2024, we had cash on hand of approximately 230,000. Our material liquidity needs over the next twelve months consist of the following: 
 
 On November 21, 2023, we issued a convertible promissory note to each of Kips Bay Select LP Kips Bay 2023 Note and Cyber One, LTD Cyber One 2023 Note ), collectively referred to as the Holders, in the principal amount of 8,000,000 to each for an aggregate principal amount of 16,000,000. The Kips Bay 2023 Note and the Cyber One 2023 Note are collectively referred to as the 2023 Convertible Notes . The 2023 Convertible Notes bore interest at a rate of 5 per annum due monthly and monthly repayments of 1,500,000 starting from January 21, 2024 and remaining outstanding balance due on July 21, 2024. See Note 7 Debt , for more details. We are in default on the 2023 Convertible Notes. 

On September 16, 2024, we entered into a Forbearance and Settlement Agreement (the Forbearance Agreement with the Holders. Pursuant to the Forbearance Agreement, the Holders have agreed to forbear from exercising certain of its rights and remedies available as a result of existing defaults and events of defaults, against us under the 2023 Convertible Notes in exchange for (i) 1,708,320 shares of common stock to Kips Bay Select LP (the Kips Bay Shares ), (ii) 1,254,986 shares of common stock to Cyber One LTD (the Cyber One Shares and (iii) up to 13,700,000 in cash to the Holders, with 700,000 due on or before September 17, 2024; 4,000,000 due on or before October 15, 2024; 4,000,000 due on or before November 15, 2024; and 5,000,000 due on or before December 15, 2024. If the 5,000,000 due on or before December 15, 2024 is paid on or before November 15, 2024, such amount shall be reduced to 4,000,000. The Company issued the Kips Bay Shares and Cyber One Shares and issued the first payment of 700,000 on September 17, 2024. 
 
 On October 15, 2024, we entered into an amendment to the Forbearance Agreement (the Amended Forbearance Agreement with the Holders. Pursuant to the Amended Forbearance Agreement , the Holders agreed to continue to forbear from exercising certain of its rights and remedies available as a result of existing defaults and events of defaults, against us under the 2023 Convertible Notes in exchange for (i) 850,000 shares of common stock to each Kips Bay Select LP and Cyber One LTD (the Amendment Shares and (ii) 13,000,000 in cash to the Holders, with 1,00,000 due on October 15, 2024; 1,000,000 due on or before October 21, 2024; 4,000,000 due on or before November 15, 2024; and 7,000,000 due on or before December 15, 2024. The Company issued the Amendment Shares and issued the first payment of 1,000,000 on October 15, 2024. 
 
 On November 6, 2024, the Company entered into a second amendment to the Forbearance Agreement (the Second Amended Forbearance Agreement with the Holders. Pursuant to the Second Amended Forbearance Agreement, the Holders agreed to continue to forbear from exercising certain of its rights and remedies available as a result of existing defaults and events of defaults, against the Company under the 2023 Convertible Notes in exchange for (i) 5,000,000 shares of common stock to each Kips Bay Select LP and Cyber One LTD (the Second Amendment Shares and (ii) 14,600,000 in cash to the Holders, with 2,600,000 due on November 21, 2024 and 12,000,000 due on or before January 31, 2025. The Company issued the Second Amendment Shares on November 7, 2024. 
 
 Funding outstanding accounts payable balances and corporate overhead, which we expect to be approximately 5.5 million to 6.5 million. 

Our sole helium processing plant in the St. Johns Field has not reached steady state production. We have encountered significant difficulties to date at the helium processing plant because of mechanical issues and design limitations, resulting in inefficient operations and lower helium recovery rates, which has limited our revenues generated and led to recurring losses incurred. In June 2024, we idled the helium processing plant. Way may continue to incur costs of 50,000 per month through April 2028 for leased equipment. More details on the leased equipment are above in the Helium Recovery Unit section of Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies . In addition, we anticipate shut-in royalties would be approximately 250,000. 

We may issue additional shares of our Series A Preferred Stock under the Series A Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement. We have no committed capital to address our material liquidity needs over the next twelve months from the date of these consolidated financial statements being issued. These matters raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year after the date that these consolidated financial statements are issued. The condensed consolidated financial statements included in this quarterly report have been prepared on a going concern basis of accounting, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. The condensed consolidated financial statements do not include adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties.

We are focused on plant designs that will allow us to continue developing our helium reserves while also developing our CO 2 resources. We have front-end engineering design studies underway for our next planned helium and CO 2 processing plant. We expect that our next significant capital outlay will be to construct a processing plant at the St. Johns Field that is capable of producing approximately 50,000 cubic feet per day of helium and approximately 500 tons per day of beverage grade CO 2 . Our estimate of the cost for the plant design, equipment, construction and drilling wells is approximately 25,000,000 to 30,000,000. Thereafter, we plan to continue adding plants of similar design and drilling new wells as needed to meet the plants processing capacity. 
 
 We are currently evaluating debt and equity financing strategies that we believe will provide sufficient capital to fund our next planned helium and CO 2 processing plant and drill new wells as needed. We believe our next planned helium and CO 2 processing plant will generate positive cash flows from operations and provide sufficient capital to address any debt service costs we would incur from debt financing strategies. Helium and CO 2 production levels that we believe we are capable of achieving as a result of these capital expenditures will position us as a top tier producer of helium and CO 2 , thereby giving us considerable bargaining power when negotiating off-take and transportation agreements. If we are unable to execute any of our debt and financing strategies or one on acceptable terms, we may not be able to finance the capital expenditures necessary to develop our helium and CO 2 resources. Because we are the operator of all of our acreage, the timing and level of our capital spending is largely discretionary and within our control. 
 
 Cash Flows from Operating, Investing and Financing Activities 
 
 The following table summarizes our cash flows for the period indicated: 

For the Nine Months Ended September 30, 

2024

Operating activities . There was an increase in cash used in operating activities of 5,780,802 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to payment of interest and default fees to Holders of the 2023 Convertible Notes and an increase in general and administrative expenses. 
 
 Investing activities . Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 related to capital expenditures at the St. Johns Field for delay rental payments and equipment at the helium processing plant and wellhead. 
 
 Financing activities . Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted of cash proceeds of 8,000,000 from the issuance of the Series A Preferred Stock, approximately 988,000 from the issuance of our common stock and 250,000 from short-term borrowings, partially offset by paydown of approximately 204,000 on our outstanding convertible notes. Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 consisted of proceeds of 5,433,000, net of issuance costs, from the issuance of equity and proceeds of 730,000 from short-term notes issued by the company. This increase was partially offset by the paydown on debt of 3,000,000. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had no off-balance arrangements or other such unrecorded obligations and we have not guaranteed any debt of any unrelated party. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 The preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. 
 
 Our Annual Report on Form 10-K contains a discussion, which is incorporated herein by reference, of the accounting estimates that we believe are critical to the reporting of our financial position and operating results and that require management's judgment. Our more significant policies and estimates include: 
 
 Full cost method of accounting for helium and CO 2 properties 

29 

Impairment of helium and CO 2 properties 

Depreciation, depletion and amortization for helium and CO 2 properties 

Helium reserve quantities 

Asset retirement obligations 

Derivative financial instruments

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
 
 The information contained in Note 2 Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the condensed consolidated financial statements under the heading Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements is hereby incorporated by reference into this Part I, Item 2. 
 
 Ite m 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 
 We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information under this item. 
 
 Ite m 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Control and Procedures 
 
 As required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act, we have evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. As of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as a result of a material weaknesses identified during the year ended December 31, 2023 that we are in the process of remediating. The material weaknesses related to the lack of completeness over the population of leases for ASC 842 booking and disclosures, lack of communication and retention of legal documents and lack of review and management oversight, which led to the incorrect application of generally accepted accounting principles and ineffective controls over the financial statement close and reporting processes. 
 
 We are recruiting additional finance and accounting personnel and we will continue to evaluate our personnel in all key finance and accounting positions to see if additional finance and accounting personnel are required. 
 
 We are not required to comply with the auditor attestation requirement of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act while we qualify as an emerging growth company under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 PART II OTHE R INFORMATION 
 Ite m 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 
 In the ordinary course of business, the Company is party to various legal actions. In management s opinion, the outcome of any such currently pending legal actions will not have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial position or results of operations. 
 
 On March 1, 2022, a potential lender filed a motion for a default judgment against our wholly owned subsidiary, Proton Green, LLC ("Proton Green") seeking a 1,000,000 break-up fee related to a commitment letter for a proposed senior secured term loan facility. The parties unsuccessfully attempted to mediate the case on October 23, 2023. Discovery is complete and the parties have filed cross-motions 
 30 

for summary judgment. On September 6, 2024, the court granted the potential lender s motion for summary judgment and denied Proton Green s cross-motion. We intend to appeal the ruling. No accrual has been recorded to the condensed consolidated financial statements because we are unable to conclude that an unfavorable outcome is probable. 
 
 We were served a lawsuit on May 2, 2024, in which we were named as one of several defendants in a complaint filed in the Federal District Court of the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division by Alpha Carta, Ltd. et al (the Alpha Carta Litigation ). Alpha Carta, Ltd. Alpha Carta alleges that Proton Green breached three promissory notes (the Notes ), a Forbearance Agreement, and a proposed unexecuted revised Forbearance Agreement with respect to payments due on the Notes and that Proton Green owes, with an aggregate balance of principal and interest, in excess of 30,000,000 (the AC Debt ). Other claims against the defendants include conspiracy to commit fraud, rescission, and declaratory judgment, all related to the AC Debt. We assert, in contrast, that we reached a loan settlement agreement Loan Settlement Agreement with Alpha Carta to settle the AC Debt for 8,000,000, which has been paid. Alpha Carta denies the existence of such Loan Settlement Agreement and alleges that if such Loan Settlement Agreement does exist, it was executed fraudulently. 
 
 We believe that the claims asserted in the Alpha Carta Litigation have no merit and intends to vigorously defend them. The Company has challenged the personal and subject matter jurisdiction, and the court has permitted the plaintiff to conduct limited jurisdictional discovery. We are unable to reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of loss, if any, associated with these claims, and accordingly, we have not accrued any liability associated with the Alpha Carta Litigation. 
 
 There are no other material litigation, arbitration or governmental proceeding currently pending against the Company or any members of its management team in their capacity as such requiring a contingent liability to be recognized as of the date of the consolidated financial statements.
