million in stock. Salisbury Bank, Salisbury s subsidiary, was a Connecticut-chartered commercial bank headquartered in
 Lakeville, Connecticut with banking offices. The acquisition enhanced the Company s presence in Massachusetts Berkshire county, and
 extended its footprint into New York s Dutchess, Orange and Ulster counties and into Connecticut s Litchfield county. In connection with the acquisition, the Company issued million shares of common stock and acquired approximately 
 billion of identifiable assets. Preliminary goodwill of million was recognized during the quarter ended September 30, 2023 as a
 result of the merger and is not amortizable or deductible for tax purposes. During the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company revised the estimated fair value of premises and equipment, net and related deferred income taxes based upon receipt of land
 and building appraisals, which resulted in a million increase in goodwill. Total goodwill of million was recognized as a result of the merger. The effects of the acquired assets and liabilities have been included in the consolidated
 financial statements since that date. As a result of the full integration of the operations of Salisbury, it is not practicable to determine all revenue or net income included in the Company s operating results relating to Salisbury since the date
 of acquisition as Salisbury results cannot be separately identified.

and individual securities,
 respectively, represented a credit loss impairment. AFS debt securities in unrealized loss positions are evaluated for impairment related to credit losses at least quarterly. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the majority of the AFS
 securities in an unrealized loss position consisted of debt securities issued by U.S. government agencies or U.S. government-sponsored enterprises that carry the explicit and/or implicit guarantee of the U.S. government, which are widely recognized
 as risk-free and have a long history of zero credit losses. Total gross unrealized losses were primarily attributable to changes in interest rates, relative to when the investment securities were purchased, and not due to the credit quality of the
 investment securities. The Company does not intend to, nor is it more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell these securities before recovery of its amortized cost basis, which may be at maturity. The Company elected to exclude AIR
 from the amortized cost basis of debt securities. AIR on AFS debt securities totaled million at September 30, 2024 and million at December 31, 2023, and is excluded from the estimate of credit losses and is reported in the other assets financial statement line.

of the Bank s HTM debt securities were past due
 or on nonaccrual status as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. There was accrued interest reversed against interest income
 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 or the year ended December 31, 2023 as all securities remained in accrual status. In addition, there were collateral-dependent HTM debt securities as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. There was allowance for credit losses on HTM securities as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, of the Company s HTM debt securities were issued by U.S. government agencies or U.S. government-sponsored enterprises. These securities carry the explicit and/or implicit guarantee of the
 U.S. government, which are widely recognized as risk-free, and have a long history of zero credit losses. Therefore, the Company did not record an allowance for credit losses for these securities as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The
 remaining HTM debt securities at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were comprised of state and municipal obligations with bond ratings of A to AAA. Based on the Company's CECL methodology, the expected credit loss on the HTM municipal bond
 portfolio was deemed immaterial, therefore no allowance for credit loss was recorded as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. AIR on HTM debt securities totaled million at September 30, 2024 and million at December 31, 2023 and is excluded from the estimate
 of credit losses and reported in the other assets financial statement line.

 occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events or circumstances after the date of such statements.

Non-GAAP Measures

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains financial information determined by methods other than in accordance with GAAP. Where non-GAAP disclosures are used in this Form 10-Q, the comparable GAAP
 measure, as well as a reconciliation to the comparable GAAP measure, is provided in the accompanying tables. Management believes that these non-GAAP measures provide useful information that is important to an understanding of the results of the
 Company s core business as well as provide information standard in the financial institution industry. Non-GAAP measures should not be considered a substitute for financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP and investors should consider
 the Company s performance and financial condition as reported under GAAP and all other relevant information when assessing the performance or financial condition of the Company. Amounts previously reported in the consolidated financial statements
 are reclassified whenever necessary to conform to current period presentation.

Critical Accounting Estimates

SEC guidance requires disclosure of critical accounting estimates. The SEC defines critical accounting estimates as those estimates made in accordance with GAAP that involve a significant level of
 estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the financial condition or results of operations of the registrant. The Company follows financial accounting and reporting policies that are in accordance
 with GAAP. The more significant of these policies are summarized in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements presented in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Refer to Note 3 to the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements in this
 Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for recently adopted accounting standards. Not all significant accounting policies require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments. The allowance for credit losses and the allowance for unfunded
 commitments policies are deemed to meet the SEC s definition of a critical accounting estimate.

Allowance for Credit Losses and Unfunded Commitments

The allowance for credit losses consists of the allowance for credit losses and the allowance for losses on unfunded commitments. The measurement of CECL on financial instruments requires an estimate
 of the credit losses expected over the life of an exposure (or pool of exposures). The estimate of expected credit losses under the CECL methodology is based on relevant information about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and
 supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amounts. Historical loss experience is generally the starting point for estimating expected credit losses. The Company then considers whether the historical loss experience should
 be adjusted for asset-specific risk characteristics or current conditions at the reporting date that did not exist over the period from which historical experience was used. Finally, the Company considers forecasts about future economic conditions
 that are reasonable and supportable. The allowance for credit losses for loans, as reported in our consolidated statements of financial condition, is adjusted by an expense for credit losses, which is recognized in earnings, and reduced by the
 charge-off of loan amounts, net of recoveries. The allowance for losses on unfunded commitments represents the expected credit losses on off-balance sheet commitments such as unfunded commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit.
 However, a liability is not recognized for commitments unconditionally cancellable by the Company. The allowance for losses on unfunded commitments is determined by estimating future draws and applying the expected loss rates on those draws.

Management of the Company considers the accounting policy relating to the allowance for credit losses to be a critical accounting estimate given the uncertainty in evaluating the level of the
 allowance required to cover management s estimate of all expected credit losses over the expected contractual life of our loan portfolio. Determining the appropriateness of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the
 effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Subsequent evaluations of the then-existing loan portfolio, in light of the factors then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the allowance for credit losses in those future periods.
 While management s current evaluation of the allowance for credit losses indicates that the allowance is appropriate, the allowance may need to be increased under adversely different conditions or assumptions. The impact of utilizing the CECL
 methodology to calculate the reserve for credit losses will be significantly influenced by the composition, characteristics and quality of our loan portfolio, as well as the prevailing economic conditions and forecasts utilized. Material changes to
 these and other relevant factors may result in greater volatility to the reserve for credit losses, and therefore, greater volatility to our reported earnings.

One of the most significant judgments involved in estimating the Company s allowance for credit losses relates to the macroeconomic forecasts used to estimate expected credit losses over the forecast
 period. As of September 30, 2024, the quantitative model incorporated a baseline economic outlook along with an alternative downside scenario sourced from a reputable third-party to accommodate other potential economic conditions in the model. At
 September 30, 2024, the weightings were 80 and 20 for the baseline and downside economic forecasts, respectively. The baseline outlook reflects an economic environment where the Northeast unemployment rate increases slightly but remains around
 4.1 during the forecast period. Northeast GDP s annualized growth (on a quarterly basis) is expected to start the fourth quarter of 2024 at approximately 3.9 and remains relatively stable during the forecast period. Key assumptions in the
 baseline economic outlook included the Federal Reserve cutting rates at the September and December meetings, the economy remaining at full employment, and continued tapering of the Federal Reserve balance sheet. The alternative downside scenario
 assumed deteriorated economic conditions from the baseline outlook. Under this scenario, Northeast unemployment rises from 4.0 in the third quarter of 2024 to a peak of 7.5 in the fourth quarter of 2025. These scenarios and their respective
 weightings are evaluated at each measurement date and reflect management s expectations as of September 30, 2024. Additional adjustments were made for factors not incorporated in the forecasts or the model, such as loss rate expectations for
 certain loan pools, considerations for inflation, and recent trends in asset value indices. Additional monitoring for industry concentrations, loan growth, and policy exceptions was also conducted. To demonstrate the sensitivity of the allowance
 for credit losses estimate to macroeconomic forecast weightings assumptions as of September 30, 2024, the Company attributed the change in scenario weightings to the change in the allowance for credit losses, with a 10 decrease to the downside
 scenario and a 10 increase to the baseline scenario causing a 4 decrease in the overall estimated allowance for credit losses. To further demonstrate the sensitivity of the allowance for credit losses estimate to macroeconomic forecast weightings
 assumptions as of September 30, 2024, the Company increased the downside scenario to 100 which resulted in a 33 increase in the overall estimated allowance for credit losses.

Net Interest Income

Net interest income is the difference between interest income on earning assets, primarily loans and securities and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, primarily deposits and borrowings.
 Net interest income is affected by the interest rate spread, the difference between the yield on interest-earning assets and cost of interest-bearing liabilities, as well as the volumes of such assets and liabilities. Net interest income is one of
 the key determining factors in a financial institution s performance as it is the principal source of earnings.

Net interest income was 101.7 million for the third quarter of 2024, up 4.5 million, or 4.6 , from the previous quarter. The FTE net interest margin was 3.27 for the three months ended September
 30, 2024, an increase of 9 bps from the previous quarter. Interest income increased 5.5 million, or 3.6 , as the yield on average interest-earning assets increased 9 bps from the prior quarter to 5.01 , while average interest-earning assets of
 12.45 billion increased 79.2 million from the prior quarter, primarily due to organic loan growth slightly offset by a decrease in the average balance of securities. Interest expense was up 1.0 million, or 1.8 , as the cost of interest-bearing
 liabilities increased 2 bps to 2.60 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, driven by interest-bearing deposit costs increasing 6 bps, which were partially offset by lower average balances of short-term borrowings. Included in net interest
 income was 2.7 million of acquisition-related net accretion for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2.6 million of acquisition-related net accretion for the three months ended June 30, 2024.

Net interest income was 101.7 million for the third quarter of 2024, up 6.8 million, or 7.1 , from the third quarter of 2023. The FTE net interest margin was 3.27 for the three months ended
 September 30, 2024, an increase of 6 bps from the third quarter of 2023. Interest income increased 19.1 million, or 14.0 , as the yield on average interest-earning assets increased 38 bps from the same period in 2023 to 5.01 , while average
 interest-earning assets increased 644.2 million, or 5.5 , from the third quarter of 2023 primarily due to the Salisbury acquisition and organic loan growth. Interest expense increased 12.4 million, or 29.3 , as the cost of interest-bearing
 liabilities increased 42 bps to 2.60 for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to both a 67 bps increase in interest-bearing deposit costs and a 1.13 billion increase in interest-bearing deposits as a result of the Salisbury
 acquisition, which were partially offset by a decrease of 491.5 million in the average balance of short-term borrowings and the 574 bps rate paid on those borrowings. Included in net interest income was 2.7 million of acquisition-related net
 accretion for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 1.4 million of acquisition-related net accretion for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

Net interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 294.0 million, up 15.0 million, or 5.4 , from the same period in 2023. FTE net interest margin was 3.20 for the nine months
 ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 14 bps from the same period in 2023. Interest income increased 82.1 million, or 22.1 , as the yield on average interest-earning assets increased 49 bps from the same period in 2023 to 4.93 , while average
 interest-earning assets of 12.36 billion increased 1.13 billion primarily due to the Salisbury acquisition and organic loan growth, partially offset by the decrease in securities. Interest expense was up 67.1 million, or 72.3 , for the nine
 months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 driven by interest-bearing deposit costs increasing 109 bps and a 1.47 billion increase in interest-bearing deposits as a result of the Salisbury acquisition, partially offset
 by a decrease of 347.0 million in the average balances of short-term borrowings and the 548 bps rate paid on those borrowings. Included in net interest income was 7.8 million of acquisition-related net accretion for the nine months ended
 September 30, 2024 and 1.4 million of acquisition-related net accretion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 Excluding net securities gains (losses), noninterest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 45.3 million, up 2.0 million, or 4.6 , from the prior quarter and up 4.9 million, or 12.1 , from the third quarter of 2023. The
 increase from the prior quarter was primarily driven by an increase in wealth management fees and insurance services. Wealth management fees increased from the prior quarter due to organic growth and seasonal activity-based fees. Insurance services
 increased from the prior quarter due to seasonal renewals. The increase from the third quarter of 2023 was driven by an increase in retirement plan administration fees, wealth management fees and insurance services. Retirement plan administration
 fees increased from the third quarter of 2023 driven by organic growth and higher market levels. Wealth management fees increased in the third quarter of 2023 driven by the addition of Salisbury revenues, organic growth and market performance.
 Insurance services increased from the third quarter of 2023 due to organic growth.

Noninterest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 134.4 million, up 30.7 million, or 29.6 , from the same period in 2023. Excluding net securities gains (losses), noninterest
 income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 131.8 million, up 18.3 million, or 16.1 , from the same period in 2023. The increase from the prior year was primarily due to an increase in retirement plan administration fees and wealth
 management fees. The increase in retirement plan administration fees was driven by higher market level, the acquisition of Retirement Direct, LLC, organic growth and higher activity based fees. The increase in wealth management fees was driven by
 the addition of Salisbury revenues, organic growth and market performance.

 Excluding acquisition expenses, noninterest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 95.2 million, up 5.6 million, or 6.3 , from the prior quarter and up 12.3 million, or 14.9 , from the third quarter of 2023. The increase from
 the prior quarter was primarily driven by higher salaries and employee benefits due to one additional payroll day and an increase in other benefits including higher levels of incentive compensation. In addition, the increase from the prior quarter
 was driven by higher technology and data services due to timing of planned initiatives and continued investment in digital platform solutions. The increase from the third quarter of 2023 was driven by higher salaries and employee benefits due to
 the Salisbury acquisition, merit pay increases, higher levels of incentive compensation, along with higher medical and other benefit costs. In addition, the increase in occupancy expense, professional fees and outside services and amortization of
 intangible assets were impacted by additional expenses from the Salisbury acquisition.

Noninterest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 277.1 million, up 28.2 million, or 11.3 , from the same period in 2023. Excluding acquisition expenses, noninterest expense for
 the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 276.6 million, up 37.4 million, or 15.6 , from the same period in 2023. The increase from the prior year was driven by higher salaries and employee benefits due to the Salisbury acquisition, merit pay
 increases, higher levels of incentive compensation and higher medical and other benefit costs. In addition, the increase in occupancy expense, professional fees and outside services and amortization of intangible assets were impacted by additional
 expenses from the Salisbury acquisition.

Income Taxes

Income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 10.7 million, up 1.5 million from the prior quarter and up 3.6 million from the third quarter of 2023. The effective tax rate
 was 21.9 for the third quarter of 2024 compared to 22.0 for the prior quarter and 22.4 for the third quarter of 2023.

Income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 29.3 million, up 3.9 million from the same period in 2023 due to an increase in pre-tax net income. The effective tax rate was
 21.9 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 22.3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in the effective tax rate from 2023 was due to a higher level of tax-exempt income as a percentage of total taxable
 income.

Loans are summarized by business line which do not align to how the Company assesses credit risk in the allowance for credit losses.

Total loans increased by 256.3 million, or 3.5 annualized, from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024. Excluding the other consumer and residential solar portfolios that are in a planned run-off
 status, period end loans increased 384.4 million, or 6.0 annualized. Commercial and industrial loans increased 104.7 million to 1.46 billion; commercial real estate loans increased 165.6 million to 3.79 billion; and total consumer loans
 decreased 13.9 million to 4.66 billion. Total loans represent approximately 71.6 of assets as of September 30, 2024, as compared to 72.5 as of December 31, 2023.

Loans in the C I and CRE portfolios consist primarily of loans made to small and medium-sized entities. The Company offers a variety of loan options to meet the specific needs of our commercial
 customers including term loans, time notes and lines of credit. Such loans are made available to businesses for working capital needs such as inventory and receivables, business expansion, equipment purchases, livestock purchases and seasonal crop
 expenses. These loans are usually collateralized by business assets such as equipment, accounts receivable and perishable agricultural products, which are exposed to industry price volatility. The Company extends CRE loans to facilitate various
 real estate transactions, encompassing acquisitions, refinancing, expansions and enhancements to both commercial and agricultural properties. These loans are secured by liens on real estate assets, covering a spectrum of properties including
 apartments, commercial structures, healthcare facilities and others, whether occupied by owners or non-owners. Risks associated with the CRE portfolio pertain to the borrowers capacity to meet interest and principal payments throughout the loan s
 duration, as well as their ability to secure financing upon the loan s maturity. The Company has a risk management framework that includes rigorous underwriting standards, targeted portfolio stress testing, interest rate sensitivities on commercial
 borrowers and comprehensive credit risk monitoring mechanisms. The Company remains vigilant in monitoring market trends, economic indicators and regulatory developments to promptly adapt our risk management strategies as needed.

Table of Contents 

Within the CRE portfolio, approximately 81 comprises Non-Owner Occupied CRE, with the remaining 19 being Owner-Occupied CRE. Non-Owner Occupied CRE includes diverse sectors across the Company s
 markets such as residential rental properties (43 ), and office spaces (18 ), along with retail, manufacturing, mixed use, hotels and others. Notably, office CRE loans account for 6 of the total outstanding loans, predominantly serving suburban
 medical and professional tenants across suburban and small urban markets. These loans carry an average size of 1.9 million, with 10 maturing over the next two years. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the total CRE construction and
 development loans amounted to 286.9 million and 347.2 million, respectively.

Allowance for Credit Losses, Provision for Loan Losses and Nonperforming Assets

Beginning January 1, 2023, the Company adopted ASU 2022-02 Financial Instruments - CECL Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures 
 which resulted in an insignificant change to the Company s methodology for estimating the allowance for credit losses on TDRs since December 31, 2022. The January 1, 2023 decrease in the allowance for credit loss on TDR loans relating to the
 adoption of ASU 2022-02 was 0.6 million, which increased retained earnings by 0.5 million and decreased the deferred tax asset by 0.1 million.

Management considers the accounting policy relating to the allowance for credit losses to be a critical estimate given the degree of judgment exercised in evaluating the level of the allowance
 required to estimate expected credit losses over the expected contractual life of our loan portfolio and the material effect that such judgments can have on the consolidated results of operations.

The CECL methodology requires an estimate of the credit losses expected over the life of a loan (or pool of loans). The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from, or
 added to, the loans amortized cost basis to present the net, lifetime amount expected to be collected on the loans. Loan losses are charged off against the allowance when management believes a loan balance is confirmed to be uncollectible.
 Expected recoveries do not exceed the aggregate of amounts previously charged-off and expected to be charged-off.

Required additions or reductions to the allowance for credit losses are made periodically by charges or credits to the provision for loan losses. These are necessary to maintain the allowance at a
 level which management believes is reasonably reflective of the overall loss expected over the contractual life of the loan portfolio, adjusted for expected prepayments. While management uses available information to recognize losses on loans,
 additions or reductions to the allowance may fluctuate from one reporting period to another. These fluctuations are reflective of changes in risk associated with portfolio content and/or changes in management s assessment of any or all of the
 determining factors discussed above. Management considers the allowance for credit losses to be appropriate based on evaluation and analysis of the loan portfolio.

Management estimates the allowance balance for credit losses using relevant available information, from internal and external sources, related to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and
 supportable forecasts. Historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses. Company historical loss experience was supplemented with peer information when there was insufficient loss data for the
 Company. Significant management judgment is required at each point in the measurement process.

The allowance for credit losses is measured on a collective (pool) basis, with both a quantitative and qualitative analysis that is applied on a quarterly basis, when similar risk characteristics
 exist. The respective quantitative allowance for each segment is measured using an econometric, discounted probability of default and loss given default modeling methodology in which distinct, segment-specific multi-variate regression models are
 applied to multiple, probabilistically weighted external economic forecasts. Under the discounted cash flows methodology, expected credit losses are estimated over the effective life of the loans by measuring the difference between the net present
 value of modeled cash flows and amortized cost basis. After quantitative considerations, management applies additional qualitative adjustments so that the allowance for credit loss is reflective of the estimate of lifetime losses that exist in the
 loan portfolio at the balance sheet date.

Portfolio segment is defined as the level at which an entity develops and documents a systematic methodology to determine its allowance for credit losses. Upon adoption of CECL, management revised the
 manner in which loans were pooled for similar risk characteristics. Management developed segments for estimating loss based on type of borrower and collateral which is generally based upon federal call report segmentation and have been combined or
 subsegmented as needed to ensure loans of similar risk profiles are appropriately pooled.

Additional information about our allowance for credit losses is included in Note 7 to the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as well as in the
 Critical Accounting Estimates section of Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The Company s management considers the allowance for credit losses to be appropriate based on evaluation and analysis
 of the loan portfolio.

Table of Contents 

The allowance for credit losses totaled 119.5 million at September 30, 2024, as compared to 120.5 million at June 30, 2024 and 114.6 million at September 30, 2023. The allowance for credit losses
 as a percentage of loans was 1.21 at September 30, 2024, compared to 1.22 at June 30, 2024 and 1.19 at September 30, 2023. The allowance for credit losses as of September 30, 2024 was consistent with the allowance estimates as of June 30, 2024.
 The increase in the allowance for credit losses from September 30, 2023 to September 30, 2024 was primarily due to providing for organic loan growth, the slowing of prepayment speed assumptions, including the change in prepayment model assumptions
 and an additional specific reserve established in the second quarter of 2024 relating to a commercial relationship individually evaluated for credit loss. These increases to the allowance for credit losses were partially offset by a change in
 forecast scenario weightings from 70 baseline and 30 downside to 80 baseline and 20 downside, and the shift in loan composition driven by other consumer and residential solar portfolios that are in a planned run-off status.

The allowance for credit losses as of September 30, 2023 incorporates the recording of 14.5 million of allowance for acquired Salisbury loans as of the acquisition date, which included both the 8.8
 million of non-PCD allowance recognized through the provision for loan losses and the 5.8 million of PCD allowance reclassified from loans.

The allowance for credit losses was 320.21 of nonperforming loans at September 30, 2024, compared to 316.37 at June 30, 2024 and 472.31 at September 30, 2023. The allowance for credit losses was
 358.45 of nonaccrual loans at September 30, 2024, compared to 346.71 of nonaccrual loans at June 30, 2024 and 552.67 of nonaccrual loans at September 30, 2023. The decline in the coverage of the allowance to nonperforming and nonaccrual loans
 from September 30, 2023 to September 30, 2024 largely relates to one nonperforming relationship that is individually evaluated for purposes of the allowance for credit losses which had a 1.7 million specific reserve established during the three
 months ended June 30, 2024.

The provision for loan losses was 2.9 million for three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 8.9 million in the prior quarter and 12.6 million for the same period in the prior year. Included in the
 provision expense for the three months ended September 30, 2023, was 8.8 million of acquisition-related provision for loan losses due to the Salisbury acquisition. Provision expense decreased compared to the prior quarter due lower levels of loan
 growth the third quarter of 2024 including the run-off of the other consumer and residential solar portfolios, the stabilization of expected prepayment assumptions impacting the expected life of the loan portfolio and a specific reserve established
 in the prior quarter relating to a commercial relationship previously placed in nonaccrual in the fourth quarter of 2023. Net charge-offs totaled 3.9 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net charge-offs of 3.7
 million during the second quarter of 2024 and 4.2 million in the third quarter of 2023. Net charge-offs to average loans was 16 bps for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 15 bps for the second quarter of 2024 and 18 bps for the
 three months ended September 30, 2023.

The provision for loan losses was 17.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 20.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Provision expense decreased from the same period
 in the prior year due to the 8.8 million of acquisition-related provision for loan losses due to the Salisbury acquisition recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, partially offset by providing for current year loan growth, the
 slowing of prepayment speed assumptions in the current year, changes in model assumptions including the extension of the expected duration of the portfolio and a specific reserve related to a commercial relationship previously placed in nonaccrual
 in the fourth quarter of 2023. Net charge-offs totaled 12.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net charge-offs of 11.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net charge-offs to average loans was
 17 bps for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 18 bps for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

As of September 30, 2024, the unfunded commitment reserve totaled 4.6 million, compared to 4.3 million as of June 30, 2024 and 4.8 million as of September 30, 2023.

Nonperforming assets consist of nonaccrual loans, loans over 90 days past due and still accruing, troubled loans modifications, OREO and nonperforming securities. Loans are
 generally placed on nonaccrual when principal or interest payments become 90 days past due, unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection. Loans may also be placed on nonaccrual when circumstances indicate that the borrower may
 be unable to meet the contractual principal or interest payments. The threshold for evaluating classified commercial and commercial real estate loans risk graded substandard or doubtful, and nonperforming loans individually evaluated for credit
 loss is 1.0 million. OREO represents property acquired through foreclosure and is valued at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value, less any estimated disposal costs.

Total nonperforming assets were 37.4 million at September 30, 2024, compared to 37.9 million at December 31, 2023 and 24.3 million at September 30, 2023. Nonperforming loans at September 30, 2024
 were 37.3 million or 0.38 of total loans, compared with 37.9 million or 0.39 of total loans at December 31, 2023 and 24.3 million or 0.25 of total loans at September 30, 2023. The increase in nonperforming assets from the same period in the
 prior year was attributable to a diversified, multi-tenant commercial real estate development relationship that was placed into a nonaccrual status in the fourth quarter of 2023, in which NBT is a participant. The relationship is being actively
 managed, as noted above, a 1.7 million specific reserve was established during the three months ended June 30, 2024 for this relationship. Total nonaccrual loans were 33.3 million or 0.34 of total loans at September 30, 2024, compared to 34.2
 million or 0.35 of total loans at December 31, 2023 and 20.7 million or 0.21 of total loans at September 30, 2023. Past due loans as a percentage of total loans was 0.36 at September 30, 2024, up from 0.32 at December 31, 2023 and down from
 0.49 at September 30, 2023.

In addition to nonperforming loans discussed above, the Company has also identified approximately 119.9 million in potential problem loans at September 30, 2024 as compared to 87.7 million at
 December 31, 2023 and 92.4 million at September 30, 2023. Potential problem loans are loans that are currently performing, with a possibility of loss if weaknesses are not corrected. Such loans may need to be disclosed as nonperforming at some
 time in the future. Potential problem loans are classified by the Company s loan rating system as substandard. Potential problem loans have increased to more normalized levels and the increase primarily relates to a few commercial real estate
 relationships reflecting changing conditions in commercial real estate markets including construction delays, rising costs and delays in leasing up spaces. The increase in potential problem loans at September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023
 and September 30, 2023 is primarily due to the net migration of commercial loan balances of 32.9 million and 27.2 million, respectively, to substandard, the majority of which is adequately secured by real estate collateral. Management cannot
 predict the extent to which economic conditions may worsen or other factors, which may impact borrowers and the potential problem loans. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that other loans will not become over 90 days past due, be placed on
 nonaccrual, become troubled loans modifications or require increased allowance coverage and provision for loan losses. To mitigate this risk the Company maintains a diversified loan portfolio, has no significant concentration in any particular
 industry and originates loans primarily within its footprint.

Deposits

Total deposits were 11.59 billion at September 30, 2024, up 619.3 million, or 5.6 , from December 31, 2023. As of September 30, 2024, there were 250.0 million of brokered time deposits, up from
 155.2 million as of December 31, 2023. The increase in deposits was primarily due to higher consumer deposit balances and accounts and the inflow of seasonal municipal deposits. The Company continues to experience some incremental migration from
 noninterest bearing and low interest checking and savings accounts into higher cost money market and time deposit instruments. The Company s composition of total deposits is diverse and granular with over 563,000 accounts with an average per
 account balance of 20,560 as of September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 the estimated amounts of uninsured deposits based on the methodologies and assumptions used for the bank regulatory reporting were 4.81 billion and
 4.08 billion, respectively. Total average deposits increased 1.39 billion, or 14.1 , from the same period last year. The increase in average balances was primarily due to the 1.31 billion in deposits acquired from Salisbury in the third quarter
 of 2023.

Borrowed Funds

The Company s borrowed funds consist of short-term borrowings and long-term debt. Short-term borrowings totaled 205.0 million at September 30, 2024 compared to 386.7 million at December 31, 2023.
 Long-term debt was 29.7 million at September 30, 2024 compared to 29.8 million at December 31, 2023.

For more information about the Company s borrowing capacity and liquidity position, see Liquidity Risk below.

Subordinated Debt

On June 23, 2020, the Company issued 100.0 million of 5.00 fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes due 2030. The subordinated notes, which qualify as Tier 2 capital, bear interest at an annual
 rate of 5.00 , payable semi-annually in arrears commencing on January 1, 2021, and a floating rate of interest equivalent to the three-month SOFR plus a spread of 4.85 , payable quarterly in arrears commencing on October 1, 2025. The subordinated
 debt issuance cost of 2.2 million is being amortized on a straight-line basis into interest expense over five years. The Company repurchased 2.0 million of the subordinated notes in 2022 at a discount of 0.1 million.

Subordinated notes assumed in connection with the Salisbury acquisition included 25.0 million of 3.50 fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes due 2031. The subordinated notes, which qualify as
 Tier 2 capital, bear interest at an annual rate of 3.50 , payable quarterly in arrears commencing on June 30, 2021, and a floating rate of interest equivalent to the three-month SOFR plus a spread of 2.80 , payable quarterly in arrears commencing
 on June 30, 2026. As of the acquisition date, the fair value discount was 3.0 million, which will be amortized into interest expense over the expected call or maturity date.

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 the subordinated debt net of unamortized issuance costs and fair value discount was 120.8 million and 119.7 million, respectively.

Capital Resources

Stockholders equity of 1.52 billion represented 11.00 of total assets at September 30, 2024 compared with 1.43 billion, or 10.71 of total assets, as of December 31, 2023. Stockholders equity
 increased 96.3 million from December 31, 2023 driven by net income generation of 104.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and a decrease of 35.2 million in accumulated other comprehensive loss due primarily to the change in the
 fair value of securities available for sale, partially offset by dividends declared of 46.2 million.

The Company did not purchase shares of its common stock during the three months ended September 30, 2024. The Company purchased 7,600 shares of its common stock in the first and second quarters of
 2024 at an average price of 33.02 per share under its previously announced share repurchase program. The Company may repurchase shares of its common stock from time to time to mitigate the potential dilutive effects of stock-based incentive plans
 and other potential uses of common stock for corporate purposes. As of September 30, 2024, there were 1,992,400 shares available for repurchase under this plan authorized on December 18, 2023, which is set to expire on December 31, 2025.

As the capital ratios in the following table indicate, the Company remained well capitalized at September 30, 2024 under applicable bank regulatory requirements. Capital measurements are well in
 excess of regulatory minimum guidelines and meet the requirements to be considered well capitalized for all periods presented. To be considered well capitalized, tier 1 leverage, common equity tier 1 capital, tier 1 capital and total risk-based

In March 2020, the OCC, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the FDIC announced an interim final rule to delay the estimated impact on regulatory capital stemming from the
 implementation of CECL. Under the modified CECL transition provision, the regulatory capital impact of the January 1, 2020 CECL adoption date adjustment to the allowance for credit losses (after-tax) has been deferred and will phase into regulatory
 capital at 25 per year commencing January 1, 2022. For the ongoing impact of CECL, the Company was allowed to defer the regulatory capital impact of the allowance for credit losses in an amount equal to 25 of the change in the allowance for
 credit losses (pre-tax) recognized through earnings for each period between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2021. The cumulative adjustment to the allowance for credit losses between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2021, will also phase into
 regulatory capital at 25 per year commencing January 1, 2022. The Company adopted the capital transition relief over the permissible five-year period.

Liquidity and Interest Rate Sensitivity Management

Market Risk

Interest rate risk is the most significant market risk affecting the Company. Other types of market risk, such as foreign currency exchange rate risk and commodity price risk, do not arise in the
 normal course of the Company s business activities or are immaterial to the results of operations.

Interest rate risk is defined as an exposure to a movement in interest rates that could have an adverse effect on the Company s net interest income. Net interest income is susceptible to interest rate
 risk to the degree that interest-bearing liabilities mature or reprice on a different basis than earning assets. When interest-bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly than earning assets in a given period, a significant increase in
 market rates of interest could adversely affect net interest income. Similarly, when earning assets mature or reprice more quickly than interest-bearing liabilities, falling interest rates could result in a decrease in net interest income.

To manage the Company s exposure to changes in interest rates, management monitors the Company s interest rate risk. Management s Asset Liability Committee ALCO meets monthly to review the
 Company s interest rate risk position and profitability and to recommend strategies for consideration by the Board of Directors (the Board ). Management also reviews loan and deposit pricing and the Company s securities portfolio, formulates
 investment and funding strategies and oversees the timing and implementation of transactions to assure attainment of the Board s objectives in the most effective manner. Notwithstanding the Company s interest rate risk management activities, the
 potential for changing interest rates is an uncertainty that can have an adverse effect on net income.

In managing the Company s asset/liability position, the Board and management aim to manage the Company s interest rate risk while minimizing net interest margin compression. At times, depending on the
 level of general interest rates, the relationship between long and short-term interest rates, market conditions and competitive factors, the Board and management may determine to increase the Company s interest rate risk position somewhat in order
 to increase its net interest margin. The Company s results of operations and net portfolio values remain vulnerable to changes in interest rates and fluctuations in the difference between long and short-term interest rates.

The primary tool utilized by the ALCO to manage interest rate risk is earnings at risk modeling (interest rate sensitivity analysis). Information, such as principal balance, interest rate, maturity
 date, cash flows, next repricing date (if needed) and current rates are uploaded into the model to create an ending balance sheet. In addition, the ALCO makes certain assumptions regarding prepayment speeds for loans and mortgage related investment
 securities along with any optionality within the deposits and borrowings. The model is first run under an assumption of a flat rate scenario (i.e. no change in current interest rates) with a static balance sheet. Four additional models are run in
 which a gradual increase of 200 bps, a gradual increase of 100 bps, a gradual decrease of 100 bps and a gradual decrease of 200 bps takes place over a 12-month period with a static balance sheet. Under these scenarios, assets subject to prepayments
 are adjusted to account for faster or slower prepayment assumptions. Any investment securities or borrowings that have callable options embedded in them are handled accordingly based on the interest rate scenario. The resulting changes in net
 interest income are then measured against the flat rate scenario. The Company also runs other interest rate scenarios to highlight potential interest rate risk.

Table of Contents 

The Company s Interest Rate Sensitivity has remained in a near neutral position. In the declining rate scenario, net interest income is projected to modestly decrease when compared to the forecasted
 net interest income in the flat rate scenario through the simulation period. The decrease in net interest income is a result of earning assets repricing and rolling over at lower yields at a faster pace than interest-bearing liabilities decline
 and/or reach their floors. In the rising rate scenarios, net interest income is near neutral, impacted by slowing prepayments speeds and increased deposit reactivity; the magnitude of potential impact on earnings may be affected by the ability to
 lag deposit repricing on NOW, savings, money market deposit accounts and time accounts. Net interest income for the next twelve months in the +200/+100/-100/-200 bp scenarios, as described above, is within the internal policy risk limits of not
 more than a 7.5 reduction in net interest income. The following table summarizes the percentage change in net interest income in the rising and declining rate scenarios over a 12-month period from the forecasted net interest income in the flat
 rate scenario using the September 30, 2024 balance sheet position:

The Company anticipates that the trajectory of net interest income will continue to depend significantly on the timing and path of short to mid-term interest rates which are heavily driven by
 inflationary pressures and FOMC monetary policy. In response to the economic impact of the pandemic, the federal funds rate was reduced to near zero in March 2020, term interest rates fell sharply across the yield curve and the Company reduced
 deposit rates. Post-pandemic, inflationary pressures have resulted in a higher overall yield curve with Federal Funds increases of 425 bps in 2022 with an additional 100 bps of increases in 2023. However, the tightening cycle ended in September of
 2024 with the Federal Reserve lowering the federal funds rate by 50 bps. While deposit rates increased meaningfully in 2023 and have continued to increase in early 2024 in conjunction with elevated short-term interest rates, the recent federal
 funds rate reduction has provided the catalyst for the Company to begin reducing deposit rates. The Company continues to focus on managing deposit expense in an environment of still elevated but declining short-term interest rates while allowing
 assets to reprice upward in relation to existing portfolio asset yields.

Liquidity Risk

Liquidity risk arises from the possibility that the Company may not be able to satisfy current or future financial commitments or may become unduly reliant on alternate funding sources. The objective
 of liquidity management is to ensure the Company can fund balance sheet growth, meet the cash flow requirements of depositors wanting to withdraw funds or borrowers needing assurance that sufficient funds will be available to meet their credit
 needs. ALCO is responsible for liquidity management and has developed guidelines, which cover all assets and liabilities, as well as off-balance sheet items that are potential sources or uses of liquidity. Liquidity policies must also provide the
 flexibility to implement appropriate strategies, along with regular monitoring of liquidity and testing of the contingent liquidity plan. Requirements change as loans grow, deposits and securities mature and payments on borrowings are made.
 Liquidity management includes a focus on interest rate sensitivity management with a goal of avoiding widely fluctuating net interest margins through periods of changing economic conditions. Loan repayments and maturing investment securities are a
 relatively predictable source of funds. However, deposit flows, calls of investment securities and prepayments of loans and mortgage-related securities are strongly influenced by interest rates, the housing market, general and local economic
 conditions, and competition in the marketplace. Management continually monitors marketplace trends to identify patterns that might improve the predictability of the timing of deposit flows or asset prepayments.

The primary liquidity measurement the Company utilizes is called Basic Surplus, which captures the adequacy of its access to reliable sources of cash relative to the stability of its funding mix of
 average liabilities. This approach recognizes the importance of balancing levels of cash flow liquidity from short and long-term securities with the availability of dependable borrowing sources, which can be accessed when necessary. At September
 30, 2024, the Company s Basic Surplus measurement was 16.4 of total assets, or 2.26 billion, as compared to the December 31, 2023 Basic Surplus of 11.6 , or 1.54 billion, and was above the Company s minimum of 5 (calculated at 692.0 million
 and 665.5 million of period end total assets as September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively) set forth in its liquidity policies.

50 

Table of Contents 

At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, FHLB advances outstanding totaled 129.6 million and 322.7 million, respectively. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Bank had 194.0 million
 and 77.0 million, respectively, of collateral encumbered by municipal letters of credit. The Bank is a member of the FHLB system and had additional borrowing capacity from the FHLB of approximately 1.63 billion at September 30, 2024 and 1.11
 billion at December 31, 2023. In addition, unpledged securities could have been used to increase borrowing capacity at the FHLB by an additional 807.7 million and 823.3 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, or used to
 collateralize other borrowings, such as repurchase agreements. The Company also has the ability to issue brokered time deposits and to borrow against established borrowing facilities with other banks (federal funds), which could provide additional
 liquidity of 2.06 billion at September 30, 2024 and 2.01 billion at December 31, 2023. In addition, the Bank has a Borrower-in-Custody program with the FRB with the addition of the ability to pledge automobile and residential solar loans as
 collateral. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Bank had the capacity to borrow 1.12 billion and 1.02 billion, respectively, from this program. The Company s internal policy authorizes borrowing up to 25 of assets. Under this
 policy, remaining available borrowing capacity totaled 3.41 billion at September 30, 2024 and 2.99 billion at December 31, 2023.

This Basic Surplus approach enables the Company to appropriately manage liquidity from both operational and contingency perspectives. By tempering the need for cash flow liquidity with
 reliable borrowing facilities, the Company is able to operate with a more fully invested and, therefore, higher interest income generating securities portfolio. The makeup and term structure of the securities portfolio is, in part, impacted by
 the overall interest rate sensitivity of the balance sheet. Investment decisions and deposit pricing strategies are impacted by the liquidity position. The Company considers its Basic Surplus position to be strong. However, certain events may
 adversely impact the Company s liquidity position in 2024 . While short-term interest rates have declined, they remain elevated related to recent history, which could result in deposit declines as depositors have alternative opportunities
 for yield on their excess funds. In the current economic environment, draws against lines of credit could drive asset growth higher. Disruptions in wholesale funding markets could spark increased competition for deposits. These scenarios could lead
 to a decrease in the Company s Basic Surplus measure below the minimum policy level of 5 . Note, enhanced liquidity monitoring was put in place to quickly respond to the changing environment during the pandemic including increasing the frequency of
 monitoring and adding additional sources of liquidity. While the pandemic has come to an end, this enhanced monitoring continues as elevated interest rates and the recent bank failures have led to a deposit decline in the banking system and
 increased volatility to liquidity risk.

At September 30, 2024, a portion of the Company s loans and securities were pledged as collateral on borrowings. Therefore, once on-balance sheet liquidity is reduced, future growth of earning assets
 will depend upon the Company s ability to obtain additional funding, through growth of core deposits and collateral management and may require further use of brokered time deposits or other higher cost borrowing arrangements.

The Company s primary source of funds is dividends from its subsidiaries. Various laws and regulations restrict the ability of banks to pay dividends to their stockholders. Generally, the payment of
 dividends by the Company in the future as well as the payment of interest on the capital securities will require the generation of sufficient future earnings by its subsidiaries.

Certain restrictions exist regarding the ability of the Bank to transfer funds to the Company in the form of cash dividends. The approval of the OCC is required to pay dividends when a bank fails to
 meet certain minimum regulatory capital standards or when such dividends are in excess of a subsidiary bank s earnings retained in the current year plus retained net profits for the preceding two years as specified in applicable OCC regulations. At
 September 30, 2024, approximately 95.8 million of the total stockholders equity of the Bank was available for payment of dividends to the Company without approval by the OCC. The Bank s ability to pay dividends is also subject to the Bank being
 in compliance with regulatory capital requirements. The Bank is currently in compliance with these requirements. Under the State of Delaware General Corporation Law, the Company may declare and pay dividends either out of accumulated net retained
 earnings or capital surplus.

RISK FACTORS

Except as set for below, there are no material changes to the risk factors as previously discussed in Part I, Item 1A. of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Risks Related to the Merger

The Merger is subject to a number of conditions, including the receipt of waivers and/or approvals from governmental
 authorities, that may delay the Merger or adversely impact the Company s and Evans s ability to complete the Merger.

The completion of the Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions. Before the Merger may be completed, certain
 approvals, waivers or consents must be obtained from federal governmental authorities, including the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the OCC. Satisfying the requirements of these governmental authorities may delay the date of completion of
 the Merger. In addition, these governmental authorities may include conditions on the completion of the Merger or require changes to the terms of the Merger. While it is currently anticipated that the Merger will be completed promptly following
 the receipt of all required regulatory and shareholder approvals, there can be no assurance that the conditions to closing will be satisfied in a timely manner or at all, or that an effect, event, development or change will not transpire that
 could delay or prevent these conditions from being satisfied or impose additional costs on or limit the revenues of the Company following the Merger, any of which might have a material adverse effect on the Company following the Merger. The
 parties are not obligated to complete the Merger should any regulatory approval contain a condition, restriction or requirement that our Board of Directors reasonably determines in good faith would, individually or in the aggregate, materially
 reduce the benefits of the Merger to such a degree that the Company would not have entered into the Merger Agreement had such condition, restriction or requirement been known at the date of the Merger Agreement.

The Company and Evans cannot provide any assurances with respect to the timing of the closing of the Merger, whether the Merger will be completed
 at all or when Evans shareholders would receive the consideration for the Merger, if at all.

52 

Table of Contents 

The market price of the Company s common stock may decline as a result of the Merger and the market price of the Company s
 common stock after the consummation of the Merger may be affected by factors different from those affecting the price of the Company s common stock before the Merger.

The market price of the Company s common stock may decline as a result of the Merger if the Company does not achieve the perceived benefits of the
 Merger or the effect of the Merger on the Company s financial results is not consistent with the expectations of financial or industry analysts.

In addition, the consummation of the Merger will result in the combination of two companies that currently operate as independent companies. The
 business of the Company and the business of Evans differ. As a result, while the Company expects to benefit from certain synergies following the Merger, the Company may also encounter new risks and liabilities associated with these differences.
 Following the Merger, shareholders of the Company and Evans will own interests in a combined company operating an expanded business and may not wish to continue to invest in the Company, or for other reasons may wish to dispose of some or all
 of the Company s common stock. If, following the effective time of the Merger, large amounts of the Company s common stock are sold, the price of the Company s common stock could decline.

Further, the results of operations of the Company and the market price of the Company s common stock after the Merger may be affected by factors
 different from those currently affecting the independent results of operations of each of the Company and Evans and the market price of the Company s common stock. Accordingly, the Company s historical market prices and financial results may
 not be indicative of these matters for the Company after the Merger.

The Merger Agreement may be terminated in accordance with its terms and the Merger may not be completed.

The Company and Evans can mutually agree to terminate the Merger Agreement at any time before the Merger has been completed, and either company can
 terminate the Merger Agreement if:

any regulatory approval required for consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement has been
 denied by final, nonappealable action of any regulatory authority, or an application for regulatory approval has been permanently withdrawn at the request of a governmental authority;

the required approval of the Merger Agreement by the Evans shareholders is not obtained;

the other party materially breaches any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements set forth in the Merger
 Agreement (provided that the terminating party is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained in the Merger Agreement), which breach is not cured within 30 days of written notice of
 the breach, or by its nature cannot be cured prior to the closing of the Merger, and such breach would entitle the non-breaching party not to consummate the Merger; or

the Merger is not consummated by September 15, 2025, unless the failure to consummate the Merger by such date is due to a material
 breach of the Merger Agreement by the terminating party.

In addition, the Company may terminate the Merger Agreement if:

Evans materially breaches the non-solicitation provisions in the Merger Agreement; or

the Evans Board of Directors:

fails to recommend approval of the Merger Agreement, or withdraws, modifies or changes such recommendation in a manner adverse to the
 Company s interests;

recommends, proposes or publicly announces its intention to recommend or propose to engage in an acquisition transaction with any person
 other than the Company or any of its subsidiaries; or

Evans fails to call, give notice of, convene and hold its special meeting.

Failure to complete the merger could negatively impact the stock price of the Company and its future business and financial
 results.

Completion of the Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions, including approval by Evans shareholders of the
 Merger. The Company cannot guarantee when or if these conditions will be satisfied or that the Merger will be successfully completed. The consummation of the Merger may be delayed, the Merger may be consummated on terms different than those
 contemplated by the Merger Agreement, or the Merger may not be consummated at all. If the Merger is not completed, the ongoing business of the Company may be adversely affected, and the Company will be subject to several risks, including the
 following:

the Company could incur substantial costs relating to the proposed Merger, such as legal, accounting, financial advisor,
 filing, printing and mailing fees; and

the Company s management s and employees attention may be diverted from their day-to-day business and operational matters as
 a result of efforts relating to the attempt to consummate the Merger.

In addition, if the Merger is not completed, the Company may experience negative reactions from the financial markets and from its customers
 and employees. The Company also could be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the merger or to enforcement proceedings commenced against the Company to perform its obligations under the Merger Agreement. If the Merger is not
 completed, the Company cannot assure its stockholders that the risks described above will not materialize and will not materially affect the Company s business and financial results or the stock price of the Company.

The integration of the Company and Evans will present significant challenges and expenses that may result in the combined
 business not operating as effectively as expected, or in the failure to achieve some or all of the anticipated benefits of the transaction.

The benefits and synergies expected to result from the proposed Merger will depend in part on whether the operations of Evans can be
 integrated in a timely and efficient manner with those of the Company. The Company will face challenges and costs in consolidating its functions with those of Evans, and integrating the organizations, procedures and operations of the two
 businesses. The integration of the Company and Evans will be complex and time-consuming, and the management of both companies will have to dedicate substantial time and resources to it. These efforts could divert management s focus and
 resources from serving existing customers or other strategic opportunities and from day-to-day operational matters during the integration process. Failure to successfully integrate the operations of the Company and Evans could result in the
 failure to achieve some of the anticipated benefits from the transaction, including cost savings and other operating efficiencies, and the Company may not be able to capitalize on the existing relationships of Evans to the extent anticipated,
 or it may take longer, or be more difficult or expensive than expected to achieve these goals. This could have an adverse effect on the business, results of operations, financial condition or prospects of the Company and/or the Bank after the
 transaction.

Unanticipated costs relating to the merger could reduce the Company s future earnings per share.

The Company BT has incurred substantial legal, accounting, financial advisory and other Merger-related costs, and management has devoted
 considerable time and effort in connection with the Merger. If the Merger is not completed, the Company will bear certain fees and expenses associated with the Merger without realizing the benefits of the Merger. If the Merger is completed, the
 Company expects to incur substantial expenses in connection with integrating the business, operations, network, systems, technologies, policies and procedures of the two companies. The fees and expenses may be significant and could have an
 adverse impact on the Company s results of operations.

The Company believes that it has reasonably estimated the likely costs of integrating the operations of the Company and Evans, and the
 incremental costs of operating as a combined company. However, it is possible that unexpected transaction costs such as taxes, fees or professional expenses or unexpected future operating expenses such as increased personnel costs or increased
 taxes, as well as other types of unanticipated adverse developments, could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations and financial condition of the combined company. If unexpected costs are incurred, the Merger could have a
 dilutive effect on the Company s earnings per share. In other words, if the Merger is completed, the earnings per share of the Company s common stock could be less than anticipated or even less than if the Merger had not been completed.

Estimates as to the future value of the combined company are inherently uncertain.

Any estimates as to the future value of the combined company, including estimates regarding the earnings per share of the combined company, are
 inherently uncertain. The future value of the combined company will depend upon, among other factors, the combined company s ability to achieve projected revenue and earnings expectations and to realize the anticipated synergies, all of which
 are subject to the risks and uncertainties described in these risk factors.

Following the Merger, the Company may not continue to pay dividends at or above the rate currently paid.

Following the Merger, the Company s stockholders may not receive dividends at the same rate that they did as stockholders of the Company prior to
 the Merger for various reasons, including the following:

the Company may not have enough cash to pay such dividends due to changes in its cash requirements, capital spending plans, cash flow or
 financial position;

decisions on whether, when and in what amounts to make any future dividends will remain at all times entirely at the discretion of the
 Board of Directors, which reserves the right to change the Company s dividend practices at any time and for any reason; and

the amount of dividends that the Company s subsidiaries may distribute to the Company may be subject to restrictions imposed by state
 law and restrictions imposed by the terms of any current or future indebtedness that these subsidiaries may incur.

The Company s stockholders will have no contractual or other legal right to dividends that have not been declared by the Board of Directors.
