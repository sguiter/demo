The Company operates in a continually changing business environment and new factors emerge from time to time. The Company cannot predict such factors, nor can it assess the impact, if any, of such factors on its results of operations, financial condition or cash flow. Accordingly, forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as a predictor of actual results. The Company disclaims any responsibility to update any forward-looking statement provided in this Form 10-Q.

The purchase price was funded through existing cash and borrowings under the Company s credit agreement. 
 During the first quarter of 2024, the Company finalized the Trackless purchase price allocation and recognized measurement period adjustments, which primarily resulted from obtaining third-party valuations, that reduced the estimated fair value of contingent consideration by million and increased the carrying value of acquired intangible assets by million, resulting in a corresponding million decrease to the carrying value of Goodwill, from the million previously recognized as of December 31, 2023.

 As more fully described within Note 12 Fair Value Measurements, the Company uses a three-level fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. The fair value of the Company s long-term borrowings and finance lease obligations is based on interest rates that we believe are currently available to us for issuance of debt with similar terms and remaining maturities (Level 2 input). The carrying amounts of the Company s long-term borrowings and finance lease obligations approximate their fair values as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 The 2022 Credit Agreement is a senior secured credit facility that provides the Company and certain of its foreign subsidiaries access to an aggregate original principal amount of up to million, consisting of (i) a revolving credit facility in an amount up to million (the Revolver and (ii) a term loan facility in an original amount of up to million. The 2022 Credit Agreement matures on October 21, 2027. 
 On May 16, 2024, the Company entered into the First Amendment to the 2022 Credit Agreement. The amendment was largely administrative in nature, including certain language to address ongoing reference rate reform. There were no changes to the term or the Company s borrowing capacity under the 2022 Credit Agreement. 
 Borrowings under the 2022 Credit Agreement bear interest, at the Company s option, at a base rate or an Adjusted Eurocurrency Rate (as defined in the 2022 Credit Agreement) in the case of borrowings in Euros or an adjusted RFR (as defined in the 2022 Credit Agreement) in the case of borrowings in U.S. Dollars, Canadian Dollars and Sterling, plus, in each case, an applicable margin. The applicable margin ranges from to for base rate borrowings and to for Adjusted Eurocurrency Rate and RFR borrowings. The Company must also pay a commitment fee to the lenders ranging between to per annum on the unused portion of the Revolver along with other standard fees. Applicable margin, issuance fees and other customary expenses are payable on outstanding letters of credit. 
 The Company is subject to certain net leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio financial covenants under the 2022 Credit Agreement that are measured at each fiscal quarter-end. The Company was in compliance with all such covenants as of September 30, 2024. 
 As of September 30, 2024, there was million of cash drawn on the Revolver, million outstanding under the term loan facility and million of undrawn letters of credit under the 2022 Credit Agreement, with million of net availability for borrowings. As of December 31, 2023, there was million of cash drawn on the Revolver, million outstanding under the term loan facility and million of undrawn letters of credit under the 2022 Credit Agreement, with million of net availability for borrowings.

 million, as a means of fixing the floating interest rate component on million of its variable-rate debt. The 2022 Swap is designated as a cash flow hedge, with an original maturity date of October 31, 2025. 
 On July 11, 2023, the Company entered into an additional interest rate swap (the 2023 Swap with a notional amount of million, as a means of fixing the floating interest rate component on million of its variable-rate debt. The 2023 Swap is designated as a cash flow hedge, with an original maturity date of August 1, 2025. 
 As a result of the application of hedge accounting treatment, all unrealized gains and losses related to the derivative instruments are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss and are reclassified into operations in the same period in which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Hedge effectiveness is assessed quarterly. The Company does not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. 
 The fair value of the Company s interest rate swaps is derived from a discounted cash flow analysis based on the terms of the contract and the interest rate curve (Level 2 inputs) and measured on a recurring basis in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the fair value of the Company s interest rate swaps was a liability of million and million, respectively, which were included in Other long-term liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, unrealized pre-tax losses of million and million, respectively, were recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, unrealized pre-tax gains of million and million, respectively, were recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss. No ineffectiveness was recorded in either period. 
 In connection with entering into the 2022 Credit Agreement in October 2022, the Company terminated an interest rate swap initially entered into in 2019, receiving proceeds of million upon settlement. The settlement gain was recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss and was amortized into earnings ratably through the original maturity date of July 30, 2024. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized non-cash settlement gains of million and million, respectively, as a component of Interest expense, net on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized non-cash settlement gains of million and million, respectively, as a component of Interest expense, net on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.

 million, including interest of million, was recorded as an income tax receivable as of December 31, 2023, fully offset by a corresponding liability for unrecognized tax benefits. 
 During the first quarter of 2024, the tax authorities notified the Company that the amended tax returns had been approved, at which point receipt of the refund claim was considered more-likely-than-not. As a result, the Company released the associated liability for unrecognized tax benefits and recognized a million discrete tax benefit for the U.S. federal refund claim, net of taxes on the associated interest. During the second quarter of 2024, the Company received the U.S. federal income tax refund and began amending applicable state tax returns to reflect the worthless stock deduction, resulting in the recognition of a million discrete state tax benefit. 
 The Company recognized income tax expense of million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to million in the prior-year quarter, with the increase primarily due to higher pre-tax income levels. The Company s effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was , compared to in the prior-year quarter. 
 Including the discrete tax benefits associated with the worthless stock deduction, which aggregated to million, and the recognition of million in excess tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation activity, the Company recognized income tax expense of million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, resulting in an effective tax rate of . For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized income tax expense of million, resulting in an

 In October 2024, the Company executed an amendment to the Federal Signal Corporation Retirement Plan the Plan ), which enabled the Company to announce a limited-time voluntary lump-sum pension offering to eligible plan participants. The lump-sum settlement payments will be made during the fourth quarter of 2024, using assets from the Plan. In connection with the lump-sum offering, the Company expects to incur a pre-tax, non-cash settlement charge of up to million in the fourth quarter of 2024, when the lump sum settlements are expected to be paid. The Company also anticipates that the lump-sum offering will result in a decrease in the Company s Long-term pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities as presented on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.

 million. If any such letters of credit or bonds are called, the Company would be obligated to reimburse the issuer of the letter of credit or bond. The Company believes the likelihood of any currently outstanding letter of credit or bond being called is remote. 
 Product Warranties 
 The Company issues product performance warranties to customers with the sale of its products. The specific terms and conditions of these warranties vary depending upon the product sold and country in which the Company does business, with warranty periods generally ranging from one to . The Company estimates the costs that may be incurred under its basic limited warranty and records a liability in the amount of such costs at the time the sale of the related product is recognized. Factors that affect the Company s warranty liability include (i) the number of units under warranty, (ii) historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims and (iii) costs per claim. The Company periodically assesses the adequacy of its recorded warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary.

 Legal Proceedings 
 The Company is subject to various claims, including pending and possible legal actions for product liability and other damages, and other matters arising in the ordinary course of the Company s business. On a quarterly basis, the Company reviews uninsured material legal claims against the Company and accrues for the costs of such claims as appropriate in the exercise of management s best judgment and experience. However, due to a lack of factual information available to the Company about a claim, or the procedural stage of a claim, it may not be possible for the Company to reasonably assess either the probability of a favorable or unfavorable outcome of the claim or to reasonably estimate the amount of loss should there be an unfavorable outcome. Therefore, for many claims, the Company cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss. 
 The Company believes, based on current knowledge and after consultation with counsel, that the outcome of such claims and actions will not have a material adverse effect on the Company s results of operations or financial condition. However, in the event of unexpected future developments, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of such matters, if unfavorable, could have a material adverse effect on the Company s results of operations, financial condition or cash flow. 
 Hearing Loss Litigation 
 The Company has been sued for monetary damages by firefighters claiming that exposure to the Company s sirens impaired their hearing and the sirens are therefore defective. Between 1999 and 2013, cases were filed on behalf of a total of plaintiffs in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois. The trial of the first of these plaintiffs claims occurred in 2008, whereby a Cook County jury returned a unanimous verdict in favor of the Company. In 2009, a trial was held on behalf of Chicago firefighter plaintiffs and concluded with a verdict for the plaintiffs in varying amounts totaling million. Following appeals, the Company satisfied the judgments, resulting in the final dismissal of the cases. A third consolidated trial involving Chicago firefighter plaintiffs occurred in November 2011.

Income tax expense 
 During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company filed amended U.S. federal income tax returns for the 2015 through 2018 tax years to claim a worthless stock deduction. As of December 31, 2023, the amended tax returns were under examination by the applicable tax authorities and recovery of the refund claim was not considered more-likely-than-not. Accordingly, the aggregate refund claim of 13.6 million, including interest of 1.8 million, was recorded as an income tax receivable as of December 31, 2023, fully offset by a corresponding liability for unrecognized tax benefits. 
 During the first quarter of 2024, the tax authorities notified the Company that the amended tax returns had been approved, at which point receipt of the refund claim was considered more-likely-than-not. As a result, the Company released the associated liability for unrecognized tax benefits and recognized a 13.0 million discrete tax benefit for the U.S. federal refund claim, net of taxes on the associated interest. During the second quarter of 2024, the Company received the U.S. federal income tax refund and began amending applicable state tax returns to reflect the worthless stock deduction, resulting in the recognition of a 2.6 million discrete state tax benefit. 
 The Company recognized income tax expense of 18.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 13.8 million in the prior-year quarter, with the increase primarily due to higher pre-tax income levels. The Company s effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 25.8 , compared to 24.2 in the prior-year quarter. 
 Including the discrete tax benefits associated with the worthless stock deduction, which aggregated to 15.6 million, and the recognition of 1.7 million in excess tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation activity, the Company recognized income tax expense of 34.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, resulting in an effective tax rate of 17.3 . For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recognized income tax expense of 33.5 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 23.2 . The Company s income tax expense and effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 also included the effects of the recognition of 1.9 million in excess tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation activity and a 0.6 million benefit associated with changes in tax reserves. 
 Net income 
 Net income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 10.6 million compared to the prior-year quarter, largely due to the aforementioned increase in income before taxes, partially offset by a 4.9 million increase in income tax expense. 
 Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 55.3 million compared to the prior-year period, largely due to the aforementioned increase in income before taxes, partially offset by a 1.2 million increase in income tax expense.

 Seasonality of Company s Business 
 Certain of the Company s businesses are susceptible to the influences of seasonal factors, including buying patterns, delivery patterns, and productivity influences from holiday periods and weather. In general, the Company tends to have lower equipment sales in the first calendar quarter of each year compared to other quarters as a result of these factors. In addition, rental income and parts sales are generally higher in the second and third quarters of the year, because many of the Company s products are used for maintenance activities in North America, where usage is typically lower during periods of harsher weather conditions.

Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 The Company uses its cash flow from operations to fund growth and to make capital investments that sustain its operations, reduce costs, or both. Beyond these uses, remaining cash is used to pay down debt, repurchase shares, fund dividend payments and make pension contributions. The Company may also choose to invest in the acquisition of businesses, like the acquisition of substantially all the assets and operations of Standard Equipment Company that was completed on October 4, 2024. In the absence of significant unanticipated cash demands, we believe that the Company s existing cash balances, cash flow from operations, and borrowings available under the Company s credit facility will provide funds sufficient for these purposes. 
 As of September 30, 2024, there was 107.0 million of cash drawn on the Revolver, 122.7 million outstanding under the term loan facility, and 11.1 million of undrawn letters of credit under the 2022 Credit Agreement, with 556.9 million of availability for borrowings. The net cash flows associated with the Company s rental equipment transactions are included in cash flow from operating activities. 
 The Company s cash and cash equivalents totaled 73.7 million and 61.0 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, 21.1 million of cash and cash equivalents was held by foreign subsidiaries. Cash and cash equivalents held by subsidiaries outside the U.S. typically are held in the currency of the country in which it is located. The Company uses this cash to fund the operating activities of its foreign subsidiaries and for further investment in foreign operations. Generally, the Company has considered such cash to be permanently reinvested in its foreign operations and the Company s current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate such cash to fund U.S. operations. However, in the event that these funds are needed to fund U.S. operations or to satisfy U.S. obligations, they generally could be repatriated. The repatriation of these funds may cause the Company to incur additional U.S. income tax expense, dependent on income tax laws and other circumstances at the time any such amounts are repatriated. 
 Net cash of 140.7 million was provided by operating activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 91.0 million in the prior-year period, with the year-over-year increase primarily due to higher net income and working capital improvements, partially offset by higher incentive-based compensation payments. 
 Net cash of 30.8 million was used for investing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 75.7 million in the prior-year period. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company funded 32.1 million of capital expenditures. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company made initial payments of 41.9 million and 13.2 million to acquire Trackless and Blasters, respectively, and funded 21.4 million of capital expenditures. 
 Net cash of 97.2 million was used for financing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 21.2 million in the prior-year period. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company paid down 64.4 million of borrowings under the Revolver and 1.6 million under its term loan facility, funded cash dividends of 22.0 million and share repurchases of 4.5 million, and redeemed 6.0 million of stock in order to remit funds to tax authorities to satisfy employees tax withholdings following the vesting of stock-based compensation and the exercise of stock options. In the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company increased debt borrowings by 4.6 million, funded cash dividends of 17.7 million and share repurchases of 4.3 million, and redeemed 5.6 million of stock in order to remit funds to tax authorities to satisfy employees tax withholdings following the vesting of stock-based compensation and the exercise of stock options. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company also paid 0.5 million to settle the contingent consideration obligation due to the former owners of MRL, and received 2.3 million from stock option exercises. 
 The Company is subject to certain net leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio financial covenants under the 2022 Credit Agreement that are measured at each fiscal quarter-end. The Company was in compliance with all such covenants as of September 30, 2024. 
 The Company anticipates that capital expenditures for 2024 will be in the range of 35 million to 40 million. 
 The Company believes that its financial resources and major sources of liquidity, including cash flow from operations and borrowing capacity, will be adequate to meet its operating needs, capital needs and financial commitments. 
 
 Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. 
 See Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk , of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there have been no significant changes in our exposure to market risk. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 As required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, the Company s management, with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or Rule 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 As a matter of practice, the Company s management continues to review and document internal control and procedures for financial reporting. From time to time, the Company may make changes aimed at enhancing the effectiveness of the controls and ensuring that the systems evolve with the business. There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2024.

 The Company also reported adjusted net income for the third quarter of 54.2 million, or 0.88 per diluted share, compared to 43.8 million, or 0.71 per diluted share, in the prior-year quarter. The Company is reporting adjusted results to facilitate comparisons of underlying performance on a year-over-year basis. A reconciliation of these and other non-GAAP measures is provided at the conclusion of this news release. 
 Organic Year-over-Year Net Sales Growth and Double-Digit Improvement in Earnings Raising EBITDA Margin Targets for the Safety and Security Systems Group 
 With our teams continued focus on operational execution and serving our customers, our businesses were able to deliver 6 year-over-year organic net sales growth, double-digit earnings improvement, gross margin expansion, and a 200-basis point increase in adjusted EBITDA margin during the third quarter, commented Jennifer L. Sherman, President and Chief Executive Officer. Our Environmental Solutions Group delivered 7 year-over-year net sales growth and a 21 increase in adjusted EBITDA. Production increases at several of our businesses and continued price realization were meaningful growth drivers. In addition, our third quarter results benefited from strong year-over-year growth in all four of our aftermarket revenue streams, which contributed to a 10 overall increase in aftermarket revenues. Our Safety and Security Systems Group also delivered impressive results, with 4 top line growth and an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 23 . With its consistently strong performance over the last several quarters, we are raising the EBITDA margin targets for our Safety and Security Systems Group to a new range of 18 to 24 , from the previous range of 17 to 21 . 
 In the Environmental Solutions Group, net sales for the third quarter were 398 million, up 25 million, or 7 , compared to the prior-year quarter. In the Safety and Security Systems Group, net sales were 76 million, up 3 million, or 4 , compared to the prior-year quarter. 
 Consolidated operating income for the third quarter was 75.9 million, up 13.4 million, or 21 , compared to the prior-year quarter. Consolidated operating margin for the third quarter was 16.0 , up from 14.0 in the prior-year quarter.

Consolidated adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was 93.0 million, up 14.5 million, or 18 , compared to the prior-year quarter, and consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin was 19.6 , up from 17.6 in the prior-year quarter. 
 In the Environmental Solutions Group, adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was 87.2 million, up 15.2 million, or 21 , compared to the prior-year quarter, and its adjusted EBITDA margin was 21.9 , up from 19.3 last year. In the Safety and Security Systems Group, adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was 17.8 million, up 3.2 million, or 22 , compared to the prior-year quarter, and its adjusted EBITDA margin was 23.4 , up from 19.9 last year. 
 Consolidated orders for the third quarter were 426 million, compared to 450 million in the prior-year quarter. Consolidated backlog at September 30, 2024 was 1.03 billion, an increase of 27 million, or 3 , from last year. 
 Increased Operating Cash Flow Further Strengthens Financial Position, Providing Flexibility to Fund Growth Opportunities and Cash Returns to Stockholders 
 Net cash provided by operating activities during the third quarter was 69 million, an increase of 21 million, or 43 , from the prior-year quarter. Net cash provided by operating activities in the first nine months of this year totaled 141 million, an increase of 50 million, or 55 , compared to the prior-year period. 
 At September 30, 2024, consolidated debt was 231 million, total cash and cash equivalents were 74 million, and the Company had 557 million of availability for borrowings under its credit facility. 
 Our operating cash flow generation this quarter was outstanding, enabling us to pay down approximately 25 million of debt during the quarter, said Sherman. So far this year, our operating cash flow has increased by 55 compared to last year, 
 further strengthening our financial position and providing significant flexibility to invest in organic growth initiatives, pursue additional strategic M&A opportunities, and fund cash returns to stockholders through dividends and opportunistic share repurchases. 
 The Company funded dividends of 7.3 million during the third quarter, reflecting a dividend of 0.12 per share, and recently announced a similar 0.12 per share dividend that will be payable in the fourth quarter of 2024. The Company also funded stock repurchases of 4.4 million during the third quarter. 
 Outlook 
 Demand for our products and aftermarket offerings remains high, with our order intake this quarter contributing to a backlog of 1.03 billion, an increase of 3 compared to last year, noted Sherman. With our third quarter performance, our current backlog, and continued execution against our strategic initiatives, we are raising our full-year adjusted EPS outlook to a new range of 3.30 to 3.40, from the prior range of 3.20 to 3.35. We are also narrowing our full-year net sales outlook to a new range of between 1.86 billion and 1.88 billion, from the previous range of 1.85 billion to 1.90 billion.

 Contact Ian Hudson, Chief Financial Officer, +1-630-954-2000, ihudson federalsignal.com 
 Adjusted earnings per share EPS is a non-GAAP measure, which includes certain adjustments to reported GAAP net income and diluted EPS. In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we made adjustments to exclude the impact of acquisition and integration-related expenses, net, and certain special income tax items, where applicable. In prior years, we have also made adjustments to exclude the impact of environmental remediation costs of a discontinued operation, purchase accounting effects, pension settlement charges, and certain other unusual or non-recurring items. Should any similar items occur in the remainder of 2024, we would expect to exclude them from the determination of adjusted EPS. However, because of the underlying uncertainty in quantifying amounts which may not yet be known, a reconciliation of our Adjusted EPS outlook to the most applicable GAAP measure is excluded based on the unreasonable efforts exception in Item 10(e)(1)(i)(B).

Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin 
 The Company uses adjusted EBITDA and the ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net sales adjusted EBITDA margin ), at both the consolidated and segment level, as additional measures which are representative of its underlying performance and to improve the comparability of results across reporting periods. We believe that investors use versions of these metrics in a similar manner. For these reasons, the Company believes that adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin, at both the consolidated and segment level, are meaningful metrics to investors in evaluating the Company s underlying financial performance. 
 Consolidated adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure that represents the total of net income, interest expense, net, acquisition and integration-related expenses, net, other expense, net, income tax expense, and depreciation and amortization expense, as applicable. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin is a non-GAAP measure that represents the total of net income, interest expense, net, acquisition and integration-related expenses, net, other expense, net, income tax expense, and depreciation and amortization expense, as applicable, divided by net sales for the applicable period(s). 
 Segment adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure that represents the total of segment operating income, acquisition and integration-related expenses, net, and depreciation and amortization expense, as applicable. Segment adjusted EBITDA margin is a non-GAAP measure that represents the total of segment operating income, acquisition and integration-related expenses, net, and depreciation and amortization expense, as applicable, divided by segment net sales for the applicable period(s). Segment operating income includes all revenues, costs and expenses directly related to the segment involved. In determining segment operating income, neither corporate nor interest expenses are included. Segment depreciation and amortization expense relates to those assets, both tangible and intangible, that are utilized by the respective segment. 
 Other companies may use different methods to calculate adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin.

Adjusted earnings per share EPS is a non-GAAP measure, which includes certain adjustments to reported GAAP net income and diluted EPS. In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we made adjustments to exclude the impact of acquisition and integration-related expenses, net, and certain special income tax items, where applicable. In prior years, we have also made adjustments to exclude the impact of environmental remediation costs of a discontinued operation, purchase accounting effects, pension settlement charges, and certain other unusual or non-recurring items. Should any similar items occur in the remainder of 2024, we would expect to exclude them from the determination of adjusted EPS. However, because of the underlying uncertainty in quantifying amounts which may not yet be known, a reconciliation of our Adjusted EPS outlook to the most applicable GAAP measure is excluded based on the unreasonable efforts exception in Item 10(e)(1)(i)(B).

Non-GAAP Measures Adjusted net income and earnings per share EPS - The Company believes that modifying its 2024 and 2023 net income and diluted EPS provides additional measures which are representative of the Company s underlying performance and improves the comparability of results between reporting periods. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, adjustments were made to reported GAAP net income and diluted EPS to exclude the impact of acquisition and integration-related expenses, net, environmental remediation costs of a discontinued operation, and certain special income tax items, where applicable. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin - The Company uses adjusted EBITDA and the ratio of adjusted EBITDA to net sales adjusted EBITDA margin ), at both the consolidated and segment level, as additional measures which are representative of its underlying performance and to improve the comparability of results across reporting periods.

Consolidated adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure that represents the total of net income, interest expense, net, acquisition and integration-related expenses, net, other expense, net, income tax expense, and depreciation and amortization expense.

Cash conversion is a non-GAAP measure that is computed by dividing net cash provided by operating activities by net income (represented as a percentage). The Company believes that cash conversion provides investors with a view of the Company s ability to convert its earnings into cash.
