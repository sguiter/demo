In the table above, unrealized holding gains (losses) relate to short-term investments that have been in a continuous unrealized gain (loss) position for less than . Our non-governmental debt securities primarily consist of corporate bonds, certificates of deposit and commercial paper. Our treasury and federal agencies primarily consist of U.S. Treasury bills and federal home loan debt securities. Realized gains or loss resulting from sales of investments were during the quarters and years to date ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023. Fair Value Measurements FASB ASC Topic 820 Fair Value Measurements establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. These tiers include: Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions. As of September 30, 2024, we held investments that are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis. These investments (available for sale) consist of non-governmental debt securities and treasury and federal agencies securities. Available for sale securities included in Level 2 are estimated based on observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, such as quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. All of our available for sale investments were measured under Level 2 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Additionally, money market funds of million and million included within cash and cash equivalents on our condensed consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, were measured under Level 1. Non-governmental debt securities of million included within cash and cash equivalents on our unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2024 were measured under Level 2. Federal agency debt securities of million and

During each of the quarters e nded September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded approximately million of loss and during the years to date ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded less than thousand dollars of loss and approximately million of loss, respectively, related to our equity affiliate within miscellaneous (expense) income on our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income.

Credit Agreement Termination of credit agreement On July 29, 2024, the Company gave notice of the termination of its credit agreement, dated as of September 8, 2021, as amended (the Credit Agreement ), by and among the Company, as borrower, certain of its subsidiary guarantors thereunder, the lenders from time-to-time parties thereto and Wintrust Bank N.A. (the Termination ). At the time of the Termination of the Credit Agreement, the Company was not in default under the Credit Agreement, r did it have any amounts outstanding thereunder. The Credit Agreement was due to mature on . The Company made the decision to terminate the Credit Agreement due to the Company s strong cash position and to avoid uncertainty under the Credit Agreement associated with newly effective Title IV financial responsibility requirements. The Termination was effective on July 30, 2024. Upon effectiveness of the Termination, all security interests and pledges granted to the secured parties under the Credit Agreement were terminated and released. The Company did not incur any material early termination penalties in connection with the Termination.

Performance Obligations Our revenue, which is derived primarily from academic programs taught to students who attend our universities, is generally segregated into two categories: (1) tuition and fees, and (2) other. Tuition and fees represent costs to our students for educational services provided by our universities and are reflected net of scholarships and tuition discounts. Our universities charge tuition and fees at varying amounts, depending on the university, the type of program and specific curriculum. Our universities bill students a single charge that covers tuition, certain fees and required program materials, such as textbooks and supplies, which we treat as a single performance obligation. Generally, we bill student tuition at the beginning of each academic term for our degree programs and recognize the tuition as revenue on a straight-line basis over the academic term. As part of a student s course of instruction, certain fees, such as technology fees and graduation fees, are billed separately to students. These fees are generally earned over the applicable term and are not considered separate performance obligations. We generally bill student tuition upon enrollment for our non-degree professional development programs and recognize the tuition as revenue on a straight-line basis over the length of the offering. Other revenue, which primarily consists of contract training revenue and miscellaneous non-student related revenue, is billed and recognized as goods are delivered or services are performed. Contract Assets For each term, the portion of tuition and fee payments received from students but not yet earned is recorded as deferred revenue and reported as a current liability on our condensed consolidated balance sheets, as we expect to earn these revenues within the next year. A contract asset is recorded for each student for the current term for which they are enrolled for the amount charged for the current term that has not yet been received as payment and to which we do not have the unconditional right to receive payment because the student has not reached the point in the student s current academic term at which the amount billed is no longer refundable to the student. On a student by student basis, the contract asset is offset against the deferred revenue balance for the current term and the net deferred revenue balance is reflected within current liabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. For certain of our institutions, students are billed as they enroll in courses, including courses related to future periods. Any billings for future periods would meet the definition of a contract asset as we do not have the unconditional right to receive payment as the course has not yet started. Contract assets related to future periods are offset against the respective deferred revenue associated with the future period. Due to the short-term nature of our academic terms, the contract asset balance which exists at the beginning of each quarter will no longer be a contract asset at the end of that quarter, with the exception of the contract assets associated with future periods. The decrease in contract asset balances are a result of one of the following: it becomes a student receivable balance once a student reaches the point in a student s academic term where the amount billed is no longer refundable to the student; a refund is made to withdrawn students for the portion entitled to be refunded under each institutions refund policy; we receive funds to apply against the contract asset balance; or a student makes a change to the number of classes they are enrolled in which may cause an adjustment to their previously billed amount. As of the end of each quarter, a new contract asset is determined on a student by student basis based on the

______________ (1) 

Tuition Refunds If a student withdraws from one of our academic institutions prior to the completion of the academic term, we refund the portion of tuition and fees already paid that, pursuant to our refund policy and applicable federal and state law and accrediting agency standards, we are not entitled to retain. Generally, the amount to be refunded to a student is calculated based upon the percent of the term attended and the amount of tuition and fees paid by the student as of their withdrawal date. In certain circumstances, we have recognized revenue for students who have withdrawn that we are not entitled to retain. We have estimated a reserve for these limited circumstances based on historical evidence in the amount of million for each period as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Students are typically entitled to a partial refund until approximately halfway through their term. Pursuant to each university s policy, once a student reaches the point in the term where no refund is given, the student would not have a refund due if withdrawing from the university subsequent to that date.

weeks in length. Generally, a student receivable balance is written off once a student is out of school and it reaches greater than days past due. Our standard student receivable allowance is based on an estimate of lifetime expected credit losses for student receivables. Our estimation methodology considers a number of quantitative and qualitative factors that, based on our collection experience, we believe have an impact on our repayment risk and ability to collect student receivables. Changes in the trends in any of these factors may impact our estimate of the allowance for credit losses. These factors include, but are not limited to: internal repayment history, changes in the current economic, legislative or regulatory environments, internal cash collection forecasts and the ability to complete the federal financial aid process with the student. These factors are monitored and assessed on a regular basis. Overall, our allowance estimation process for student receivables is validated by trend analysis and comparing estimated and actual performance. We have an immaterial amount of student receivables that are due greater than 12 months from the date of our condensed consolidated balance sheets. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the amount of non-current student receivables under payment plans that are longer than 12 months in duration, net of allowance for credit losses, was million and million, respectively.

Fair Value Measurements The carrying amount reported in our condensed consolidated balance sheets for the current portion of student receivables approximates fair value because of the nature of these financial instruments as they generally have short maturity periods. It is not practicable to estimate the fair value of the non-current portion of student receivables, since observable market data is not readily available, and no reasonable estimation methodology exists. 

 . Lease terms generally range from five to with one to four renewal options for extended terms. In most cases, we are required to make additional payments under facility operating leases for taxes, insurance and other operating expenses incurred during the operating lease period, which are typically variable in nature. We determine if a contract contains a lease when the contract conveys the right to control the use of identified property, plant or equipment for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Upon identification and commencement of a lease, we establish a right of use ROU asset and a lease liability.

million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, is presented within other current liabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. We record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss will be incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. We evaluate, at least quarterly, developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that was previously accrued and make adjustments as further information develops, circumstances change or contingencies are resolved. Significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount. We may be unable to estimate a possible loss or range of possible loss due to various reasons, including, among others: (1) if the damages sought are indeterminate; (2) if the proceedings are in early stages; (3) if there is uncertainty as to the outcome of pending appeals, motions or settlements; (4) if there are significant factual issues to be determined or resolved; and (5) if there are novel or unsettled legal theories presented. In such instances, there is considerable uncertainty regarding the ultimate resolution of such matters, including a possible eventual loss, if any. United States of America, ex rel. Fiorisce LLC v. Perdoceo Education Corporation, Colorado Technical University, Inc. and American InterContinental University, Inc. On July 19, 2023, we became aware of an amended complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado on May 19, 2023. The original complaint was filed under seal on February 25, 2021 by a former employee of Colorado Technical University through a limited liability company, on behalf of herself, any other interested parties affiliated with the LLC and the federal government. On July 18, 2023, the district court ordered the complaint unsealed and we were notified that the U.S. Department of Justice (" DOJ" had declined to intervene in the action on February 3, 2023. The company had

ownership of the University of St. Augustine for Health Sciences, LLC (" USAHS "). The material terms of the transaction have been described in the Company s Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on July 16, 2024. Completion of the acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions and satisfactory regulatory approvals from the Accrediting Commission for Senior Colleges and Universities of the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (" WASC "), as well as other key regulatory bodies, and completion of the preacquisition review process with the US Department of Education. The Company expects to complete the acquisition in December 2024. Perdoceo expects to pay approximately million to million in cash at closing to acquire ownership of USAHS. The actual cash paid will depend on adjustments for cash, debt and working capital based on the final closing balance sheet. The acquisition is not subject to a financing condition. Perdoceo plans to use cash on hand for the purchase.

Provision for income taxes 

Effective rate 

The effective tax rate for the quarter and year to date ended September 30, 2024 reflects federal tax credits claimed for the 2023 tax return, which decreased the effective tax rate for the quarter and year to date by and , respectively. Additionally, the tax effect of stock-based compensation and the release of previously recorded tax reserves reduced the effective tax rate for the quarter and year to date ended September 30, 2024 by and , respectively. The effective tax rate for the quarter and year to date ended September 30, 2023 was primarily impacted by a million favorable discrete adjustment related to the recognition of the tax benefits associated with a previously disclosed prior year ordinary loss attributable to the stock of a worthless subsidiary, which decreased the effective tax rate for the quarter and year to date by and , respectively. The effective tax rate for the quarter and year to date ended September 30, 2023 reflects federal and state tax credits claimed for the 2022 tax return, which decreased the effective tax rate for the quarter a nd year to date by and , respectively. Additionally, the tax effect of stock-based compensation and the release of other previously recorded tax reserves reduced the effective tax rate for the quarter and year to date ended September 30, 2023 by and , respectively. As of September 30, 2024, a valuation allowance of million was maintained with respect to our equity investment and state net operating losses. We estimate that it is reasonably possible that the gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits for a variety of uncertain tax positions will decrease by up to million in the next twelve months as a result of the expiration of the statute of limitations in several jurisdictions. The income tax rate for the quarter and year to date ended September 30, 2024 does not take into account the possible reduction of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits. The impact of a reduction to the liability will be treated as a discrete item in the period the reduction occurs. We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in tax expense. As of September 30, 2024, we had accrued million as an estimate for reasonably possible interest and accrued penalties. Our tax returns are routinely examined by federal, state and local tax authorities and these audits are at various stages of completion at any given time. The Company s federal income tax filings are open to examinations for the tax years ended December 31, 2021 and forward. 

million and million restricted stock units, respectively, which are not "performance-based" and which have a grant-date fair value of approximately million and million, respectively. For the years to date ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company granted approximately million and million restricted stock units, respectively, which are performance-based and which have a grant-date fair value of approximately million and million, respectively. The performance-based restricted stock units are subject to performance conditions which are determined at the time of grant and typically cover a performance period. These performance conditions may result in all units being forfeited even if the requisite service period is met. There were restricted stock units granted during each of the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. All restricted stock units granted in 2024 and 2023 are to be settled in shares of our common stock.

Share-Based Compensation Expense For the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the total share-based compensation expense was approximately million and million, respectively. For the years to date ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the total share-based compensation expense was approximately million and million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we estimate that total compensation expense of approximately million will be recognized over the next for all unvested share-based awards that have been granted to participants. This amount excludes any estimates of forfeitures. 

million which commenced March 1, 2024 and expires . The new stock repurchase program replaced the previous stock repurchase program. The other terms of the new stock repurchase program are consistent with the Company s previous stock repurchase program. The timing of purchases and the number of shares repurchased under the program will be determined by the Company s management and will depend on a variety of factors including stock price, trading volume and other general market and economic conditions, its assessment of alternative uses of capital, regulatory requirements and other factors. Repurchases will be made in open market transactions, including block purchases, conducted in accordance with Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act as well as may be made pursuant to trading plans established under Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act, which would permit shares to be repurchased when the Company might otherwise be precluded from doing so under insider trading laws. The stock repurchase program does not obligate the Company to purchase shares and the Company may, in its discretion, begin, suspend or terminate repurchases at any time, without any prior notice. During the years to date ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we repurchased approximately million shares and million shares of our common stock, respectively, for approximately million at an average price of per share during the year to date ended September 30, 2024 and for approximately million at an average price of per share during the year to date ended September 30, 2023. There were shares repurchased during the quarters ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. As of September 30, 2024, approximately million was available under our authorized stock repurchase program to repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock. Shares of stock repurchased under the program are held as treasury shares. These repurchased shares have reduced the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for basic and diluted earnings per share calculations.

 The discussion below and other items in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contain forward-looking statements, as defined in Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that reflect our current expectations regarding our future growth, results of operations, cash flows, performance and business prospects and opportunities, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, our management. We have tried to identify forward-looking statements by using words such as anticipate, believe, expect, plan, may, should, will, continue to, focused on and similar expressions, but these words are not the exclusive means of identifying forward-looking statements. These statements are based on information currently available to us and are subject to various risks, uncertainties, and other factors, including, but not limited to, those matters discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 that could cause our actual growth, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, performance, business prospects and opportunities to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, these statements. Except as expressly required by the federal securities laws, we undertake no obligation to update such factors or to publicly announce the results of any of the forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect future events, developments, or changed circumstances or for any other reason. Among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, our forward-looking statements are the following: 
 declines in enrollment or interest in our programs or our ability to market to and contact prospective students; 

our continued compliance with and eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs under the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended, and the regulations thereunder (including the terms of any potential changes to or conditions imposed on our continued participation in the Title IV programs under new program participation agreements, the new 90-10, financial responsibility and administrative capability standards prescribed by the U.S. Department of Education (the Department )), as well as applicable accreditation standards and state regulatory requirements; 

the impact of various versions of borrower defense to repayment regulations; 

the final outcome of various legal challenges to the Department's loan discharge and forgiveness efforts; 

rulemaking or changing interpretations of existing regulations, guidance or historical practices by the Department or any state or accreditor and increased focus by Congress and governmental agencies on, or increased negative publicity about, for-profit education institutions; 

the success of our initiatives to improve student experiences, retention and academic outcomes; 

our continued eligibility to participate in educational assistance programs for key employers, veterans and other military personnel; 

increased competition; 

our ability to pay dividends on our common stock and execute our stock repurchase program; 

the impact of management changes; and 

changes in the overall U.S. economy. 

The following Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations MD A should be read in conjunction with the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The MD A is intended to help investors understand the results of operations, financial condition and present business environment. The MD A is organized as follows:

Consolidated Results of Operations 

Segment Results of Operations 

Summary of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Liquidity, Financial Position and Capital Resources 

OVERVIEW 
 Our accredited academic institutions offer a quality postsecondary education primarily online to a diverse student population, along with campus-based and blended learning programs. The Company s academic institutions Colorado Technical University CTU and the American InterContinental University System AIUS or AIU System provide degree programs from the 
 17 

associate through doctoral level as well as non-degree seeking and professional development programs. Our academic institutions offer students industry-relevant and career-focused academic programs that are designed to meet the educational needs of today s busy adults. CTU and AIUS continue to show innovation in higher education, advancing personalized learning technologies like their intellipath learning platform and using data analytics and technology to serve and educate students while enhancing overall learning and academic experiences. Perdoceo's institutions are committed to providing quality education that closes the gap between learners who seek to advance their careers and employers needing a qualified workforce. 
 Our reporting segments are determined in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 280 Segment Reporting and are based upon how the Company analyzes performance and makes decisions. Each segment represents a postsecondary education provider that offers a variety of academic programs. We organize our business across two reporting segments: CTU and AIUS. 
 Regulatory Environment and Political Uncertainty 
 We operate in a highly regulated industry, which has significant impacts on our business and creates risks and uncertainties. In recent years, Congress, the Department, states, accrediting agencies, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Federal Trade Commission, state attorneys general, consumer advocacy groups and the media have all scrutinized the for-profit postsecondary education sector. Congressional hearings and roundtable discussions were held regarding various aspects of the education industry, including issues surrounding student debt as well as publicly reported student outcomes that may be used as part of an institution s recruiting and admissions practices, and reports were issued that are highly critical of for-profit colleges and universities. A group of influential U.S. senators, consumer advocacy groups and some media outlets have strongly and repeatedly encouraged the Department, the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs and its state approving agencies to take action to limit or terminate the participation of institutions such as ours in existing tuition assistance programs. In several cases, these groups have received significant financial support from third parties critical of our sector and have aligned on messaging that negatively impacts our sector during policy and rulemaking discussions. In addition, the current administration has made student loan forgiveness one of its top domestic policy objectives, and it has been aggressively pursued by the Department in cooperation with special interest groups, other federal agencies, state attorneys general and others. These groups collectively have focused efforts relating to student debt forgiveness on for-profit colleges and universities, encouraging loan discharge applications and complaints by former students. 
 We continue to see one of the most challenging operating environments in recent memory as the Department has undertaken a complete overhaul of almost all of the major regulatory requirements associated with our participation in Title IV Programs and which disproportionally negatively impact the for-profit postsecondary education sector. Additionally, a number of the Department s regulatory initiatives are explicitly targeted at negatively impacting the proprietary sector of education. In many cases the new regulatory requirements are unclear, require further clarification as to their interpretation or applicability or are subject or will be subject to legal challenges. We expect to continue to need to operate nimbly in this uncertain environment, making necessary changes to the extent possible to comply with the myriad of new vague or unclear rules or interpretations as well as new interpretations of existing rules. For example, in 2023, we materially reduced prospective student enrollment, marketing and outreach processes at AIUS during the year to limit the volume of new federal funding that the institution would receive and to preserve available funding for existing students under the Department s new 90-10 Rule. Any actions that limit our participation in Title IV Programs or the amount of student financial aid for which our students are eligible would materially impact our student enrollments and profitability and could impact the continued viability of our business as currently conducted. 
 We encourage you to review Item 1, Business, and Item 1A, Risk Factors, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K to learn more about our highly regulated industry and related risks and uncertainties, in addition to the MD A in our 2024 Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. 
 Note Regarding Non-GAAP measures 
 We believe it is useful to present non-GAAP financial measures which exclude certain significant and non-cash items as a means to understand the performance of our core business. As a general matter, we use non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with results presented in accordance with GAAP to help analyze the performance of our core business, assist with preparing the annual operating plan, and measure performance for some forms of compensation. In addition, we believe that non-GAAP financial information is used by analysts and others in the investment community to analyze our historical results and to provide estimates of future performance. 
 We believe certain non-GAAP measures allow us to compare our current operating results with respective historical periods and with the operational performance of other companies in our industry because it does not give effect to potential differences caused by items we do not consider reflective of underlying operating performance. We believe the items we are adjusting for are not normal operating expenses reflective of our underlying business. In evaluating the use of non-GAAP measures, investors should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses similar to the adjustments presented below. Our presentation of non-GAAP measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by expenses that are unusual, non-routine or non-recurring. A non-GAAP measure has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation, or as a substitute for net income, 
 18 

operating income, earnings per diluted share, or any other performance measure derived in accordance with and reported under GAAP or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities or as a measure of our liquidity. 
 Non-GAAP financial measures, when viewed in a reconciliation to respective GAAP financial measures, provide an additional way of viewing the Company's results of operations and the factors and trends affecting the Company's business. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, the respective financial results presented in accordance with GAAP. 
 2024 Third Quarter Overview 
 During the third quarter ended September 30, 2024 (" current quarter "), we continued to experience high levels of student retention and engagement at both CTU and AIUS, with student retention remaining at multi-year highs. Our faculty and student support teams remain dedicated to educating and serving our students, and we anticipate that student retention should continue to trend at these levels through the remainder of 2024. 
 Total student enrollments increased 11.0 at September 30, 2024 as compared to September 30, 2023, with both academic institutions contributing to this increase. CTU's total student enrollments increased 13.6 as compared to the prior year quarter end driven by student enrollment growth within our corporate engagement programs as well as a positive timing impact from the academic calendar comparability resulting in more enrollment days for the current year to date as compared to the prior year to date. Total student enrollments increased 4.0 at AIUS for the current quarter end as compared to the prior year quarter end as AIUS' total student enrollment comparability had continued to improve during the current year to date since reverting to normalized levels of operations beginning in the fourth quarter of 2023. 
 We view technology as a catalyst and differentiator for us and remain committed to making selective investments that deliver a more meaningful and relevant educational experience for our learners while continuing to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our academic institutions student support functions. Additionally, we remained focused on investing in and improving processes that support our corporate engagement programs. Lastly, marketing and admissions spend increased during the current quarter as compared to the prior year quarter, driven by AIUS operating at normalized levels during the current year. We continue to adjust our marketing strategies to further improve our focus on identifying prospective students who are more likely to succeed at one of our universities, as well as comply with updated expectations from various federal agencies around prospective student outreach. 
 We expect the strong levels of student retention and engagement experienced through the current year to date, to continue through the remainder of 2024 and expect to end the year with total student enrollment growth at both of our academic institutions as of December 31, 2024. Full year revenue is expected to be lower for 2024 primarily due to the lag impact on revenue of lower beginning total student enrollments at AIUS as well as lower revenue due to simplification of our professional development offerings at CTU. 
 Financial Highlights 
 Revenue for the current quarter decreased by 5.6 or 10.1 million as compared to the prior year quarter, resulting from a decrease in revenue for CTU of 4.0 or 4.8 million and a decrease for AIUS of 9.0 or 5.3 million. The decrease in revenue at CTU was driven by changes within our professional development program offerings as well as a negative timing impact of revenue-earning days due to the academic calendar for the current quarter as compared to the prior year period. CTU's academic calendar may impact the comparability of revenue-earning days and enrollment results in any given quarter, with the impact on revenue and total student enrollments not necessarily having the same magnitude or directional impact. The decrease within AIUS was driven by a lag impact on revenue of the operational changes undertaken during 2023. 
 Operating income for the current quarter increased to 44.8 million as compared to operating income of 43.1 million in the prior year quarter. The increase in operating income for the current quarter was a result of decreased operating expenses, primarily in the areas of asset impairment, academics and administrative expenses, which more than offset the decrease in revenue during the current quarter as compared to the prior year quarter. 
 The Company believes it is useful to present non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude certain significant and non-cash items, as a means to understand the performance of its operations. (See tables below for a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation.) Adjusted operating income was 48.6 million for the current quarter as compared to 47.2 million for the prior year quarter. 
 Adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per diluted share for the quarters and years to date ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 is presented below (dollars in thousands, unless otherwise noted):

Revenue 
 The current quarter and year to date revenue decreased by 5.6 or 10.1 million and 10.2 or 57.3 million, respectively, as compared to the prior year periods, driven by decreases in revenue within both CTU and AIUS. The decline for the current quarter and year to date was primarily driven by the lag impact on revenue due to the operational changes made at AIUS in the prior year as well as changes within our professional development program offerings at CTU. Typically, total student enrollment balances at the end of any given quarter have a lag impact on revenue in the subsequent quarter. Additionally, the current quarter and current year to date had a decrease in revenue-earning days at CTU as compared to the prior year periods due to a timing impact of the academic calendar.

The general and administrative expense for the current quarter increased by 1.8 or 1.6 million and decreased by 11.4 or 34.8 million for the current year to date, as compared to the prior year periods. The current quarter increase was primarily driven by increased advertising and marketing expense, which was only partially offset with a decrease in admissions and administrative expenses. The year to date improvement was driven by decreases within all expense categories as compared to comparative prior year period. 
 Advertising and marketing expense for the current quarter increased by 18.6 or 4.2 million and decreased by 7.0 or 5.6 million for the current year to date, as compared to the prior year periods. The current quarter increase was due to increased spending within AIUS to normalized levels versus the prior year which was decreased due to the short-term operational changes. The current year to date improvement was primarily driven by adjustments made to our marketing processes to identify prospective student interest. 
 Admissions expense for the current quarter and year to date decreased by 5.5 or 1.2 million and 13.7 or 9.6 million, respectively, as compared to the prior year periods. Admissions expense for the current quarter decreased within CTU, which more than offset the increase within AIUS as a result of the return to normalized operating levels. The current year to date improvement was primarily driven by decreased expenses within both CTU and AIUS as a result of the operational changes made during the prior year. 
 The administrative expense for the current quarter and year to date decreased by 6.2 or 2.5 million and 11.3 or 14.5 million, respectively, as compared to the prior year periods, primarily driven by operational efficiencies within our academic institutions and decreased legal fees within Corporate and Other for the year to date period.

Bad debt expense for the current quarter increased by 15.0 or 1.1 million and decreased by 19.4 or 5.2 million for the current year to date, as compared to the prior year periods. We regularly evaluate our reserve rates, which includes a quarterly update of our analysis of historical student receivable collectability based on the most recent data available and a review of current known factors which we believe could affect future collectability of our student receivables, such as the number of students that do not complete the financial aid process. We continue to expect quarterly fluctuations in bad debt expense. 
 Operating Income 
 Operating income increased by 4.0 or 1.7 million and 1.9 or 2.6 million for the current quarter and year to date, respectively, as compared to the prior year periods. The current quarter improvement was benefitted by lower academics, admissions and administrative expenses which more than offset the decrease in revenue as compared to the prior year quarter. The year to date improvement was supported by lower operating expenses across all categories which more than offset the decrease in revenue as compared to the prior year period. The current quarter and year to date also included lower asset impairment charges of 7.4 million and 6.2 million, respectively, as compared to the comparative prior year periods.

Provision for Income Taxes 
 For the quarter and year to date ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a provision for income taxes of 14.1 million reflecting an effective tax rate of 26.9 and 42.1 million reflecting an effective tax rate of 26.6 , respectively, as compared to a provision for income taxes of 6.8 million reflecting an effective tax rate of 14.1 and 39.3 million reflecting an effective tax rate of 23.1 for the respective prior year periods. 
 The effective tax rate for the quarter and year to date ended September 30, 2024 reflects federal tax credits claimed for the 2023 tax return, which decreased the effective tax rate for the quarter and year to date by 0.4 and 0.1 , respectively. Additionally, the tax effect of stock-based compensation and the release of previously recorded tax reserves reduced the effective tax rate for the quarter and year to date ended September 30, 2024 by 0.2 and 1.4 , respectively. The effective tax rate for the quarter and year to date ended September 30, 2023 was primarily impacted by a 4.5 million favorable discrete adjustment related to the recognition of the tax benefits associated with a previously disclosed prior year ordinary loss attributable to the stock of a worthless subsidiary, which decreased the effective tax rate for the quarter and year to date by 9.3 and 2.6 , respectively. The effective tax rate for the quarter and year to date ended September 30, 2023 reflects federal and state tax credits claimed for the 2022 tax return, which decreased the effective tax rate for the quarter and year to date by 0.6 and 0.2 , respectively. Additionally, the tax effect of stock-based compensation and the release of other previously recorded tax reserves reduced the effective tax rate for the quarter and year to date ended September 30, 2023 by 0.2 and 0.6 , respectively. 
 For the full year 2024, we expect our effective tax rate to be between 26.0 and 27.0 .

Total student enrollments represent all students who are active as of the last day of the reporting period. Active students are defined as those students who are considered in attendance by participating in class related activities during the previous two weeks. Total student enrollments do not include learners pursuing: a) non-degree seeking and professional development programs, and b) degree seeking, non-Title IV, self-paced programs at our universities. 
 CTU. Current quarter and year to date revenue decreased by 4.0 or 4.8 million and 6.1 or 22.2 million, respectively, as compared to the prior year periods. The decrease was primarily driven by changes within the professional development program offerings at CTU as well as a negative timing impact of revenue-earning days due to the academic calendar for the current quarter and 
 23 

year to date as compared to the prior year periods. CTU experienced total student enrollment growth of 13.6 at September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year quarter end which was driven by growth in student enrollments from corporate engagement programs as well as a positive timing impact of the academic calendar on enrollment days. CTU's academic calendar may impact the comparability of revenue-earning days and enrollment results in any given quarter, with the impact on revenue and total student enrollments not necessarily having the same magnitude or directional impact. 
 Current quarter and year to date operating income for CTU increased by 28.1 or 9.7 million and 8.9 or 10.6 million, respectively, as compared to the prior year periods. The improvement in operating income was primarily supported by lower academics and admissions expenses as well as right-sizing of the cost structure to align with more simplified professional development offerings, which more than offset the declines in revenue. The current quarter and year to date also included lower asset impairment charges of 7.4 million and 6.2 million, respectively, as compared to the comparative prior year periods. 
 AIUS. Current quarter and year to date revenue decreased by 9.0 or 5.3 million and 17.8 or 35.0 million, respectively, as compared to the prior year periods. The decreases were driven by a lag impact from the operational changes made during the latter half of 2023. AIUS' experienced total student enrollment growth of 4.0 at September 30, 2024 as compared to the prior year quarter end as the return to normalized operating levels in the fourth quarter of 2023 contributed to increased student enrollments. 
 Current quarter and year to date operating income for AIUS decreased by 41.9 or 6.5 million and 30.0 or 13.4 million, respectively, as compared to the prior year periods, driven by the decrease in revenue discussed above. 
 Corporate and Other. This category includes unallocated costs that are incurred on behalf of the entire company. Total Corporate and Other operating loss for the current quarter increased by 20.6 or 1.4 million as compared to the prior year quarter primarily driven by acquisition costs and increased legal fees for the current quarter. The year to date operating loss improved by 18.6 or 5.4 million as compared to the prior year period primarily as a result of lower legal expenses. 
 SUMMARY OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
 A detailed discussion of the accounting policies and estimates that we believe are most critical to our financial condition and results of operations that require management s most subjective and complex judgments in estimating the effect of inherent uncertainties is included under the caption Summary of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates included in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 also includes a discussion of these and other significant accounting policies. 
 LIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL POSITION AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 As of September 30, 2024, cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and available-for-sale short-term investments cash balances totaled 722.6 million. Our cash flows from operating activities have historically been adequate to fulfill our liquidity requirements. We have historically financed our operating activities, organic growth and acquisitions primarily through cash generated from operations and existing cash balances. We expect to continue to generate cash during the remainder of 2024. We anticipate that we will be able to satisfy the cash requirements associated with, among other things, our working capital needs, capital expenditures, lease commitments, quarterly dividends payments and pending acquisition through at least the next 12 months primarily with cash generated by operations and existing cash balances. 
 We maintain a balanced capital allocation strategy that focuses on maintaining a strong balance sheet and adequate liquidity, while (i) investing in organic projects at our universities, in particular technology-related initiatives which are designed to benefit our students, and (ii) evaluating diverse strategies to enhance stockholder value, including acquisitions, quarterly dividend payments and share repurchases. Ultimately, our goal is to deploy resources in a way that drives long term stockholder value while supporting and enhancing the academic value of our institutions. 
 On February 20, 2024, the Board of Directors of the Company approved a new stock repurchase program for up to 50.0 million which commenced March 1, 2024 and expires September 30, 2025. The new stock repurchase program replaced the previous stock repurchase program. The timing of purchases and the number of shares repurchased under the program will be determined by the Company s management and will depend on a variety of factors including stock price, trading volume and other general market and economic conditions, its assessment of alternative uses of capital, regulatory requirements and other factors. 
 The Board of Directors approved the aforementioned stock repurchase programs believing it advantageous to the Company and its stockholders to repurchase shares of the Company s common stock from time to time at prices below what the Board of Directors believed to be the intrinsic value of the Company s common stock. 
 The discussion above reflects management s expectations regarding liquidity; however, as a result of the significance of the Title IV Program funds received by our students, we are highly dependent on these funds to operate our business. Any reduction in the level of Title IV funds that our students are eligible to receive or any impact on timing or our ability to receive Title IV Program 
 24 

funds, or any requirement to post a significant letter of credit to the Department, may have a significant impact on our operations and our financial condition. In addition, our financial performance is dependent on the level of student enrollments which could be impacted by external factors. See Item 1A, Risk Factors, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Sources and Uses of Cash 
 Operating Cash Flows 
 During the years to date ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, net cash flows provided by operating activities totaled 144.0 million and 98.8 million, respectively. The increase in net cash flows provided by operating activities for the current year to date as compared to the prior year to da te was primarily driven by timing of working capital payments and Title IV cash drawdowns, as well as certain compensation-related payments. 
 Our primary source of cash flows from operating activities is tuition collected from our students. Our students derive the ability to pay tuition costs through the use of a variety of funding sources, including, among others, federal loan and grant programs, state grant programs, private loans and grants, institutional payment plans, private and institutional scholarships and cash payments. 
 For further discussion of Title IV Program funding and other funding sources for our students, see Item 1, Business - Student Financial Aid and Related Federal Regulation , in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Our primary uses of cash to support our operating activities include, among other things, cash paid and benefits provided to our employees for services, to vendors for products and services, to lessors for rents and operating costs related to leased facilities, to suppliers for textbooks and other institution supplies, and to federal, state and local governments for income and other taxes. 
 Investing Cash Flows 
 During the year to date ended September 30, 2024, net cash flows provided by investing activities totaled 7.3 million compared to net cash flows used in investing activities of 31.2 million for the prior year to date. 
 Purchases and Sales of Available-for-Sale Investments. Purchases and sales of available-for-sale investments resulted in a net cash inflow of 10.3 million for the current year to date as compared to a net cash outflow of 26.4 million for the prior year to date. 
 Capital Expenditures. Capital expenditures decreased to 3.0 million for the year to date ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 4.8 million for the year to date ended September 30, 2023. For the full year 2024, we expect capital expenditures to be approximately 1.0 of revenue. 
 Financing Cash Flows 
 During the years to date ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, net cash flows used in financing activities totaled 31.5 million and 12.4 million, respectively. Payments to repurchase shares of our common stock were 6.8 million for the year to date ended September 30, 2024 and 2.7 million for the year to date ended September 30, 2023. 
 Payments of employee tax associated with stock compensation. Payments of employee tax associated with stock compensation were 3.4 million and 2.2 million for the years to date ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Payments of cash dividends and dividend equivalents . During the years to date ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company made dividend payments of 23.2 million and 7.2 million, respectively.

Right of use asset, net: The decrease is driven by recurring amortization of remaining ROU assets as well as impairment of certain leased assets which the Company made the decision to vacate during the current year to date. 
 Income taxes: The increase primarily relates to amounts owed with respect to estimated payments of federal and state income tax for 2024. 
 Deferred revenue: The increase is primarily related to the timing impact of the academic terms within CTU and AIUS along with an increase in total student enrollments. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATI VE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 We are exposed to financial market risks, primarily changes in interest rates. We use various techniques to manage our interest rate risk. We have no derivative financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments, and believe the risk related to cash equivalents and available for sale investments is limited due to the adherence to our investment policy, which focuses on capital preservation and liquidity. In addition, we use asset managers who conduct initial and ongoing credit analyses on our investment portfolio and monitor that investments are in compliance with our investment policy. Despite the investment risk mitigation strategies we employ, we may incur investment losses as a result of unusual and unpredictable market developments and may experience reduced investment earnings if the yields on investments deemed to be low risk remain low or decline. 
 Interest Rate Exposure 	 
 Our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell investments that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates. At September 30, 2024, a 10 increase or decrease in interest rates applicable to our investments would not have a material impact on our future earnings, fair values or cash flows. 
 Our financial instruments are recorded at their fair values as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. We believe that the exposure of our consolidated financial position and results of operations and cash flows to adverse changes in interest rates applicable to our investments is not significant. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We completed an evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q Report under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that (i) the information required to be disclosed by us in this Report was recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms provided by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ), and (ii) information required to be disclosed by us in our reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Inherent Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls 
 Our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our Company have been detected. 
 26 

These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.
