ITEM 2. 

MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

General

The Company s results of operations are primarily dependent on the results of Home Federal Bank (the Bank ), its wholly owned subsidiary. The Bank s results of operations depend, to a large extent, on net interest
 income, which is the difference between the income earned on its loan and investment portfolios and the cost of funds, consisting of the interest paid on deposits and borrowings. Results of operations are also affected by provisions for loan
 losses and loan sale activities. Non-interest expense principally consists of compensation and employee benefits, office occupancy and equipment expense, data processing, and other expenses. Our results of operations are also significantly
 affected by general economic and competitive conditions, particularly changes in interest rates, government policies, and actions of regulatory authorities. Future changes in applicable law, regulations, or government policies may materially
 impact our financial condition and results of operations.

The Bank operates from its main office in Shreveport, Louisiana and ten full-service branch offices located in Shreveport, Bossier City, Benton and Minden, Louisiana. The Company s primary market area is the
 Shreveport-Bossier City-Minden combined statistical area.

Critical Accounting Policies

The accounting and financial reporting policies of the Company conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and to general practices within the banking industry. Accordingly,
 the consolidated financial statements require certain estimates, judgments, and assumptions, which are believed to be reasonable, based upon the information available. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and
 liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the periods presented. Critical accounting policies comprise those that management believes are the most critical to aid in fully
 understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. These policies require numerous estimates or economic assumptions that may prove inaccurate or may be subject to variations which may significantly affect our reported results and
 financial condition for the period or in future periods.

There were no changes made to the Company's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
 affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

Allowance for Credit Losses. The Company has identified the calculation of the allowance for credit losses as a critical accounting policy, due to the higher degree of
 judgment and complexity than its other significant accounting policies.

Income Taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined using the liability (or balance sheet) method. Under this method, the net deferred tax asset or
 liability is determined based on the tax effects of the temporary differences between the book and tax basis of the various assets and liabilities and gives current recognition to changes in tax rates and laws. The realization of our deferred
 tax assets principally depends upon our achieving projected future taxable income. We may change our judgments regarding future profitability due to future market conditions and other factors. We may adjust our deferred tax asset balances, if
 our judgments change.

 1.3 million reduction in unrealized losses on available for sale securities, partially offset by 3.5 million in principal payments.

Cash and Cash Equivalents 

Cash and cash equivalents increased 6.1 million, or 17.4 , from 34.9 million at June 30, 2024 to 41.0 million at September 30, 2024. The increase in cash and cash
 equivalents was primarily due to decreases in loans receivable.

Loans Receivable, Net 

Loans receivable, net, decreased by 16.8 million, or 3.6 , to 454.0 million at September 30, 2024 compared to 470.9 million at June 30, 2024. The decrease in loans receivable, net was primarily due to decreases

Loans Held-for-Sale 

Loans held-for-sale increased 535,000, from 1.7 million at June 30, 2024 to 2.3 million at September 30, 2024. The increase in loans held-for-sale results primarily from the increase in the origination volume
 during the first three months of fiscal year end 2025.

Investment securities amounted to 97.4 million at September 30, 2024, compared to 96.0 million at June 30, 2024, an increase of 1.4 million, or 1.5 . The increase in investment securities was primarily due to
 security purchases of 4.0 million and a 1.3 decrease in market value losses on available-for-sale securities, partially offset by 3.5 million principal repayments on mortgage backed securities.

Non-interest Income 

The 134,000 decrease in non-interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023, resulted from an increase in loss on sale of real estate of 220,000, partially

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Bank maintains levels of liquid assets deemed adequate by management. The Bank adjusts its liquidity levels to fund deposit outflows, repay its borrowings, and to fund loan commitments. The Bank also adjusts
 liquidity as appropriate to meet asset and liability management objectives.

The Bank s primary sources of funds are deposits, amortization and prepayment of loans and mortgage-backed securities, maturities of investment securities and other short-term investments, loan sales, and earnings
 and funds provided from operations. While scheduled principal repayments on loans and mortgage-backed securities are a relatively predictable source of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates,
 economic conditions, and competition. The Bank sets the interest rates on its deposits to maintain a desired level of total deposits. In addition, the Bank invests excess funds in short-term interest-earning accounts and other assets which
 provide liquidity to meet lending requirements. The Bank s deposit accounts with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas amounted to 1.4 million at September 30, 2024.

A significant portion of the Bank s liquidity consists of securities classified as available-for-sale and cash and cash equivalents. The Bank s primary sources of cash are net income, principal repayments on
 loans and mortgage-backed securities, and increases in deposit accounts. If the Bank requires funds beyond its ability to generate them internally, borrowing agreements exist with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas which provides an
 additional source of funds. At September 30, 2024, The Bank had no advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas and had 179.4 million in borrowing capacity. 
 Additionally, at September 30, 2024, the Bank was a party to a Master Purchase Agreement with First National Bankers Bank whereby Home Federal Bank may purchase Federal Funds from First National Bankers Bank in an amount not to exceed
 20.4 million. There were no amounts purchased under this agreement as of September 30, 2024. In addition, the Company had available an 11.0 million line of credit agreement at September 30, 2024 with First National Bankers Bank. At September
 30, 2024, there was an 5.5 million balance in the credit line.

At September 30, 2024, the Bank had outstanding loan commitments of 35.7 million to originate loans and commitments under unused lines of credit of 13.6 million. At September 30, 2024, certificates of deposit
 scheduled to mature in less than one year totaled 167.7 million. Based on prior experience, management believes that a significant portion of such deposits will remain with us, although there can be no
 assurance that this will be the case. In addition, the cost of such deposits could be significantly higher upon renewal in a rising interest rate environment. The Bank intends to utilize its high levels of liquidity to fund its lending
 activities. If additional funds are required to fund lending activities, Home Federal Bank intends to sell its securities classified as available-for-sale, as needed.

At September 30, 2024, Home Federal Bank exceeded each of its capital requirements with common equity tier 1, tier 1 capital, total capital, leverage, and tangible capital ratios of 13.19 , 13.19 , 14.29 , 9.02 ,
 and 9.02 , respectively.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

At September 30, 2024, the Company did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined by Securities and Exchange Commission rules.

Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices

The financial statements and related financial data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with instructions to Form 10-Q which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in
 terms of historical dollars without considering changes in relative purchasing power over time due to inflation.

Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all of the Company s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution s
 performance than does the effect of inflation.
