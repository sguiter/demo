ALLAKOS INC. 
 NOTES TO UNAUDITED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 reportable segment. Liquidity Matters Since inception, the Company has incurred net losses and negative cash flows from operations. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred a net loss of million . At September 30, 2024, the Company had an accumulated deficit of million and does not expect to experience positive cash flows from operating activities in the foreseeable future. The Company has financed its operations to date primarily through the sale of common stock. Management expects to incur additional operating losses in the future as the Company continues to further develop, seek regulatory approval for and, if approved, commence commercialization of its product candidates. On January 16, 2024, the Company announced that due to unfavorable clinical trial results associated with the use of lirentelimab in its Phase 2 atopic dermatitis and Phase 2b chronic spontaneous urticaria trials, that the Company would halt lirentelimab-related activities across clinical, manufacturing, research and administrative functions. Accordingly, the Company s Board of Directors approved a reorganization plan to reduce operating costs and better align the Company s workforce with its current clinical development plans of its business (the 2024 Reorganization Plan ). Under the 2024 Reorganization Plan, the Company s workforce was reduced by approximately primarily during the first quarter of 2024. The Company had million of cash, cash equivalents and investments at September 30, 2024 . Management believes that this amount is sufficient to fund the Company s operations for at least the next 12 months from the issuance date of these financial statements.

These securities had remaining maturities of less than . The Company has the intent and ability to hold such securities until recovery and has determined that there has been no material change to their credit risk.

There were material realized gains or losses recognized on the sale or maturity of available-for-sale securities during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and as a result, there were no material reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive gain (loss) for the same periods.

The contractual term of the 2019 San Carlos Lease is years from August 2021 until . The 2019 San Carlos Lease provides rent abatements and includes a one-time option to extend the lease term for . This option to extend the lease term was not determined to be reasonably certain and therefore has not been included in the Company s calculation of the associated operating lease liability under ASC 842. The 2019 San Carlos Lease includes monthly base rent amounts escalating over the term of the lease. In addition, the lessor provided for a tenant improvement allowance of up to million, which was fully utilized and is recorded in lease obligations. On March 27, 2023, the Company entered into an amendment for the 2019 San Carlos Lease, whereby rentable square feet was adjusted to square feet and lease payments were reduced by approximately per month, effective from January 1, 2022 through the end of the lease term. The Company accounted for these changes as a modification under ASC 842 and the operating right-of-use asset and lease liability were remeasured during the first quarter of 2023 utilizing an estimated incremental borrowing rate of . The estimated incremental borrowing rate was based on the Company s estimated rate of interest for a fully collateralized borrowing over a similar term as the remaining lease payments while incorporating the Company s credit risk. As a result of the modification, the right-of-use asset and lease liability decreased by approximately million. No gain or loss was recognized upon the modification. As discussed in Note 5 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets , the Company recognized long-lived asset impairment charges of million on the right-of-use assets relating to the 2019 San Carlos Lease during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Classification of Operating Leases The 2019 San Carlos Lease required a security deposit of million, which the Company satisfied by establishing a letter of credit secured by restricted cash. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, a security deposit of million for the 2019 San Carlos Lease was recorded as restricted cash in other long-term assets on the Company s balance sheets.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our financial statements and the other financial information appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. These statements generally relate to future events or to our future financial performance and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. The following discussion and analysis contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Our actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those discussed in our forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed below and those discussed in the section entitled Risk Factors included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. If we do update one or more forward-looking statements, no inference should be drawn that we will make additional updates with respect to those or other forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning these and other risks and uncertainties is contained in our other periodic filings with the SEC. 
 Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements about: 
 our plans to develop, manufacture and commercialize AK006 and our other product candidates, including our targeted clinical indications, intellectual property strategy, sales and marketing objectives and infrastructure capabilities; 

the timing, focus and clinical indications of our preclinical studies and clinical trials, and the reporting of data from those trials; 

the ability of our clinical trials to demonstrate safety and efficacy of our product candidates, and other positive results; 

the expected patient enrollment in our clinical trials; 

the impact that the adoption of new accounting pronouncements will have on our financial statements; 

the beneficial characteristics, safety, efficacy and therapeutic effects of AK006 or our other product candidates; 

the timing or likelihood of regulatory filings and approvals, including our expectation to seek special designations, such as orphan drug designation, for AK006 or our other product candidates for various diseases; 

our ability to obtain and maintain regulatory approval of AK006 or our other product candidates; 

our continued reliance on third-parties to manufacture our product candidates and conduct additional clinical trials of AK006; 

our ability to obtain, maintain, or negotiate favorable terms of any collaboration, partnership, licensing or other arrangements that may be necessary or desirable to develop, manufacture or commercialize AK006 and our other product candidates; 

our intentions with respect to future sales and marketing plans; 

the need to hire additional personnel and our ability to attract and retain such personnel; 

the need for additional financing, and our ability to obtain such financing on terms that are favorable to the Company and its stockholders; 

our expectations regarding financial performance, including revenues, expenses and net losses, and impacts from our reorganization plans and manufacturing development efforts of the foregoing; 

the sufficiency of our existing cash, cash equivalents and investments to fund our future operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements; 

the costs associated with being a public company; and 

our anticipated uses of our existing cash, cash equivalents and investments. 

These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, including, but not limited to, those described in Risk Factors . In some cases, you can identify these statements by terms such as anticipate, believe, could, estimate, expects, intend, may, plan, potential, predict, project, should, will, would or the negative of those terms, and similar expressions that convey uncertainty of future events or outcomes. These forward-looking statements reflect our beliefs and views with respect to future events and are based on estimates and assumptions as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and are subject to risks and uncertainties. We discuss many of these risks in greater detail in the section entitled Risk Factors included in Part II, Item 1A and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive 
 16 

and rapidly changing environment. New risks emerge from time to time. It is not possible to predict all risks, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements we may make. Given these uncertainties, you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. We qualify all of the forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q by these cautionary statements. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements publicly, or to update the reasons actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 
 Overview 
 We are a clinical stage biotechnology company developing therapeutics which target immunomodulatory receptors present on immune effector cells involved in allergic, inflammatory and proliferative diseases. Activating inhibitory receptors allows us to directly target cells involved in disease pathogenesis and, in the setting of allergy and inflammation, has the potential to result in broad inhibition of inflammatory cells. Our most advanced product candidate, AK006, is currently in a Phase 1 clinical trial. 
 AK006 has shown activity in preclinical studies including a broad array of animal disease models of mast cell diseases. In June 2024, we announced positive results from our Phase 1 trial of intravenous (IV) AK006 in healthy volunteers, with AK006 demonstrating high receptor occupancy on mast cells and a favorable safety profile. In October 2024, we announced positive results from our Phase 1 trial of subcutaneous (SC) AK006 in healthy volunteers, with AK006 demonstrating good bioavailability, high and prolonged receptor occupancy on mast cells, and a favorable safety profile. We have prioritized our AK006 development efforts based on our assessment of the probability of clinical and regulatory success, unmet medical need and potential market opportunity. We have assembled a team with a proven track record and deep experience in antibody discovery and in clinical development, operations and finance. 
 The key elements of our strategy are to: 
 Obtain POC with AK006 in chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) and other mast cell driven conditions. We are testing AK006 in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled cohort of patients with CSU. We expect to report initial data from over 30 subjects with CSU in early Q1 of 2025. CSU is an inflammatory skin disease believed to be caused by the inappropriate activation of mast cells in the skin. We believe there is a need for additional treatments for patients with CSU that are refractory to antihistamines. 

Develop Subcutaneous formulation of AK006. We have also developed a formulation of AK006 for SC administration. As part of the Phase 1 study, we reported SC AK006 safety, PK, and PD data, including bioavailability, as well as Siglec-6 receptor occupancy in skin biopsy samples, in October 2024. We plan to use the SC formulation in subsequent AK006 clinical development. 

Build therapeutic pipeline. Our research is focused on immunomodulatory receptors present on immune effector cells involved in allergic, inflammatory and proliferative diseases. Activating these immunomodulatory receptors allows us to directly target cells involved in disease pathogenesis and, in the setting of allergy and inflammation, has the potential to result in broad inhibition of inflammatory cells. Following this approach, we have developed AK006 and have research programs directed at other immunomodulatory targets. 

AK006 targets Siglec-6, an inhibitory receptor expressed selectively on mast cells, a type of white blood cell that is widely distributed in the body and plays a central role in the inflammatory response. Binding of AK006 to Siglec-6 activates the native inhibitory function of the receptor which in turn reduces mast cell activation. In preclinical studies, AK006 inhibited multiple modes of mast cell activation, including IgE, IL-33, KIT, C5a, and MRGPR-X2, resulting in the deep suppression of mast cell activation. In addition to mast cell inhibition, AK006 reduced human tissue mast cells via ADCP in the presence of activated macrophages. AK006 is currently being evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled cohort of patients with CSU. We expect to report initial data from over 30 patients with CSU in early Q1 of 2025. 
 Chronic spontaneous urticaria is an inflammatory skin disease believed to be caused by the inappropriate activation of mast cells via IgE-dependent and IgE-independent pathways in the skin. Symptoms of chronic spontaneous urticaria include frequent and unpredictable eruption of hives, severe itching and swelling. First-line treatment consists of H1 antihistamine medication; however, a significant number of patients do not receive adequate benefit even at up to four times the labeled dose. In the United States, it is estimated that there are 800 thousand adults with moderate-to-severe CSU whose disease is refractory to antihistamines. There is only one FDA approved therapy for patients who are refractory to antihistamines, omalizumab, which binds IgE. Because AK006 inhibits both IgE-dependent and IgE-independent modes of mast cell activation, it has the potential to treat a broad CSU population or show greater symptom improvement. 
 AK006 is being studied in an ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial that consists of IV and subcutaneous (SC) single ascending dose (SAD) cohorts and IV multiple ascending dose (MAD) cohorts in healthy volunteers, as well as a cohort in patients with CSU who will be 
 17 

administered AK006 via intravenous infusion. We have completed and reported data from the SAD and MAD IV and SC AK006 cohorts in healthy volunteers. We expect initial data from over 30 CSU cohort patients to be available in early Q1 of 2025. 
 In June 2024, we announced that, in the ongoing Phase 1 study in healthy volunteers, single and multiple IV doses of AK006 were well tolerated with a favorable safety profile. Skin biopsies taken from AK006 treated healthy volunteers showed high levels of receptor occupancy confirming AK006 reaches skin tissue mast cells. AK006 showed dose linear exposure and with an estimated half-life of 21 days for the highest (720 mg) IV dose. Moreover, AK006 achieved serum concentrations consistent with levels demonstrating inhibitory activity in preclinical experiments. 
 We have also developed a formulation of AK006 for SC administration. As part of the Phase 1 study, we announced in October 2024 that in healthy volunteers single SC doses of AK006 were well tolerated with a favorable safety profile. Subcutaneous AK006 showed bioavailability of 77 and an estimated half-life of 12-22 days. Consistent with the IV formulation, skin biopsies taken from subcutaneous AK006 treated healthy volunteers showed high levels of receptor occupancy, confirming AK006 reaches skin tissue mast cells. We plan to use the SC formulation in subsequent AK006 clinical development. 
 We had also been developing lirentelimab (AK002) and, in conjunction with the Phase 2 lirentelimab results in atopic dermatitis and chronic spontaneous urticaria, we announced on January 16, 2024 that we no longer plan to pursue further development of lirentelimab. Lirentelimab has been administered in more than 1,000 patients, and with approximately 500 patients exposed for six months or more. Lirentelimab has generally been well tolerated with no long-term safety findings to date. 
 Since our inception in 2012, we have devoted substantially all of our resources and efforts towards the research and development of our product candidates. In addition to activities conducted internally at our facilities, we have utilized significant financial resources to engage contractors, consultants and other third parties to conduct various preclinical and clinical development activities on our behalf. 
 To date, we have not had any products approved for sale and have not generated any revenue nor been profitable. Further, we do not expect to generate revenue from product sales until such time, if ever, that we are able to successfully complete the development and obtain marketing approval for one of our product candidates. We will continue to require additional capital to develop our product candidates, achieve commercial approval and fund operations for the foreseeable future. We have incurred significant operating losses to date and expect to incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable future. Our net losses were 116.2 million and 123.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 1,234.7 million. 
 In January 2024, we began implementing the 2024 Reorganization Plan to reduce operating costs and better align our workforce with the current clinical development plans of our business. Accordingly, we decided to halt lirentelimab-related activities across clinical, manufacturing, research and administrative functions. As a result, we reduced our workforce by approximately 50 . While this resulted in increased near-term costs, primarily in the first and second quarters of 2024, we believe that the 2024 Reorganization Plan will reduce our overall spending in subsequent quarters subject to periodic fluctuations caused by the timing of ongoing manufacturing development efforts and the timing of future clinical trials. Additionally, as described in Note 5 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets , we recorded a 27.3 million noncash charge related to the impairment of long-lived assets during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and investments of 92.7 million, which we believe will be sufficient to fund our planned operations for at least the next 12 months from the issuance of our financial statements. 
 Components of Operating Results 
 Revenue 
 We have not generated any revenue from product sales or otherwise, and do not expect to generate any revenue for at least the next several years. 
 Operating Expenses 
 We classify operating expenses into two categories: (i) research and development and (ii) general and administrative. 
 Research and Development Expenses 
 Research and development expenses represent the following costs incurred by us for the discovery, development and manufacturing of our product candidates: 
 consultant and personnel-related costs including consulting fees, employee salaries and benefits, travel and stock-based compensation expense; 

18 

costs incurred to conduct nonclinical research and development activities; 

costs incurred under service agreements with clinical contract research organizations CROs and clinical investigative sites to conduct our clinical studies; 

costs incurred under service agreements with contract development and manufacturing organizations CDMOs for the manufacture and fill finish of our product candidates, as well as any costs required to cancel any related purchase obligations; 

costs related to in-house research and development activities conducted at our facilities including laboratory supplies, non-capital laboratory equipment and depreciation of capital laboratory equipment and leasehold improvements; 

costs incurred under exclusive and non-exclusive license agreements with third-parties; and 

allocated facility and other costs including the rent and maintenance of our facilities, insurance premiums, depreciation of shared-use leasehold improvements and general office supplies. 

We expense research and development costs as incurred. We recognize costs for certain development activities, such as clinical trials, based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using data such as clinical site activations, patient enrollment or information provided to us by our clinical CROs and clinical investigative sites, along with analysis by our in-house clinical operations personnel. Advance payments for goods or services to be received in the future for use in research and development activities are deferred and capitalized as prepaid expenses, even when there is no alternative future use for the research and development. The capitalized amounts are expensed as the related goods are delivered or the services are performed. 
 Prior to the regulatory approval of our product candidates, we recognize expenses incurred with our CDMOs for the manufacture of product candidates that could potentially be available to support future commercial sales, if approved, in the period in which they have occurred. To date, we have not yet capitalized any costs to inventory as we are unable to determine if these costs will provide a future economic benefit, given the unapproved nature of our product candidates. 
 The successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain. Accordingly, it is difficult to estimate the nature, timing and extent of costs necessary to complete the remainder of the development of our product candidates. We are also unable to predict when, if ever, we will be able to generate revenue from our product candidates. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing drugs, including the uncertainty surrounding: 
 demonstrating sufficient safety and tolerability profiles of product candidates; 

successful enrollment and completion of clinical trials; 

requisite clearance and approvals from applicable regulatory authorities; 

establishing and maintaining commercial manufacturing capabilities with CDMOs; 

obtaining and maintaining protection of intellectual property; and 

commercializing product candidates, if and when approved, alone or in collaboration with third-parties. 

A change pertaining to any of these variables would significantly impact the timing and extent of costs incurred with respect to the development and commercialization of our product candidates. 
 External costs incurred from CDMOs, clinical CROs and clinical investigative sites have comprised a significant portion of our research and development expenses since inception. We track these costs on a program-by-program basis following the advancement of a product candidate into clinical development. However, consulting and personnel-related costs, laboratory supplies and non-capital equipment utilized in the conduct of in-house research, in-licensing fees, various pre-clinical research costs and general overhead, are not tracked on a program-by-program basis, nor are they allocated, as they commonly benefit multiple projects, including those still in our pipeline. 
 Expenses in the second half of 2024 are expected to decrease as compared to the first half of 2024, given the decreased expenses relating to lirentelimab and the implementation of the 2024 Reorganization Plan. 
 
 General and Administrative Expenses 
 General and administrative expenses consist of fees paid to consultants, salaries, benefits and other personnel-related costs, including stock-based compensation, for our personnel in executive, finance, accounting and other administrative functions, legal costs, fees paid for accounting and tax services, costs associated with pre-commercialization activities and facility costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses. Legal costs include general corporate and patent legal fees and related costs. 
 19 

Our general and administrative expenses decreased in the first half of 2024 following the employment severance related costs associated with the 2024 Reorganization Plan. We expect to continue to incur costs associated with operating as a public company, including expenses related to maintaining compliance with the rules and regulations of the SEC, and those of any national securities exchange on which our securities are traded, additional insurance premiums, information technology and facility activities, and other ancillary administrative and professional services. 
 
 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 
 During the first quarter of 2024, as a result of the significant sustained decline observed in the Company s stock price and related market capitalization following our decision to halt the development of lirentelimab, the Company believed a triggering event occurred and the potential of impairment existed with respect to our long-lived assets. As a result of these factors, we performed an impairment analysis of the Company s long-lived assets. Based on this analysis, we recognized a long-lived asset impairment charge of 27.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. For more information see Note 5 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets in the accompanying notes to the Condensed Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Interest Income 
 Interest income primarily consists of interest and investment income earned on our cash, cash equivalents and investments included on the balance sheets. 
 Other Expense, Net 
 Other expense, net, primarily consists of amounts realized from gains and losses related to fluctuations in foreign currencies. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates 
 Our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported expenses incurred during the reporting periods. Our estimates are based on our historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our judgments and estimates in light of changes in circumstances, facts and experience. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as described in Note 5 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets, we utilized estimates in relation to the valuation and impairment of long-lived assets, and as described in Note 10 Stock-Based Compensation , we updated our method for estimating the expected term of our stock options effective January 1, 2024. There were no other changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates as disclosed in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 See Note 2 to our unaudited financial statements for recently issued accounting pronouncements, including the respective effective dates of adoption and effects on our results of operations and financial condition.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Sources of Liquidity 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and investments of 92.7 million. Based on our existing business plan, we believe that our current cash, cash equivalents and investments will be sufficient to fund our anticipated level of operations through at least the next 12 months from the issuance of our financial statements. 
 We are a clinical stage biotechnology company with a limited operating history. As a result of our significant research and development expenditures, we have generated net losses since our inception. We have financed our operations primarily through equity offerings. 
 In May 2022, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 3333-265085) with the SEC pursuant to which we may, from time to time, sell up to an aggregate of 250.0 million of our common stock. On May 31, 2022, the registration statement was declared effective by the SEC, which allows us to access the capital markets for the three-year period following this effective date. Our September 2022 equity offering and our outstanding at-the-market offering program were offered under this Form S-3. Further details of these programs are included below. 
 Additionally, in November 2023, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-275517) with the SEC pursuant to which we may, from time to time, sell up to an aggregate of 250.0 million of our common stock. On November 24, 2023, the registration statement was declared effective by the SEC, which allows us to access the capital markets for the three-year period following this effective date. 
 At-the-Market Equity Offering 
 On August 4, 2022, we entered into a sales agreement (the 2022 Sales Agreement with Cowen and Company, LLC Cowen ). Pursuant to the 2022 Sales Agreement we may sell, from time to time up to an aggregate of 75.0 million in gross sales proceeds of our common stock through an ATM Offering. We will pay Cowen a commission equal to 3.0 of the gross proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock under the 2022 Sales Agreement. The 75.0 million of common stock that may be offered, issued and sold in the ATM Offering is included in the 250.0 million of securities that may be offered, issued and sold by us under our registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-265085). We expect to use the net proceeds from sales under the 2022 Sales Agreement for general corporate purposes. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we sold 0.1 million shares of our common stock at an average price of 7.20 per share through our ATM Offering, resulting in proceeds of 1.0 million net of commissions, with all sales to date occurring during the first quarter of 2023. Under our current ATM Offering program, 74.0 million of common stock remain available for future sales as of September 30, 2024; however, we are not obligated to make any sales under this program.

Cash Used in Operating Activities 
 Net cash used in operating activities was 81.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which was primarily attributable to our net loss of 116.2 million adjusted for net noncash charges of 49.1 million and net changes in operating assets and liabilities of 14.0 million. Noncash charges included approximately 27.3 million of long-lived asset impairment, 19.7 million in stock-based compensation expense, 2.8 million in depreciation and amortization expense and 1.8 million in noncash lease expense, partially offset by 2.6 million in net accretion of premiums and discounts on investments. 
 Net cash used in operating activities was 92.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which was primarily attributable to our net loss of 123.2 million adjusted for net noncash charges of 32.4 million and net changes in operating assets and liabilities of 1.4 million. Noncash charges included approximately 31.0 million in stock-based compensation expense, 4.6 million in 
 23 

depreciation and amortization expense and 1.1 million in noncash lease expense, partially offset by 4.3 million in net accretion of premiums and discounts on investments. 
 Cash Provided by Investing Activities 
 Net cash provided by investing activities was 25.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which consisted primarily of 125.6 million in proceeds from maturities of investments, partially offset by 100.5 million for the purchases of investments and 0.1 million for the purchases of property and equipment. 
 Net cash provided by investing activities was 73.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which consisted of 213.0 million in proceeds from maturities of investments, partially offset by 139.4 million for the purchases of investments and 0.6 million for the purchases of property and equipment . 
 Cash Provided by Financing Activities 
 Net cash provided by financing activities was 0.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which consisted of proceeds received from employees for the purchase of common stock through the 2018 ESPP and for the exercise of stock options. 
 Net cash provided by financing activities was 2.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which consisted of 1.0 million in net proceeds from the issuance of common stock in connection with the ATM Offering, 1.5 million in proceeds received from employees for the purchase of common stock through the 2018 ESPP and for the exercise of stock options. 
 Funding Requirements 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and investments, excluding restricted cash, of 92.7 million, which we believe will be sufficient to fund our planned operations for at least the next 12 months from the issuance date of our unaudited interim financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We will continue to require additional capital to develop our product candidates, achieve commercial approval and fund operations for the foreseeable future. We intend to seek and have sought to raise funding from time to time through private or public equity or debt financings, or other sources such as strategic collaborations. Adequate additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. Our failure to raise capital as and when needed could have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategies. 
 The timing and amount of our capital expenditures will depend on many factors, including: 
 the number and scope of clinical indications and clinical trials we decide to pursue; 

the scope and costs of manufacturing activities; 

the extent to which we acquire or in-license other product candidates and technologies, if any; 

the cost, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates, and if successful, the cost and time necessary to bring product candidates to market; 

the cost and timing of establishing sales and marketing capabilities for product candidates receiving marketing approval, if any; 

the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending intellectual property-related claims; 

our efforts to enhance operational systems and our ability to attract, hire and retain qualified personnel, including personnel to support the development of our product candidates; and 

the costs associated with being a public company. 

If we are unable to raise additional funds when needed, we may be required to delay, reduce or terminate some or all of our development efforts. We may also be required to sell or license to others rights to our product candidates in certain territories or indications that we would prefer to develop and commercialize ourselves. 
 The issuance of additional equity securities may cause our stockholders to experience dilution. Future equity or debt financings may contain terms that are not favorable to us or our stockholders including debt instruments imposing covenants that restrict our operations and limit our ability to incur liens, issue additional debt, pay dividends, repurchase our common stock, make certain investments or engage in certain merger, consolidation, licensing or asset sale transactions. 
 24 

Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
 Our contractual obligations and commitments relate primarily to our operating leases and non-cancelable purchase obligations under agreements with various research and development organizations and suppliers in the ordinary course of business. 
 In the normal course of business, we enter into contracts with clinical CROs, clinical investigative sites and other counterparties assisting with our preclinical studies and clinical trials. Such contracts are generally cancellable, with varying provisions regarding termination. In the event of a contract being terminated, we would only be obligated for services received as of the effective date of the termination, along with cancellation fees, as applicable. Additionally, we have entered into agreements with certain vendors for the provision of goods and services, which includes development and manufacturing services with CDMOs. These agreements may include certain provisions for purchase obligations and termination obligations that could require payment for the cancellation of committed purchase obligations or for early termination of the agreements. The amounts of the cancellation or termination payments may vary and are based on the timing of the cancellation or termination and the specific terms of the agreements. We expect to enter into additional collaborative research, contract research, clinical and commercial manufacturing, and supplier agreements in the future, which may require significant upfront payments and long-term commitments of capital resources. Additionally, see Note 7 Leases , and Note 8 Contingencies , to our unaudited interim financial statements for further information relating to lease commitments, indemnification obligations and other commitments. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 Since our inception, we have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in the rules and regulations of the SEC. 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitati ve Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide this disclosure. 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. As of September 30, 2024, our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level. 
 Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objective and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 From time to time, we may become involved in litigation or other legal proceedings. We are not currently a party to any litigation or legal proceedings that are likely to have a material adverse effect on our business. Regardless of outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources, and other factors. 
 Item 1A. Ris k Factors. 
 Except as set forth below, our risk factors have not materially changed from those previously disclosed in Part 1, Item 1A Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 If we fail to maintain compliance with the minimum listing requirements, our common stock will be subject to delisting. Our ability to publicly or privately sell equity securities and the liquidity of our common stock could be adversely affected if our common stock is delisted. 
 The continued listing standards of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC Nasdaq applicable to the Nasdaq Global Select Market require, among other things, that the minimum price of a listed company s stock be at or above 1.00. If the minimum bid price is below 1.00 for a period of more than 30 consecutive trading days, the listed company will fail to be in compliance with Nasdaq s listing rules and, if the listed company does not regain compliance within a 180-day grace period, it may be subject to delisting. In order to regain compliance, the bid price of the listed company s common stock must close at a price of at least 1.00 per share for a minimum of 10 consecutive trading days within a 180-day grace period. In the event a listed company does not regain compliance by the end of the Compliance Period, that company may be eligible for additional time to regain compliance (the Second Compliance Period pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A)(i) by transferring to the Nasdaq Capital Market. To qualify for the Second Compliance Period, the listed company would need to submit a transfer application and pay an application fee and, in addition, would be required to meet the continued listing requirement for the market value of its publicly held shares and all other initial listing standards for Nasdaq, with the exception of the bid price requirement, and will need to provide written notice of its intention to cure the deficiency during the Second Compliance Period, by effecting a reverse stock split, if necessary. There can be no assurance that a listed company will be eligible for the Second Compliance Period, if applicable, or that the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Staff (the Staff would grant that company s request for continued listing subsequent to any delisting notification. If the listed company fails to regain compliance, its common stock would be subject to delisting. 
 On August 13, 2024, we received a letter from the Staff the indicating that, based upon the closing bid price of shares of our common stock for the 30 consecutive business day period from July 1, 2024 through August 12, 2024, we did not meet the minimum bid price of 1.00 per share required for continued listing on the Nasdaq Global Select Market pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(a)(1). The letter also indicated that, pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), we would be afforded 180 calendar days to regain compliance with the bid price requirement. On November 5, 2024, we received a letter from the Staff stating that for the last 10 consecutive business days, from October 10, 2024, to November 4, 2024, the closing bid price of our common stock has been 1.00 per share or greater, that the Staff has determined that we have regained compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(a)(1), and that the matter is now closed. However, there can be no assurance that we will maintain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement or any other Nasdaq listing standards. If we fail to maintain compliance with one or more Nasdaq listing standards, our common stock will be subject to delisting. Delisting from Nasdaq could adversely affect our ability to raise additional financing through the public or private sale of equity securities, would significantly affect the ability of investors to trade our securities and would negatively affect the value and liquidity of our common stock. Delisting could also have other negative results, including the potential loss of confidence by employees, the loss of institutional investor interest and fewer business development opportunities. 
 We have incurred significant net losses since inception and we expect to continue to incur significant net losses for the foreseeable future. 
 We have incurred net losses in each reporting period since our inception, have not generated any revenue to date and have financed our operations principally through the sale and issuance of common stock and preferred stock. Our net losses were 185.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 116.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 1,234.7 million. We have devoted substantially all of our resources and efforts to research and development. Our lead product candidate, AK006, is in early clinical development, and our other product candidates are in preclinical development. As a result, we expect that it will be several years, if ever, before we generate revenue from product sales. Even if we succeed in receiving marketing approval for and commercializing one or more of our product candidates, we expect that we will continue to incur substantial research and development and other expenses in order to develop and market additional potential products. 
 26 

We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future. The net losses we incur may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter such that a period-to-period comparison of our results of operations may not be a good indication of our future performance. The size of our future net losses will depend, in part, on our manufacturing and clinical activities, the rate of future growth of our expenses and our ability to generate revenue. Our prior losses and expected future losses have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our working capital and our ability to achieve and maintain profitability. 
 We will require substantial additional capital to finance our operations. If we are unable to raise such capital when needed, or on acceptable terms, we may be forced to delay, reduce and/or eliminate one or more of our research and drug development programs or future commercialization efforts. 
 Developing pharmaceutical products, including conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials, is a very time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete. We expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we conduct clinical trials of, and seek marketing approval for, AK006 and our other product candidates. In addition, if we obtain marketing approval for any of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to drug sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution. We have also incurred and expect to continue to incur significant costs associated with operating as a public company. Accordingly, we will need to obtain substantial additional funding in order to maintain our continuing operations. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on acceptable terms, we may need to reevaluate our operating plan and may be forced to delay, reduce and/or eliminate one or more of our research and drug development programs or future commercialization efforts. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 92.7 million in cash, cash equivalents and investments. We filed: (i) on August 4, 2022, a prospectus supplement to our shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-265085) that covers the offering, issuance and sale of up to 75.0 million of our common stock from time to time through an at-the-market program under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and (ii) on September 19, 2022, a prospectus supplement to such shelf registration statement that covered the offering, issuance and sale of 29,882,000 shares of our common stock, at a public offering price of 5.02 per share. We received aggregate net proceeds of 140.6 million, after deducting the underwriting commissions and offering expenses from the September 19, 2022 follow-on offering and as of September 30, 2024 received aggregate net proceeds of 1.0 million under the at-the-market program. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and investments will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements through at least the next 12 months. Our estimate as to how long we expect our existing cash, cash equivalents and investments to continue to fund our operations is based on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. Changing circumstances, some of which may be beyond our control, could cause us to consume capital significantly faster than we currently anticipate, and we may need to seek additional funds sooner than planned. 
 We plan to use our existing cash, cash equivalents and investments to fund our development of AK006 and for other research and development activities, working capital and other general corporate purposes. This may include additional research, hiring additional personnel, capital expenditures and the costs of operating as a public company. Advancing the development of AK006 and any other product candidates will require a significant amount of capital. Our existing cash, cash equivalents and investments will not be sufficient to fund all of the actions that are necessary to complete the development and commercial approval of AK006 or any of our other product candidates. We will be required to obtain further funding through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations and licensing arrangements or other sources, which may dilute our stockholders or restrict our operating activities. We do not have any committed external source of funds. Adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Additionally, our ability to raise additional capital may be adversely impacted by potential worsening of global economic conditions and volatility of financial markets in the United States and worldwide. Our failure to raise capital as and when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to pursue our business strategy.
