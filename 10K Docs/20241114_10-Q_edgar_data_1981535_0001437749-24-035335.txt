In December 2023, SharpLink Israel's Board of Directors approved management to enter into a Letter of Intent with RSports to purchase the Company s Sports Gaming Client Services and SHGN businesses. 
 
 In December 2023, SharpLink Israel discontinued its C4 technology due to the lack of market acceptance. C4 technology centered on monetizing our own online audience and our customers respective online audiences of U.S. fantasy sports and casual sports fans and casino gaming enthusiasts by converting them into loyal online sports and iGaming bettors. 
 
 On January 18, 2024, the Company entered into a PA with RSports to sell the Company s Sports Gaming Client Services and SHGN business units to RSports. All of the membership interests of Sports Technologies, LLC, a Minnesota limited liability company, Holdings Quinn, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and SHGN who owns all of the issued membership interests in SportsHub Reserve, LLC, SHReserve ), a Minnesota limited liability company; SportsHub PA, LLC, SHPA ), a Pennsylvania limited liability company, and SportsHub Holdings, LLC, SHHoldings ), a Minnesota limited liability company, and SportsHub Operations, LLC, SHOperations ), a Minnesota limited liability company (SHReserve, SHPA, SHHoldings and SHOperations, collectively, the SHGN Subsidiaries were sold for in an all-cash transaction.

See Note 3 for an amendment to the PA agreement and Note 4. 
 
 The Company has discontinued operations for the Sports Gaming Client Services and SHGN businesses. See Note 4. 
 
 The Company is in the process of closing its legal entities in MTS in order to simplify its legal structure. 
 
 Nasdaq Notice 
 
 On July 11, 2024 , SharpLink received a letter from Nasdaq Listing Qualifications (the "Letter") indicating that the Company is no longer in compliance with the minimum bid price requirement for continued listing set forth in Listing Rule 5550 (a)( 2 ), which requires listed securities to maintain a minimum bid price of 1.00 per share. The rules also provide SharpLink a compliance period of 180 calendar days to regain compliance. According to the Letter, the Company has until January 7, 2025 to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. SharpLink can regain compliance if at any time during this 180 -day period, the closing bid price of its Common Stock is at least 1.00 for a minimum of ten consecutive business days, in which case SharpLink will be provided with written confirmation of compliance by Nasdaq and this matter will be closed. In the event that the Company fails to regain compliance after the initial 180 -day period, SharpLink may then be eligible for additional time if it meets the continued listing requirements for market value of publicly held shares and all other initial listing standards for The Nasdaq Capital Market, with the exception of the bid price requirement, and will be required to provide written notice of its intention to cure the deficiency during the second compliance period equal to an additional 180 calendar days. If SharpLink cannot demonstrate compliance by the end of the second compliance period, Nasdaq will notify SharpLink that its Common Stock is subject to delisting. The Letter has no immediate effect on SharpLink s listing or the trading of its Common Stock, and during the grace period, as may be extended, the Company s Common Stock will continue to trade on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol SBET. 

and ), respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the net loss from continuing operations totaled ) and ) respectively. The Company used cash for operating activities from continuing operations of ) and ) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. 
 
 In January 2024, the Company completed the Sale of our Sports Gaming Client Services and SHGN business units for million in an all cash transaction. In connection with the closing of the Sale of Business, SharpLink repaid in full all outstanding term loans and lines of credit with Platinum Bank, together with accrued but unpaid interest and all other amounts due in connection with such repayment under existing credit agreements, totaling an aggregate , and thereby terminated all existing credit facilities with Platinum Bank and discharged the debt on the Company s balance sheet. In addition, the Company redeemed the outstanding convertible debenture issued to Alpha Capital Anstalt Alpha for of the outstanding balance, plus accrued and unpaid interest, for in aggregate, thereby satisfying all obligations under the debenture and discharging the debt on the balance sheet. See Note 8 . 

On May 1, 2024, Company entered into an ATM Sales Agreement (the ATM Sales Agreement with A.G.P./Alliance Global Partners (the Agent pursuant to which the Company may offer and sell, from time to time, through the Agent, as sales agent and/or principal, shares of its common stock, par value per share (the Common Stock ), having an aggregate offering price of up to , subject to certain limitations on the amount of Common Stock that may be offered and sold by the Company set forth in the ATM Sales Agreement (the Offering ). The Company is not obligated to make any sales of Shares under the ATM Sales Agreement and any determination by the Company to do so will be dependent, among other things, on market conditions and the Company s capital raising needs. As of November 14, 2024, SharpLink has raised gross proceeds of from sales of Shares under the ATM Sales Agreement. 
 
 In addition to funds that may be raised through the ATM Sales Agreement, we may need to raise additional capital to fund the Company s growth and future business operations. We cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are not able to secure additional funding when needed to support our business and to respond to business challenges, track and comply with applicable laws and regulations, develop new technology and services or enhance our existing offering, improve our operating infrastructure, enhance our information security systems to combat changing cyber threats and expand personnel to support our business, we may have to delay or reduce the scope of our planned strategic initiatives. Moreover, any additional equity financing that we obtain may dilute the ownership held by our existing shareholders. The economic dilution to our shareholders will be significant if our stock price does not materially increase, or if the effective price of any sale is below the price paid by a particular shareholder. Any debt financing could involve substantial restrictions on activities and creditors could seek additional pledges of some or all of our assets. If we fail to obtain additional funding as needed, we may be forced to cease or scale back operations, and our results, financial conditions and stock price would be adversely affected. As such, these factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period. 

in an all cash transaction. 
 
 On May 8, 2024, SharpLink entered into an amended and fully restated Post Closing Assignment Agreement with RSports, whereby SharpLink and RSports have agreed to amend the PA to exclude the transfer/sale of SHGN and have agreed to the assignment/sale of the Acquired Subsidiaries membership interests in SHReserve and SHPA to be made directly to RSports upon and subsequent to the approval of a petition by the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board. Based on this amended agreement, the sale of the business is an asset sale for legal and tax purposes instead of an equity sale. 
 
 Further, in connection with the Sale of Business, SharpLink entered into a Post Closing Covenant Agreement (the PCCA with the Buyer defining the post-closing terms and conditions relating to certain transfers and assignments of assets subsequent to the closing of the Sale of Business, including: 
 
 Transferring control of all bank accounts held by the Targets to the Buyer; 

Transferring or cooperating with the application process for all state gaming licenses held by the Targets in connection with the change of control to the Buyer; 
 
 Providing the Buyer with an accounting of all funds due to and from and any deferred revenue between Sports Technologies, LLC, SHGN and SharpLink, Inc.; 
 
 Assigning to Buyer or its affiliates, or cause the counterparty to consent to, all contracts assumed by the Buyer or its affiliates on or subsequent to the closing based upon change of control provisions; and 
 
 Assigning to Buyer or its affiliates all of its intellectual property rights purchased in the PA for the Acquired Subsidiaries or Targets. 

In accordance with the terms of the PCCA, SharpLink will complete all post-closing covenants following the closing as reasonably possible, with the exception of Seller covenants that are dependent on governmental authorities or governmental orders for completion, in which case it will use diligent, good faith efforts to cause the same to be completed as soon as practical. The million gain was calculated by measuring the difference between the fair value of consideration received less the carrying amount of assets and liabilities sold in accordance with ASC 810. The gain is preliminary and subject to finalization of post-closing adjustments pursuant to the PA, the Post Closing Assignment Agreement and PCCA Agreement. 
 
 In the statement of cashflows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , the net cash used in investing activities - discontinued operations is due to cash received from the sale of business of , net of the cash transferred of . The majority of the cash transferred of was reflected in discontinued operations customer deposits liability and deferred revenue of and , respectively. 
 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , SharpLink paid RSports and , respectively, for use of accounting service personnel under the PCCA agreement. RSports paid SharpLink and under the PCCA agreement for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , respectively. 

Sale of Sports Gaming Client Services and SHGN 
 
 As disclosed in Note 3, due to the Sale of Business in January 2024, we ceased our Sports Game Client Services and SHGN segments. The historical results of these business segments have been reflected as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements for all periods prior to the closing date of the Sale of Business on January 18, 2024. 
 
 Sale of MTS 
 
 The Company negotiated a Share and Asset Purchase Agreement which was closed on December 31, 2022. The majority of the assets of the primary reporting unit within MTS were sold. The assets and liabilities remaining post transaction are in the process of winding down subsequent to the year ended December 31, 2022.

We follow the authoritative guidance on accounting for and disclosure of uncertainty in tax positions which requires us to determine whether a tax position of the Company is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals of litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. For tax positions meeting the more likely than not threshold, the uncertain tax benefit amount recognized in the financial statements is reduced to the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 likelihood of being realized upon the ultimate settlement with the relevant taxing authority. Interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are included in the provision for income taxes in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. In accordance with the Sale of Business See Note 3 ), management performed an evaluation of the technical merits of the Israeli Controlled Foreign Corporate Rules to determine the taxability of the gain from the Sale of Business from an Israeli tax perspective. This analysis also considered the results of the U.S. income tax. Management determined that the technical merits for uncertain tax exposure resulting from the gain for Israeli tax purposes did not exceed the more-likely-than- not threshold and has not recorded any income tax liability at September 30, 2024 . Management s determination is based on known facts and circumstances and requires judgment of a complex set of rules and regulations. If facts and circumstances change, such as closing, liquidating or selling of the businesses equity that is remaining, including events outside the Company s control, this could have a material impact on the management s determination.

For the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, revenues declined 34.7 to 881,690 compared to 1,349,331 reported for the same three-month period in the prior year. The decrease is largely due to the market conditions softening and the loss of customers.

Our gross profit margin declined to 19.6 from 29.0 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decline represents highercasino payouts due to large winnings by individuals during the three months ended September 30, 2024.

The 3rd quarter of 2023 also included expenses in connection with the expansion initiatives associated with our Affiliate Marketing Services.

If we are not able to secure additional funding when needed to support our business and to respond to business challenges, develop new technology and services or enhance our existing offering, track and comply with applicable laws and regulations, improve our operating infrastructure, enhance our information security systems to combat changing cyber threats and expand personnel to support our business, we may have to delay or reduce the scope of planned strategic initiatives. Moreover, any additional equity financing that we obtain may dilute the ownership held by our existing shareholders. The economic dilution to our shareholders will be significant if our stock price does not materially increase, or if the effective price of any sale is below the price paid by a particular shareholder. Any debt financing could involve substantial restrictions on activities and creditors could seek additional pledges of some or all of our assets. If we fail to obtain additional funding as needed, we may be forced to cease or scale back operations, and our results, financial conditions and stock price would be adversely affected. As such, these factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 On September 30, 2024, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. Since our inception, except for standard operating leases accounted for prior to January 1, 2022, we have not engaged in any off-balance sheet arrangements, including the use of structured finance, special purpose entities or variable interest entities. 
 
 Inflation 
 
 Our opinion is that inflation did not have a material effect on our operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Climate Change 
 
 Our opinion is that neither climate change, nor governmental regulations related to climate change, have had, or are expected to have, any material effect on our operations. 
 
 New Accounting Pronouncements 
 
 Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted 
 
 In November 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2023-07 Segment Reporting (Topic ASC 280) Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. This Accounting Standards Update improves reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosure about significant segment expenses. The enhancements under this update require disclosure of significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM and included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss, require disclosure of other segment items by reportable segment and a description of the composition of other segment items , require annual disclosures under Topic ASC 280 to be provided in interim periods, clarify use of more than one measure of segment profit or loss by the CODM, require that the title of the CODM be disclosed with an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measures of segment profit or loss to make decisions, and require that entities with a single reportable segment provide all disclosures required by this update and required under Topic ASC 280. ASU 2023-07 is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The Company believes the adoption of ASC 280 will not have a material impact on its condensed consolidated financial statements.

In December 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2023-09 Income Taxes (Topic ASC 740) Income Taxes. This Accounting Standards Update improves the transparency of income tax disclosures by requiring (1) consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation and (2) income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction. It also includes certain other amendments to improve the effectiveness of income tax disclosures. The amendments in ASU 2023-09 will become effective at the beginning of our 2025 fiscal year. Early adoption is permitted for annual financial statements that have not yet been issued or made available for issuance. We do not expect that this guidance will have a material impact upon our financial position and results of operations.

 The Company s Chief Executive Officer and the Company s Chief Financial Officer evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024 and concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective.
