 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations and that are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements are made as of the date of this Form 10-Q. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Form 10-Q. Actual results might differ significantly from those described in or implied by such statements due to various factors and uncertainties, including those described in the MD A - Forward-Looking Statements section of this Form 10-Q and the Introduction and Risk Factors sections of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, or 2023 Annual Report . 
 Throughout this Form 10-Q, we use certain acronyms and terms that are defined in the Glossary of our 2023 Annual Report. 
 You should read the following MD A in conjunction with our 2023 Annual Report and our condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 included in Financial Statements . 
 
 INTRODUCTION 
 Freddie Mac is a GSE chartered by Congress in 1970, with a mission to provide liquidity, stability, and affordability to the U.S. housing market. We do this primarily by purchasing single-family and multifamily residential mortgage loans originated by lenders. In most instances, we package these loans into guaranteed mortgage-related securities, which are sold in the global capital markets, and transfer interest-rate and liquidity risks to third-party investors. In addition, we transfer a portion of our mortgage credit risk exposure to third-party investors through our credit risk transfer programs, which include securities- and insurance-based offerings. We also invest in mortgage loans, mortgage-related securities, and other types of assets. We do not originate mortgage loans or lend money directly to mortgage borrowers. 
 We support the U.S. housing market and the overall economy by enabling America's families to access mortgage loan funding with better terms and by providing consistent liquidity to the single-family and multifamily mortgage markets. We have helped many distressed borrowers keep their homes or avoid foreclosure and have helped many distressed renters avoid eviction. 
 Since September 2008, we have been operating in conservatorship, with FHFA as our Conservator. The conservatorship and related matters significantly affect our management, business activities, financial condition, and results of operations. Our future is uncertain, and the conservatorship has no specified termination date. We do not know what changes may occur to our business model during or following conservatorship, including whether we will continue to exist. In connection with our entry into conservatorship, we entered into the Purchase Agreement with Treasury, under which we issued Treasury both senior preferred stock and a warrant to purchase common stock. Our Purchase Agreement with Treasury is critical to keeping us solvent and avoiding the appointment of a receiver by FHFA under statutory mandatory receivership provisions. We believe the support provided by Treasury pursuant to the Purchase Agreement currently enables us to have adequate liquidity to conduct normal business activities. For additional information on the conservatorship and related matters and the Purchase Agreement, see our 2023 Annual Report.

Management's Discussion and Analysis Introduction 

 Business Results 
 Consolidated Financial Results 
 
 Net Revenues and Net Income 
 (In billions) 

Net Worth 
 (In billions) 

Key Drivers: 
 n Net income was 3.1 billion, an increase of 420 million year-over-year, primarily driven by a decline in non-interest expense, as the prior period included a 313 million additional expense accrual. 
 n Net revenues were 5.8 billion, an increase of 3 year-over-year, primarily driven by higher net interest income. 
 n Net worth was 56.4 billion as of September 30, 2024, up from 44.7 billion as of September 30, 2023. The quarterly increases in net worth have been, or will be, added to the aggregate liquidation preference of the senior preferred stock. The liquidation preference of the senior preferred stock was 125.9 billion on September 30, 2024, and will increase to 129.0 billion on December 31, 2024 based on the increase in net worth in 3Q 2024. 
 
 Market Liquidity 
 
 Market Liquidity 
 (In thousands) 
 
 We support the U.S. housing market by executing our mission to provide liquidity and help maintain credit availability for new and refinanced single-family mortgages as well as for rental housing. We provided 113 billion in liquidity to the mortgage market in 3Q 2024, which enabled the financing of 415,000 home purchases, refinancings, and rental units.

Management's Discussion and Analysis Introduction 

 Mortgage Portfolio Balances 

Mortgage Portfolio 
 (UPB in billions) 

Key Drivers: 
 n Our mortgage portfolio increased 2 year-over-year to 3.5 trillion at September 30, 2024, continuing to grow at a moderate pace. 
 l Our Single-Family mortgage portfolio was 3.1 trillion at September 30, 2024, up 2 year-over-year. 
 l Our Multifamily mortgage portfolio was 452 billion at September 30, 2024, up 5 year-over-year. 
 
 Credit Enhancement Coverage 
 
 Single-Family Mortgage Portfolio with Credit Enhancement 
 (UPB in billions) 

Multifamily Mortgage Portfolio with Credit Enhancement 
 (UPB in billions) 

In addition to transferring interest-rate and liquidity risk to third-party investors through our securitization activities, we engage in various types of credit enhancements, such as primary mortgage insurance and CRT transactions, to reduce our credit risk exposure and transfer a portion of the credit risk on certain loans in our mortgage portfolio to third parties. At September 30, 2024, we had credit enhancement coverage on 62 of our Single-Family mortgage portfolio and 93 of our Multifamily mortgage portfolio. See MD A - Risk Management Credit Risk for additional information on our credit enhancements.

 Key Drivers: 
 n Guarantee income 
 l 3Q 2024 vs. 3Q 2023 - Increased primarily due to lower fair value losses on guarantee assets as a result of medium-term interest rate declines in 3Q 2024. 
 l YTD 2024 vs. YTD 2023 - Increased primarily due to lower fair value losses on guarantee assets as a result of medium-term interest rate declines and favorable fair value changes on guarantee assets from prepayment rates in YTD 2024. 
 n Investment gains, net 
 l 3Q 2024 vs. 3Q 2023 - Decreased primarily due to impacts from interest-rate risk management activities. 
 l YTD 2024 vs. YTD 2023 - Increased primarily due to impacts from interest-rate risk management activities and higher revenues from held-for-sale loan purchase and securitization activities.

 (1) NM - not meaningful. 
 Key Drivers: 
 n 3Q 2024 vs. 3Q 2023 - The benefit for credit losses for 3Q 2024 was driven by a credit reserve release in Single-Family as a result of lower mortgage interest rates and a credit reserve release in Multifamily due to enhancements in the credit loss estimation process. The benefit for credit losses for 3Q 2023 was primarily driven by a credit reserve release in Single-Family due to improvements in house prices. 
 n YTD 2024 vs. YTD 2023 - The provision for credit losses for YTD 2024 was primarily driven by a credit reserve build in Single-Family attributable to new acquisitions. The benefit for credit losses for YTD 2023 was primarily driven by a credit reserve release in Single-Family due to improvements in house prices, partially offset by a credit reserve build in Multifamily.

 n Benefit for (decrease in) credit enhancement recoveries 
 l 3Q 2024 vs. 3Q 2023 and YTD 2024 vs. YTD 2023 - Decreased primarily due to a smaller decrease in expected credit losses on covered loans. 
 n Other expense 
 l 3Q 2024 vs. 3Q 2023 and YTD 2024 vs. YTD 2023 - Decreased primarily due to a 313 million expense accrual for an adverse judgment at trial in 3Q 2023. We did not have a similar litigation accrual in 3Q 2024.

 Key Drivers: 
 As of September 30, 2024 compared to December 31, 2023: 
 n Securities purchased under agreements to resell increased, driven by a shift from securities sold under agreements to repurchase to debt of Freddie Mac due to lower funding costs. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase are generally offset against securities purchased under agreements to resell on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
 n Mortgage loans held-for-investment increased primarily due to growth in our Single-Family mortgage portfolio. 
 n Debt increased primarily due to an increase in debt of consolidated trusts driven by growth in our Single-Family mortgage portfolio.

 l Our loan purchase and guarantee activity increased as both home purchase and refinance volume increased due to lower mortgage interest rates. 
 l The average loan size of new acquisitions increased due to a higher conforming loan limit and house price appreciation in recent quarters. 
 l Estimated guarantee fee rate calculations are based on month-end market rates for the month of acquisition. The average estimated guarantee fee rate on new acquisitions increased during 3Q 2024 compared to 3Q 2023 due to higher contractual guarantee fee rates and faster estimated prepayment rates based on such month-end market rates. This increase was partially offset by a shift in the business mix of new acquisitions.

Management's Discussion and Analysis Risk Management 

RISK MANAGEMENT 
 To achieve our mission, we take risks as an integral part of our business activities. We are exposed to the following key types of risk: credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, compliance risk, legal risk, strategic risk, and reputation risk. 
 
 Credit Risk 
 
 Allowance for Credit Losses 
 
 For financial assets measured at amortized cost, we recognize an allowance for credit losses that is deducted from or added to the amortized cost basis of the financial asset to present the net amount expected to be collected on the financial asset on the balance sheet. 
 For Single-Family credit exposures, we estimate the allowance for credit losses for loans on a pooled basis using a discounted cash flow model that evaluates a variety of factors to estimate the cash flows we expect to collect. The discounted cash flow model forecasts cash flows over the loan s remaining contractual life, adjusted for expectations of prepayments, and using our historical experience (which includes the effects of severe weather events and other natural disasters), adjusted for current and forecasted economic conditions. These projections require significant management judgment, and we face uncertainties and risks related to the models we use for financial accounting and reporting purposes. For further information on our accounting policies and methods for estimating our allowance for credit losses and related management judgments, see MD A - Critical Accounting Estimates . 
 For Multifamily credit exposures, we estimate the allowance for credit losses using a loss-rate method to estimate the net amount of cash flows we expect to collect. The loss-rate method is based on a probability of default and loss given default framework that estimates credit losses by considering a loan s underlying characteristics, our historical experience (which includes the effects of severe weather events and other natural disasters), and current and forecasted economic and multifamily market conditions. During 3Q 2024, we made enhancements to our credit loss estimation process. These changes did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. Beginning in 3Q 2024, loan characteristics considered by our model include vintage, loan term, current DSCR, current net operating income (NOI), current LTV ratio, interest rate type, underlying property type, and property location. We simulate multiple forecast paths of economic variables, property values, and NOI over the loan s remaining contractual life. We also consider as model inputs expected prepayments and expected recoveries from credit enhancements that are not freestanding contracts. Management adjustments to our model output may be necessary to take into consideration current economic events and other factors not considered within the model.

 Updates to Private Mortgage Insurer Eligibility Requirements 
 During 3Q 2024, Freddie Mac, in coordination with FHFA and in alignment with Fannie Mae, issued updates to the Private Mortgage Insurer Eligibility Requirements (PMIERs), the financial and operational standards that private mortgage insurance companies must meet to be an approved insurer and provide mortgage guaranty insurance on mortgage loans acquired by the Enterprises. The updates to PMIERs relate to the standards for available assets held by mortgage insurers to pay claims to ensure that these assets are high quality, highly liquid, and readily available when needed. The updated standards differentiate between bonds based on credit quality and liquidity, and also establish limits for assets backed by residential mortgages or commercial real estate, to mitigate the impact if such assets lose value during periods of housing stress. The updates will be implemented through a 24-month phased-in approach, and be fully effective on September 30, 2026.

 Geographic Concentrations 
 We purchase mortgage loans from across the U.S. but do not purchase an equal number of loans from each state, leading to concentrations of credit risk in certain geographic areas. Local economic and other conditions can affect the borrower's ability to repay and the value of the underlying collateral. In addition, certain states and municipalities have passed or may pass laws that limit our ability to foreclose or evict and make it more difficult and costly to manage our risk. 
 See Note 12 for more information about the geographic distribution of our Single-Family mortgage portfolio. 
 
 Delinquency Rates 
 We report Single-Family delinquency rates based on the number of loans in our Single-Family mortgage portfolio that are past due as reported to us by our servicers as a percentage of the total number of loans in our Single-Family mortgage portfolio. 
 The chart below presents the delinquency rates of mortgage loans in our Single-Family mortgage portfolio. 

The percentages of loans that were one month past due and two months past due increased as of September 30, 2024 compared to September 30, 2023. The percentage of loans one month past due can be volatile due to seasonality, whether the last day of the period falls on a weekend, and other factors that may not be indicative of default. As a result, the percentage of loans two months past due tends to be a better early performance indicator than the percentage of loans one month past due. 
 We have observed a higher serious delinquency rate during the first 12-24 months after origination for loans originated during 2022 and later compared to earlier vintages. See Note 3 for additional information on the payment status of our single-family mortgage loans.

Other includes repayment plans and foreclosure alternatives. 
 
 Our loan workout activity decreased, based on UPB, in the 2024 periods compared to the 2023 periods. Completed loan workout activity includes forbearance plans where borrowers fully reinstated the loan to current status during or at the end of the forbearance period, payment deferral plans, loan modifications, successfully completed repayment plans, short sales, and deeds in lieu of foreclosure. Completed loan workout activity excludes active loss mitigation activity that was ongoing and had not been completed as of the end of the period, such as forbearance plans that had been initiated but not completed and trial period modifications. There were approximately 16,000 loans in active forbearance plans and approximately 14,000 loans in other active loss mitigation activity as of September 30, 2024.

 Market Risk 
 Overview 
 Our business segments have embedded exposure to market risk, which is the economic risk associated with adverse changes in interest rates, volatility, and spreads. Market risk can adversely affect future cash flows, or economic value, as well as earnings and net worth. The primary sources of interest-rate risk are our investments in mortgage-related assets, the debt we issue to fund these assets, and our Single-Family guarantees. 
 
 Interest-Rate Risk 
 Our primary interest-rate risk measures are duration gap and Portfolio Value Sensitivity (PVS). Duration gap measures the difference in price sensitivity to interest rate changes between our financial assets and liabilities and is expressed in months relative to the value of assets. PVS is an estimate of the change in the present value of the cash flows of our financial assets and liabilities from an instantaneous shock to interest rates, assuming spreads are held constant and no rebalancing actions are undertaken. PVS is measured in two ways, one measuring the estimated sensitivity of our portfolio value to a 50 bps parallel movement in interest rates (PVS-L) and the other to a non-parallel movement resulting from a 25 bps change in the slope of the yield curve (PVS-YC). While we believe that duration gap and PVS are useful risk management tools, they should be understood as estimates rather than as precise measurements. 
 The tables below provide our duration gap, estimated point-in-time and minimum and maximum PVS-L and PVS-YC results, and an average of the daily values and standard deviation. The table below also provides PVS-L estimates assuming an immediate 100 bps shift in the yield curve. The interest-rate sensitivity of a mortgage portfolio varies across a wide range of interest rates.

 Earnings Sensitivity to Market Risk 
 The GAAP accounting treatment for our financial assets and liabilities (i.e., some are measured at amortized cost, while others are measured at fair value) creates variability in our GAAP earnings when interest rates and spreads change. We manage this variability of GAAP earnings, which may not reflect the economics of our business, using fair value hedge accounting. See MD A - Consolidated Results of Operations and MD A - Our Business Segments for additional information on the effect of changes in interest rates and market spreads on our financial results. 
 Freddie Mac 3Q 2024 Form 10-Q 32 

Management's Discussion and Analysis Risk Management 

Interest Rate-Related Earnings Sensitivity 
 While we manage our interest-rate risk exposure on an economic basis to a low level as measured by our models, our GAAP financial results are subject to significant earnings variability from period to period based on changes in market conditions. 
 In an effort to reduce our GAAP earnings variability and better align our GAAP results with the economics of our business, we elect to use hedge accounting for certain single-family mortgage loans and certain debt instruments. See Note 8 for additional information on hedge accounting. 
 Earnings Sensitivity to Changes in Interest Rates 
 We evaluate a range of interest rate scenarios to determine the sensitivity of our earnings due to changes in interest rates and to determine our fair value hedge accounting strategies. The interest rate scenarios evaluated include parallel shifts in the yield curve in which interest rates increase or decrease by 100 bps, non-parallel shifts in the yield curve in which long-term interest rates increase or decrease by 100 bps, and non-parallel shifts in the yield curve in which short-term and medium-term interest rates increase or decrease by 100 bps. This evaluation identifies the net effect on comprehensive income from changes in fair value attributable to changes in interest rates for financial instruments measured at fair value, including the effects of fair value hedge accounting, for each of the identified scenarios. This evaluation does not include the net effect on comprehensive income from interest-rate sensitive items that are not measured at fair value (e.g., amortization of mortgage loan premiums and discounts, changes in fair value of held-for-sale mortgage loans for which we have not elected the fair value option, etc.) or from changes in our future contractual net interest income due to repricing of our interest-bearing assets and liabilities. The before-tax results of this evaluation are shown in the table below.

 (1) The earnings sensitivity presented is calculated using the change in interest rates and net effective duration exposure. 
 The actual effect of changes in interest rates on our comprehensive income in any given period may vary based on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the composition of our assets and liabilities, the actual changes in interest rates that are realized at different terms along the yield curve, and the effectiveness of our hedge accounting strategies. Even if implemented properly, our hedge accounting programs may not be effective in reducing earnings volatility, and our hedges may fail in any given future period, which could expose us to significant earnings variability in that period.

 Other Investments Portfolio 
 Our other investments portfolio is important to our cash flow, collateral management, asset and liability management, and ability to provide liquidity and stability to the mortgage market. 
 Our liquidity and contingency operating portfolio primarily includes securities purchased under agreements to resell and non-mortgage-related securities. Our non-mortgage-related securities consist of U.S. Treasury securities and other investments that we could sell to provide us with an additional source of liquidity to fund our business operations. We also maintain non-interest-bearing deposits at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and interest-bearing deposits at commercial banks. Our interest-bearing deposits at commercial banks, including custodial accounts, totaled 4.5 billion and 5.1 billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. See MD A - Our Portfolios - Investments Portfolio - Other Investments Portfolio for additional information about our other investments portfolio. 
 
 Mortgage-Related Investments Portfolio 
 We invest principally in mortgage-related investments, certain categories of which are largely unencumbered and liquid. Our primary source of liquidity among these mortgage assets is our holdings of agency securities. See MD A - Our Portfolios - Investments Portfolio - Mortgage-Related Investments Portfolio for additional information about our mortgage loans and mortgage-related securities.

Management's Discussion and Analysis Critical Accounting Estimates 

 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 Our critical accounting estimates and policies relate to the Single-Family allowance for credit losses. For additional information about our critical accounting estimates and other significant accounting policies, see Note 1 and Critical Accounting Estimates in our 2023 Annual Report. 
 Single-Family Allowance for Credit Losses 
 The Single-Family allowance for credit losses represents our estimate of expected credit losses over the contractual term of the mortgage loans. The Single-Family allowance for credit losses pertains to all single-family loans classified as held-for-investment on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
 Determining the appropriateness of the Single-Family allowance for credit losses is a complex process that is subject to numerous estimates and assumptions requiring significant management judgment about matters that involve a high degree of subjectivity. This process involves the use of models that require us to make judgments about matters that are difficult to predict. 
 Changes in forecasted house price growth rates can have a significant effect on our allowance for credit losses estimates. The table below shows our nationwide forecasted house price growth rates that were used in determining our allowance for credit losses. See Note 5 for additional information regarding our current period provision for credit losses.

REGULATION AND SUPERVISION 
 In addition to oversight by FHFA as our Conservator, we are subject to regulation and oversight by FHFA under our Charter and the GSE Act and to certain regulation by other government agencies. FHFA has the power to require us from time to time to change our processes, take action and/or stop taking action that could impact our business. Furthermore, regulatory activities by other government agencies can affect us indirectly, even if we are not directly subject to such agencies' regulation or oversight. For example, regulations that modify requirements applicable to the purchase or servicing of mortgages can affect us. 
 
 Federal Housing Finance Agency 
 Affordable Housing Goals 
 Proposed Affordable Housing Goals for 2025-2027 
 On August 29, 2024, FHFA proposed its single-family and multifamily affordable housing goals for Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae for 2025-2027. In addition to setting the benchmark levels for the single-family and multifamily affordable housing goals, the proposed rule would establish a new process for evaluating compliance with the housing goals. Under the current regulation, if we were to fail to meet a feasible housing goal, FHFA may require us to submit a housing plan describing the steps that we will take to improve our performance. The proposed rule would provide that FHFA will not require a housing plan if our single-family housing goals performance met the level required by newly-defined Enforcement Factors. These Enforcement Factors address, in part, the uncertainty in forecasting the market several years in advance as well as the time lag in determining the actual market level retrospectively. The Enforcement Factors apply only to the single-family low-income home purchase, very low-income home purchase, and low-income refinance goals. Under the proposed rule, there would be a limit on the Enterprises' ability to rely entirely on the Enforcement Factors. Specifically, if an Enterprise fails to meet the low-income or very low-income home purchase goal in both 2025 and 2026, then the Enforcement Factor would not apply to that goal in 2027.

 (3) Maximum exposure to loss is based on our expected recovery receivables and excludes our obligations to make certain payments to the VIE to support payment of the interest due on the notes issued by the VIE, which we account for as derivative instruments. The notional value of these derivative instruments is equal to the total assets of the VIE.

 Over the last several years, numerous lawsuits have been filed against the U.S. government and, in some cases, the Secretary of the Treasury and the Director of FHFA, challenging certain government actions related to the conservatorship (including actions taken in connection with the imposition of conservatorship) and the Purchase Agreement. Freddie Mac is not a party to all of these lawsuits. Several of the lawsuits seek to invalidate the net worth sweep dividend provisions of the senior preferred stock, which were implemented pursuant to the August 2012 amendment to the Purchase Agreement. Some of these cases also have challenged the constitutionality of the structure of FHFA. A number of cases have been dismissed (some of which have been appealed), and others remain pending. 
 These cases include one that was filed in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims as a derivative lawsuit, purportedly on behalf of Freddie Mac as a nominal defendant: Reid and Fisher vs. the United States of America and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation . This case was filed on February 26, 2014. The complaint alleges, among other items, that the net worth sweep dividend provisions of the senior preferred stock constitute an unlawful taking of private property for public use without just compensation. The plaintiffs ask that Freddie Mac be awarded just compensation for the U.S. government's alleged taking of its property, attorneys' fees, costs, and other expenses. The Court dismissed the case with prejudice on September 1, 2023 and entered judgment for the defendants. On October 31, 2023, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal to the Federal Circuit. 
 Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, in addition to satisfying other conditions, all currently pending material litigation related to our conservatorship and/or the Purchase Agreement must be resolved or settled and we must indemnify Treasury and the United States from and against any loss, cost, or damage of any kind arising out of our placement into conservatorship or the August 2012 amendment to the Purchase Agreement in order to exit from conservatorship. 
 
 RISK FACTORS 
 This Form 10-Q should be read together with the Risk Factors section in our 2023 Annual Report, which describes various risks and uncertainties to which we are or may become subject. These risks and uncertainties could, directly or indirectly, adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, strategies, and/or prospects. 
 
 UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 
 Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities 
 The securities we issue are "exempted securities" under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. As a result, we do not file registration statements with the SEC with respect to offerings of our securities. 
 Following our entry into conservatorship, we suspended the operation of, and ceased making grants under, equity compensation plans. Previously, we had provided equity compensation under those plans to employees and members of the Board of Directors. Under the Purchase Agreement, we cannot issue any new options, rights to purchase, participations, or other equity interests without Treasury's prior approval. 
 Information About Certain Securities Issuances by Freddie Mac 
 We make available, free of charge through our website at www.freddiemac.com/investors , our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and all other SEC reports and amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file the material with the SEC. The SEC also maintains an internet site (www.sec.gov) that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding companies that file electronically with the SEC.

Controls and Procedures 

Controls and Procedures 
 EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that the information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC's rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management of the company, including the company's CEO and Interim CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing our disclosure controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and we must apply judgment in implementing possible controls and procedures. 
 Management, including the company's CEO and Interim CFO, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. As a result of management's evaluation, our CEO and Interim CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024, at a reasonable level of assurance, because we have not been able to update our disclosure controls and procedures to provide reasonable assurance that information known by FHFA on an ongoing basis is communicated from FHFA to Freddie Mac's management in a manner that allows for timely decisions regarding our required disclosure under the federal securities laws. We consider this situation to be a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. 
 CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING DURING 3Q 2024 
 We evaluated the changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during 3Q 2024 and concluded that there were no changes that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 MITIGATING ACTIONS RELATED TO THE MATERIAL WEAKNESS IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 
 As described above under Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures , we have one material weakness in internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024 that we have not remediated. 
 Given the structural nature of this material weakness, we believe it is likely that we will not remediate it while we are under conservatorship. However, both we and FHFA have continued to engage in activities and employ procedures and practices intended to permit accumulation and communication to management of information needed to meet our disclosure obligations under the federal securities laws. These include the following: 
 n FHFA has established the Division of Conservatorship Oversight and Readiness, which is intended to facilitate operation of the company with the oversight of the Conservator. 
 n We provide drafts of our SEC filings to FHFA personnel for their review and comment prior to filing. We also provide drafts of certain external press releases and statements to FHFA personnel for their review and comment prior to release. 
 n FHFA personnel, including senior officials, review our SEC filings prior to filing, including this Form 10-Q, and engage in discussions with us regarding issues associated with the information contained in those filings. Prior to filing this Form 10-Q, FHFA provided us with a written acknowledgment that it had reviewed the Form 10-Q, was not aware of any material misstatements or omissions in the Form 10-Q, and had no objection to our filing the Form 10-Q. 
 n Our senior management meets regularly with senior leadership at FHFA, including, but not limited to, the Director. 
 n FHFA representatives attend meetings frequently with various groups within the company to enhance the flow of information and to provide oversight on a variety of matters, including accounting, credit and capital markets management, external communications, and legal matters. 
 n Senior officials within FHFA's accounting group meet frequently with our senior financial executives regarding our accounting policies, practices, and procedures. 
 Although we and FHFA have attempted to design and implement disclosure policies and procedures to account for the conservatorship and accomplish the same objectives as disclosure controls and procedures for a typical reporting company, there are inherent structural limitations on our ability to design, implement, test, or operate effective disclosure controls and procedures under the circumstances of conservatorship. Despite our material weakness, we believe that our condensed consolidated financial statements for 3Q 2024 have been prepared in conformity with GAAP.

 You represent that you do not have any confidential information, trade secrets or other proprietary information that you obtained as the result of your employment with another employer that you will be using in your position at Freddie Mac. You also represent that you are not subject to any employment, confidentiality or stock grant agreements, or any other restrictions or limitations imposed by a prior employer, which would affect your ability to perform the duties and responsibilities for Freddie Mac in the job position offered, and further represent that you have provided Freddie Mac with copies of any non-competition, non-solicitation or similar agreements or limitations that have not expired, so that Freddie Mac can make an independent judgment that your employment with Freddie Mac is not inconsistent with any of its terms. 
 XI. Enforcement 
 A. You acknowledge that during your employment with Freddie Mac, you may be subject to corrective action, up to and including termination of employment, for your breach or threat of breach of any provision of this Agreement. You further agree that, following the conclusion of your employment with Freddie Mac, Freddie Mac may contact your future employers or take other legal steps necessary to protect Freddie Mac Confidential Information from improper use or disclosure, such as seeking injunctive relief or asserting legal claims. 
 B. You agree that in the event that you breach Section IV(A) or IV(B) of this Agreement, Freddie Mac may request that your new employer recuse you from any business transactions with Freddie Mac for six months. You further agree that Freddie Mac may also seek injunctive relief or asse1i legal claims such as breach of contract or tortious interference with contract, against you or your new employer. Finally, you agree that Freddie Mac may bar your new employer from doing business with Freddie Mac for a period of time. 
 5 

C. You acknowledge that if you are a Senior Vice President or above, in the event that you breach any provision of this Agreement during or after your employment with Freddie Mac, you may be subject to a forfeiture of any unpaid Deferred Salary you are eligible for under the Executive Management Compensation Program, notwithstanding the terms of any program, plan, agreement-Dr award to the contrary, to the extent permitted by applicable law. Such forfeiture shall be limited to such pay earned within six months prior to your separation from employment, or any unpaid severance pay you are eligible for from Freddie Mac. This forfeiture provision shall not apply to Deferred Salary earned prior to June 1, 2021. The Board of Directors, in the good faith exercise of their sole discretion, shall determine the appropriate dollar amount and type of compensation to be forfeited by you, if any. The Board of Directors will consider certain factors when determining the dollar amount of any forfeiture including materiality of the violation and proportionality of the violation as compared to the amount of compensation subject to forfeiture. 
 D. You agree that irreparable injury will result to Freddie Mac's business interests in the event of breach or threatened breach of this Agreement, the full extent of Freddie Mac's damages will be impossible to ascertain, and monetary damages will not be an adequate remedy for Freddie Mac. Therefore, you agree that in the event of a breach or threat of breach of any provision(s) of this Agreement, Freddie Mac, in addition to any other relief available, shall be entitled to temporary, preliminary, and permanent equitable relief to restrain any such breach or threat of breach by you and all persons acting for and or in concert with you, without the necessity of posting bond or security, which you expressly waive. 
 E. You agree that each of your obligations specified in this Agreement is a separate and independent covenant, and that all of your obligations set forth herein shall survive any termination, for any reason, of your Freddie Mac employment. To the extent that any provision of this Agreement is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable because it is overbroad, that provision shall be limited and enforced to the extent permitted by applicable law. Should any provision of this Agreement be declared or determined by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable or invalid under applicable law, the validity of the remaining obligations will not be affected thereby and only the unenforceable or invalid obligation will be deemed not to be a part of this Agreement. 
 F. This Agreement is governed by, and will be construed in accordance with, the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia, without regard to its or any other jurisdiction's conflict-of-law provisions. You agree that any action related to or arising out of this Agreement shall be brought exclusively in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, and you hereby irrevocably consent to personal jurisdiction and venue in such court and to service of process by United States Mail or express courier service in any such action. 
 G. If any dispute(s) arise(s) between Freddie Mac and you with respect to any matter which is the subject of this Agreement, the prevailing party in such dispute(s) shall be entitled to recover from the other party all of its costs and expenses, including its reasonable attorneys' fees. 
 XII. At-Will Employment Relationship 
 Nothing in this Agreement is intended or shall be construed to abrogate the at will employment relationship between you and Freddie Mac, and both you and Freddie Mac retain the right to terminate the employment relationship at any time for any lawful reason with or without notice.
