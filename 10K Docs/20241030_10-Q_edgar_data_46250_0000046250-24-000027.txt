 million related to estimated remediation expenses associated with perchlorinated biphenyls ("PCBs") discovered in the soil at our Rosemount, MN facility during our expansion project. We acquired the property, which had prior heavy industrial use, in fiscal 2012. While the source of the PCBs is unknown, we have never brought PCBs onto the property or used PCBs on the site. The liability is not discounted as management expects to incur these expenses within the next twelve months. Given the many uncertainties involved in assessing environmental claims, our reserves may prove to be insufficient. While it is possible that additional expense related to the remediation will be incurred in future periods if currently unknown issues arise, we are unable to estimate the extent of any further financial impact. No expenses were charged against this liability during the three and six months ended September 29, 2024.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 The following is a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for the six months ended September 29, 2024 as compared to the similar period ended October 1, 2023. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and notes to condensed consolidated financial statements included in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q and Item 8 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024 . 
 
 Overview 
 We derive substantially all of our revenues from the sale of chemicals and specialty ingredients to our customers in a wide variety of industries. We began our operations primarily as a distributor of bulk chemicals with a strong customer focus. Over the years, we have maintained the strong customer focus and have expanded our business by increasing our sales of value-added chemicals and specialty ingredients, including manufacturing, blending, and repackaging certain products. 
 
 Business Acquisitions 
 On June 28, 2024, we acquired substantially all the assets of Wofford Water Service, Inc. ("Wofford") for 3.4 million. Wofford distributed water treatment chemicals and equipment to customers mainly in Mississippi. The results of operations since the acquisition date and the assets are included in our Water Treatment segment. 
 
 On June 3, 2024, we acquired substantially all the assets of Intercoastal Trading, Inc. and certain related entities ("Intercoastal") for 22.0 million. Intercoastal distributes water treatment chemicals and equipment to its customers in Maryland, Delaware and Virginia. The results of operations since the acquisition date and the assets are included in our Water Treatment segment. 
 In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, we acquired substantially all the assets of Industrial Research Corporation ("Industrial Research") for 4.6 million. Industrial Research was a distributor of water treatment chemicals and equipment for its customers in central to northern Louisiana, eastern Texas and southern Arkansas. The results of operations since the acquisition and the assets are included in our Water Treatment segment. 
 In the third quarter of fiscal 2024, we acquired substantially all the assets of Miami Products Chemical Company ("Miami Products") for 15.5 million. Miami Products is a bleach manufacturer and distributor serving customers primarily throughout Ohio and the surrounding region. The results of operations and the assets, including goodwill associated with this acquisition, are included as part of our Water Treatment segment from the date of acquisition forward. 
 In the third quarter of fiscal 2024, we acquired substantially all the assets of Water Solutions Unlimited, Inc. ("Water Solutions") for 60 million and an additional amount to be paid after three years based on achieving certain targets. The total purchase price was estimated to be 70.7 million, including the estimated potential earnout to be paid of 10.7 million. Water Solutions is a manufacturer and distributor of water treatment chemicals serving customers primarily throughout Indiana, Illinois and Michigan. The results of operations and the assets, including goodwill associated with this acquisition, are included as part of our Water Treatment segment from the date of acquisition forward. 
 In the second quarter of fiscal 2024, we acquired substantially all the assets of EcoTech Enterprises, Inc. ("EcoTech") for 3.4 million. EcoTech was a manufacturer and distributor of water treatment chemicals serving customers throughout Arkansas and surrounding states. The results of operations and the assets are included as part of our Water Treatment segment from the date of acquisition forward. 
 The aggregate annual revenue of these six businesses acquired in fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2025 totaled approximately 85 million, as determined using the applicable twelve-month period preceding each respective acquisition date. 
 
 Share Repurchase Program 
 We have in place a share repurchase program for up to 2.6 million shares of our common shares. As of September 29, 2024, 831,946 shares remain available to be repurchased under this program. 
 
 Financial Results 
 We focus on total profitability dollars when evaluating our financial results as opposed to profitability as a percentage of sales, as sales dollars tend to fluctuate as raw material prices rise and fall, particularly in our Water Treatment and Industrial segments. The costs for certain of our raw materials can rise or fall rapidly, causing fluctuations in gross profit as a percentage of sales. 
 
 We use the last in, first out LIFO method of valuing the majority of our inventory in our Water Treatment and Industrial segments, which causes the most recent product costs to be recognized in our income statement. The LIFO inventory 
 valuation method and the resulting cost of sales are consistent with our business practices of pricing to current chemical raw material prices. Inventories in our Health and Nutrition segment are valued using the first-in, first-out FIFO method. 
 
 We disclose the sales of our bulk commodity products as a percentage of total sales dollars for our Water Treatment and Industrial segments. Our definition of bulk commodity products includes products that we do not modify in any way, but receive, store, and ship from our facilities, or direct ship to our customers in large quantities. We disclose the percentage of our overall sales that consist of sales of bulk commodity products as these products are generally distributed and we do not add significant value to these products in comparison to our non-bulk products. Sales of these products are generally highly competitive and price sensitive. As a result, bulk commodity products generally have our lowest margins. 

Results of Operations 
 The following table sets forth the percentage relationship of certain items to sales for the period indicated: 
 Three Months Ended Six Months Ended September 29, 2024 October 1, 2023 September 29, 2024 October 1, 2023 Sales 100.0 100.0 100.0 100.0 Cost of sales (75.6) (77.2) (75.2) (78.3) Gross profit 24.4 22.8 24.8 21.7 Selling, general and administrative expenses (10.7) (8.8) (10.2) (8.3) Operating income 13.7 14.0 14.6 13.4 Interest expense, net (0.6) (0.3) (0.5) (0.4) Other (expense) income 0.3 (0.1) 0.2 Income before income taxes 13.4 13.6 14.3 13.0 Income tax expense (3.6) (3.7) (3.7) (3.5) Net income 9.8 9.9 10.6 9.5 

Three Months Ended September 29, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended October 1, 2023 
 
 Sales 
 Sales were 247.0 million for the three months ended September 29, 2024, an increase of 10.5 million, or 4 , from sales of 236.5 million in the same period a year ago. Increased sales in our Water Treatment segment more than offset sales softness in our Industrial and Health and Nutrition segments. 
 
 Water Treatment Segment. Water Treatment segment sales increased 23.6 million, or 23 , to 124.5 million for the three months ended September 29, 2024, from sales of 100.9 million in the same period a year ago. Sales of bulk commodity products in the Water Treatment segment were approximately 8 of sales dollars for both the three months ended September 29, 2024 and in the same period a year ago. Sales increased as a result of added sales from acquired businesses. 
 
 Industrial Segment. Industrial segment sales decreased 8.6 million or 9 , to 89.9 million for the three months ended September 29, 2024, from sales of 98.5 million in the same period a year ago. Sales of bulk commodity products in the Industrial segment were approximately 15 of sales dollars in the three months ended September 29, 2024 and 13 in the same period a year ago. Although overall volumes increased slightly year over year, sales decreased as a result of lower selling prices on certain products, driven by lower raw material costs and competitive pricing actions. 
 
 Health Nutrition Segment. Health and Nutrition segment sales decreased 4.5 million, or 12 , to 32.6 million for the three months ended September 29, 2024, from sales of 37.1 million in the same period a year ago. Sales decreased due to lower sales of our manufactured products driven by reduced volumes and selling prices due to decreased demand for certain of our products. 
 
 Gross Profit 
 Gross profit increased 6.3 million, or 12 , to 60.2 million, or 24 of sales, for the three months ended September 29, 2024, from 53.9 million, or 23 of sales, in the same period a year ago. During the three months ended September 29, 2024, the

 Selling, general and administrative SG A expenses increased 5.6 million, or 27 , to 26.5 million, or 11 of sales, for the three months ended September 29, 2024, from 20.9 million, or 9 of sales, in the same period a year ago. Expenses increased primarily due to 3.8 million in added costs from the acquired businesses in our Water Treatment segment, including amortization of intangibles of 1.5 million. In addition, a year-over-year increase of 1.0 million in compensation expense related to our non-qualified deferred compensation plan increased SG A expenses, with the offset in other income. 
 
 Operating Income 
 Operating income increased 0.7 million, or 2 , to 33.7 million, or 14 of sales, for the three months ended September 29, 2024, from 33.0 million, or 14 of sales, in the same period a year ago due to the combined impact of the factors discussed above. 
 
 Interest Expense, Net 
 Interest expense was 1.4 million for the three months ended September 29, 2024 and 0.7 million the same period a year ago. Interest expense increased due to an increase in outstanding borrowings in the current year as compared to a year ago as well as a slightly higher interest rate. 
 
 Other Income (Expense) 
 Other income was 0.7 million for the three months ended September 29, 2024 compared to expense of 0.3 million in the same period a year ago. The current year income represents gains recorded on investments held for our non-qualified deferred compensation plan, while the prior year expense represented losses recorded on those investments. The amounts recorded as a gain were offset by similar amounts recorded as an increase or decrease to compensation expense within SG A expenses. 
 
 Income Tax Provision 
 Our effective income tax rate was 27 for both the three months ended September 29, 2024 and the three months ended October 1, 2023. The effective tax rate is impacted by projected levels of annual taxable income, permanent items, and state taxes. Our effective tax rate for the full year is expected to be approximately 26-27 .

Sales of bulk commodity products in the Industrial segment were approximately 14 of sales dollars in the six months ended September 29, 2024 and 13 in the same period of the prior year. Although overall volumes increased slightly year over year, sales decreased as a result of lower selling prices on certain of our products, driven by lower raw material costs and competitive pricing pressures. 
 
 Health Nutrition Segment. Health and Nutrition segment sales decreased 5.6 million, or 8 , to 68.1 million for the six months ended September 29, 2024, from sales of 73.7 million in the same period a year ago.

 Industrial Segment. Gross profit for the Industrial segment increased 2.9 million, or 8 to 40.1 million, or 21 of sales, for the six months ended September 29, 2024, and 37.2 million, or 17 of sales, in the same period a year ago. During the six months ended September 29, 2024, the LIFO reserve increased, and gross profit decreased, by 0.2 million. In the same quarter a year ago, the LIFO reserve decreased, and gross profit increased, by 3.0 million. Gross profit increased as a result of increased volumes of certain products and product mix changes. 
 
 Health and Nutrition Segment . Gross profit for our Health and Nutrition segment increased 1.2 million, or 9 , to 14.2 million, or 21 of sales, for the six months ended September 29, 2024, from 13.0 million, or 18 of sales, in the same period a year ago. Gross profit increased as a result of product mix changes. 
 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
 Selling, general and administrative SG A expenses increased 10.9 million, or 27 , to 51.3 million, or 10 of sales, for the six months ended September 29, 2024, from 40.4 million, or 8 of sales, in the same period a year ago. Expenses increased primarily due to the 7.2 million in added costs from the acquired businesses in our Water treatment segment, including amortization of intangibles of 2.7 million. In addition, a year-over-year increase of 0.8 million in compensation expense related to our non-qualified deferred compensation plan increased SG A expenses, with the offset in Other Income. Variable pay increased 0.7 million driven by our increased stock price. Wages and other variable expenses increased primarily as a result of business growth. 
 
 Operating Income 
 Operating income increased 8.0 million, or 12 , to 73.5 million, or 15 of sales, for the six months ended September 29, 2024, from 65.5 million, or 13 of sales, in the same period a year ago due to the combined impact of the factors discussed above. 
 
 Interest Expense, Net 
 Interest expense was 2.7 million for the six months ended September 29, 2024 and 1.9 million the same period a year ago. Interest expense increased due to an increase in outstanding borrowings in the current year as compared to a year ago as well as a higher interest rate. 
 
 Other Income (Expense) 
 Other income was 0.7 million for the six months ended September 29, 2024 compared to a nominal amount in the same period a year ago. The current year income represents gains recorded on investments held for our non-qualified deferred compensation plan. The amounts recorded as a gain were offset by similar amounts recorded as an increase to compensation expense within SG A expenses. 
 
 Income Tax Provision 
 Our effective income tax rate was 26 for the six months ended September 29, 2024 and 27 the six months ended October 1, 2023. The effective tax rate in the first six months of the current year was impacted by favorable tax provision adjustments recorded. The effective tax rate is impacted by projected levels of annual taxable income, permanent items, and state taxes. Our effective tax rate for the full year is currently expected to be approximately 26-27 . 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Cash was 7.5 million at September 29, 2024, an increase of 0.3 million as compared with the 7.2 million available as of March 31, 2024. 
 
 Cash provided by operating activities was 59.2 million for the six months ended September 29, 2024, compared to cash provided by operating activities of 92.6 million in the same period a year ago. The year-over-year decrease in cash provided by operating activities in the first six months of the current year was primarily driven by unfavorable year-over-year changes in inventory and accounts payable, slightly offset by increased net income compared to the same period a year ago. Due to the nature of our operations, which includes purchases of large quantities of bulk chemicals, the timing of purchases can result in significant changes in working capital investment and the resulting operating cash flow. 
 
 Cash u sed in investing activities was 46.3 million for the six months ended September 29, 2024, compared to 19.9 million in the sam e period a year ago. In the first six months of the current year, we incurred acquisition spending of 25.4 million, with the acquisitions of Intercoastal for 22.0 million and Wofford for 3.4 million. Capital expenditures were 21.3 million for the six months ended September 29, 2024, compared to 16.9 million in the same period a year ago. In the first six months of fiscal 2025, we purchased a building in Texas for 2.5 million and had more investments in equipment and containers, resulting in an increase in overall capital expenditures compared to the prior year. In the prior year, we invested 5.1 million to complete an expansion of one of our Minnesota manufacturing facilities. 
 
 Cash used in by financing activities was 12.5 million for the six months ended September 29, 2024, compared to 69.3 million of cash used in financing activities in the same period a year ago. Included in financing activities in the first six months of the current year were net debt proceeds of 5.0 million, compared to net debt payments of 52.0 million in the first six months of the prior year. In addition, we repurchased 9.1 million of our common stock in the first six months of the current year, compared to 9.8 million in the same period of the prior year. 
 
 We expect our cash balances and funds available under our credit facility, discussed below, along with cash flows generated from operations, will be sufficient to fund the cash requirements of our ongoing operations for the foreseeable future. 
 
 Our Board has authorized the repurchase of up to 2.6 million shares of our outstanding common shares. The shares may be purchased on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions subject to applicable securities laws and regulations. The primary objective of the share repurchase program is to offset the impact of dilution from issuances relating to employee and director equity grants and our employee stock purchase program. During the six months ended September 29, 2024, we repurchased 105,541 shares of common stock with an aggregate purchase price of 9.1 million. During the six months ended October 1, 2023,we repurchased 167,796 shares of common stock with an aggregate purchase price of 9.8 million. As of September 29, 2024, 831,946 shares remained available to be repurchased under the share repurchase program. 
 
 We are party to a second amended and restated credit agreement (the Credit Agreement with U.S. Bank National Association U.S. Bank as Sole Lead Arranger and Sole Book Runner, and other lenders from time to time party thereto (collectively, the Lenders ), whereby U.S. Bank is also serving as Administrative Agent. The Credit Agreement refinanced the revolving loan under our previous credit agreement with U.S. Bank and provides us with senior secured revolving credit facilities (the Revolving Loan Facility totaling 250 million. The Revolving Loan Facility includes a 10 million letter of credit subfacility and 25 million swingline subfacility. The Revolving Loan Facility has a five-year maturity date, maturing on April 30, 2027. The Revolving Loan Facility is secured by substantially all of our personal property assets and those of our subsidiaries. We may use the amount available under the Revolving Loan Facility for working capital, capital expenditures, 
 share repurchases, restricted payments and acquisitions permitted under the Credit Agreement, and other general corporate purposes. 
 
 Borrowings under the Revolving Loan Facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to one of the following, plus, in both cases, an applicable margin based upon our leverage ratio: (a) Term SOFR, which includes a credit spread adjustment of 0.10 , for an interest period of one, three or six months as selected by us, reset at the end of the selected interest period, or (b) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (1) U. S. Bank s prime rate, (2) the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 0.5 , or (3) one-month Term SOFR for U.S. dollars plus 1.0 . The Term SOFR margin is between 0.85 and 1.35 , depending on our leverage ratio. The base rate margin is between 0.00 and 0.35 , depending on our leverage ratio. At September 29, 2024, the effective interest rate on our borrowings was 4.5 . 
 
 In addition to paying interest on the outstanding principal under the Revolving Loan Facility, we are required to pay a commitment fee on the unutilized commitments thereunder. The commitment fee is between 0.15 and 0.25 , depending on our leverage ratio. 
 
 Debt issuance costs paid to the Lenders are being amortized as interest expense over the term of the Credit Agreement. As of September 29, 2024, the unamortized balance of these costs was 0.2 million, and is reflected as a reduction of debt on our balance sheet. 
 
 The Credit Agreement requires us to maintain (a) a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.15 to 1.00 and (b) a maximum total cash flow leverage ratio of 3.0 to 1.0. The Credit Agreement also contains other customary affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants that restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness, dispose of significant assets, make certain investments, including any acquisitions other than permitted acquisitions, make certain payments, enter into sale and leaseback transactions, grant liens on our assets or enter into rate management transactions, subject to certain limitations. We are permitted to make distributions, pay dividends and repurchase shares so long as no default or event of default exists or would exist as a result thereof. We were in compliance with all covenants of the Credit Agreement as of September 29, 2024 and expect to remain in compliance with all covenants for the next 12 months. 
 
 The Credit Agreement contains customary events of default, including failure to comply with covenants in the Credit Agreement and other loan documents, cross default to other material indebtedness, failure by us to pay or discharge material judgments, bankruptcy, and change of control. The occurrence of an event of default would permit the lenders to terminate their commitments and accelerate loans under the Credit Facility. 
 
 We have in place an interest rate swap agreement to manage the risk associated with a portion of our variable-rate long-term debt. We do not utilize derivative instruments for speculative purposes. The interest rate swap involves the exchange of fixed-rate and variable-rate payments without the exchange of the underlying notional amount on which the interest payments are calculated. The notional amount of the swap agreement is 60 million, and it will terminate on May 1, 2027. 
 
 As part of our growth strategy, we have acquired businesses and may pursue acquisitions or other strategic relationships in the future that we believe will complement or expand our existing businesses or increase our customer base. We believe we could borrow additional funds under our current or new credit facilities or sell equity for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 We are subject to the risk inherent in the cyclical nature of commodity chemical prices. However, we do not currently purchase forward contracts or otherwise engage in hedging activities with respect to the purchase of commodity chemicals. We attempt to pass changes in the cost of our materials to our customers. However, there are no assurances that we will be able to pass on the increases in the future. 
 
 We are exposed to market risks related to interest rates. Our exposure to changes in interest rates is primarily related to borrowings under our Revolving Loan Facility. We have in place an interest rate swap agreement to manage the risk associated with a portion of our variable-rate long-term debt. The interest rate swap involves the exchange of fixed-rate and variable-rate payments without the exchange of the underlying notional amount on which the interest payments are calculated. The notional amount of the swap agreement is 60.0 million, and it will terminate on May 1, 2027. As of September 29, 2024, a 25-basis point change in interest rates on our unhedged variable-rate debt would potentially increase or decrease our annual interest expense by approximately 0.1 million. 
 
 Other types of market risk, such as foreign currency risk, do not arise in the normal course of our business activities. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Based upon that evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 29, 2024. Disclosure controls and procedures are defined by Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act as controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed with the SEC under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, or person performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

ARTICLE 3 
 SEVERANCE BENEFITS 
 3.1 Termination Without Cause Not In Connection with a Change In Control .

For purposes of determining a Covered Executive s Severance Benefits under this Sec. 3.1, the Salary Continuation Period for a Covered Executive shall be the relevant period described in Appendix A . 
 a. Base Salary . Hawkins shall pay the Covered Executive his or her Base Salary for the Salary Continuation Period. Such Base Salary shall be paid in equal installments over the Salary Continuation Period in accordance with Hawkins standard payroll practices. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the following conditions and limitations on the payment of Base Salary shall apply 
 i. It is intended that all or a portion of the amounts payable during the six-month period following the Date of Termination will constitute separation pay due to involuntary separation from service under Treas. Reg. 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii). Accordingly, the amounts in excess of the Separation Pay Plan Amount that would otherwise have been payable during such six-month period shall be accumulated and paid (without interest) to the Covered Executive in a lump sum on the first day of the seventh month following the Date of Termination (subject to satisfaction of the conditions described in Sec. 2.3 by such date). 
 ii. Any installment payment(s) of Base Salary that otherwise would have been paid during such six-month period to the Covered Executive pursuant to this subsection, but solely for the fact that the conditions described in Sec. 2.3 have not yet been satisfied, shall be accumulated and paid (without interest) to the Covered Executive in a lump sum upon the first regularly scheduled payroll date following the satisfaction of such conditions. 
 b. Medical and Dental . Hawkins shall reimburse the Covered Executive for the amount of the employer portion of his or her premium payments for COBRA continuation coverage for medical and dental benefits for the Salary Continuation Period, or, if shorter, the 18-month period following the Date of Termination, if the Covered Executive qualifies for and elects that coverage for such period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, Hawkins obligation to make any payment or further payment pursuant to this subsection will cease on the date the Covered Executive becomes covered by another group health plan that does not impose pre-existing condition limitations on the Covered Executive s coverage. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to extend the period for which COBRA continuation coverage must be provided to the Covered Executive or the Covered Executive s dependents beyond that mandated by law. Such payments are intended to be medical reimbursements exempt from Code 409A pursuant to Treas. Reg. 1.409A-1(b)(9)(v)(B). 
 c. Outplacement Costs . Hawkins shall engage and pay on behalf of the Covered Executive, the reasonable costs of outplacement services for the twelve-month period following the Date of Termination. The payments under this subsection are intended to be exempt from Code 409A pursuant to Treas. Reg. 1.409A-1(b)(9)(v)(A). Accordingly, the costs of such outplacement services shall not be incurred beyond the last day of the second calendar year following the calendar year in which the Covered Executive's Date of Termination falls, and Hawkins payment shall be made before the end of the third calendar year following the calendar year in which the Covered Executive s Date of Termination for the Salary Continuation Period. 

3.2 Termination Due to Change in Control . In the event of a Covered Executive s Termination for Good Reason or Termination Without Cause that is also a Termination Due to Change in Control 
 a. The Covered Executive shall be entitled to the Severance Benefits described in Sec. 3.1, except that 
 i. for purposes of determining the Covered Executive s Severance Benefits under this Sec. 3.2, the Salary Continuation Period shall be the Salary Continuation Period for a Termination Due to Change in Control described in Appendix A . 
 ii. the amounts payable during the six-month period described in Sec. 3.1(a)(i) that constitute separation pay due to involuntary separation from service under Treas. Reg. 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii) shall be paid as soon as administratively practicable following the Date of Termination (subject to satisfaction of the conditions described in Sec. 2.3 by such date). 
 iii. if the Change in Control constitutes a change in ownership of a corporation under Treas. Reg. 1.409A-3(i)(5)(v), a change in the effective control of a corporation under Treas. Reg. 1.409A-3(i)(5)(vi), or a change in the ownership of a substantial portion of a corporation s assets as defined in Treas. Reg. 1.409A-3(i)(5)(vii), the Base Salary installment payments that would otherwise be payable for the remainder of the Salary Continuation Period following the period described in Sec. 3.1(a)(i) shall instead be paid in a lump sum on the first day of the seventh month following the Date of Termination (subject to satisfaction of the conditions described in Sec. 2.3 by such date). 
 b. The Covered Executive shall be entitled to the following additional Severance Benefits 
 i. Bonus . The Covered Executive shall be entitled to receive an amount equal to one-twelfth (1 12) of his or her Target Annual Bonus multiplied by the number of months in the Salary Continuation Period for a Termination Due to a Change in Control described in Appendix A . Such payment shall be made in a lump sum as soon as administratively practicable after the expiration of all rescission period(s) described in Sec. 2.3, but in any event not later than two and half months following the end of the year in which the Date of Termination occurs. Such amount is intended to be a short-term deferral pursuant to Treas. Reg. 1.409A-1(b)(4). 

ii. Profit Sharing Plan . The Covered Executive shall be entitled to receive an amount intended to provide a benefit equal to the additional benefit that the Executive would have received under the Profit Sharing Plan if such Covered Executive (x) had remained employed by Hawkins for the entire Salary Continuation Period and (y) had been entitled to Employer Contributions (as defined in the Profit Sharing Plan) under the Profit Sharing Plan for the Salary Continuation Period. 
 The amount of such payment shall equal the additional Discretionary Employer Profit Sharing Contribution (as defined in the Profit Sharing Plan) that the Covered Executive would have received for the Salary Continuation period if his her Compensation had continued at the same rate as in effect immediately prior to his her Termination of Employment and the rate of the Discretionary Employer Profit Sharing Contribution had been the same rate as in effect for the most recent Plan Year ending prior to the Termination of Employment, plus if, on the Date of Termination, the Profit Sharing Plan permits 401(k) Contributions, such Employer Matching Contributions the Covered Executive would have received for the Salary Continuation Period if he she had made 401(k) Contributions at least at the rate that would have entitled him her to the maximum Employer Matching Contributions permitted under the Plan. 
 Such payment shall be made in a lump sum as soon as administratively practicable after the expiration of all rescission period(s) described in Sec. 2.3, but in any event not later than two and half months following the end of the year in which the Date of Termination occurs. Such amount is intended to be a short-term deferral pursuant to Treas. Reg. 1.409A-1(b)(4). 
 iii. D eferred Compensation Plan. To the extent that a Covered Executive is eligible for and participating in the Deferred Compensation Plan, the Covered Executive shall be entitled to receive an amount equal to the additional benefit that the Covered Executive would have received under the Deferred Compensation Plan if such Covered Executive (x) had remained employed by Hawkins for the entire Salary Continuation Period and (y) had been entitled to Company Credits (as defined in the Deferred Compensation Plan) under the Deferred Compensation Plan for the Salary Continuation Period. 
 The amount of such payment shall equal the value of the Company Credits that the Covered Executive would have received for the Salary Continuation Period. 
 Such payment, if any, shall be made in a lump sum as soon as administratively practicable after the expiration of all recession period(s) described in Sec. 2.3, but in any event not later than two and half months following the end of the year in which the Date of Termination occurs. Such amount is intended to be a short-term deferral pursuant to Treas. Reg. 1.409A-1(b)(4). For the avoidance of doubt, this Sec. 3.2(b)(iii) shall in no way change the timing of distributions under the Deferred Compensation Plan. 
 3.3 Clawback. Any payment of a Severance Benefit hereunder shall be subject to, and recoverable by, Hawkins under Hawkins clawback policy in effect from time to time provided, however, that for any attempted recovery from and after a Change in Control, such clawback policy shall have been in effect prior to the Change in Control except as such policy has been modified to conform to applicable law or regulation.

ARTICLE 6 
 MISCELLANEOUS 
 6.1 Amendment and Termination . Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Plan may not be amended in any manner that adversely affects any Covered Executive unless such Covered Executive expressly consents to such amendment in writing. In the event of a Change in Control and for a period of two years thereafter, the Plan may not be amended, suspended or discontinued in any manner except to comply with applicable changes in the law, to prevent adverse tax consequences to a Covered Executive, or to make benefits more favorable to a Covered Executive. 
 6.2 Limitation of Covered Executive s Rights . Nothing in this Plan shall be construed as conferring upon the Covered Executive any right to continue in the employment of Hawkins, nor shall it interfere with the rights of Hawkins to terminate the employment of the Covered Executive and or to take any personnel action affecting the Covered Executive without regard to the effect which such action may have upon the Covered Executive as a recipient or prospective recipient of benefits under this Plan. Any amounts payable hereunder shall not be deemed salary or other compensation to the Covered Executive for the purposes of computing benefits to which the Covered Executive may be entitled under any other arrangement established by Hawkins for the benefit of its employees. 
 6.3 Application of Section 4999 to Severance Benefits . 
 a. Excise Tax Adjustment to Severance Benefits . Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Plan, in the event that any payment or benefit received or to be received by a Covered Executive, whether pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or any other plan, arrangement or agreement) (all such payments and benefits, including the Severance Benefits, being hereinafter referred to as the Total Payments would be subject (in whole or part), to an excise tax under Code 4999 (the Excise Tax ), then, after taking into account any reduction in the Total Payments provided by reason of Code 280G in such other plan, arrangement or agreement, the payments under this Plan that do not constitute deferred compensation within the meaning of Code 409A shall first be reduced, and all other payments that do constitute deferred compensation within the meaning of Code 409A shall thereafter be reduced (beginning with those payments last to be paid), to the extent necessary so that no portion of the Total Payments is subject to the Excise Tax, but only if (i) the net amount of such Total Payments, as so reduced (and after subtracting the net amount of federal, state and local income taxes on such reduced Total Payments and after taking into account the phase out of itemized deductions and personal exemptions attributable to such reduced Total Payments) is greater than or equal to (ii) the net amount of such Total Payments without such reduction (but after subtracting the net amount of federal, state and local income taxes on such Total Payments and the amount of Excise Tax to which the Covered Executive would be subject in respect of such unreduced Total Payments and after taking into account the phase out of itemized deductions and personal exemptions attributable to such unreduced Total Payments). In no event shall the Covered Executive have the discretion to determine the order in which payments under this Plan shall be reduced in accordance with the preceding sentence. 

b. Excise Tax Determination . For purposes of determining whether and the extent to which the Total Payments will be subject to the Excise Tax and the amount of such Excise Tax, (i) no portion of the Total Payments the receipt or enjoyment of which the Covered Executive shall have waived at such time and in such manner as not to constitute a payment within the meaning of Code 280G(b) of the Code shall be taken into account, (ii) no portion of the Total Payments shall be taken into account which, in the opinion of tax counsel Tax Counsel reasonably acceptable to the Covered Executive and selected by the accounting firm (the Auditor which was, immediately prior to the Change in Control, Hawkins independent auditor, does not constitute a parachute payment within the meaning of Code 280G(b)(2) (including by reason of Code 280G(b)(4)(A)) and, in calculating the Excise Tax, no portion of such Total Payments shall be taken into account which, in the opinion of Tax Counsel, constitutes reasonable compensation for services actually rendered, within the meaning of Code 280G(b)(4)(B), in excess of the Covered Executive s base amount allocable to such reasonable compensation, and (iii) the value of any non-cash benefit or any deferred payment or benefit included in the Total Payments shall be determined by the Auditor in accordance with the principles of Code 280G(d)(3) and (4). For purposes of this Sec. 6.3, (i) the Covered Executive shall be deemed to pay federal income tax at the highest marginal rate of federal income taxation in the calendar year in which the applicable Total Payment is to be made and state and local income taxes at the highest marginal rate of taxation in the state and locality of the Covered Executive s residence in the calendar year in which the applicable Total Payment is to be made, net of the maximum reduction in federal income taxes which could be obtained from deduction of such state and local taxes and (ii) except to the extent that the Covered Executive otherwise notifies Hawkins, the Covered Executive shall be deemed to be subject to the loss of itemized deductions and personal exemptions to the maximum extent provided by the Code for each dollar of incremental income. 
 c. Payments Calculation Notice . At the time that payments are made under this Plan, Hawkins shall provide the Covered Executive with a written statement setting forth the manner in which such payments were calculated and the basis for such calculations including, without limitation, any opinions or other advice Hawkins has received from Tax Counsel, the Auditor or other advisors or consultants (and any such opinions or advice which are in writing shall be attached to the statement). If the Covered Executive objects to Hawkins calculations, Hawkins shall pay to the Covered Executive such portion of the Total Payments (up to 100 thereof) as the Covered Executive determines is necessary to result in the proper application of subsection (a) of this Sec. 6.3. 
 6.4 Legal Fees and Expenses . Hawkins shall pay to the Covered Executive all legal fees and expenses incurred by the Covered Executive in disputing in good faith any issue hereunder relating to the termination of the Covered Executive s employment, in seeking in good faith to obtain or enforce any benefit or right provided by this Plan, or in connection with any tax audit or proceeding to the extent attributable to the application of Code 4999 to any payment or benefit provided hereunder. Such payments shall be made within ten business days after delivery of the Covered Executive s written request for payment accompanied with such evidence of fees and expenses incurred as Hawkins reasonably may require, subject to the limits of Sec. 6.9. If Hawkins shall have reimbursed the Covered Executive for legal fees and expenses and it is later determined that the Covered Executive was not acting in good faith, all amounts paid on behalf of, or reimbursed to, the Covered Executive shall be promptly refunded to Hawkins. 

6.5 Right of Offset . Hawkins reserves the right to withhold and set off from any payments to a Covered Executive any amount owed to Hawkins or an Affiliate by the Covered Executive, whether such obligation is matured or unmatured and however arising, at the time of (and with priority over) any such distribution or payment to the extent that the retention or exercise of such right does not have adverse tax consequences to the Covered Executive under Code 409A (for clarity, this offset right is against amounts then due and payable and is not intended to accelerate payment of any amount). Hawkins further reserves the right to withhold and set off from the Covered Executive s accrued benefit under the Plan (even if a payment is not then due and payable) any amount owed to Hawkins or an Affiliate by the Covered Executive, as satisfaction of such obligation of the Covered Executive, where such obligation is incurred in the ordinary course of the service relationship between the Covered Executive and Hawkins or the Affiliate, the entire amount of reduction in any of Hawkins or the Affiliate s taxable years does not exceed five thousand dollars 5,000), and the reduction is made at the same time and in the same amount as the obligation otherwise would have been due and collected from the Covered Executive. 
 6.6 Nonalienation of Benefits . Except as expressly provided herein, the Covered Executive shall not have the power or right to transfer, alienate or otherwise encumber his or her interest under the Plan. Hawkins obligations under the Plan are not assignable or transferable except to (a) any corporation or partnership which acquires all or substantially all of Hawkins assets, or (b) any corporation or partnership into which Hawkins may be merged or consolidated. The provisions of this Plan shall inure solely to the benefit of the Covered Executive. 
 6.7 Cooperation by Covered Executive . The Covered Executive shall cooperate with Hawkins by furnishing any and all information reasonably requested by Hawkins in order to facilitate the payment of benefits hereunder. 
 6.8 Withholding Taxes . Hawkins may make such provisions and take such action as it deems necessary or appropriate for the withholding of any taxes which Hawkins is required by any law or regulation of any governmental authority, whether Federal, state or local, to withhold in connection with any benefits under the Plan, including, but not limited to, the withholding of appropriate sums from any amount otherwise payable to the Covered Executive. The Covered Executive, however, shall be responsible for the payment of all individual tax liabilities relating to any such benefits. 
 6.9 Compliance with Code 409A . This Plan and the payments hereunder are intended to be exempt from or to satisfy the requirements of Code 409A(a)(2), (3) and (4), including the exceptions for short-term deferrals, separation pay arrangements, reimbursements, and in-kind distributions, and shall be interpreted and administered accordingly. Each payment under this Plan is intended to be treated as one of a series of separate payments for purposes of Code 409A and Treas. Reg. 1.409A-2(b)(2)(iii) (or any similar or successor provisions). To the extent that payments under this Plan are subject to Code 409A and the Covered Executive is a specified employee (as defined in Code 409A) as of the Date of Termination, distributions to the Covered Executive may not be made before the date that is six months after the Date of Termination or, if earlier, the date of the Covered Executive s death. Payments to which the Covered Executive would otherwise be entitled during the first six months following the date of termination will be accumulated and paid on the first day of the seventh month following the Date of Termination (or the Covered Executive s death, if earlier). To the extent that payments under this Plan are payments under a reimbursement plan subject to Code 409A, the right to reimbursement may not be exchanged for cash or any other benefit, the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement in one calendar year shall not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement in any other calendar year, and the reimbursement of any eligible expense shall be made pursuant to Hawkins normal policies and procedures for expense reimbursement, which shall be in any event no later than the last day of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the expense was incurred. 
 6.10 Unfunded Plan . The Plan shall not be funded, and no Covered Executive shall have any right to, or interest in, any assets of Hawkins or its Affiliates or subsidiaries. 

6.11 Severability . If any provision of this Plan is held unenforceable, the remainder of the Plan shall continue in full force and effect without regard to such unenforceable provision and shall be applied as though the unenforceable provision were not contained in the Plan. 
 6.12 Governing Law . This Plan shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of the State of Minnesota, without reference to the principles of conflict of laws and to the extent not superseded by the laws of the United States. span 
 6.13 Jurisdiction and Venue . Any action involving claims of a breach of this Plan must be brought exclusively in the courts of the State of Minnesota and or the United States District Court, District of Minnesota. 
 6.14 Headings . Headings are inserted in this Plan for convenience of reference only and are to be ignored in the construction of the provisions of the Plan. 
 6.15 Notice . Any notice or filing required or permitted to be given to Hawkins under this Plan shall be sufficient if in writing and hand delivered, or sent by registered or certified mail, to the Human Resources Department, or to such other entity as Hawkins may designate from time to time. Such notice shall be deemed given as to the date of delivery, or, if delivery is made by mail, as of the date shown on the postmark on the receipt for registration or certification. 
 6.16 Successors . This Plan shall be binding upon Hawkins and its successors and assigns. Hawkins shall require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to assume and agree to perform all of Hawkins obligations hereunder in the same manner and to the same extent that Hawkins would have been required to perform if no succession had taken place.
