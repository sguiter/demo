EXPLANATORY NOTE 
 
 L.B. Foster Company (the Company is filing this Amendment No. 1 on Form 10-Q/A (the Amended Form 10-Q to amend and restate certain items in the Company s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2024, which was originally filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC on May 7, 2024 (the Original Form 10-Q ). This Amended Form 10-Q includes the restated Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the three months ended March 31, 2024. 
 
 Restatement Background 
 
 As disclosed in the Company s Item 4.02 Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on October 8, 2024, subsequent to the filing of the Original Form 10-Q, the Company identified an error related to the classification of the 3,477 thousand gain on the sale of the former joint venture facility located in Magnolia, Texas, which sale was completed in the first quarter of 2024 (the Magnolia Sale and reflected in the Company s Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations for the three month period ended March 31, 2024. Upon completion of the Magnolia Sale, the Company recorded the 3,477 thousand gain in Other (income) expense - net in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations. The Company had concluded that such classification was appropriate, as the facility was built for the purpose of a direct financing lease from the Company to the joint venture and such facility was not utilized by the Company in its operating activities. However, in accordance with ASC 360-10-45-5, the 3,477 thousand gain on the Magnolia Sale should have been recorded as a component of Operating income and not Other (income) expense - net. As a result of this classification error, Operating income was understated by 3,477 thousand and Other (income) expense - net was overstated by 3,477 thousand in the Company s Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations for the three months ended March 31, 2024 included within the Original Form 10-Q. 
 
 Accordingly, on October 7, 2024 (the Determination Date ), the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company (the Audit Committee ), based on the recommendation of the Company s management, concluded that the classification of the Magnolia Sale gain described in the preceding paragraph was an error in the Company s previously issued Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations for the three months ended March 31, 2024, as filed within the Original Form 10-Q, and that such statement should be restated to correct such error. Accordingly, the Audit Committee concluded as of the Determination Date that the previously issued Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the three months ended March 31, 2024, as included in the Original Form 10-Q, should no longer be relied upon. 
 
 The Company s management has also concluded that its disclosure controls and procedures as of March 31, 2024 were not effective because of a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting due to the lack of an effectively designed control related to the accounting for, and disclosure of, non-recurring complex transactions. A discussion of the Company s plans to remediate this material weakness is set forth in the revised Part I - Item 4. Controls and Procedures of this Amended Form 10-Q. Additionally, for the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company identified other immaterial errors that have also been corrected with this filing. 
 
 The Company has included in this Amended Form 10-Q updated certifications executed by the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer as of the date of this Amended 10-Q as required by Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The updated certifications are included hereto as Exhibits 31.1, 31.2, and 32.0. 
 
 This classification error in the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations for the three months ended March 31, 2024 does not impact Total net sales, Income before income taxes, Income tax expense, Net income, Basic earnings per common share, Diluted earnings per common share, management incentive compensation or the Company s credit facility covenants, or any disclosed non-GAAP metrics, including Adjusted EBITDA and organic sales. 
 
 The Company is filing this Amended Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2024 to amend and restate the following items included in the Original Form 10-Q: 
 
 Part I - Item 1. Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited); 
 Part I - Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations; 
 Part I - Item 4. Controls and Procedures; 
 Part II - Item 1A. Risk Factors; and 
 Part II - Item 6. Exhibits. 
 
 Pursuant to Rule 12b-15, this Amended Form 10-Q sets forth the complete text of each item listed above, as amended. Except for such items, this Amended Form 10-Q does not amend, update or change any other items or disclosures in the Original Form 10-Q and 
 continues to describe the conditions as of the date of the Original Form 10-Q. As such, except as set forth herein, we have not updated or modified the disclosures contained in the Original Form 10-Q to reflect any events that have occurred after the Original Form 10-Q.

 Segment operating income (loss), as shown above, includes allocated corporate operating expenses. Allocated corporate operating expenses include costs associated with central services such as quality, logistics, environmental health and safety, information technology, insurance, and human resources. Other corporate functional costs that are associated with the operating segments are also allocated to the segments such as finance, marketing, credit and collections, and treasury functions. Operating expenses related to corporate headquarter functions were allocated to each segment based on segment headcount, revenue contribution, or activity of the business units within the segments, based on the corporate activity type provided to the segment. Management believes the allocation of corporate operating expenses provides an accurate presentation of how the segments utilize corporate support activities. This provides the CODM meaningful segment profitability information to support operating decisions and the allocation of resources. The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies found in Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements contained in its Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Certain corporate costs are separately managed on a consolidated basis and are not allocated to the operating segments.

Additionally, certain corporate executive management costs, including costs of the corporate executive leadership team, and corporate management stock-based compensation expenses are not allocated to the operating segments. Finally, interest expense, income taxes, and certain other items included in other income and expense which are managed on a consolidated basis are not allocated to the operating segments.

 The majority of the Company s revenue is from products transferred and services rendered to customers at a point in time. The Company recognizes revenue at the point in time at which the customer obtains control of the product or service, which is generally when the product title passes to the customer upon shipment or the service has been rendered to the customer. In limited cases, title does not transfer and revenue is not recognized until the customer has received the products at a designated physical location.

 The Company s performance obligations under long-term agreements with its customers are generally satisfied over time. Over time revenue is primarily comprised of transit infrastructure and technology services and solutions projects within the Rail segment, precast concrete buildings within the Precast Concrete Products division in the Infrastructure segment, and long-term bridge projects and custom precision metering systems within the Steel Products division in the Infrastructure segment. Revenue under these long-term agreements is generally recognized over time, either using an input measure based upon the proportion of actual costs incurred to estimated total project costs or an input measure based upon actual labor costs as a percentage of estimated total labor costs, depending upon which measure the Company believes best depicts the Company s performance to date under the terms of the contract, or an output method, specifically units delivered, based upon certain customer acceptance and delivery requirements. The use of an input or an output measure to recognize revenue is determined based on what is most appropriate given the nature of the work performed and terms of the associated agreement. 
 
 Accounting for these long-term agreements involves the use of various techniques to estimate total revenues and costs. The Company estimates profit on these long-term agreements as the difference between total estimated revenues and expected costs to complete a contract and recognizes that profit over the life of the contract. As a result of management s reviews of contract-related estimates the Company makes adjustments to contract estimates that impact our revenue and profit totals. Changes in estimates are primarily attributed to updated considerations, including economic conditions and historic contract patterns, resulting in changes to anticipated revenue from existing contracts. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, reductions to net sales stemming from changes in actual and expected values of certain commercial contracts and settlements of such contracts were . Such adjustments were

The Company has established policies regarding allowance for credit losses associated with contract assets, which includes standalone reserve assessments for its long term, complex contracts as needed as well as detailed regular review and updates to contract margins, progress, and value.

Management also regularly reviews collection patterns and future expected collections and makes necessary revisions to allowance for credit losses related to contract assets.

 The Company established the allowance for credit losses by calculating the amount to reserve based on the age of a given trade receivable and considering historical collection patterns, bad debt expense experience, expected future trends of collections, current and expected market conditions, and any other relevant subjective adjustments as needed. Management maintains high-quality credit review practices and positive customer relationships that mitigate credit risks. The Company s reserves are regularly reviewed and revised as necessary.

 Environmental and Legal Proceedings 
 The Company is subject to national, state, foreign, provincial, and/or local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. The Company s efforts to comply with environmental regulations may have an adverse effect on its future earnings. 
 
 On June 5, 2017, a General Notice Letter was received from the United States Environmental Protection Agency EPA indicating that the Company may be a potentially responsible party PRP regarding the Portland Harbor Superfund Site cleanup along with numerous other companies. More than other companies received such a notice. The Company and a predecessor owned and operated a facility near the harbor site for a period prior to 1982. The net present value and undiscounted costs of the selected remedy throughout the harbor site are estimated by the EPA to be approximately billion and billion, respectively, and the remedial work is expected to take as long as years to complete. These costs may increase given that the remedy will not be initiated or completed for several years. The Company is reviewing the basis for its identification by the EPA and the nature of the historic operations of a Company predecessor near the site. Additionally, the Company executed a PRP agreement which provides for a private allocation process among almost PRPs in a working group whose work is ongoing and involves a process that will ultimately conclude a proposed allocation of liability for cleanup of the site and various sub-areas. The Company does not have any individual risk sharing agreements in place with respect to the site, and was only associated with the site from 1976 to when it purchased the stock of a company whose assets it sold in 1982 and which was dissolved in 1994. On March 26, 2020, the EPA issued a Unilateral Administrative Order to parties requiring them to perform remedial design work for that portion of the Harbor Superfund Site that includes the area closest to the facility; the Company was not a recipient of this Unilateral Administrative Order. The Company cannot predict the ultimate impact of these proceedings because of the large number of PRPs involved throughout the harbor site, the size and extent of the site, the degree of contamination of various wastes, varying environmental impacts throughout the harbor site, the scarcity of data related to the facility once operated by the Company and a predecessor, potential comparative liability between the allocation parties and regarding non-participants, and the speculative nature of the remediation costs. Based upon information currently available, management does not believe that the Company s alleged PRP status regarding the Portland Harbor Superfund Site or other compliance with the present environmental protection laws will have a material adverse effect on the , results of operations, cash flows, competitive position, or capital expenditures of the Company. As more information develops and the allocation process is completed, and given the resolution of factors like those described above, an unfavorable resolution could have a material adverse effect. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company maintained environmental reserves approximating and , respectively. 
 
 The Company is also subject to other legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of its business. Legal actions are subject to inherent uncertainties, and future events could change management s assessment of the probability or estimated amount of potential losses from pending or threatened legal actions. Based on available information, it is the opinion of management that the ultimate resolution of pending or threatened legal actions, both individually and in the aggregate, will not result in losses having a material adverse effect on the Company s financial position or liquidity as of March 31, 2024. 
 
 If management believes that, based on available information, it is at least reasonably possible that a material loss (or additional material loss in excess of any accrual) will be incurred in connection with any legal actions, the Company discloses an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss, either individually or in the aggregate, as appropriate, if such an estimate can be made, or discloses that an estimate cannot be made. Based on the Company s assessment as of March 31, 2024, no such disclosures were considered necessary.

 Results Summary 
 Net sales of 124,320 for the three months ended March 31, 2024, increased by 8,832, or 7.6 , over the prior year quarter. The increase in sales is due to organic sales growth of 19,474 or 16.9 , partially offset by the divestiture of the Ties and Chemtec businesses as well as the Bridge Exit which reduced sales by 10,642 or 9.2 . 
 
 Gross profit for the three months ended March 31, 2024 increased 2,869 or 12.3 , over the prior year quarter and gross profit margins expanded by 90 basis points to 21.1 . The improvement in gross profit is due primarily to the portfolio changes that are a part of the Company s strategic transformation, as well as uplift from increased sales volumes and product mix. 
 
 Selling and administrative expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2024 increased by 1,453, or 6.8 , over the prior year quarter, due primarily to increased personnel costs and professional services expenditures. Selling and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales decreased to 18.4 from 18.5 in the prior year quarter. 
 
 The 3,477 gain on sale of the former joint venture facility for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was attributed to the Company s facility and land in Magnolia, Texas. 
 
 Net interest expense decreased 263 due to lower outstanding debt, on average, for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the prior year quarter. The Company s outstanding debt balance was 78,085 as of March 31, 2024, compared to 80,096 as of March 31, 2023. 
 
 Other income - net for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was 253 compared to other expense - net for the three months ended March 31, 2023 of 1,849, which was primarily due to the 2,033 loss on the sale of Chemtec during the prior year quarter. 
 
 The Company s effective income tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was 6.2 , compared to 19.9 in the prior year quarter. The Company s effective income tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2024 differed from the federal statutory rate of 21 primarily due to the realization of a portion of its U.S. deferred tax assets previously offset by a valuation allowance. The Company continues to maintain a full valuation allowance against its U.S. deferred tax assets, which is likely to result in significant variability of the effective tax rate in the current year.

 The Rail segment sales for the three months ended March 31, 2024 increased by 18,239, or 28.3 , compared to the prior year quarter. The increase was due to higher organic sales of 18,940, or 29.4 , partially offset by a 701, or 1.1 , decrease from the divestiture of Ties. Rail Products sales increased 12,810 driven by strength in domestic markets served. Technology Services and Solutions sales increased by 7,227 due to strength in domestic rail safety markets served, as well as improvement in United Kingdom markets. Global Friction management sales declined 1,798 driven by the timing of orders which have increased from the 2023 fourth quarter by 29.6 . 
 
 The Rail segment gross profit increased by 4,287, or 30.0 compared to the prior year quarter, and gross profit margins expanded 30 basis points to 22.5 . Technology Services and Solutions business unit gross profit improved by 4,086 due to higher volume and improved mix. Higher volumes in Rail Products resulted in gross profit increasing by 1,369.

 Segment operating income increased 4,384 compared to the prior year, and operating income margins expanded 450 basis points to 8.2 . The increase was driven by improvement in gross profit levels as a result of increased sales volume and favorable business mix, particularly in the Technology Services and Solutions business unit. 
 
 During the current quarter, new orders within the Rail segment increased by 10,019, or 13.6 , compared to the prior year quarter. The increase in new orders was attributable to the Rail Products and Global Friction Management businesses, which was offset in part by the Ties divestiture which reduced orders by 2,729 as well as lower overall order rates in the Technology Services and Solutions business unit. Segment backlog as of March 31, 2024 was 86,038, a decrease of 27,555, or 24.3 , versus the prior year quarter. The decrease is attributed to the Rail Products business, including a reduction of 3,549 related to the divestiture of Ties, partially offset by a 27.7 increase in Global Friction Management backlog.

O rganic sales increased by 534, or 1.0 , while being adversely affected by weather conditions that impacted customer project execution in our Precast Concrete Products business.

Table of Contents 

 The Infrastructure segment gross profit for the three months ended March 31, 2024, decreased by 1,418, or 15.7 , due primarily to the divestiture of Chemtec which reduced gross profit by 888 and softness in margins in our Precast Concrete Products business.

 Segment operating loss for the first quarter of 2024 was 1,388 compared to an operating loss in the prior year of 340. The segment operating loss was due to lower gross profit levels, which was partially offset by a decrease in amortization expense and selling and administrative expenses. 
 
 During the quarter, the Infrastructure segment had a decrease in new orders of 17,149, or 26.1 , compared to the prior year quarter. The decrease is due to an 8,538 impact associated with the divestiture of Chemtec and the Bridge Exit as well as decreases in orders in the Precast Concrete Products and Protective Coatings businesses. Backlog as of March 31, 2024 was 136,223, a decrease of 10,065, or 6.9 , versus the prior year quarter, driven primarily by a reduction of 8,509 related to the Bridge Exit.

 The Company s principal sources of liquidity are its existing cash and cash equivalents, cash generated by operations, and the available capacity under the revolving credit facility, which provides for a total commitment of up to 130,000, of which 50,071 was available for borrowing as of March 31, 2024, subject to covenant restrictions. The Company s primary needs for liquidity relate to working capital requirements for operations, capital expenditures, debt service obligations, payments related to the Union Pacific Railroad Settlement, tax obligations, outstanding purchase obligations, acquisitions and to support the share repurchase program. The Company s total debt, including finance leases, was 78,085 and 55,273 as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and was primarily comprised of borrowings under its revolving credit facility. 
 
 The following table reflects available funding capacity as of March 31, 2024: 
 March 31, 2024 Cash and cash equivalents 3,148 Credit agreement: Total availability under the credit agreement 130,000 Outstanding borrowings on revolving credit facility (77,497) Letters of credit outstanding (2,432) Net availability under the revolving credit facility 50,071 Total available funding capacity 53,219 
 
 As of March 31, 2024 we were in compliance with all covenants of the Credit Agreement and have 53,219 available funding capacity. 
 
 The Company s operating cash flows are impacted from period to period by fluctuations in working capital needs, as well as its overall profitability. While the Company places an emphasis on working capital management in its operations, factors such as its contract mix, commercial terms, days sales outstanding DSO ), and market conditions as well as seasonality may impact its working capital. The Company regularly assesses its receivables and contract assets for collectability and realization, and provides allowances for credit losses where appropriate. The Company believes that its reserves for credit losses are appropriate as of March 31, 2024, but

 adverse changes in the economic environment and adverse financial conditions of its customers may impact certain of its customers ability to access capital and pay the Company for its products and services, as well as impact demand for its products and services. 
 
 The changes in cash and cash equivalents for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 were as follows: 
 Three Months Ended March 31, 2024 2023 Net cash (used in) provided by operating activities (21,444) 6,932 Net cash provided by investing activities 789 4,661 Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 21,298 (12,022) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (55) 186 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents 588 (243) 
 
 Cash Flow from Operating Activities 
 During the three months ended March 31, 2024, net cash used in operating activities was 21,444, compared to cash provided by operating activities of 6,932 during the prior year quarter. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, net income and adjustments to reconcile net income from operating activities provided 5,414, compared to 3,352 in the prior year quarter. Working capital and other assets and liabilities were a use of 26,858 in the current period, compared to a source of 3,580 in the prior year quarter. The change in operating cash flow for the three months ended March 31, 2024 versus the three months ended March 31, 2023 was largely driven by accounts receivable, which was a use of 4,042 during the current quarter compared to the 26,239 provided in the prior year quarter. Order execution and collection timing can impact accounts receivables in any given quarter. 
 
 Cash Flow from Investing Activities 
 Capital expenditures for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 were 2,712 and 699, respectively. Capital expenditures in both periods primarily relate to general plant and operational improvements throughout the Company, as well as organic growth initiatives. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company sold the facility and land of its former joint venture in Magnolia, Texas generating a cash inflow of 3,501. During the three months ended March 31, 2023 the Company received cash proceeds from the Chemtec divestiture totaling 5,344. 
 
 Cash Flow from Financing Activities 
 During the three months ended March 31, 2024 the Company had an increase in outstanding debt of 22,911 compared to March 31, 2023 in which the Company has a decrease in debt of 12,047. The increase in debt for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was primarily due to cash used in operating activities due to organic growth initiatives and higher seasonal working capital needs. The decrease in debt for the 2023 period was due to lower working capital as well as proceeds received from the Chemtec divestiture during the quarter. 
 
 During the first quarter of 2023, the Company s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 15,000 of the Company s common stock in open market transactions through February 2026. For the three months ended March 31, 2024 the Company repurchased 16,555 shares of its stock for 385 under this program. Repurchases of shares of the Company s common stock may be made from time to time in the open market or in such other manner as determined by the Company. The timing of the repurchases and the actual amount repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including the market price of the Company s shares, general market and economic conditions, and other factors. The stock repurchase program does not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of common stock and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. 
 
 Financial Condition 
 As of March 31, 2024, the Company had 3,148 in cash and cash equivalents and 50,071 of availability under its revolving credit facility, subject to covenant restrictions. As of March 31, 2024, approximately 2,729 of the Company s cash and cash equivalents were held in non-domestic bank accounts. 
 
 The Company s principal uses of cash in recent years have been to fund its operations, including capital expenditures, repurchase of shares, acquisitions, funding the UPRR Settlement Agreement, and service indebtedness. The Company views its short and long-term liquidity as being dependent on its results of operations, changes in working capital needs, and its borrowing capacity. 
 
 On August 13, 2021, the Company, its domestic subsidiaries, and certain of its Canadian and United Kingdom subsidiaries (collectively, the Borrowers ), entered into the Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement with PNC Bank, N.A., Citizens Bank, N.A., Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, Bank of America, N.A., and BMO Harris Bank, National Association. The Credit Agreement, as amended, modifies the prior amended revolving credit facility, on terms more favorable to the 
 25 

Table of Contents 

 Company and extends the maturity from April 30, 2024 to August 13, 2026. The Credit Agreement provides for a five-year, revolving credit facility that permits aggregate borrowings of the Borrowers up to 130,000 with a sublimit of the equivalent of 25,000 U.S. dollars that is available to the Canadian and United Kingdom borrowers in the aggregate. The Credit Agreement s incremental loan feature permits the Company to increase the available commitments under the facility by up to an additional 50,000 subject to the Company s receipt of increased commitments from existing or new lenders and the satisfaction of certain conditions. On August 12, 2022, the Company entered into a second amendment to its Credit Agreement (the Second Amendment which added an additional tier to the pricing grid and provided for the conversion from LIBOR-based to SOFR-based borrowings. For a discussion of the terms and availability of the credit facilities, please refer to Note 7 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q/A. 
 
 To reduce the impact of interest rate changes on outstanding variable-rate debt, the Company amended and entered into SOFR-based interest rate swaps with notional values totaling 20,000 and 20,000, effective August 12, 2022 and August 31, 2022, respectively, at which point the agreements effectively converted a portion of the debt from variable to fixed-rate borrowings during the term of the swap contract. 
 
 Backlog 
 Although backlog is not necessarily indicative of future operating results, the following table provides the backlog by segment: 
 Backlog March 31, 2024 December 31, 2023 March 31, 2023 Rail, Technologies, and Services 86,038 84,418 113,593 Infrastructure Solutions 136,223 129,362 146,288 Total backlog 222,261 213,780 259,881 
 While a considerable portion of the Company s business is backlog driven, certain businesses, including the Global Friction Management business unit, are not driven by backlog and therefore have insignificant levels of backlog throughout the year. Backlog decreased 37,620 compared to the prior year quarter due to 12,058 from businesses that were divested and a discontinued product line. The remaining decline is associated with the timing of large orders for the Rail Products business. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in conformity with US GAAP. The preparation of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. As a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. The Company has concluded that there have been no significant changes to its critical accounting policies or estimates as described in its Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 In accordance with SEC rules, the Company provides descriptions of the non-GAAP financial measures included in this filing and reconciliations to the most closely related GAAP financial measures. The Company believes that these measures provide useful perspective on underlying business trends and results and a supplemental measure of year-over-year results. The non-GAAP financial measures described below are used by management in making operating decisions, allocating financial resources and for business strategy purposes and may, therefore, also be useful to investors as they are a view of our business results through the eyes of management. These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to be considered by the user in place of the related GAAP financial measure, but rather as supplemental information to our business results. These non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as similar measures used by other companies due to possible differences in method and in the items or events being adjusted. 
 
 References in this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations to organic sales refer to sales calculated in accordance with GAAP, adjusted to exclude divestiture, exit, and acquisition-related sales. Management evaluates the Company s sales performance based on organic sales growth. Organic sales growth is a non-GAAP financial measure of sales growth (which is the most directly comparable GAAP measure), adjusted to exclude the effects of divestiture, exit, and acquisition-related sales from year-over-year comparisons. The Company believes this measure provides investors with a supplemental understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis. The Company reports organic sales growth at the consolidated and segment levels. 
 
 The Company defines new orders as a contractual agreement between the Company and a third-party in which the Company will, or has the ability to, satisfy the performance obligations of the promised products or services under the terms of the agreement. The Company defines backlog as contractual commitments to customers for which the Company s performance obligations have not been met, including with respect to new orders and contracts for which the Company has not begun any performance. Management utilizes new orders and backlog to evaluate the health of the industries in which the Company operates, the Company s current and future

 results of operations and financial prospects, and strategies for business development. The Company believes that new orders and backlog are useful to investors as supplemental metrics by which to measure the Company s current performance and prospective results of operations and financial performance. 
 
 Non-GAAP financial measures are not a substitute for GAAP financial results and should only be considered in conjunction with the Company s financial information that is presented in accordance with GAAP.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 L.B. Foster Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of March 31, 2024. At the time of the filing of the Company s Original Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2024 on May 7, 2024, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. Subsequent to that evaluation on October 7, 2024, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, due to a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting described below, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of March 31, 2024. 
 
 27 

Table of Contents 

 Material Weakness in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. We have identified the following unremediated material weakness in internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2024. 
 
 Subsequent to the filing of the Company s Original Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company concluded it did not design effective controls related to the accounting for, and disclosure of, non-recurring complex transactions as of March 31, 2024. This material weakness resulted in a material error in the Company s previously issued Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the three months ended March 31, 2024 included in the Original Form 10-Q leading to the restatement of these financial statements in this Amended Form 10-Q. 
 
 Management s Remediation Efforts 
 In response to the material weakness described above, with the oversight of the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, the Company will conduct more thorough and diligent accounting research and, when necessary, engage third-parties to assist with the accounting for, and disclosure of, non-recurring complex transactions. 
 
 The remediation efforts are intended both to address the identified material weakness and to enhance our overall internal control environment. The Company is committed to continuous improvement of its internal control over financial reporting and will continue to diligently review and enhance its internal controls, as necessary. The Company cannot be assured that the measures we have taken to date, or that we may take in the future, will be sufficient to remediate the material weakness we identified or avoid future material weaknesses. Accordingly, there could continue to be a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our consolidated financial statements would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 Other than the material weakness described above, there were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the three months ended March 31, 2024, and that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 
 In designing and evaluating disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.
