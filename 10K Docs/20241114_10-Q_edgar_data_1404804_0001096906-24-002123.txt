For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company reported a net loss of and net cash used in operating activities of 26,296. Management believes that based on its operating plan, the projected sales for 2024, combined with funds available from its working capital will be sufficient to fund operations for the next twelve months. However, there can be no assurance that operations and operating cash flows will continue at the current levels or improve in the near future. Whether, and when, the Company can attain profitability and positive cash flows from operations is uncertain. The Company is also uncertain whether it can raise additional capital. These uncertainties cast substantial doubt upon the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year from the issuance of these financial statements. Our financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of operations. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability or classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts or classification of liabilities should we be unable to continue as a going concern.

 The Company recognizes compensation expense for stock-based awards expected to vest on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award based on their grant date fair value. The Company estimates the fair value of stock options using a Black-Scholes option pricing model which requires management to make estimates for certain assumptions regarding risk-free interest rate, expected life of options, expected volatility of stock and expected dividend yield of stock. When determining expected volatility, the Company considers the historical performance of the Company s stock, as well as implied volatility. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant, based on the options expected term. The expected term of the options is based on the Company s evaluation of option holders exercise patterns and represents the period of time that options are expected to remain unexercised. The Company uses historical data to estimate the timing and amount of forfeitures.

 L iquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Overview 
 
 Our primary sources of liquidity are cash provided by financing activities and available working capital. Additionally, from time to time, we may raise funds from the equity capital markets to fund our research and development programs, expansion of our business and general operations. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, our current liabilities totaled 2,063,174 and our current assets totaled 733,846 resulting in negative working capital of 1,329,328. 
 
 We have no firm commitments or obligations for capital expenditures. However, substantial discretionary expenditures may be required to enable us to conduct existing and planned product research, design, development, manufacturing, marketing and distribution of our products. We may need to raise additional capital to facilitate growth and support our long-term product development, manufacturing, and marketing programs. The Company has no established bank-financing arrangements. Therefore, it is possible that we may need to seek additional financing through subsequent future public or private sales of our securities, including equity securities. We may also seek funding for the development, manufacturing, and marketing of our products through strategic partnerships and other arrangements with corporate partners. There can be no assurance, however, that such collaborative arrangements or additional funds will be available when needed, or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. If adequate funds are not available, we may be required to curtail one or more of our research and development programs. 
 
 We have historically incurred significant losses, which have resulted in a total accumulated deficit of 22,068,002 at September 30, 2024.

 Operating Activities 
 
 We realized a negative cash flow from operations of 26,295 for the nine months period ended September 30, 2024, compared with a negative cash flow of 64,332 during the same period the prior year. 
 
 Included in the operating loss of 192,029 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 are non-cash expenses, which are not a drain on our capital resources. During this period, these non-cash expenses included the value of options granted in the amount of 5,010 and depreciation and amortization of 2,365. Additionally, the operating loss included general and administrative expenses of 451,716 and research and development expenses of 53,758. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 
 We realized a 0.00 cash flow from financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with positive cash flow of 15,113 for the same period the prior year. The positive cash flow for the same period in the prior year was due to proceeds from related party note payable. 
 
 Investing Activities 
 
 We realized negative cash flow from investing activities of 6,335 for the nine months period ended September 30, 2024 compared with negative cash flow from investing activities of 0 for the same period in the prior year. The negative cash flow for the period ended September 30, 2024 related to purchases of fixed assets. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 
 None. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 Accounting Method and Use of Estimates 
 
 The Company's financial statements are prepared using the accrual method of accounting. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Areas where significant estimates are required include the following: 
 
 Accounts Receivable 
 
 Trade receivables are carried at original invoice amount less an estimate made for doubtful receivables based on a review of all outstanding amounts on a monthly basis. Management determines the allowance for doubtful accounts by identifying troubled accounts and by using historical experience applied to an aging of accounts. Trade receivables are written off when deemed uncollectible. Recoveries of trade receivables previously written off are recorded when received. 
 
 Inventory 
 
 Inventories are stated at the lower of market or average cost basis. The Company reviews inventories on hand at least annually and records provisions for estimated excess, slow moving and obsolete inventory, as well as inventory with a carrying value in excess of net realizable value. The regular and systematic inventory valuation reviews include a current assessment of future product demand, historical experience and product expiration. Accordingly, the Company has established an allowance for the cost of such obsolete inventory. 
 Page 17 
 
 Long-lived assets 
 
 The Company assesses the recoverability of its long-lived assets annually and whenever circumstances indicate that there may be an impairment. The Company compares the estimated undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying value of the long-lived assets to determine if impairment has occurred. In the event that impairment has occurred, the Company recognizes the impairment immediately. 
 
 Revenue Recognition 
 
 In general, revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for the goods or services. In order to achieve that core principle, a five-step approach is applied: (1) identify the contract with a customer, (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (3) determine the transaction price, (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (5) recognize revenue allocated to each performance obligation when we satisfy the performance obligation. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer and is the unit of account for revenue recognition. 
 
 We recognize revenue on various products and services as follows: 
 
 Products - The Company recognizes revenue from the sale of products as performance obligations are satisfied. Those sales predominantly contain a single delivery element, and revenue is recognized at a single point in time when ownership and risks transfer (i.e. the performance obligation has been satisfied). In general, ownership and risk passes FOB shipping point, or as negotiated. 
 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 
 The Company has evaluated recent accounting pronouncements, and their adoption has not had or is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s financial position, or statements. 
 
 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are not required to provide the information under this item. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by our company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 Our management performed an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our Principal Executive Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act"). Based upon that evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024. The material weakness, which relates to internal control over financial reporting, which was identified is: due to our small size, we do not have a proper segregation of duties in certain areas of our financial reporting process. This control deficiency, which is pervasive in nature, results in a reasonable possibility that material misstatements of the financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
 Page 18 
 
 Changes in Internal Controls 
 
 There have not been any changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 
 On September 16, 2022 the Company received a Summons and was named as a cross-defendant in the matter of Olson-Ecologic Engine Testing Laboratories, LLC -v- Michael Naylor, Omnitek Engineering Corp., and Moto Concerto, Inc. , filed in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Orange, Central Justice Center, Case No. 30-2020-01171344. Olson-Ecologic Engine Testing Laboratories, LLC filed the cross-complaint in response to the original complaint filed by Michael Naylor against Olson-Ecologic Engine Testing Laboratories. Omnitek served as a subcontractor to Olson-Ecologic who received a grant in May 2017 from the California Energy Commission. In October 2017, very early in the project and before completion of the project, which was to run into 2020, Olson-Ecologic advised Omnitek that the California Energy Commission had terminated the project. In the cross-complaint Olson-Ecologic alleges that Omnitek participated with Mr. Naylor in overcharging Olson-Ecologic, however, Olson-Ecologic does not provide a specific statement of facts or actions of what Omnitek allegedly did. Olson-Ecologic s cross-complaint and allegations against Omnitek are without merit and Omnitek will vigorously defend the cross-complaint. On July 29, 2024, the court stayed the case until January 27, 2025. 
 
 We are not a party to any other pending legal proceeding. No federal, state or local governmental agency is presently contemplating any proceeding against the Company. No director, executive officer or affiliate of the Company or owner of record or beneficially of more than five percent of the Company's common stock is a party adverse to the Company or has a material interest adverse to the Company in any proceeding.
