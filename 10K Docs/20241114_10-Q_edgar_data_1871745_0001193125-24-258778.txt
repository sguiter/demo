 SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 

 , for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar Business Combination with one or more businesses (the Business Combination ). The Company may pursue an initial Business Combination target in any business or industry. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had not commenced operations. All activity for the period from March 9, 2021 (inception) through September 30, 2024, relates to the Company s formation and the initial public offering (the Public Offering and, subsequent to the Public Offering, identifying a target company for a Business Combination and completion of the proposed Business Combination (described below). The Company will not generate operating revenues until after the completion of its initial Business Combination, at the earliest. The Company will generate non-operating
 income in the form of interest income from the proceeds derived from the Public Offering. 
 The Company s Sponsor is DSAC Partners LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the Sponsor ). On September 28, 2021, the Company consummated its Public Offering of units (the Units and with respect to the Class A common stock included in the Units sold, the Public Shares ). Each Unit consists of one share of Class A common stock of the Company, par value per share (the Class A Common Stock ), and one-half
 of redeemable warrant of the Company (each whole warrant, a Public Warrant ), with each Public Warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share of Class A Common Stock for per share, subject to adjustment. The Units were sold at a price of per Unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of . 
 On January 24, 2024, the SEC adopted new rules and regulations for SPACs, which became effective on July 1, 2024, that will affect SPAC Business Combination transactions (the 2024 SPAC Rules ). The 2024 SPAC Rules require, among other matters, (i) additional disclosures relating to SPAC Business Combination transactions; (ii) additional disclosures relating to dilution and to conflicts of interest involving Sponsors and their affiliates in both SPAC initial public offerings and Business Combination transactions; (iii) additional disclosures regarding projections included in SEC filings in connection with proposed Business Combination transactions; and (iv) the requirement that both the SPAC and its target company be co-registrants
 for Business Combination registration statements. In addition, the SEC s adopting release provided guidance describing circumstances in which a SPAC could become subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act, including its duration, asset composition, business purpose, and the activities of the SPAC and its management team in furtherance of such goals. The 2024 SPAC Rules may materially affect the Company s ability to complete an initial Business Combination and may increase the costs and time related thereto. 
 Simultaneously with the closing of the Public Offering, pursuant to the Private Placement Warrants Purchase Agreement, the Company completed the private sale of warrants (the Private Placement Warrants to the Sponsor at a purchase price of per Private Placement Warrant, generating gross proceeds to the Company of . The Private Placement Warrants are identical to the Public Warrants included as part of the Units sold in the Public Offering, except that the Private Placement Warrants, so long as they are held by the Sponsor or its permitted transferees, (i) are not redeemable by the Company, (ii) may not (including the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants), subject to certain limited exceptions, be transferred, assigned or sold until days after the completion of the Company s initial Business Combination, (iii) may be exercised on a cashless basis and (iv) are entitled to registration rights. underwriting discounts or commissions were paid with respect to such sale. The issuance of the Private Placement Warrants was made pursuant to the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 (the Securities Act ), as amended. 
 The Business Combination must occur with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value of at least of the net assets held in the Trust Account (net of amounts disbursed to management for working capital purposes and excluding the amount of any deferred underwriting commissions held in trust) at the time of signing the agreement to enter into the Business Combination. However, the Company will only complete such Business Combination if the post transaction company owns or acquires or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target business sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act ). There is no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully effect a Business Combination. 
 Upon the closing of the Public Offering, per Unit sold in the Public Offering, including the proceeds of the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, was held in a Trust Account and invested only in U.S. government securities with a maturity of days or less, in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7
 under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations or in demand deposit accounts. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account that may be released to the Company to pay its taxes, the proceeds from the Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants will not be released from the Trust Account until the earliest of (i) the completion of the initial Business Combination, (ii) the redemption of the public shares if the Company is unable to complete the initial Business Combination by the Termination Date, subject to applicable law, and (iii) the redemption of the public shares properly submitted in connection with a stockholder vote to amend the Company s amended and restated certificate of incorporation Charter to modify the substance or timing of the Company s obligation to redeem of the public shares if the Company has not consummated an initial Business Combination by the Termination Date or with respect to any other material provisions relating to stockholders rights or pre-initial
 Business Combination activity. The proceeds deposited in the Trust Account could become subject to the claims of the Company s creditors, if any, which could have priority over the claims of the Company s public stockholders. 
 The Company will provide its public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of the initial Business Combination either (i) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the Business Combination or (ii) without a stockholder vote by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether the Company will seek stockholder approval of a proposed Business Combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by the Company, solely in the Company s discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction 

to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations and on the conditions described herein. 
 The initial stockholders, Sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with the Company, pursuant to which they have agreed to (i) waive their redemption rights with respect to any founder shares and Public Shares they hold in connection with the completion of the initial Business Combination, (ii) waive their redemption rights with respect to any founder shares and Public Shares they hold in connection with a stockholder vote to approve an amendment to the Company s Charter to modify the substance or timing of the Company s obligation to redeem of the Public Shares if the Company has not consummated an initial Business Combination within the Combination Period or with respect to any other material provisions relating to stockholders rights or pre-initial Business Combination
 activity and (iii) waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to any founder shares they hold if the Company fails to complete its initial Business Combination within the Combination Period or any extended period of time that the Company may have to consummate an initial Business Combination as a result of an amendment to the Company s Charter (although they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to any Public Shares they hold if the Company fails to complete its initial Business Combination within the prescribed time frame) and (iv) vote any founder shares held by them and any Public Shares purchased during or after the Public Offering (including in open market and privately-negotiated transactions) in favor of the initial Business Combination. 
 The Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to the Company if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has entered into a written letter of intent, confidentiality or other similar agreement or Business Combination agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below the lesser of (i) per Public Share and (ii) the actual amount per Public Share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account, if less than per Public Share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, less taxes payable, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party or prospective target business who executed a waiver of any and all rights to the monies held in the Trust Account (whether or not such waiver is enforceable) nor did it apply to any claims under the Company s indemnity of the underwriters of the Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. However, the Company has not asked the Sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor has the Company independently verified whether the Sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and the Company believes that the Sponsor s only assets are securities of the Company. Therefore, the Company cannot assure you that the Sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. 
 The shares of common stock subject to redemption are recorded at redemption value and classified as temporary equity, in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board s FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 480 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity. In such case, the Company will proceed with a Business Combination if the Company seeks stockholder approval and a majority of the issued and outstanding shares voted are voted in favor of the Business Combination. 
 With the December 28, 2022 deposit into the Trust Account for a extension of per share), the Company had months (or until March 28, 2023) from the closing of the Public Offering, or any extended period of time that the Company may have, to consummate an initial Business Combination as a result of an amendment to the Company s Charter (the Combination Period to complete the initial Business Combination. If the Company is unable to complete the initial Business Combination within the Combination Period, the Company will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at aper-share
 price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable and less up to to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the Company s remaining stockholders and the Company s board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject, in each case, to the Company s obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to the warrants, which will expire worthless if the Company fails to complete its initial Business Combination within the Combination Period.

excise tax on certain repurchases (including redemptions and economically similar transactions) of stock by publicly traded U.S. corporations on or after January 1, 2023. The Company is considered a covered corporation within the meaning of the IR Act. The excise tax is imposed on the repurchasing corporation itself, not its stockholders from which shares are repurchased (although it may reduce the amount of cash distributable in a current or subsequent redemption). The amount of the excise tax is generally 1 of the fair market value of the shares repurchased, determined at the time of the repurchase. Corporations are permitted to net the fair market value of certain new stock issuances by such corporation against the fair market value of stock repurchases (or deemed repurchases) during the same taxable year to reduce or eliminate the amount of excise tax that would otherwise apply. In addition, certain exceptions apply to the excise tax. The U.S. Department of the Treasury (the Treasury has authority to provide regulations and other guidance to carry out, and prevent the abuse or avoidance of, the excise tax. 
 Whether and to what extent we would be subject to the excise tax will depend on a number of factors, including (i) whether the redemption is treated as a repurchase of stock for purposes of the excise tax, (ii) the fair market value of the redemptions treated as repurchases in connection with a Business Combination, (iii) the structure of a Business Combination and whether any such transaction closes, (iv) the nature and amount of any private investment in public equity PIPE or other equity issuances in connection with a Business Combination (or otherwise issued not in connection with a Business Combination but issued within the same taxable year of a Business Combination), (v) whether we consummate a Business Combination, and (vi) the content of regulations and other guidance issued by the Treasury. It is possible that the Company will be subject to the excise tax with respect to any subsequent redemptions, including redemptions in connection with a Business Combination, that are treated as repurchases for this purpose (other than, pursuant to recently issued guidance from the Treasury, redemptions in complete liquidation of the Company). As mentioned, the excise tax is imposed on the repurchasing corporation itself, not the stockholders from which stock is repurchased. The imposition of the excise tax (including as a result of holders of public shares electing to exercise their redemption rights in connection with a Business Combination) could, however, reduce the amount of cash available to the Company to pay redemptions (or the cash contribution to the target business in connection with a Business Combination, which could hinder the Company s ability to complete a Business Combination or cause the other shareholders of the combined company to economically bear the impact of such excise tax). 
 On September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company recognized and , respectively, in excise tax payable related to share redemptions. In accordance with ASC340-10-S99-1,

the liability does not impact the statements of operations and is offset against accumulated deficit because additional paid-in
 capital is not available. 
 During the second quarter of 2024, the IRS issued final regulations with respect to the timing and payment of the excise tax. Pursuant to those regulations, the Company would need to file a return and remit payment for any liability incurred during the period from January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023 on or before October 31, 2024. In October 2024, the Company filed its excise tax return but did not make an excise tax payment. 
 The Company is currently evaluating its options with respect to payment of this obligation. If the Company is unable to pay its obligation in full, it will be subject to additional interest and penalties which are currently estimated at interest per annum and a underpayment penalty per month or portion of a month up to of the total liability for any amount that is unpaid from November 1, 2024 until paid in full.

 The Company has entered into promissory notes and working capital loans with the Sponsor for a total of outstanding as of September 30, 2024. These Notes bear no interest and are due upon liquidation or consummation of an initial Business Combination. If the Company completes an initial Business Combination, the Company would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the Trust Account released to the Company. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds held outside the Trust Account. In the event that the initial Business Combination does not close, the Company may use a portion of the working capital held outside the Trust Account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from the Trust Account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to of such loans may be convertible into warrants, at a price of per warrant at the option of the lender. 

to the Trust Account, to consummate an initial Business Combination. 
 It is uncertain that the Company will be able to consummate an initial Business Combination within 12 months from the issuance date of these unaudited condensed financial statements or obtain additional funding. If an initial Business Combination is not consummated by the required date, there will be a mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution. In the event of a dissolution, we anticipate a shortfall of liquidity. Our anticipated shortfall of sufficient liquidity to meet our current and future estimated financial obligations raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for a period of time within one year after the date that the accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements are issued. We plan to address this uncertainty through working capital loans and through consummation of our initial Business Combination. There is no assurance that working capital loans will be available to us or that our plans to consummate an initial Business Combination will be successful.

Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. We have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations and projections about future events. These forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and assumptions about us that may cause our actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as may, should, could, would, expect, plan, anticipate, believe, estimate, continue, or the negative of such terms or other similar expressions.

Each CVR I represents the right of the holder thereof to receive its pro rata share of 2,000,000 newly issued PubCo Class A Ordinary Shares, and each CVR I shall be exercised automatically upon PubCo s delivery of the CVR Payment Notice (as defined in the CVR Agreement) to the Rights Agent, notifying the Rights Agent that, during the 12 month period ending on the final day of the month in which the second anniversary of the Closing occurs, the consolidated revenues of PubCo and its subsidiaries was less than 50 million.

Each CVR III represents the right of the holder thereof to receive its pro rata share of 2,000,000 newly issued PubCo Class A Ordinary Shares, and each CVR III shall be exercised automatically upon PubCo s delivery of the CVR Payment Notice, notifying the Rights Agent that, during the 12 month period ending on the final day of the month in which the fourth anniversary of the Closing occurs, the consolidated revenues of PubCo and its subsidiaries was less than 263 million. The contingent payments under the CVR Agreement, if they become payable, will become payable to the Rights Agent for subsequent distribution to the holders of the CVRs. There can be no assurance that any payment of any PubCo Ordinary Shares will be made or that any holders of CVRs will receive any amounts with respect thereto. The right to the contingent payments contemplated by the CVR Agreement is a contractual right only. The CVRs will not be evidenced by a certificate or other instrument. The CVRs will not be transferable. The CVRs will not have any voting or dividend rights and will not represent any equity or ownership interest in PubCo or any of its affiliates. No interest will accrue on any amounts payable in respect of the CVRs. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of September 30, 2024, we had 8,988 in our operating bank account and a working capital deficit of 14,135,149. The Company has entered into promissory notes and working capital loans with the Sponsor for a total of 7,626,942 outstanding at September 30, 2024. These Notes bear no interest and are due upon liquidation or consummation of an initial Business Combination. If the Company completes an initial Business Combination, the Company would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the Trust Account released to the Company. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds held outside the Trust Account. In the event that the initial Business Combination does not close, the Company may use a portion of the working capital held outside the Trust Account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from the Trust Account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to 1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants, at a price of 1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. As of the date of this filing, the Company has until November 28, 2024, unless otherwise extended pursuant to the Charter and with a monthly additional deposit of 90,000 to the Trust Account, to consummate an initial Business Combination. It is uncertain that we will be able to consummate an initial business combination within 12 months from the issuance date of these unaudited condensed financial statements or obtain additional funding. If an initial Business Combination is not consummated by the required date of April 28, 2024, there will be a mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution. In the event of a dissolution, we anticipate a shortfall of liquidity. Our anticipated shortfall of sufficient liquidity to meet our current and future estimated financial obligations raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for a period of time within one year after the date that the accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements are issued. We plan to address this uncertainty through loans and through consummation of our initial Business Combination. There is no assurance that loans will be available to us or that our plans to consummate an initial Business Combination will be successful. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of September 30, 2024, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements. Risks and Uncertainties Various social and political circumstances in the U.S. and around the world (including wars and other forms of conflict, rising trade tensions between the United States and China, and other uncertainties regarding actual and potential shifts in the U.S. and foreign trade, economic and other policies with other countries, terrorist acts, security operations and catastrophic events such as fires, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes and global health epidemics), may also contribute to increased market volatility and economic uncertainties or deterioration in the U.S. and worldwide. Specifically, the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and resulting market volatility could adversely affect the Company s ability to complete a Business Combination. In response to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the U.S. and other countries have imposed sanctions or other restrictive actions against Russia. Any of the above factors, including sanctions, export controls, tariffs, trade wars and other governmental actions, could have a material adverse effect on the Company s ability to complete a Business Combination and the value of the Company s securities. In addition, we depend on a variety of U.S. and multi-national financial institutions to provide us with banking services. The default or failure of one or more of the financial institutions that we rely on may adversely affect our business and financial condition, including our ability to successfully consummate a Business Combination. We maintain the majority of our cash and cash equivalents in accounts with major U.S. and multi-national financial institutions, and our deposits at certain of these institutions exceed insured limits. Market conditions can impact the viability of these institutions. In the event of the failure of any of the financial institutions where we maintain our cash and cash equivalents, there can be no assurance that we would be able to access uninsured funds in a timely manner or at all. Any inability to access or delay in accessing these funds could adversely affect our liquidity, business and financial condition.

Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the IR Act was signed into law. The IR Act provides for, among other things, a new U.S. federal 1 excise tax on certain repurchases (including redemptions and economically similar transactions) of stock by publicly traded U.S. corporations on or after January 1, 2023. The excise tax is imposed on the repurchasing corporation itself, not its stockholders from which shares are repurchased (although it may reduce the amount of cash distributable in a current or subsequent redemption). The amount of the excise tax is generally 1 of the fair market value of the shares repurchased, determined at the time of the repurchase. Corporations are permitted to net the fair market value of certain new stock issuances by such corporation against the fair market value of stock repurchases (or deemed repurchases) during the same taxable year to reduce or eliminate the amount of excise tax that would otherwise apply. In addition, certain exceptions apply to the excise tax. The U.S. Department of the Treasury (the Treasury has authority to provide regulations and other guidance to carry out, and prevent the abuse or avoidance of, the excise tax. Whether and to what extent we would be subject to the excise tax will depend on a number of factors, including (i) whether the redemption is treated as a repurchase of stock for purposes of the excise tax, (ii) the fair market value of the redemptions treated as repurchases in connection with a Business Combination, (iii) the structure of a Business Combination and whether any such transaction closes, (iv) the nature and amount of any private investment in public equity PIPE or other equity issuances in connection with a Business Combination (or otherwise issued not in connection with a Business Combination but issued within the same taxable year of a Business Combination), (v) whether we consummate a Business Combination, and (vi) the content of regulations and other guidance issued by the Treasury. It is possible that the Company will be subject to the excise tax with respect to any subsequent redemptions, including redemptions in connection with a Business Combination, that are treated as repurchases for this purpose (other than, pursuant to recently issued guidance from the Treasury, redemptions in complete liquidation of the Company). As mentioned, the excise tax is imposed on the repurchasing corporation itself, not the stockholders from which stock is repurchased. The imposition of the excise tax (including as a result of holders of public shares electing to exercise their redemption rights in connection with a Business Combination) could, however, reduce the amount of cash available to the Company to pay redemptions (or the cash contribution to the target business in connection with a Business combination, which could hinder the Company s ability to complete a Business Combination or cause the other shareholders of the combined company to economically bear the impact of such excise tax). For the period ended September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company has recognized 2,150,457, respectively, in excise tax payable related to share redemptions. In accordance with ASC 340-10-S99-1, the liability does not impact the unaudited condensed statements of operations and is offset against accumulated deficit because additional paid-in capital is not available. During the second quarter of 2024, the IRS issued final regulations with respect to the timing and payment of the excise tax. Pursuant to those regulations, the Company would need to file a return and remit payment for any liability incurred during the period from January 1, 2023 to December 31, 2023 on or before October 31, 2024. In October 2024, the Company filed its excise tax return but did not make an excise tax payment. The Company is currently evaluating its options with respect to payment of this obligation. If the Company is unable to pay its obligation in full, it will be subject to additional interest and penalties which are currently estimated at 10 interest per annum and a 5 underpayment penalty per month or portion of a month up to 25 of the total liability for any amount that is unpaid from November 1, 2024 until paid in full. Results of Operations As of September 30, 2024, we had not commenced any operations. All activity for the period from March 9, 2021, (inception) through September 30, 2024, relates to our formation and the Public Offering, and, since the closing of the Public Offering, a search for a Business Combination and the completion of the proposed Business Combination. We have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenues to date. We will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of our initial Business Combination, at the earliest. We will generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on cash and cash equivalents from the proceeds derived from the Public Offering. We expect to incur increased expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as for due diligence expenses. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had net income of 2,770,817, which consisted of interest earned on cash held in Trust Account of 338,150, change in fair value of warrant liabilities of 2,784,000 and the Company s operating bank interest income of 406, partially offset by operating costs amounting to 265,513 and provision for income tax of 86,226. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had net loss of 2,266,696, which consisted of operating costs amounting to 2,675,905, change in fair value of warrant liabilities of 464,000 and provision for income tax of 497,303, partially offset by interest earned on cash held in Trust Account of 1,355,727 and the Company s operating bank interest income of 14,785. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, we had net income of 14,315, which consisted of, interest income earned on investments held in the Trust Account of 775,008 and the Company s operating bank interest income of 12,957, partially offset by operating costs amounting to 386,678, provision for income tax of 154,972 and 232,000 of a change in fair value of warrant liability. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we had net income of 444,533, which consisted of interest income earned on investments held in the Trust Account of 3,932,692 and the Company s operating bank interest income of 34,306, and 464,000 of a change in fair value of warrant liability, partially offset by operating costs amounting to 3,185,009 and provision for income tax of 801,456. Contractual Obligations We do not have any long-term debt obligations, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations, purchase obligations or long-term liabilities.

Administrative Services Agreement We have agreed to pay our Sponsor 10,000 per month for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative support services. Upon the earlier of the completion of the initial Business Combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying such monthly fees. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, 30,000 and 90,000 was incurred for the administrative service fee. Registration Rights The holders of the (i) founder shares, which were issued in a private placement prior to the closing of the Public Offering, (ii) Private Placement Warrants, which were issued in a private placement simultaneously with the closing of the Public Offering and the shares of Class A common stock underlying such Private Placement Warrants and (iii) Private Placement Warrants that may be issued upon conversion of Working Capital Loans will have registration rights to require the Company to register a sale of any of the Company s securities held by them pursuant to a registration rights agreement signed on the effective date of the Public Offering. The holders of these securities are entitled to make up to three demands, excluding short form demands, that the Company register such securities. In addition, the holders have certain piggy-back registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to the Company s completion of the initial Business Combination. The Company will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements. Underwriting Agreement The underwriters are entitled to a deferred underwriting discount of 3.5 or 8,050,000 of the gross proceeds of the Public Offering held in the Trust Account upon the completion of the Company s initial Business Combination subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement. Critical Accounting Estimates We prepare our unaudited condensed financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of unaudited condensed financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses and related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, the Company s management reviews the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our unaudited condensed financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP. Judgments are based on historical experience, terms of existing contracts, industry trends and information available from outside sources, as appropriate. However, by their nature, judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty, and, therefore, actual results could differ from our estimates. Actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management. We have identified the following critical accounting estimates: Warrant Liability and Working Capital Loan Conversion Option We classify each warrant and the Working Capital Loan Option as a liability at its fair value. These liabilities are subject to re-measurement at each balance sheet date. With each such re-measurement, the liabilities will be adjusted to fair value, with the change in fair value recognized in our statement of operations. The fair value of our Private Placement Warrants and Working Capital Loan Conversion Option requires significate estimates by management. Deviations from these estimates could result in a significate difference to our financial results. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information otherwise required under this item. Item 4. Controls and Procedures. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Disclosure controls and procedures are designed with the objective of ensuring that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this Report, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time period specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures are also designed with the objective of ensuring that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management evaluated, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer (our Certifying Officers ), the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b)under the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, our Certifying Officers concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. We do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all our control deficiencies and instances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 None. 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K
 filed with the SEC on April 1, 2024, as amended on Form 10-K/A
 filed with the SEC on May 20, 2024 and as supplemented by our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q
 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and June 30, 2024, filed with the SEC on May 20, 2024 and August 14, 2024, respectively. We may disclose changes to such factors or disclose additional factors from time to time in our future filings with the SEC. 
 NYSE delisted our securities from its exchange which could limit investors ability to make transactions in its securities and subject us to additional trading restrictions. 

 On April 12, 2024, we announced our intention to voluntarily delist from The New York Stock Exchange NYSE our Class A common stock, par value 0.0001 per share (the Class A Common Stock and units, each consisting of one share of Class A Common Stock and one-half
 of one redeemable warrant (collectively, the Securities ). On April 29, 2024, we received a notice from NYSE stating that NYSE had determined to delist our Securities from NYSE and that trading in our Securities on NYSE had been suspended, effective at the close of trading on April 29, 2024. NYSE reached its decision pursuant to Rule 802.01B of the NYSE Listed Company Manual because we did not meet NYSE s continued listing standard that requires listed acquisition companies to maintain an average aggregate global market capitalization attributable to its publicly held shares of at least 40 million over a period of 30 consecutive trading days. 
 We began trading our Class A common stock, par value 0.0001 per share on OTCQX 
 Best Market OTCQX under the symbol DSAQ . Our Units and redeemable warrants presently trade on the OTC Markets Pink Market OTC Pink and together with OTCQX, OTC under the symbols DSAQ.U and DSAQ.W, respectively. Since our securities trade on OTC, we could face significant material adverse consequences, including: 

the price of our securities will likely decrease as a result of the loss of market efficiencies associated with NYSE; 

a requirement to trade on OTC for a year before reapplying for listing on a national securities exchange; 

holders may be unable to sell or purchase our securities when they wish to do so; 

we may become subject to shareholder litigation; 

we may lose the interest of institutional investors in our securities; 

we may lose media and analyst coverage; and 

we may lose any active trading market for our securities, as our securities may then only be traded on one of the over-the-counter

 markets, if at all. 
 Additionally, if our securities are delisted from trading on OTC, our investors ability to make transactions in our securities could be limited and subject us to additional trading restrictions. 
 Because our securities were delisted from NYSE and are no longer listed on a national securities exchange, we may face significant material adverse consequences, including: (i) a limited availability of market quotations for our securities, (ii) reduced liquidity for our securities, (iii) a determination that our securities are penny stocks which will require brokers trading in our Public Shares to adhere to more stringent rules, including being subject to the depository requirements of Rule 419 of the Securities Act, and possibly result in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our securities, (iv) a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future, and (v) a less attractive acquisition vehicle to a target business in connection with an initial business 
combination. The National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996, which is a federal statute, prevents or preempts the states from regulating the sale of certain securities
, which are referred to as covered securities. Because our securities were delisted from NYSE and trade on OTC, our Class A Common Stock, Warrants and Units do not qualify as covered securities under the Securities Act and we are subject to regulation in each state in which we offer our securities. Public shareholders 
who do not elect to redeem their Public Shares in connection with the shareholder meeting to approve the Business Combination, may be unable to recover their investment except through sales of our shares on the open market or upon our liquidation or redemption of shares. The price of our common stock may be volatile, and there can be no assurance that stockholders will be able to dispose of our shares at favorable prices, or at all. 
 The SEC has recently issued final rules relating to certain activities of SPACs. Certain of the procedures we or others may determine to undertake in connection with such rules may increase our costs and the time needed to complete the Business Combination. 

 On January 24, 2024, the SEC issued final rules (the 2024 SPAC Rules ), which became effective on July 1, 2024, that formally adopted some of the SEC s proposed rules for SPACs that were released on March 30, 2022. The 2024 SPAC Rules, among other items, impose additional disclosure requirements in initial public offerings by SPACs and business combination transactions involving SPACs and private operating companies; amend the financial statement requirements applicable to business combination transactions involving such companies; update and expand guidance regarding the general use of projections in SEC filings, including requiring disclosure of all material bases of the projections and all material assumptions underlying the projections; increase the potential liability of certain participants in proposed business combination transactions; and could impact the extent to which SPACs could become subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act. The 2024 SPAC Rules may materially adversely affect our business, including our ability to negotiate and complete, and the costs associated with, our initial business combination, and results of operations.
