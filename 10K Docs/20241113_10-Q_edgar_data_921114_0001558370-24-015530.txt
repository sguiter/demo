 Armata Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) per share (the Common Stock is traded on the NYSE American exchange under the ticker symbol ARMP. million. The Company expects to continue to incur substantial losses, and its transition to profitability will depend on the successful development, approval and commercialization of product candidates and on the achievement of sufficient revenues to support its cost structure. The Company may never achieve profitability, and unless and until then, the Company will need to continue to raise additional capital. Existing cash and cash equivalents of million as of September 30, 2024 will not be sufficient to fund the Company s operations for the next 12 months from the date of these condensed consolidated financial statements. These circumstances raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company has prepared its condensed consolidated financial statements on a going concern basis, which assumes that the Company will realize its assets and satisfy its liabilities in the normal course of business. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result from the outcome of the uncertainty concerning the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Recent Financing: 2024 Credit Agreement On March 4, 2024, the Company entered into a credit and security agreement (the 2024 Credit Agreement for a loan in an aggregate amount of million (the 2024 Loan with Innoviva Strategic Opportunities LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Innoviva, Inc. (NASDAQ: INVA), our principal stockholder and a related party (collectively, Innoviva ). The 2024 Loan bears interest at an annual rate of and matures on June 4, 2025. Principal and accrued interest are payable at maturity. Repayment of the 2024 Loan is guaranteed by the Company s domestic subsidiaries, and the loan is secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company and the subsidiary guarantors. Concurrently with the execution of the 2024 Credit Agreement, the Company amended certain provisions of its existing convertible loan (the Convertible Loan (see Note 7) and secured credit and security agreement, dated January 10, 2023, with Innoviva (the Convertible Credit Agreement and its existing secured term loan facility (the 2023 Loan and credit and security agreement, dated July 10, 2023, with Innoviva (the 2023 Credit Agreement to, among other things, conform certain terms relating to permitted indebtedness and permitted liens (see Note 8). The Company plans to raise additional capital through equity offerings, debt financings, or other capital sources, including potential collaborations, licenses and other similar arrangements. While the Company believes this plan to raise additional funds will alleviate the conditions that raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern, these plans are not entirely within its control and cannot be assessed as being probable of occurring. The Company s ability to raise additional capital may be adversely impacted by potential worsening global economic conditions and the recent disruptions to, and volatility in, financial markets in the United States and worldwide. The Company may not be able to secure additional financing in a timely manner or on favorable terms, if at all. Furthermore,

The Company evaluated authoritative guidance for accounting for the Convertible Loan and concluded that the Convertible Loan should be accounted for at fair value under ASC 480, Distinguish Liabilities from Equity, due to the fact that the Convertible Loan will predominately be settled with the Company s Common Stock. Consequently, the Company recorded the Convertible Loan in its entirety at fair value on its condensed consolidated balance sheet, with changes in fair value recorded as other income (expenses) in the condensed consolidated statements of operations during each reporting period.

 Legal Proceedings From time to time, the Company may be involved in disputes, including litigation, relating to claims arising out of operations in the normal course of business. Any of these claims could subject the Company to costly legal expenses and, while management generally believes that there is adequate insurance to cover many different types of liabilities, the Company s insurance carriers may deny coverage or policy limits may be inadequate to fully satisfy any damage awards or settlements. If this were to happen, the payment of any such awards could have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated results of operations and financial position. Additionally, any such claims, whether or not successful, could damage the Company s reputation and business. The Company is currently not a party to any legal proceedings, the adverse outcome of which, in management s opinion, individually or in the aggregate, would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. million grant and entered into a program administered by the U.S. Department of Defense through MTEC managed by the Naval Medical Research Command (NMRC) Naval Advanced Medical Development (NAMD) with funding from the Defense Health Agency and Joint Warfighter Medical Research Program. On September 29, 2022, the MTEC Agreement was modified to increase the total award by million to million and extend the term into the third quarter of 2024. In July 2024, the MTEC Agreement was modified to increase the total award by million to a total of million and extend the term into the third quarter of 2025. The MTEC funds are to partially fund a Phase 1b/2a, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose escalation clinical study of the Company s therapeutic phage-based candidate, AP-SA02, for the treatment of complicated Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia infections. The MTEC Agreement specifies that the grant will be paid to the Company over the term of the award through a cost reimbursable model, based on agreed upon cost share percentages, and the grant money received is not refundable to MTEC. Upon license or commercialization of intellectual property developed with the funding from the MTEC Agreement, additional fees will be due to MTEC. The Company will elect whether to (a) pay a fixed royalty amount, which is subject to a cap based upon total funding received, or (b) pay an additional assessment fee, which would also be subject to a cap based upon a percentage of total funding received. The MTEC Agreement is effective through August 15, 2025. The MTEC Agreement may be terminated in whole or in part 30 calendar days following written notice from the Company to MTEC. In addition, MTEC has the right to terminate the MTEC Agreement upon material breach by the Company. The Company determined that the MTEC Agreement is not in the scope of ASC 808 or ASC 606. Applying ASC 606 by analogy, the Company recognizes proceeds received under the MTEC Agreement as grant revenue in the statement of operations when related costs are incurred. The Company recognized and million in grant revenue from the MTEC Agreement during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. As of March 31, 2024, the Company recognized the entire million award as grant revenue.

Overview We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on the development of high purity, pathogen-specific bacteriophage therapeutics for the treatment of chronic pulmonary diseases exacerbated by concurrent bacterial infection with antibiotic-resistant and difficult-to-treat bacteria using our proprietary bacteriophage-based technology. We see bacteriophages as a potentially safer and effective alternative to antibiotics and an essential response to the growing bacterial resistance to current classes of antibiotics. Bacteriophages or phages have a powerful and highly differentiated mechanism of action that enables binding to and killing of specific targeted bacteria while uniquely preserving the normal human microbiome or healthy bacteria . This is in direct contrast to traditional broad-spectrum antibiotics which can alter the human microbiome increasing susceptibility to opportunistic pathogens, such as C. difficile . We believe that phages represent a promising means to effectively treat bacterial infections as an alternative to broad-spectrum antibiotics, especially for patients with bacterial infections resistant to current standard of care therapies, including the multidrug-resistant or superbug strains of bacteria. We are a leading developer of clinical-stage phage therapeutics of high purity, and believe we are uniquely positioned to address the growing worldwide threat of antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections. We have completed three critical Phase 2 trials, two of which were completed this year, utilizing two distinct phage cocktails against two different pathogens with the potential to treat chronic pulmonary disease complicated by bacterial infection, as well as acute systemic bacterial infections. We believe we are on a critical pathway towards pivotal Phase 3 clinical studies. We are combining our proprietary approach and expertise in identifying, characterizing and developing both naturally occurring and engineered (synthetic) bacteriophages with our proprietary phage-specific host-engineered

 cGMP manufacturing capabilities to advance a target pipeline of high-quality bacteriophage product candidates for late-stage clinical development. We have improved our manufacturing processes by significantly increasing phage titers and improving production efficiency with the goal of ensuring commercial viability. We believe that we are uniquely advancing two lead candidates to address both chronic and acute bacterial infections. Our first lead phage candidate, inhaled AP-PA02, is focused primarily on the treatment of chronic pulmonary infections with P. aeruginosa . On October 14, 2020, we received the approval to proceed from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the FDA for our Investigational New Drug IND application for AP-PA02. In the first quarter of 2023, we announced positive topline results from the completed SWARM- P.a. study a Phase 1b/2a, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose and multiple ascending dose clinical trial to evaluate the safety and tolerability of inhaled AP-PA02 in subjects with cystic fibrosis and chronic pulmonary P. aeruginosa infection. Data indicate that AP-PA02 was well-tolerated with a treatment emergent adverse event profile similar to placebo. Pharmacokinetics findings confirm that AP-PA02 can be effectively delivered to the lungs through nebulization with minimal systemic exposure, with single ascending doses and multiple ascending doses resulting in a proportional increase in exposure as measured in induced sputum. AP-PA02 exposures were generally consistent across subjects. Additionally, bacterial levels of P. aeruginosa in the sputum measured at several timepoints suggest improvement in bacterial load reduction for subjects treated with AP-PA02 at the end of treatment as compared to placebo after ten days of dosing. In addition, a correlation was seen between increasing phage dose (higher AP-PA02 exposures) and reduction in the bacterial load, supporting the biologic plausibility of a bacterial specific mechanism of action and creating the opportunity for phage as a therapeutic alternative to inhaled antibiotics. This study was supported by the CFF, which granted us a Therapeutics Development Award of 5.0 million. As of September 30, 2024, we received the full award s amount, including the final payment of 0.3 million in January 2024. Following the promising Phase 1b/2a results of favorable safety and tolerability profile and plausible mechanism of action, an additional confirmatory Phase 2 trial was initiated in non-cystic fibrosis Bronchiectasis NCFB patients with similar chronic pulmonary disease with infections due to P. aeruginosa . On February 22, 2022, we announced FDA approval to proceed with our IND application for inhaled AP-PA02, in a second indication, NCFB. We initiated a Phase 2 trial Tail wind in NCFB in 2022 and reported first patient dosing in the first quarter of 2023. The Tail wind study is a Phase 2, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety, phage kinetics, and efficacy of inhaled AP-PA02 phage therapeutic in subjects with NCFB and chronic pulmonary P. aeruginosa infection. The trial design included two cohorts in order to analyze AP-PA02 as monotherapy as well as AP-PA02 in combination with inhaled antibiotics. One cohort enrolled subjects not on chronic inhaled antibiotics, randomized to receive either inhaled AP-PA02 or placebo. The other cohort enrolled subjects on chronic inhaled antibiotics, randomized to receive either inhaled AP-PA02 plus their chronic inhaled antibiotic or placebo plus their chronic inhaled antibiotic. The aim of the study is to define a safe dose and dosing duration with promising biologic correlation in anticipation for a definitive Phase 3 trial in 2025. On July 11, 2024, we announced completion of enrollment of the Phase 2 Tail wind Study. The last patient final follow-up visit took place on August 7, 2024. We anticipate topline data from the Tail wind study by the end of 2024, followed by potential initiation of a pivotal bronchiectasis trial in 2025 in which we plan to evaluate inhaled AP-PA02 as an alternative to inhaled antibiotics in chronic pulmonary P. aeruginosa infections in subjects with NCFB. As there are no FDA approved anti-infective treatments for NCFB, a definitive pivotal placebo-controlled trial is plausible, providing a pathway to commercialization for chronic pulmonary diseases with concurrent chronic bacterial infection, pending positive clinical trial results. In parallel, we have an acute bacterial infection clinical development plan focused on Staphylococcus aureus S. aureus bacteremia, a difficult-to-treat and often life-threatening human infection that can result in high morbidity and mortality and for which bacterial resistance to antibiotics is growing. A key advantage of our phage manufacturing expertise is the purity profiles of our phage products, including AP-SA02, our phage product candidate for S. aureus ; this has enabled us to pursue treatment of complicated S. aureus bacteremia, where repetitive intravenous dosing is required. On June 15, 2020, we entered into an agreement (the MTEC Agreement with the Medical Technology Enterprise Consortium MTEC ), pursuant to which we received a 15.0 million grant and entered into a multi-year program administered by the U.S Department of Defense through MTEC and managed by the Naval Medical Research Command (NMRC) Naval Advanced Medical Development (NAMD) with funding from the Defense Health Agency and Joint Warfighter Medical Research Program. On September

 29, 2022, the MTEC Agreement was modified to increase the total award by 1.3 million to 16.3 million and extend the term into the second half of 2024. In July 2024, the MTEC Agreement was modified to increase the total award by 5.3 million to 21.6 million and extend the term into the third quarter of 2025. The grant is being used to partially fund a Phase 1b/2a, multi center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled dose escalation study that will assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of our phage-based candidate, AP-SA02, for the treatment of adults with S. aureus diSArm study) . On November 17, 2021, we announced that we had received approval from the FDA to proceed with our IND application for AP-SA02. Since dosing the first patient in the Phase 2a portion of the study on September 26, 2023, we have focused on accelerating enrollment of the diSArm study, evaluating safety with higher intravenous doses, which is possible due to the high purity of our phage product candidates. The high purity of our phages has allowed us to dose escalate to 5E10 PFU every six hours (2E11 PFU every 24 hours) for five days without clinically significant adverse events. In parallel with dose escalation, the evolution of two distinct blinded subsets of subjects receiving phage has been observed. One subset, comprising approximately half of the treated group, has evidence of persistence of detectable phage in the blood providing early evidence of in vivo phage amplification and resultant release of phage progeny. On November 12, 2024, we announced the completion of enrollment of the Phase 1b/2a diSArm study. We anticipate topline data from the diSArm study in the first quarter of 2025 where we can explore the two aforementioned subsets in an unblinded manner. We are committed to developing a pivotal S. aureus bacteremia trial in 2025 to evaluate the intravenous phage product candidate, AP-SA02, as an adjunct to standard of care broad-spectrum antibiotics and/or potentially as an alternative to broad-spectrum antibiotics, which would decrease the utilization of broad-spectrum antibiotics and their detrimental impact on the healthy human microbiome. On August 1, 2022, we announced FDA approval to proceed with our IND application for AP-SA02 in a second indication, prosthetic joint infections PJI with S. aureus . We had planned to initiate a Phase 1b/2a trial in 2023; however, in light of the growing concerns of both PJI and wound infection, we are planning to revise the protocol to include both indications. Driven by data from the bacteremia study, and with sufficient funding, we may in the future initiate a Phase 1b/2a trial to assess the safety and tolerability of intravenous and intra-articular AP-SA02 as an adjunct to standard of care antibiotics in adults undergoing treatment of periprosthetic joint infections and/or wound infections caused by S. aureus . We remain committed to conducting randomized controlled clinical trials required for FDA approval in order to move towards the commercialization of our phage products as alternatives and/or reinforcements to traditional antibiotics, providing a potential safe and effective method of treating patients suffering from drug-resistant and difficult-to-treat bacterial infections. The following chart summarizes the status of our phage product candidate development programs and partners. We have incurred net losses since our inception and our operations to date have been primarily limited to research and development and raising capital. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 330.3 million. We currently expect to use our existing cash and cash equivalents for the focused research and development of our current product candidates and for working capital and other general corporate purposes. We anticipate that a substantial portion of our capital resources and efforts in the foreseeable future will be focused on completing the development of and

 seeking to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates. We do not expect to generate product revenue unless and until we successfully complete development and obtain marketing approval for at least one of our product candidates. We may also use a portion of our existing cash and cash equivalents for the potential acquisition of, or investment in, product candidates, technologies, formulations or companies that complement our business, although we have no current understandings, commitments or agreements to do so. Our existing cash and cash equivalents of 17.1 million as of September 30, 2024 will not be sufficient to enable us to complete all necessary development of any potential product candidates. Accordingly, we will be required to obtain further funding through one or more other public or private equity offerings, debt financings, collaboration, strategic financing, grants or government contract awards, licensing arrangements or other sources. Our ability to raise additional capital may be adversely impacted by potential worsening global economic conditions and potential disruptions to, and volatility in, financial markets in the United States and worldwide. Adequate additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on acceptable terms, we may be required to defer, reduce or eliminate significant planned expenditures, restructure, curtail or eliminate some or all of our development programs or other operations, dispose of assets, enter into arrangements that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our product candidates, technologies or potential markets, file for bankruptcy or cease operations altogether. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and result in a loss of investment by our stockholders. Recent Events MTEC Agreement Modification In July 2024, we amended the MTEC Agreement and increased the amount of the award by 5.3 million to a total of 21.6 million. We will recognize an increase in grant revenue from the third quarter of 2024 until the full amount of the amended award is utilized. Debt On November 12, 2024, we amended the Convertible Credit Agreement and the 2023 Credit Agreement, among other things, to extend the maturity dates of the Convertible debt and 2023 Loan from January 10, 2025 to January 10, 2026.

Research and development expenses totaled 25.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, remaining virtually unchanged compared with the same period in 2023 despite an increase in research and development activities due to increasing efficiencies. Clinical trial costs increased by 0.7 million, from 2.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 3.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase is primarily attributable to a 1.0 million increase in AP-PA02 NCFB trial costs and an additional 0.2 million increase in Bacteremia trial costs due to the increase in the number of enrolled patients, patient visits, and active sites increase in both trials since the second half of 2023. Also, the increase is due in part to achieving clinical contract research organization CRO milestones ahead of schedule, resulting increase in associated CRO expenses. The increase was partially offset by a decrease of 0.3 million in AP-PA02 CF study costs, as most activities under the trials were completed in 2023. Clinical trial costs increased by 0.5 million, from 7.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 7.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase is primarily due to an increase of 2.5 million in the AP-PA02 NCFB trial costs, offset by a decrease of 1.2 million in AP-PA02 CF trial costs, 0.4 million in Bacteremia trial costs and 0.2 million in AP-SA02 PJI trial costs. The AP-PA02 CF trial is substantially completed and study reconciliation is in process. The PJI trial is currently on hold, and we may in the future initiate a Phase 1b/2a trial to assess the safety and tolerability of combined intravenous and intra-articular AP-SA02. Bacteremia trial costs decreased due to a credit of 0.8 million received from a clinical research organization, offset by an increase of 0.4

 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The AP-PA02 NCFB trial costs increased as the number of enrolled patients, patient visits, and active sites increased from the second half of 2023 through July 2024, when we completed patients enrollment for NCFB study. Other external research and development costs decreased by 0.1 million from 1.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 1.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease of 0.1 million in consulting expenses. Other external research and development costs decreased by 0.8 million from 3.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 2.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease of 0.5 million in consulting expenses and 0.3 million decrease in outsourced service costs.

This increase was mainly driven by a 0.3 million increase in stock-based compensation expense, which was primarily due to options granted in March 2024, 2024 a mid-year bonus payments of 0.2 million, and an increase of 0.3 million in other personnel-related costs, offset by a 0.1 million decrease in severance costs. Personnel-related costs, including employee payroll and related expenses, increased by 0.1 million, from 8.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 8.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. This increase was mainly driven by 2024 mid-year bonus payments of 0.2 million, severance payments of 0.2 million, and an increase of 0.2 million in other personnel-related costs offset by 0.3 million lower stock-based compensation expense (as there were no expenses related to the equity awards that fully vested after September 30, 2023) and 0.2 million payroll related costs reduction. Facilities and overheads costs increased by 0.2 million, from 2.2 million for the three months ended September 30,2023 to 2.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 mainly due to an increase in facilities maintenance costs.

 Facilities and overheads costs increased by 0.1 million, from 7.2 million for the nine months ended September 30,2023 to 7.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 mainly due to an increase in facilities maintenance costs. General and Administrative General and administrative expenses were 3.2 million and 3.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease of 0.4 million is primarily related to a decrease of 1.0 million in professional services during the third quarter of 2024 as we continue to achieve efficiencies with in-house hires, offset by a 0.6 million increase in personnel expenses, including stock-based compensation. General and administrative expenses were 9.9 million and 8.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase of 1.4 million is primarily related to an increase of 2.0 million in stock-based compensation expenses due to stock-based awards granted during the first quarter of 2024, increase in lease expenses of 0.3 million and an increase of 0.3 million in other facilities and overhead expenses, offset by a decrease of 1.1 million in professional and legal, accounting and other consulting expenses, and a decrease of 0.2 million in payroll and related costs. Interest Income Interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 0.3 million and less than 0.1 million, respectively, and related to interest income on our money market fund investments. Interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 0.6 million and 0.1 million, respectively, and related to interest income on our money market fund investments. Interest Expense We recognized interest expense of 2.9 million and 1.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, related to the interest expenses and the amortization of debt discount and issuance costs for the 2023 Loan and 2024 Loan received from Innoviva in July 2023 and March 2024, respectively. Stated interest is accrued and is payable at the maturity of the 2023 Loan and the 2024 Loan in 2025. We recognized interest expense of 7.5 million and 1.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, related to the interest expenses and the amortization of debt discount and issuance costs for the 2023 Loan and 2024 Loan received from Innoviva in July 2023 and March 2024, respectively. Stated interest is accrued and is payable at the maturity of the 2023 Loan and the 2024 Loan in 2025. Change in Fair Value of Convertible Debt We recognized a gain on change in the fair value of the Convertible Loan for the three months ended September 30, 2024 of 6.9 million. The gain of 6.9 million is primarily attributable to the decrease in our Common Stock price in the three months ended September 30, 2024. We recognized a loss of 15.8 million for three months ended September 30, 2023, which is primarily due to the increase in our Common Stock price in the three months ended September 30, 2023. We recognized a gain on change in the fair value of the Convertible Loan for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 17.3 million and a loss of 13.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Such fluctuations in fair values are primarily attributable to the changes in our estimated probabilities of various settlement scenarios, changes in our Common Stock price, remaining loan term and changes in volatilities. The Convertible Loan received from Innoviva in January 2023 and amended in July 2023 is accounted for at fair value using a weighted probability of various settlement scenarios of the Convertible Loan during its term discounted to each reporting date. Conversion option scenarios are valued using an option pricing model with significant assumptions and estimates such as volatility, expected term and risk-free interest rates.

 Loss on Convertible Debt Extinguishment We recognized a loss on convertible debt extinguishment for both three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 of 3.9 million which relates to the amendment to the Convertible Loan on July 10, 2023. The amendment was accounted for as an extinguishment in the third quarter of 2023. Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Condition We have incurred net losses since our inception and have negative operating cash flows. Our cash and cash equivalents of 17.1 million as of September 30, 2024 will not be sufficient to fund our operations for the next 12 months from the date of issuance of our condensed consolidated financial statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We plan to control our expenses and to raise additional capital through a combination of public and private equity, debt financings, strategic alliances, and grant arrangements. These circumstances raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. While management believes this plan to raise additional funds will alleviate the conditions that raise substantial doubt, these plans are not entirely within its control and cannot be assessed as being probable of occurring. We may not be able to secure additional financing in a timely manner or on favorable terms, if at all . During the year ended December 31, 2023, we received the Convertible Loan in the aggregate amount of 30.0 million and the 2023 Loan in the aggregate amount of 25.0 million from Innoviva. The Convertible Loan and the 2023 Loan mature in January 2025, and principal and accrued interest are payable at maturity. The Convertible Loan provides for various conversion and repayment options, including the conversion of principal and accrued interest into shares of our Common Stock upon a Qualified Financing and the Company s option to repay the Convertible Loan prior to maturity. On March 4, 2024, we entered into the 2024 Credit Agreement for the 2024 Loan in an aggregate amount of 35.0 million with Innoviva. Concurrently with the execution of the 2024 Loan, we amended certain provisions of the Convertible Credit Agreement and the 2023 Credit Agreement to, among other things, conform certain terms relating to permitted indebtedness and permitted liens. The 2024 Loan bears interest at an annual rate of 14 and matures in June 2025. Principal and accrued interest are payable at maturity. In July 2024, we amended the MTEC Agreement and increased the amount of the award by 5.3 million to a total of 21.6 million. We will recognize grant revenue from the third quarter of 2024 until the full amount of the amended award is utilized. On November 12, 2024, we amended the Convertible Credit Agreement and the 2023 Credit Agreement, among other things, to extend the maturity dates of the Convertible debt and 2023 Loan from January 10, 2025 to January 10, 2026. Future Capital Requirements We will need to raise additional capital in the future to continue to fund our operations. Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including: the costs and timing of our research and development activities ; the progress and cost of our clinical trials and other research and development activities ; manufacturing costs associated with our targeted phage therapies strategy and other research and development activities; the costs and timing of seeking regulatory approvals ; 

 32 

Table of Contents 
 the costs of filing, prosecuting and enforcing any patent applications, claims, patents and other intellectual property rights; and the costs of potential lawsuits involving us or our product candidates . We may seek to raise capital through a variety of sources, including: the public equity market; private equity financings; collaborative arrangements; government grants; or strategic financing. 
 Any additional fundraising efforts may divert our management team from their day-to-day activities, which may adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates. Our ability to raise additional funds will depend, in part, on the success of our product development activities, including our targeted phage therapies strategy and any clinical trials we initiate, regulatory events, our ability to identify and enter into in-licensing or other strategic arrangements, and other events or conditions that may affect our value or prospects, as well as factors related to financial, economic and market conditions, many of which are beyond our control. We cannot be certain that sufficient funds will be available to us when required or on acceptable terms. If we are unable to secure additional funds on a timely basis or on acceptable terms, we may be required to defer, reduce or eliminate significant planned expenditures, restructure, curtail or eliminate some or all of our development programs or other operations, dispose of technology or assets, pursue an acquisition of our company by a third party at a price that may result in a loss on investment for our stockholders, enter into arrangements that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our product candidates, technologies or potential markets, file for bankruptcy or cease operations altogether. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, increase the risk of insolvency and loss of investment by our stockholders. To the extent that additional capital is raised through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the issuance of such securities could result in dilution to our existing stockholders. Our ability to raise additional capital may be adversely impacted by potential worsening global economic conditions and the recent disruptions to, and volatility in, financial markets in the United States and worldwide. Cash Flows The following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash for the periods presented (in thousands): 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net cash used in operating activities (29,624) (39,317) Net cash used in investing activities (1,956) (5,744) Net cash provided by financing activities 34,958 54,031 Net increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash 3,378 8,970 Cash Flows Used in Operating Activities Net cash used in operating activities was 29.6 million and 39.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Table of Contents 
 Cash used in operating activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to our net loss for the period of 21.5 million, adjusted by non-cash items of 4.8 million and a decrease of 3.3 million in our net operating assets and liabilities.

The decrease in our net operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to a decrease of 4.2 million in operating lease liability related to lease payments and payments for the construction of office and laboratory and manufacturing space at our new leased facility in Los Angeles, CA, a decrease of 2.0 million in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, an increase of 0.8 million in accrued compensation, and a decrease of 2.1 million in prepaid expenses and other current assets.

Cash Flows Used in I nvesting Activities Net cash used in investing activities was 2.0 million and 5.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which is attributable to purchases of laboratory and manufacturing equipment in connection with the construction of a new office, laboratory and manufacturing space at our leased facility in Los Angeles, CA. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 34.9 million, which consisted primarily of proceeds from issuance of term debt, net of issuance costs of less than 0.1 million, and proceeds from exercise of stock options of 0.1 million. Cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 54.0 million, which consisted primarily of proceeds from issuance of convertible debt, net of issuance costs of 29.1 million, proceeds from issuance of term debt, net of issuance costs of 24.9 million, and proceeds from exercise of stock options of less than 0.1 million, partially offset by less than 0.1 million of the payments for taxes related to net share settlement of equity awards. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of September 30, 2024, we did not have off-balance sheet arrangements. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate estimates and assumptions, including but not limited to those related to convertible debt, stock-based compensation expense, accruals for research and development costs, lease assets and liabilities, the valuation of deferred tax assets, valuation of uncertain income tax positions, impairment of goodwill and intangible assets and impairment of

 long-lived assets. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Refer to Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements and critical accounting policies and estimated included in our Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 21, 2024. There were no material changes to our critical accounting policies from December 31, 2023. Item 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and are not required to provide the information required under this item. Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Disclosure Controls and Procedures Under the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer CEO and Senior Vice President, Finance and Principal Financial Officer PFO ), we evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act (the Exchange Act as of September 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, our CEO and PFO have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024 to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and PFO, as appropriate to allow timely discussion regarding required disclosures. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined by Rules 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. PART II. OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS From time to time, we are a party to certain litigation that is either judged to be not material or that arises in the ordinary course of business. We intend to vigorously defend our interests in these matters. We expect that the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. However, due to the uncertainties inherent in litigation, no assurance can be given as to the outcome of these proceedings. Item 1A. RISK FACTORS Our business is subject to a number of risks, including those identified in Item 1A of Part I of our 2023 Form 10-K. There have been no material changes to the risk factors described in our 2023 Form 10-K.
