 warrants immediately exercisable and composed of public warrants and private warrants. Following the Closing,
on June 21, 2024, the Company s Common Stock and Warrants began trading on the Nasdaq under the symbols WENA and WENAW, 
respectively. The Public Units of Redwoods automatically separated into the component securities upon consummation of the Business Combination
and, as a result, no longer trade as a separate security. Further, upon closing of the Business Combination on June 21, 2024, the Company
received approximately in net cash proceeds. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company determined there was
an additional approximate cash. 

At Closing,
pursuant to the terms of the Business Combination Agreement and after giving effect to the redemptions of shares of Redwoods Common Stock: 

The total consideration paid at Closing (the Merger
Consideration by Redwoods to ANEW Medical, Inc. security holders was shares of the Company common stock valued at 
million (the Consideration Shares ), based on an implied ANEW equity value of valued at per share; 

Each share of ANEW Medical Common Stock, if any, that was
owned by Redwoods, Merger Sub, ANEW Medical, Inc. or any other affiliate of Redwoods immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger
(the Effective Time was automatically cancelled and retired without any conversion or consideration; 

Each share of Merger Sub common stock, par value 
per share Merger Sub Common Stock ), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time was converted into
 newly issued share of Common Stock of the Surviving Corporation. 

In connection with the Merger,
the Company entered into a convertible promissory note and Securities Purchase Agreement SPA with certain accredited investors
(the Redwoods PIPE Investors for an aggregate of shares (bonus free trading shares and restricted
shares issued at closing), with each unit consisting of one share of Company common stock (the PIPE Shares for an aggregate purchase price of (the Redwoods PIPE Financing ). Upon the closing of the
Redwoods PIPE Financing (which closed in connection with the closing of the Merger), the were used by the Company

the Redwoods PIPE Financing funds. 

In connection with the Merger,
the Company entered convertible promissory note and Securities Purchase Agreement SPA with certain accredited investors
(the ANEW PIPE Investors for an aggregate of units (bonus free trading shares and restricted shares
issued at closing), with each unit consisting of share of Company common stock (the PIPE Shares for an aggregate purchase price of (the ANEW PIPE Financing ). Upon the closing of the
ANEW PIPE Financing (which closed in connection with the closing of the Merger), was used by the Company to
settle transaction costs. The Company received approximately in cash proceeds and recorded a receivable of from the ANEW
PIPE Financing funds. 

Concurrent with Closing,
certain ANEW stockholders may be entitled to up to an additional shares of Company Common Stock (the Contingent Consideration
Shares ), upon the following conditions being met: 

In
accordance with guidance applicable to these circumstances, the equity structure has been restated in all comparable periods up to June
21, 2024 and reflected as such as of September 30, 2024, to reflect the number of shares of the Company s common stock, par
value per share, issued to ANEW s stockholders in connection with the merger. As such, the shares and corresponding capital amounts
and earnings per share related to ANEW s common stock prior to the merger have been retroactively restated as shares reflecting
the exchange ratio established in the merger. 

For accounting purposes, the Merger was treated as the equivalent of the
Company issuing shares for the net assets of Redwoods, accompanied by a recapitalization. The net assets of Redwoods
were stated at historical cost with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded. In connection with the Merger, in addition to
the warrants, ANEW Medical assumed in cash and in income tax payable. The income tax payable of was
settled in full as of September 30, 2024 from the assumed cash.

and an
accumulated deficit of approximately million. The Company has incurred recurring losses, has experienced recurring negative
operating cash flows, and requires significant cash resources to execute its business plans. The Company is dependent on obtaining additional
working capital funding from the sale of equity and/or debt securities in order to continue to execute its development plans and continue
operations. Without additional funding, there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for
twelve months from the date of these financial statements. 

. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has not experienced
losses on this account and management believes the Company is not exposed to significant risks on such account.

Overview 

Klotho
Neurosciences, Inc. The Company or Klotho develops essential medicines for the treatment of chronic diseases
 cancer, cardiovascular, and neurodegenerative disorders. The Company currently has acquired two licensed platforms: a generic
drug portfolio and a biosimilar biologics platform that uses biologic therapies to treat cancer, and two proprietary, patented technologies
involving the melanocortin receptor-binding molecules and a gene therapy platform which uses a gene therapy approach to introduce a therapeutic
protein called Klotho inside the body to treat neurodegenerative diseases. 

Effective
September 17, 2024, the Company changed its legal name from ANEW Medical, Inc. to Klotho Neurosciences, Inc. This name change was approved
by the Company s Board of Directors to better reflect the strategic focus of its proprietary products. Throughout these financial
statements, references to the Company refer to Klotho Neurosciences, Inc., formerly known as ANEW or ANEW Public. Under
certain circumstances, references to ANEW and ANEW Public have remained when useful in describing the sequence of events that occurred
during the merger between Redwoods and ANEW. 

As of May 30, 2023, Redwoods Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation
and a special purpose acquisition company Redwoods ), Anew Medical Sub, Inc., a Wyoming corporation Merger Sub and ANEW Medical, Inc., a Wyoming corporation ANEW entered into a Business Combination Agreement, which was amended as
of November 4, 2023 (the Business Combination Agreement ). On June 21, 2024 (the Closing Date ), Merger Sub
merged with and into ANEW, with ANEW continuing as the surviving corporation and as a wholly owned subsidiary of Redwoods (the Business
Combination ). In connection with the Business Combination, on June 21, 2024, Redwoods filed a Second Amended Certificate of Incorporation
with the Delaware Secretary of State, and adopted the amended and restated bylaws (the Amended and Restated Bylaws ), which
replaced Redwoods Charter and Bylaws in effect as of such time. In connection with the closing of the Business Combination (the
 Closing ), Redwoods changed its name to ANEW Medical, Inc.

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

See
Item 1, Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. 

Results
of Operations 

For
accounting purposes, the transactions contemplated by the Business Combination are treated as a reverse acquisition and, as such, the
historical financial statements of the accounting acquirer Klotho will become the historical financial statements of Public ANEW. Under
this method of accounting, Redwoods was treated as the acquired company for financial reporting purposes. Accordingly, for
accounting purposes, the Merger was treated as the equivalent of the Company issuing shares for the net assets of Redwoods,
accompanied by a recapitalization. The net assets of Redwoods were stated at historical cost with no goodwill or other intangible
assets recorded. 

We
have not generated any operating revenues to date. To date, the Company s operations have consisted of acquiring our licensed platforms
and patents, and planning for the Business Combination. We incur expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial
reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as our expenses associated with planning our research and clinical testing operations. 

Results
of Operations for the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 

Revenues 

The
Company had no revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023. 

Operating
Expenses 

Operating
expenses are composed of consultant fees and professional fees. 

Our operating expenses for the three months ended
September 30, 2024 were 2,870,932 compared to 123,737 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 2,747,195. The
increase was primarily due to increased share-based compensation expense. 

Our operating expenses for the nine months ended
September 30, 2024 were 3,688,584 compared to 520,589 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 3,167,995. The
increase was primarily due to increased share-based compensation expense as well as expenses associated with our business combination
including increases in third party consulting fees and professional fees. 

Net
Loss 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred a net loss
of 2,959,426 compared to a net loss of 144,111 for the three month period ended September 30, 2023. The increase in net loss was primarily
due to increased share-based compensation expense.

of 4,083,109 compared to a net loss of 580,983 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 3,502,126. The increase

Operating
Activities 

Net cash used in operating activities for the
nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 2,002,358, compared to 247,406, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of
approximately 1,755,000. The significant increase in cash used in operating activities is primarily attributable to increases in expenses
related to the business combination and continued operating costs. We expect net cash used in operating activities to increase in the
coming periods, until our products are able to produce meaningful revenue. 

Investing Activities 

Net cash used in investing activities for the
nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 123,497, compared to 76,325 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of approximately
 47,000. The increase in cash used in investing activities is primarily attributable to licensing payments made in the period. 

Financing Activities 

Net cash provided by financing activities for
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 2,173,942, which consisted of investments, proceeds from the business combination, as well
as proceeds from related parties. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash provided by financing activities was 250,000,
from repayment of an advance to a shareholder. 

Liquidity, Capital Resources and Going Concern 

As of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash of 50,895 and net working
capital of 827,783). 

The
Company has incurred and expects to continue to incur significant professional costs to remain as a publicly traded company and incurred
significant transaction costs related to the consummation of the Business Combination. 

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared as if the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company has
incurred significant operating losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception. As of September 30, 2024, the Company
had cash of approximately 51,000 and an accumulated deficit of approximately 8.5 million. The Company has incurred recurring
losses, has experienced recurring negative operating cash flows, and requires significant cash resources to execute its business plans.
The Company is dependent on obtaining additional working capital funding from the sale of equity and/or debt securities in order to continue
to execute its development plans and continue operations. Without additional funding, there is substantial doubt about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern for twelve months from the date of these financial statements. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We
have no obligations, assets or liabilities, which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2024. We do
not participate in transactions that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as
variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. We have
not entered into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments
of other entities, or purchased any non-financial assets. 

19 

Emerging
Growth Company Status 

We are an emerging growth company ,
as defined in the JOBS Act, and, for as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we may choose to take advantage of exemptions
from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies but not to emerging growth companies, including, but not limited
to, not being required to have our independent registered public accounting firm audit our internal control over financial reporting under
Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy
statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval
of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. As an emerging growth company, we can also delay adopting new or revised accounting
standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We intend to avail ourselves of these options. Once adopted,
we must continue to report on that basis until we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company. 

We
will cease to be an emerging growth company upon the earliest of: (i) the end of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our
initial public offering; (ii) the first fiscal year after our annual gross revenue are 1.07 billion or more; (iii) the date on which
we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than 1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities; or (iv) the end of
any fiscal year in which the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeded 700 million as of the end of the second
quarter of that fiscal year. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive if we choose to rely on these
exemptions. If, as a result of our decision to reduce future disclosure, investors find our common stock less attractive, there may be
a less active trading market for our common stock and the price of our common stock may be more volatile. 

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

As
a smaller reporting company, we are not required to make disclosures under this Item. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our management has evaluated the effectiveness
of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(the Exchange Act )), as of September 30, 2024. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer have concluded that as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective to provide reasonable assurance
that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act (a) is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified by Securities and Exchange Commission SEC rules and forms and
(b) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate,
to allow timely decisions regarding any required disclosure. 

Management has identified control deficiencies
regarding inadequate accounting resources, the lack of segregation of duties and the need for a stronger internal control environment.
Our management believes that these material weaknesses are due to the small size of our accounting staff. The small size of our accounting
outsourced staff may prevent adequate controls in the future due to the cost/benefit of such remediation. 

To mitigate the current limited resources and
limited employees, we rely heavily on direct management oversight of transactions, along with the use of external legal and accounting
professionals. As we grow, we expect to increase our number of employees, which will enable us to implement adequate segregation of duties
within the internal control framework. 

These control deficiencies could result in a misstatement
of account balances that would result in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement to our financial statements may not be
prevented or detected on a timely basis. In light of this material weakness, we performed additional analyses and procedures in order
to conclude that our financial statements for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q were
fairly stated in accordance with GAAP. Accordingly, management believes that despite our material weaknesses, our financial statements
for the quarter ended September 30, 2024, are fairly stated, in all material respects, in accordance with GAAP. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting 

There were no changes in our internal control
over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 KLOTHO NEUROSCIENCES, INC. INSIDER TRADING POLICY

Exhibit 19.1 

KLOTHO NEUROSCIENCES, INC. 

 CONFIDENTIALITY AND INSIDER TRADING POLICY 

 ______ 

To: All Company Officers,
Directors, Employees, Consultants and Temporary Insiders: 

This Confidentiality and Insider
Trading Policy (this Policy describes the standards of Klotho Neurosciences, Inc. (the Company on trading,
and causing the trading of, the Company s securities or securities of certain other publicly-traded companies while in the possession
of confidential information. 

One of the principal purposes
of the federal securities laws is to prohibit so-called insider trading. Simply put, insider trading occurs when a person
uses material non-public information obtained through involvement with the Company to make decisions to purchase, sell, give away or otherwise
trade the Company s securities or to provide that information to others outside the Company. Serious problems could be caused for
the Company by unauthorized disclosure of internal information about the Company, including problems relating to improper trading in Company
stock. Company personnel should not discuss internal Company matters or developments with anyone outside of the Company, except as required
in the performance of regular corporate duties. Care should also be taken to avoid inadvertent disclosure of confidential information,
such as through conversations that may be overheard. 

The prohibition on disclosure
of confidential information applies specifically (but not exclusively) to inquiries about the Company that may be made by the financial
press, investment analysts or others in the financial community. It is important that all such communications on behalf of the Company
be through an appropriately designated officer under carefully controlled circumstances. Unless you are expressly authorized to the contrary,
if you receive any inquiries of this nature, you should decline comment and refer the inquirer to the Company s Chief Executive
Officer or Chief Financial Officer. 

1. Our Policy Against Trading
on Undisclosed Information . If a director, officer, employee, consultant or temporary insider has material non-public information
relating to our Company, this Policy and governing law prohibit such person, or any related person, from buying or selling securities
of the Company (or engaging in any other action to take advantage of that information or pass that information on to others) until the
third business day after the date all material non-public information concerning the Company known to such person has been publicly announced
in a press release or filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ). This Policy and governing law also prohibit
trading in the securities of other companies such as potential acquisition candidates or our customers or suppliers about which you have
material, non-lpublic information as a result of your employment or you consulting assignment. 

Transactions that may be necessary
or justifiable for independent reasons (such as the need to raise money for an emergency expenditure) are no exception. Even the appearance
of any improper transaction must be avoided to preserve our reputation for adhering to the highest standards of conduct. 

Material information .
Material information is any information that a reasonable investor would consider important in a decision to buy, hold or sell stock 
in short, any information that could reasonably affect the price of the stock. It is not possible to define all categories of material
information; however, common examples of information that will frequently be regarded as material are: 

(i) projections of future earnings or losses, including changes
in earnings estimates; 

(ii) unusual gains or losses in major operations; 

(iii) news of a pending or proposed merger, acquisition or tender
offer; 

(iv) news of significant sales of assets or the disposition of
a subsidiary; 

(v) significant write-downs in assets or increases in revenues; 

(vi) developments regarding significant litigation or government
agency investigations; 

(vii) changes in dividend policies or the declaration of a stock
split or the offering of additional securities; 

(viii) changes in management; 

(ix) significant new products or discoveries; 

(x) changes in debt ratings; 

(xi) offerings of Company securities; 

(xii) impending bankruptcy or financial liquidity problems; and 

(xiii) the gain or loss of a substantial customer or supplier. 

Either positive or negative
information may be material. Material information is not limited to historical facts but may also include projections and forecasts. With
respect to a future event, such as a merger, acquisition or introduction of a new product, the point at which negotiations or product
development are determined to be material is determined by balancing the probability that the event will occur against the magnitude of
the effect the event would have on a company's operations or stock price should it occur. Thus, information concerning an event that would
have a large effect on stock price, such as a merger, may be material even if the possibility that the event will occur is relatively
small. When in doubt about whether particular non-public information is material, presume it is material. If you are unsure whether
information is material, you should consult the Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer before making any decision to disclose
such information (other than to persons who need to know it) or to trade in or recommend securities to which that information relates.

(Klotho Neurosciences Insider Trading Policy July 2024) 2 

Non-Public Information .
Insider trading prohibitions come into play only when you possess information that is material and non-public. The fact that
information has been disclosed to a few members of the public does not make it public for insider trading purposes. To be public 
the information must have been disseminated in a manner designed to reach investors generally, and the investors must be given the opportunity
to absorb the information. 

Non-Public information may include: 

(i) information available to a select group of analysts or brokers
or institutional investors; 

(ii) undisclosed facts that are the subject of rumors, even if the rumors are widely circulated; and 

(iii) information that has been entrusted to the Company on a confidential basis until a public announcement
of the information has been made and enough time has elapsed for the market to respond to a public announcement of the information (normally
three business days). 

As with questions of materiality,
if you are not sure whether information is considered public, you should either consult with the Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial
Officer, or assume that the information is non-public and treat it as confidential. 

When Information is Public .
As you can appreciate, it is also improper for an officer, director or employee to enter a trade immediately after the company has made
public announcement of material information, including earnings releases. Because the Company's shareholders and the investing public
should be afforded the time to receive the information and act upon it, you should not engage in any transactions until the third business
day after the information has been released. 

Twenty-Twenty Hindsight .
Remember, if your securities transactions become the subject of scrutiny, they will be viewed after-the-fact with the benefit of hindsight.
As a result, before engaging in any transaction you should carefully consider how regulators and others might view your transaction in
hindsight. 

(Klotho Neurosciences Insider Trading Policy July 2024) 3 

Transactions By Family
Members . The very same restrictions that apply to you also apply to your family members who reside with you (including a spouse, a
child, a child away at college, stepchildren, grandchildren, parents, stepparents, grandparents, siblings and in-laws), anyone else who
lives in your household, and any family members who do not live in your household but whose transactions in Company securities are directed
by you or are subject to your influence or control, such as parents or children who consult with you before they trade in Company securities
(collectively referred to as Family Members ). Employees are expected to be responsible for the compliance of their Family
Members. 

Transactions by Entities
that You Influence or Control . This Policy applies to any entities that you influence or control, including any corporations, partnerships
or trusts (collectively referred to as Controlled Entities ), and transactions by these Controlled Entities should be treated
for the purposes of this Policy and applicable securities laws as if they were for your own account. 

Tipping Information to
Others . Whether the information is proprietary information about our Company or information that could have an impact on our stock
price, employees must not pass the information on to others. Serious penalties apply, whether or not you derive any benefit from another's
actions. 

In side Information Regarding
Other Companies . This Policy and the guidelines described herein also apply to material, non-public information relating to other
companies, including the Company s customers, vendors or suppliers Business Partners ), when that information is obtained
in the course of employment with, or other services performed on behalf of, the Company. Civil and criminal penalties, and termination
of employment, may result from trading on material, non-public information regarding the Company s Business Partners. All employees
should treat material, non-public information about the Company s Business Partners with the same care required with respect to
information related directly to the Company. 

Post-Termination Transactions . This Policy,
except for pre-clearance procedures specified in this section, continues to apply to transactions in Company securities even after termination
of service to the Company. If an individual is in possession of material, non-public information when his or her service terminates, that
individual may not trade in Company securities until that information has become public or is no longer material. 

Black-Out Periods .
Each of the Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer has the authority, when he or she deems it necessary or advisable because
of developments known to the Company and not yet disclosed to the public or for other reasons, to prohibit members of the Board of Directors,
officers and any other employees from transacting in Company securities. The Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer will notify
you by email of such a prohibition (referred to as a Black-Out Period ), and the Black-Out Period shall continue for as long
as the Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer specifies. In the event of a Black-Out Period, affected persons may not engage
in any transaction involving the purchase or sale of the Company securities during the Black-Out Period and may not disclose to
others the fact of their transaction suspension. If a Black-Out Period is imposed, you and your related persons MAY NOT execute
transactions even if the Trading Window (as defined below) is then otherwise open for other employees. 

(Klotho Neurosciences Insider Trading Policy July 2024) 4 

Trading Window . The
following applies to: 

All members of the Board of Directors 

Executive Officers (those officers who have been notified that they are subject to the provisions of Section
16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 namely the reporting of beneficial ownership on Form 3 s, 4 s, and 5 s
and prohibition on short swing profits), and 

Certain employees and consultants of the Company, who have been separately notified that these provisions
apply to them, will be reviewed periodically, or when other significant events occur (each, a Key Employee ). Individuals
will be added or removed from coverage as necessary. You will be notified if there is any change in your status. 

To increase compliance with
the insider trading laws, the Company has created a Trading Window policy. The Trading Window opens at the close of business on the second
trading day following the date the financial results for a particular fiscal quarter or year are disclosed to the general public and closes
at the close of business on the fourteenth day of the third calendar month of that fiscal quarter. 

All members of the Board
of Directors, Executive Officers and Key Employees may not transact in the Company s securities other than during the Trading Window.

The preferred period for transacting
in the Company s securities, assuming the absence of material non-public Information at the time, is generally the first ten days
of each Trading Window. 

You will be notified quarterly
when the Trading Window opens and closes, you should know, however, that even during the Trading Window, if you have knowledge of material
non- public information concerning the Company, you may not transact in the Company s securities until the close of business of
the second trading day following the date such information has been disclosed to the general public or ceases to be material non-public
Information. Transacting in the Company s securities during the Trading Window should not be considered a safe harbor, 
and you should use good judgment at all times. 

Pre-Clearance of Transactions .
Directors, Executive Officers and Key Employees may only transact in the Company s securities when the Trading Window is open (and
assuming a Black- Out Period has not been imposed and they are not otherwise aware of material non-public Information), and then only
with the prior approval of the Company s Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer. The information that must be provided
when requesting pre-clearance is set forth on attached Exhibit A. The Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer is under no obligation
to approve a transaction submitted for pre-clearance, and may determine not to permit the transaction. If a person seeks pre-clearance
and permission to engage in the transaction is denied, then he or she should refrain from initiating any transaction in Company securities,
and should not inform any other person of the restriction. 

(Klotho Neurosciences Insider Trading Policy July 2024) 5 

When a request for pre-clearance
is made, the requestor should carefully consider whether he or she may be aware of any material, non-public information about the Company,
and should describe fully those circumstances to the Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer. The requestor should also indicate
whether he or she has effected any non-exempt opposite-way transactions within the past six months, and should be prepared
to report the proposed transaction on an appropriate Form 4 or Form 5. The requestor should also be prepared to comply with SEC Rule 144
and file Form 144, if necessary, at the time of any sale. 

Pre-cleared trades must be
effected within five business days of receipt of pre- clearance unless an exception is granted. Transactions not effected within the time
limit would be subject to pre-clearance again. The requestor receiving clearance for a trade should notify the Chief Executive Officer
or Chief Financial Officer of the completion of the transaction. 

Other Transactions .
Employees who are not officers, directors or 10 shareholders are not prohibited under the federal securities laws from trading in the
Company's securities on a short-term basis. However, as a matter of Company policy, the following transactions involving Company securities
should not be undertaken unless pre-cleared with the Chief Executive Officer: short sales, margin purchases, or purchases or sales of
puts or calls. 

Company Assistance .
If you have any questions concerning specific transactions in stock of the Company, you are encouraged to contact the Company s
Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer. However, the ultimate responsibility for adhering to this Policy and avoiding improper
transactions rests with you. 

2. Prohibition Against
Disclosure of Nonpublic Information . The Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the Company (the Authorized
Personnel are authorized to communicate with brokers, dealers, analysts, institutional investors, shareholders, affiliates of
the foregoing and any other person that has purchased or sold, or may reasonably be expected to purchase or sell, any common stock of
the Company (collectively, Securities Professionals and Shareholders ). Other employees, directors and temporary insiders
are not authorized to provide oral or written information to Securities Professionals and Shareholders, except at the express direction
of the Authorized Personnel. If you receive any inquiries from any Securities Professionals or Shareholders, you should decline comment
and refer the inquirer to one or more of the Authorized Personnel. 

(Klotho Neurosciences Insider Trading Policy July 2024) 6 

If you have any doubt as
to your responsibilities under these guidelines, seek clarification and guidance from the Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer
before you act. 

Do not try to resolve uncertainties
on your own. 

We will expect the strictest
compliance with these procedures by all personnel at every level. As set forth below, failure to observe them may result in serious legal
difficulties for you, as well as the Company. 

3. Certain Exceptions .
The Policy set forth in Section 1 does not apply in the case of the following transactions, except as specifically noted: 

Stock Incentive Plan .
For purposes of this Policy, the Company considers the exercise of stock options for cash under the Company s stock options plans
or the purchase of shares under any Company employee stock purchase plan or otherwise from the Company (but not the sale of any such shares
acquired on the exercise of the option or the purchase) exempt from this Policy unless the Company is aware of material, non-public information
that it cannot disclose to the participant, because the other party to the transaction is the Company itself and the price does not vary
with the market but is fixed by the terms of the option agreement or the plan. 

10b5-1 Programs . Pursuant
to SEC Rule 10b5-1, directors, officers and employees of the Company may establish written programs at a time at which they do not have
material, non-public-information which permit (i) automatic trading of the Company s stock through a third-party broker or (ii)
trading of the Company s stock by an independent person (e.g., an investment banker) who is not aware of material, non-public-information
at the time of a trade. All programs shall be subject to the restrictions and limitations imposed by SEC Rule 10b5-1. These rules are
technical in nature and a 10b5-1 program should only be established with a broker or other securities professional with experience and
expertise in this area. Each program (or the form of program established by a broker or other third party) must be reviewed by the Chief
Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer prior to establishment, to confirm compliance with this policy and the applicable securities
laws. Once a program is implemented in accordance with this Section 3, trades pursuant to such program shall not be subject to the limitations
and restriction set forth in other sections of this Policy. If properly established and implemented, trading pursuant to a program may
occur even when the person on whose behalf such trade is made is aware of material, non-public-information. 

4. Violations of Insider
Trading Laws . Penalties for trading on or communicating material non-public information can be severe, both for individuals involved
in such unlawful conduct and their employers and supervisors, and may include jail terms, criminal fines, civil penalties and civil enforcement
injunctions. Given the severity of the potential penalties, compliance with this Policy is absolutely mandatory. 

Legal Penalties . A
person who violates insider trading laws by engaging in transactions in a company's securities when he or she has material, non-public
information can be sentenced to a substantial jail term and required to pay a criminal penalty of several times the amount of profits
gained or losses avoided. 

In addition, a person who
tips others may also be liable for transactions by the tippees to whom he or she has disclosed material non-public information. Tippers
can be subject to the same penalties and sanctions as the tippees, and the SEC has imposed large penalties even when the tipper did not
profit from the transaction. 

The SEC can also seek substantial
civil penalties from any person who, at the time of an insider trading violation, directly or indirectly controlled the person who
committed such violation, which would apply to the Company and/or management and supervisory personnel. These control persons may
be held liable for up to the greater of 1 million or three times the amount of the profits gained or losses avoided. Even for violations
that result in a small or no profit, the SEC can seek penalties from a company and/or its management and supervisory personnel as control
persons. 

Company-imposed Penalties .
Employees who violate this Policy may be subject to disciplinary action by the Company, including dismissal for cause. Any exceptions
to the Policy, if permitted, may only be granted by the Chief Executive Officer and must be provided before any activity contrary to the
above requirements takes place.
