EXPLANATORY NOTE 
 
 First Northwest Bancorp (the "Company") is filing this Amendment No. 1 (the "Form 10-Q/A") to the Company s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 (the "Form 10-Q"), originally filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on August 12, 2024, in order to reflect an increase of 6.6 million in charge-offs across commercial construction loans, commercial business loans and the Splash unsecured consumer loan program as well as increased provision on Splash consumer loans, resulting in a restated provision for credit losses on loans of 8.7 million. The increases are a result of management s ongoing credit evaluation in assessing the collectability of these loans. In consultation with its prudential regulators, management determined that these amendments were necessary to reflect the credit quality of and underlying collateral values for certain commercial loans. The increases resulted in corrections to loan amortized cost balances, the allowance for credit losses on loans, interest and fees on loans receivable, the provision for credit losses on loans and tax adjustments related to the correction of loan charge-offs and allowance for credit losses on loans. The Audit Committee of the Company s Board of Directors agreed with management s conclusion, following consultation with the Company s independent registered public accounting firm. 
 
 The following tables summarize the effects of the restatement on the Company s balance sheet and statement of operations amounts as reported as of and for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024:

In connection with its evaluation of the restatements described above, management has concluded that a material weakness in the Company s internal control over financial reporting existed as of June 30, 2024. Specifically, 
 
 the Company did not maintain effective controls over the timely recognition of changes in value of collateral-dependent individually evaluated loans and the methodology used to evaluate loans that possess characteristics distinct from existing loan groups evaluated on a pooled basis within the portfolio. See additional discussion included in Part I - Item 4, "Controls and Procedures" of this Form 10-Q/A.

Although this Form 10-Q/A amends and restates the original Form 10-Q in its entirety, except for the information described above, this Form 10-Q/A does not reflect events occurring after the filing of the original Form 10-Q and unless otherwise stated herein, the information contained in the Form 10-Q/A is current only as of the date of the original filing. Except as described above, no other changes have been made to the original Form 10-Q. Accordingly, this form should be read in conjunction with the Company s filings made with the SEC subsequent to the filing of the original Form 10-Q.

In accordance with applicable SEC rules, this Form 10-Q/A includes an updated signature page and certifications of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer in Exhibits 31.1, 31.2 and 32 as required by Rule 12b-15.

 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 (Unaudited) 

shares of common stock at an offering price of per share for gross proceeds of million. An additional shares of Company common stock and in cash were contributed to the First Federal Community Foundation ("Foundation"), a charitable foundation that was established in connection with the Conversion, resulting in the issuance of a total of shares. The Company received million in net proceeds from the stock offering of which million was contributed to the Bank upon Conversion. 
 
 Pursuant to the Bank's Plan of Conversion (the "Plan") adopted by its Board of Directors, and as approved by its members, the Company established an employee stock ownership plan ("ESOP"). On December 18, 2015, the ESOP completed its open market purchases, with funds borrowed from the Company, of of the common stock issued in the Conversion for a total of shares. 
 
 In April 2021, First Northwest entered into an Amended and Restated Joint Venture Agreement (the "Joint Venture Agreement") with the Bank, Peace of Mind, Inc. ("POM"), and Quin Ventures, Inc. ("Quin" or "Quin Ventures"). First Northwest extended million to Quin Ventures under a capital financing agreement and related promissory note and issued shares of the Company's common stock to POM with a value of . Quin Ventures sold substantially all of its assets in December 2022 to Quil Ventures, Inc. ("Quil"), at which time POM returned the shares previously issued and the joint venture agreement was terminated. As part of the sale transaction, the Company received a ownership stake in Quil valued at and recorded a million commitment receivable. In June 2023, First Northwest determined that Quin Ventures was no longer a going concern. The Company wrote off the remaining investment in Quin Ventures through retained earnings in accordance with applicable non-controlling interest accounting methods. The noncontrolling interest in Quin Ventures balance was moved to retained earnings, with no change to total shareholders' equity as a result of the transaction. In December 2023, the Company determined that Quil was no longer a going concern, making the collectability of the receivable from and investment in Quil unlikely. As result, the related investment of and commitment receivable of million were written off during the fourth quarter of 2023, impacting other noninterest income and other noninterest expense, respectively. 
 
 On October 31, 2021, the Bank converted from a State Savings Bank Charter to a State Commercial Bank Charter and was simultaneously renamed First Fed Bank from First Federal Savings and Loan Association of Port Angeles. 
 
 On August 5, 2022, First Northwest's election to be treated as a financial holding company became effective, allowing the Company to engage in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to financial activities. 
 
 First Northwest and the Bank are collectively referred to as the "Company." For periods prior to June 30, 2023, Company references also include Quin Ventures. 
 
 First Northwest's business activities generally are limited to passive investment activities and oversight of its investment in First Fed and former controlling interest in Quin Ventures. Accordingly, the information set forth in this report, including the consolidated unaudited financial statements and related data, relates primarily to the Bank for balance sheet related disclosures and the Bank and Quin Ventures for income statement related disclosures. 
 
 The Bank is a community-oriented financial institution providing commercial and consumer banking services to individuals and businesses in western Washington State with offices in Clallam, Jefferson, Kitsap, King, and Whatcom counties. These services include deposit and lending transactions that are supplemented with bor rowing and investing activities. 

In preparing the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the near term relate to a determination of the allowance for credit losses ("ACL"), fair value of financial instruments and derivatives, and deferred tax assets and liabilities. 

Recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted 
 
 In March 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024 - 01, Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718 ): Scope Application of Profits Interest and Similar Awards . ASU 2024 - 01 added an illustrative example to demonstrate how an entity should apply the scope guidance in paragraph 718 - 10 - 15 - 3 to determine whether a profits interest award should be accounted for in accordance with Topic 718. Awards not meeting the criteria should be accounted for in accordance with Topic 710. The illustrative example provides four fact patterns which are intended to reduce complexity in determining whether a profits interest award is subject to the guidance in Topic 718 and reduce existing diversity in practice. ASU 2024 - 01 is effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this ASU is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

There were available-for-sale securities with unrealized losses of less than one year, and available-for-sale securities with an unrealized loss of more than one year at June 30, 2024 . There were available-for-sale securities with unrealized losses of less than one year, and available-for-sale securities with an unrealized loss of more than one year at December 31, 2023 . Management believes that the unrealized losses on our investment securities relate principally to the general change in interest rates, market liquidity and demand, and market volatility that has occurred since the initial purchase, and such unrecognized losses or gains will continue to vary with general interest rate level and market fluctuations in the future. We do not believe the unrealized losses on our securities are related to a deterioration in credit quality. Certain investments in a loss position are guaranteed by government entities or government sponsored entities. The Company believes that it is unlikely that we would be required to sell these investments prior to a market price recovery or maturity. Based on the Company s evaluation of these securities, no credit impairment was recorded at June 30, 2024 , or December 31, 2023 . 

The amortized cost and estimated fair value of investment securities by contractual maturity are shown in the following tables at the dates indicated. Expected maturities of mortgage-backed securities may differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties; therefore, these securities are shown separately.

Nonaccrual Loans. The accrual of interest on loans is discontinued at the time the loan is 90 days delinquent unless the credit is well-secured and in process of collection. In all cases, loans are placed on nonaccrual or charged off at an earlier date if collection of principal or interest is considered doubtful. All interest accrued but not collected for loans that are placed on nonaccrual or charged off is reversed against interest income. The interest on these loans is accounted for on the cash basis or cost recovery method until qualifying for return to accrual. Loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured. For those loans placed on nonaccrual status due to payment delinquency, return to accrual status will generally not occur until the borrower demonstrates repayment ability over a period of not less than six months.

 Past due loans. Loans are considered past due if the required principal and interest payments have not been received as of the date such payments were due. There were three loans with a total amortized cost of million that were past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest at June 30, 2024 . The loans were well secured and met the regulatory criteria for continuing to accrue interest. There were no loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest at December 31, 2023 .

Credit quality indicator. Federal regulations provide for the classification of lower quality loans and other assets, such as debt and equity securities, as substandard, doubtful, or loss; risk ratings 6, 7, and 8 in our 8 -point risk rating system, respectively. An asset is considered substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the borrower or of any collateral pledged. Substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that the Bank will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full highly questionable and improbable, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values. Assets classified as loss are those considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted. 
 
 When First Fed classifies problem assets as either substandard or doubtful, it may choose to individually evaluate the expected credit loss or may determine that the characteristics are not significantly different from those in pooled loan analysis. The Company evaluates individual loans for expected credit losses when those loans do not share similar risk characteristics with loans evaluated using a collective (pooled) basis. When an insured institution classifies problem assets as a loss, it is required to charge off such assets in the period in which they are deemed uncollectible. Assets that do not currently expose First Fed to sufficient risk to warrant classification as substandard or doubtful but possess identified weaknesses are designated as either watch or special mention assets; risk ratings 4 and 5 in our risk rating system, respectively. Loans not otherwise classified are considered pass graded loans and are rated 1 - 3 in our risk rating system. 

The following table presents the amortized cost of loans receivable by internally assigned risk grade and class of loans as of June 30, 2024 , as well as gross charge-off activity for the six months ended June 30, 2024 .

Individually Evaluated Loans. The Company evaluates loans collectively for purposes of determining the ACLL in accordance with ASC 326 by aggregating loans deemed to possess similar risk characteristics and individually evaluates loans that it believes no longer possess risk characteristics similar to other loans in the portfolio. These loans are typically identified from a substandard or worse internal risk grade, since the specific attributes and risks associated with such loans tend to become unique as the credit deteriorates. Such loans are typically nonperforming, modified loans made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, and/or are deemed collateral dependent, where the ultimate repayment of the loan is expected to come from the operation of or eventual sale of the collateral. 
 
 Loans that are deemed by management to possess unique risk characteristics are evaluated individually for purposes of determining an appropriate lifetime ACLL. The Company uses a discounted cash flow approach, using the loan s effective interest rate, for determining the ACL on individually evaluated loans, unless the loan is deemed collateral dependent. Collateral dependent loans are evaluated based on the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral, less estimated costs to sell. The Company may increase or decrease the ACLL for collateral dependent individually evaluated loans based on changes in the estimated expected fair value of the collateral. In cases where the loan is well-secured and the estimated value of the collateral exceeds the amortized cost of the loan, no ACLL is recorded. Changes in the ACLL for all other individually evaluated loans is based substantially on the Company s evaluation of cash flows expected to be received from such loans. 
 
 As of June 30, 2024 , million of loans were individually evaluated with of ACLL attributed to such loans. At June 30, 2024 , four individually evaluated loans totaling million were evaluated using a discounted cash flow approach and the remaining loans totaling million were evaluated based on the underlying value of the collateral. Two of the loans evaluated using the discounted cash flow method were accruing at quarter end, while the remaining loans evaluated using the discounted cash flow method and collateral dependent loans were all on nonaccrual status at June 30, 2024 . 
 
 At December 31, 2023 , million of loans were individually evaluated with of ACLL attributed to such loans. At December 31, 2023 , one individually evaluated loan with a recorded investment of million was evaluated using a discounted cash flow approach and the remaining loans totaling million were evaluated based on the underlying value of the collateral. The loan evaluated using the discounted cash flow method was accruing at year end, while the collateral dependent loans were all on nonaccrual status at December 31, 2023. 
 
 Collateral Dependent Loans. Loans that have been classified as collateral dependent are loans where substantially all repayment of the loan is expected to come from the operation of or eventual liquidation of the collateral.

Modified Loans to Troubled Borrowers. On January 1, 2023, the Company adopted ASU 2022 - 02, which introduced new reporting requirements for modifications of loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. The Company refers to these loans as modified loans to troubled borrowers ("MLTB"). A MLTB arises from a modification made to a loan in order to alleviate temporary difficulties in the borrower s financial condition and/or constraints on the borrower s ability to repay the loan, and to minimize potential losses to the Company. GAAP requires that certain types of modifications be reported, which consist of the following: principal forgiveness, interest rate reduction, other-than-insignificant payment delay, term extension, or any combination of the foregoing. The ACLL for a MLTB is measured on a collective basis, as with other loans in the loan portfolio, unless management determines that such loans no longer possess risk characteristics similar to others in the loan portfolio. In those instances, the ACLL for a MLTB is determined through individual evaluation. 
 
 During the six months ended June 30, 2024 , there was one new MLTB, a commercial business loan with a recorded investment of for which the Bank agreed to defer payments. The borrower has agreed to resume principal and interest payments at the end of the deferral period. The loan was current at June 30, 2024 , based on the modified terms. 
 
 During the year ended December 31, 2023, there was one new MLTB, a commercial business loan with a recorded investment of for which the Bank agreed to defer principal payments. The borrower continues to make interest-only payments and the loan was current at year end based on the modified terms.

Allowance for Credit Losses on Unfunded Loan Commitments. The Company estimates expected credit losses on unfunded, off-balance sheet commitments over the contractual period in which the Company is exposed to credit risk from a contractual obligation to extend credit, unless the obligation is unconditionally cancellable by the Company. The Company has determined that no allowance is necessary for its home equity line of credit portfolio as it has the contractual ability to unconditionally cancel the available lines of credit. The allowance methodology is similar to the ACLL, but additionally includes an estimate of the future utilization of the commitment as determined by historical commitment utilization. The credit risks associated with the unfunded commitments are consistent with the risks outlined for each loan class. The allowance is recognized in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and is adjusted as a provision, or recapture of provision, for credit losses on the Consolidated Statements of Income. The allowance for unfunded commitments was and at June 30, 2024 , and December 31, 2023 , respectively.

A three -level valuation hierarchy is used in determining fair value that is based on the transparency of the inputs used in the valuation process. The inputs used in determining fair value in each of the three levels of the hierarchy are as follows: 
 
 Level 1 - Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
 
 Level 2 - Either: (i) quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; (ii) observable inputs, such as interest rates or yield curves; or (iii) inputs derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. 
 
 Level 3 - Unobservable inputs. 
 
 The hierarchy gives the highest ranking to Level 1 inputs and the lowest ranking to Level 3 inputs. The level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the overall fair value measurement. 
 
 The Company used the following methods to measure fair value on a recurring and nonrecurring basis. 
 
 Securities available for sale : Where quoted prices are available in an active market, securities are classified as Level 1. Level 1 instruments include highly liquid government bonds, securities issued by the U.S. Treasury, and exchange-traded equity securities. If quoted prices are not available, management determines fair value using pricing models, quoted prices of similar securities, which are considered Level 2, or discounted cash flows. In certain cases, where there is limited activity in the market for an instrument, assumptions must be made to determine their fair value. Such instruments are classified as Level 3. 
 
 Equity and partnership investments : Management determines fair value using quoted prices of similar investments or discounted cash flows, which are considered Level 2, when available. Where there is limited activity in the market for an instrument, assumptions must be made to determine their fair value. The Company believes that the net asset value obtained through financial statements provided by each partnership approximates fair value. Such instruments are classified as Level 3. 
 
 Sold loan servicing rights, at fair value : The fair value of sold loan servicing rights is determined through a discounted cash flow analysis, which uses interest rates, prepayment speeds, discount rates, and delinquency rate assumptions as inputs. Servicing rights are classified as Level 3 due to reliance on assumptions used in the valuation. 
 
 Loans receivable, net : The fair value of loans is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using the current rate at which similar loans and leases would be made to borrowers with similar credit and for the same remaining maturities. Additionally, to be consistent with the requirements under FASB ASC Topic 820 for Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, the loans were valued at a price that represents the Company s exit price or the price at which these instruments would be sold or transferred. 
 
 Interest rate swap derivative : The fair values of interest rate swap agreements are based on valuation models using observable market data as of the measurement date (Level 2 ). The Company s securities derivatives are traded in an over-the-counter market where quoted market prices are not always available. The Company also entered into pay-fixed and receive-floating interest rate swaps associated with certain fixed rate loans. The fair values of derivatives are determined using quantitative models that utilize multiple market inputs. The inputs will vary based on the type of derivative, but could include interest rates, prices and indices to generate continuous yield or pricing curves, prepayment rates, and volatility factors to value the position. The majority of market inputs are actively quoted and can be validated through external sources, including market transactions and third -party pricing services. The fair values of all interest rate swaps are determined from third -party pricing services without adjustment. 

Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis - Assets and liabilities are considered to be valued on a recurring basis if fair value is measured regularly (i.e., daily, weekly, monthly, or quarterly). The following tables show the Company s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at the dates indicated:

 Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis - Assets are considered to be valued on a nonrecurring basis if the fair value measurement of the instrument does not necessarily result in a change in the amount recorded on the consolidated balance sheets. Generally, nonrecurring valuation is the result of the application of other accounting pronouncements that require assets or liabilities to be assessed for impairment or recorded at the lower of cost or fair value. 
 
 The following tables present the Company s assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis at the dates indicated:

Credit Risk-related Contingent Features 
 The Company is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to hedging instruments. The counterparties to all derivative transactions are major financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings. However, this does not eliminate the Company s exposure to credit risk with these institutions. This credit risk is limited to the unrealized gains in such contracts should any of these counterparties fail to perform as contracted. 
 
 The Company has interest rate swap agreements with its derivative counterparties that contain provisions where if the Company either defaults or fails to maintain its status as a well or adequately capitalized institution, then the Company could be required to terminate the contract or post additional collateral. At June 30, 2024 , the Company had no derivatives in a net liability position related to these agreements. The Company has minimum collateral posting thresholds with its derivative counterparties and has posted cash of million at June 30, 2024 , to secure the related interest rate swap agreements as needed. In certain cases, the Company will have posted excess collateral compared to total exposure due to initial margin requirements or day-to-day rate volatility. 
 
 As of June 30, 2024 , the Company was in compliance with all credit risk-related contingent features. Given the considerations described above, the Company considers the impact of the risk of counterparty default to be immaterial. 

million. A pre-tax gain on sale of million was recorded in noninterest income for the second quarter of 2024. Premises and equipment, net of depreciation, decreased by million in the second quarter of 2024. 
 
 Concurrent with the closing of the sale of the Properties, the Bank entered into triple net lease agreements (the "Lease Agreements") to lease back each of the Properties sold. Each Lease Agreement has an initial term of years with one -year renewal option. Going forward, a monthly rent expense of in the aggregate for all Properties will be recorded in Occupancy and Equipment. The total estimated rent expense for the leaseback of these properties for 2024 is million. The annual increase in rent is expected to be partially o set by the elimination of annualized depreciation expense on the buildings of . The executed Lease Agreements also generated right of use assets totaling million and lease liabilities of million resulting in increases to other assets and other liabilities, respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets that was recorded during the second quarter of 2024.

ITEM 2: MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 This Item has been restated to reflect the changes described in the Explanatory Note and in Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 1 of this Form 10-Q/A. 
 
 Forward-Looking Statements 
 
 Certain matters discussed in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q/A constitute forward-looking statements, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements are not statements of historical fact, are based on certain assumptions and are generally identified by the use of words such as "believes," "expects," "anticipates," "estimates" or similar expressions. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: 

statements of our goals, intentions and expectations; 

statements regarding our business plans, prospects, growth and operating strategies; 

statements regarding the quality of our loan and investment portfolios; and 

estimates of our risks and future costs and benefits. 

These forward-looking statements are based on current beliefs and expectations of management and are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond the Company s control. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements due to, among others, the following factors: 

risks associated with lending and potential adverse changes in the credit quality of loans in our portfolio; 

legislative or regulatory changes, including increased insurance rates and assessments or expanded consumer protection regulations, responses to recent events in the banking industry, interest rates along the yield curve, and inflation, which could adversely affect the Company's business; 

continued depressed market demand for mortgage and Small Business Administration loans that we originate for sale; 

changes in monetary and fiscal policies including interest rate policies of the Federal Reserve and the relative differences between short and long-term interest rates, deposit interest rates, our net interest margin and funding sources; 

our ability to control operating costs and expenses; 

whether our management team can succeed in implementing our operational strategy, including but not limited to our ability to achieve higher net interest income and noninterest revenue growth; 

our ability to successfully execute on growth strategies related to our entry into new markets and delivery channels, including banking as a service; 

our ability to develop user-friendly digital applications to serve existing customers and attract new customers; 

the use of estimates in determining fair value of certain of our assets, which estimates may prove to be incorrect and result in significant declines in valuation; 

pressures on liquidity, including as a result of withdrawals of customer deposits or declines in the value of our investment portfolio; 

increased competitive pressures among financial services companies, particularly from non-traditional banking entities such as challenger banks, fintech, and mega technology companies; 

our ability to attract and retain deposits at a reasonable cost relative to the market; 

changes in consumer spending, borrowing and savings habits, resulting in reduced demand for banking products and services, particularly in the event of a recession that affects our market areas; 

results of examinations by our primary or other regulatory authorities, as well as a consent order we entered into with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, could have an adverse impact on our business and operations; 

disruptions, security breaches, or other adverse events, failures or interruptions in, or attacks on, our information technology systems or on the third-party vendors who perform several of our critical processing functions; 

risks related to overall economic conditions, including the impact on the economy of an elevated interest rate environment and geopolitical instability, including the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East; 

any failure of key third-party vendors to perform their obligations to us; 

risks related to natural disasters, including droughts, fires, floods, earthquakes, pandemics, and other unexpected events; 

the effects of any reputational damage to the Company resulting from any of the foregoing; and 

other economic, competitive, governmental, regulatory and technical factors affecting our operations, pricing, products and services and other risks described elsewhere in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including this Form 10-Q/A and the Company's 2023 Form 10-K.

 General 
 
 First Northwest is a bank holding company and a financial holding company and is engaged in banking activities through its wholly owned subsidiary, First Fed Bank, as well as certain non-banking financial activities. Non-financial investments include several limited partnership investments, including a 33.3 interest in The Meriwether Group, LLC ("MWG"). The Company's business activities are generally focused on passive investment activities and oversight of the activities of First Fed. The Company also entered into partnerships to strategically invest in fintech-related businesses. 
 
 First Fed Bank is a community-oriented financial institution founded in 1923 in Port Angeles, Washington. We have 18 locations including 12 full-service branches, three business centers and three administration centers in Clallam, Jefferson, King, Kitsap, Snohomish and Whatcom counties. First Fed s business and operating strategy is focused on building sustainable earnings by delivering a full array of financial products and services for individuals, small business, and commercial customers. Lending activities include the origination of first lien one-to-four family mortgage loans, commercial and multi-family real estate loans, residential and commercial construction and land loans, commercial business loans, SBA loans, and consumer loans, consisting primarily of home equity loans and lines of credit. Over the last five years, we have significantly increased the origination of commercial real estate, multi-family real estate, construction, and commercial business loans, and have increased our consumer loan portfolio through our manufactured home and auto loan purchase programs. We offer traditional consumer and business deposit products, including transaction accounts, savings and money market accounts and certificates of deposit ("CDs") for individuals and businesses. Deposits are our primary source of funding for our lending and investing activities. First Fed also has a limited partnership investment in the Meriwether Group Capital Hero Fund LP ("Hero Fund") which was previously held by First Northwest. The Hero Fund is a private commercial lender focused on lower-middle market businesses, primarily in the Pacific Northwest. 
 
 First Northwest's limited partnership investments include Canapi Ventures Fund, LP; BankTech Ventures, LP; and JAM FINTOP Blockchain, LP. These limited partnerships invest in fintech-related businesses with a focus on developing digital solutions applicable to the banking industry. In 2022, First Northwest acquired a 33.3 interest in MWG, a boutique investment bank and consulting firm focused on providing entrepreneurs with resources to help them succeed. Also in 2022, the Company acquired a 25 equity interest as a general partner in Meriwether Group Capital, LLC ("MWGC"), which provides financial advice for borrowers and capital for the Hero Fund. MWG also holds a 20 general partner interest in MWGC. MWGC holds a 0.01 general partner interest in the Hero Fund. 
 
 First Northwest is impacted by prevailing economic conditions as well as government policies and regulations concerning, among other things, monetary and fiscal affairs, housing and financial institutions. Deposit flows are influenced by several factors, including interest rates paid on competing deposits, alternative investment options available to our customers, account maturities, the number and quality of our deposit originators, digital delivery systems, branding and customer acquisition, and the overall level of personal income and savings in the markets where we do business. Lending activities are influenced by the demand and pricing for loan funds, our credit policies, the number and quality of our lenders and credit underwriters, digital delivery systems, branding and customer acquisition, and regional economic cycles. 
 
 Our primary source of pre-tax income is net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on our loans and investments and interest expense paid on our deposits and borrowings. Changes in our asset and liability mix, market and portfolio interest rates and cash flows from existing assets and liabilities affect our net interest income. A secondary source of income for the Company is noninterest income, which includes revenue earned from providing products and services, including service charges on deposit accounts, late and other charges on loans, mortgage banking income, loan sales and servicing income, interest rate swap fee income, earnings from bank-owned life insurance, investment services income, gains and losses from sales of securities, and changes in the market value of our equity and partnership investments. 
 
 An offset to net interest income is the provision for credit losses, which represents the periodic charge to operations that is required to adequately provide for losses inherent in our investment, loan and unfunded commitment portfolios through the ACL. A recapture of previously recognized provision for credit losses may be added to net income if the underlying assumptions driving anticipated loss rates within the CECL model improve, such as the United States unemployment and gross domestic product metrics; lowered qualitative factor adjustments to reflect improvements in the nonaccrual and past due status or upgrades in risk ratings of a particular loan segment; lower loan or unfunded commitment balances, or receipt of recoveries for amounts previously charged off.

Table of Contents 

Noninterest expenses incurred in operating our business consist of salaries and employee benefit costs, occupancy and equipment expenses, federal deposit insurance premiums and regulatory assessments, data processing expenses, marketing and other customer acquisition expenses, legal and other professional fees, expenses related to real estate and personal property owned, and other expenses. 
 
 Recent Regulatory Developments 
 
 Brokered Deposits Rulemaking. On July 30, 2024, the Board of Directors of the FDIC approved a proposed rule that would amend the FDIC s regulations governing the classification and treatment of brokered deposits. The proposal would, among other changes, broaden the definition of deposit broker to include agents that place or facilitate the placement of third-party deposits at only one insured depository institution and narrow the exception to the definition of deposit broker for agents whose primary purpose is not the placement of funds with depository institutions. While the Company is evaluating the potential impact of the proposed rule, if the rule is finalized as proposed, the Bank would likely be required to classify a greater amount of its deposits obtained with the involvement of third parties as brokered deposits. An increase in the amount of brokered deposits on the Bank s balance sheet could, among other consequences, increase the Bank s deposit insurance assessment costs. 
 
 Third-Party Deposit Arrangements Guidance. On July 25, 2024, the Federal Reserve, FDIC, and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency released a joint statement discussing potential risks related to arrangements between banks and third parties to deliver bank deposit products and services to end users, as well as examples of effective practices for the management of those risks. Additionally, the agencies issued a request for information and comment on the nature of banks relationships with financial technology companies and effective risk management practices for those relationships. The agencies also indicated that they are considering whether additional steps, such as enhancements to supervisory guidance, could help ensure that banks effectively manage risks associated with these various types of arrangements. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies 
 
 There are no material changes to the critical accounting policies from those disclosed in the Company's 2023 Form 10-K. 

Comparison of Financial Condition at June 30, 2024 (Restated) and December 31, 2023 
 
 Assets . Total assets increased to 2.22 billion, or 0.6 , at June 30, 2024, from 2.2 billion at December 31, 2023. 
 
 Cash and cash equivalents decreased by 40.0 million, or 32.5 , to 83.2 million as of June 30, 2024, compared to 123.2 million as of December 31, 2023. Cash decreased during the current year as the Bank deployed funds into higher-yielding investment securities and loans. 
 
 Investment securities increased 11.1 million, or 3.8 , to 306.7 million at June 30, 2024, from 295.6 million at December 31, 2023. Investment security purchases during the six months ended June 30, 2024, totaled 53.0 million with an estimated weighted-average yield of 6.4 and a weighted-average life of 5.4 years. The security purchases and a portfolio market value increase of 100,000 were partially offset by the sale of 23.2 million of securities, with an average yield of 3.0 , during the six months ended June 30, 2024, and payment activity during the period. Our recent investment purchases have primarily been floating rate securities to take advantage of higher short-term rates above those offered on cash and to reduce balance sheet sensitivity. The investment portfolio, including mortgage-backed securities, had an estimated projected average life of 7.8 years as of June 30, 2024, compared to 7.7 years as of December 31, 2023, and had an estimated average repricing term of 6.5 years as of June 30, 2024, compared to 6.3 years as of December 31, 2023, based on the interest rate environment at those times. The effective duration of the investment portfolio was 4.3 years at June 30, 2024, compared to 4.8 years at December 31, 2023. If prevailing market interest rates fall, we expect prepayments will accelerate due to the current coupons of fixed rate bonds. 
 
 Included in MBS non-agency are 29.8 million of commercial mortgage-backed securities ("CMBS"), of which 89.8 are in "A" tranches with the remaining 10.2 in "B" tranches. Our largest exposure in the CMBS portfolio is to long-term care facilities, which comprises 65.2 , or 19.4 million, of our private label CMBS securities. All of the CMBS have credit enhancements ranging from 28.8 to 99.8 , with a weighted-average credit enhancement of 55.2 , that further reduces the risk of loss on these investments. 
 
 The investment portfolio was comprised of 55.8 in amortizing securities at June 30, 2024, compared to 52.0 at December 31, 2023. The projected average life of the securities portfolio may vary due to prepayment activity, particularly in the mortgage-backed securities portfolio, which is impacted by prevailing market interest rates. Our securities portfolio is utilized to manage liquidity, improve long-term interest income and manage interest rate risk. For additional information, see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 1 of this Form 10-Q/A.

Net loans, excluding loans held for sale, increased 35.3 million to 1.68 billion at June 30, 2024, from 1.64 billion at December 31, 2023. During the six months ended June 30, 2024, auto and other consumer loans increased 36.5 million with 25.6 million of Woodside auto loan purchases, 22.3 million of Triad manufactured home loan purchases and 14.2 million of First Help auto loan purchases, partially offset by prepayments and scheduled payments. Multi-family loans increased 17.0 million during the six months ended June 30, 2024. The increase was the result of 21.4 million of construction loans converting into permanent amortizing loans, partially offset by payment activity. One-to-four family loans increased 11.5 million during the six months ended June 30, 2024, as a result of 22.3 million in residential construction loans which converted to permanent amortizing loans, partially offset by payments received. Commercial business loans increased 4.8 million, including 13.4 million of organic originations, 9.5 million of purchased Bankers Healthcare group loans and 4.9 million in draws on existing line of credit commitments, offset by repayments and charge off activity. Home equity loan outstanding balances increased 3.2 million over the prior year end due to 2.9 million from home equity loan originations and draws on new and existing line of credit commitments. Commercial real estate loans decreased 12.5 million during the six months ended June 30, 2024, due to payoffs, scheduled payments and a reclassification of 3.9 million to multi-family offsetting originations of 5.2 million. 
 
 Construction and land loans decreased 22.4 million, or 17.3 , to 107.3 million at June 30, 2024, from 129.7 million at December 31, 2023, with 44.1 million converting into fully amortizing loans and charge offs totaling 4.0 million, partially offset by draws on new and existing loan commitments. Construction loans in the portfolio are geographically dispersed throughout Western Washington. All construction projects are monitored by either a third-party firm or our internal construction administration team. Projects with larger loan commitments have more robust monitoring by firms with more services and expertise. We continue to monitor the impact inflation and housing demand may have on the completion of the projects currently in the portfolio. As of the date of this report, we have no reason to believe that any of the projects in process will not be completed. At June 30, 2024, 46 of construction commitments were secured by one-to-four family residential properties, which are anticipated to convert into amortizing loans upon completion and may be sold at that time. 
 
 We monitor real estate values and general economic conditions in our market areas, in addition to assessing the strength of our borrowers, including their equity contributions to a project, to prudently underwrite construction loans. We continually assess our lending strategies across all product lines and markets where we do business to improve earnings while also prudently managing credit risk.

During the six months ended June 30, 2024, the Company added 90.5 million of organic loan originations, of which 59.4 million, or 65.7 , were located in the Puget Sound region, 23.5 million, or 26.0 , on the North Olympic Peninsula, 2.8 million, or 3.1 , in other areas throughout Washington State, and 4.8 million, or 5.3 , in other states. The Company purchased an additional 40.7 million in auto loans, 22.3 million in manufactured home loans, and 9.5 million in commercial business loans to borrowers located throughout the United States during the six months ended June 30, 2024. We will continue to strategically evaluate opportunities to acquire assets through wholesale channels in order to supplement organic originations and increase net interest income. The Northpointe Bank Mortgage Purchase Program ("Northpointe MPP") also provides a source of additional interest income but is dependent on demand for funding, with repayment of advances to this program typically occurring within 30 days or less. The total loan portfolio was composed of 78.2 organic originations and 21.8 purchased loans at June 30, 2024. 
 
 The ACLL increased to 19.3 million at June 30, 2024, as the Company recorded a 9.9 million provision for credit loss on loans for the six-month period. Net charge-offs were 8.1 million for the six-month period. The ACLL as a percentage of total loans was 1.14 and 1.10 at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 
 Nonaccrual loans increased 5.0 million, or 26.7 , to 23.6 million at June 30, 2024, from 18.6 million at December 31, 2023, primarily attributable to a 8.1 million commercial construction loan placed on nonaccrual during the quarter ended June 30, 2024, a 708,000 multi-family loan, a 535,000 delinquent purchased one-to-four family loan, three delinquent auto loans totaling 406,000 and a 184,000 increase to a commercial construction relationship previously placed on nonaccrual. These increases were partially offset by 4.0 million of charge offs on loans previously placed on nonaccrual and a 591,000 single family residence loan that was paid off during the first quarter of 2024. Nonaccrual loans to total loans was 1.39 at June 30, 2024, compared to 1.12 at December 31, 2023. The ACLL as a percentage of nonaccrual loans decreased to 82 at June 30, 2024, down from 94 at December 31, 2023. Subsequent to quarter-end, the 708,000 multifamily loan was paid off.

Classified loans increased 4.6 million to 39.8 million at June 30, 2024, from 35.1 million at December 31, 2023, due to the downgrade during the first half of 2024 of the loans noted above. An 11.2 million construction loan relationship, which became classified in the fourth quarter of 2022, a 9.2 million commercial loan relationship which became classified in the fourth quarter of 2023 and the 8.1 million commercial construction loan relationship which became classified in the quarter ended June 30, 2024, account for 71 of the classified loan balance at June 30, 2024. The Bank has exercised legal remedies, including the appointment of a third-party receivership and foreclosure actions, to liquidate the underlying collateral to satisfy the real estate loans in two of the three collateral-dependent relationships. Proceeds from the sale of a unit in the 11.2 million construction loan relationship during the first quarter of 2024 were used to the paydown principal of the related loan balance. Subsequent to quarter-end, a property included in the 9.2 million commercial loan relationship was sold, resulting in a 3.0 million loan payoff recorded in the third quarter of 2024. 
 
 The Bank recorded commercial construction loan charge-offs totaling 4.0 million and commercial business loan charge-offs of 2.6 million in the second quarter of 2024 as a result of uncertainty in the collectability of the underlying collateral in specific loan relationships. Charge-offs are based on individual loan evaluations and do not represent a universal decline in the collectability of all loans in these categories. Additional charged-off balances were related to loans purchased through the Splash unsecured consumer loan program totaled 1.3 million during the six months ended June 30, 2024, or 76 of gross charge-offs. The Bank's active participation in the program was discontinued in 2023. Total Splash loan balances of 4.7 million and 7.3 million were included in Auto and Other Consumer loans at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. We believe the ACLL is adequate to absorb the known and inherent risks of loss in the overall loan portfolio as of June 30, 2024.

In the second quarter of 2024, the Bank completed the sale and leaseback of six branch properties to Mountainseed, reducing premises and equipment by 6.8 million. The Bank received the full sales price of 14.7 million. The proceeds of the sale transaction were used to pay down borrowings. First Fed is leasing back the six properties sold to Mountainseed under agreements with initial terms of 15 years with one 15-year renewal option each. The leases, recorded in the second quarter of 2024, resulted in an increase of 12.2 million to both other assets and other liabilities for the related right-of-use assets and lease liabilities created by the contracts, respectively. 
 
 In the second quarter of 2024, a redemption of First Northwest's limited partnership investment in Meriwether Group Hero Fund LP was offset by a subsequent limited partnership investment in the same entity by First Fed. First Northwest utilized the cash received to pay down the NexBank line of credit. 
 
 Liabilities. Total liabilities increased to 2.06 billion at June 30, 2024, from 2.04 billion at December 31, 2023, due to increases in deposits of 31.4 million and lease liabilities included in other liabilities of 11.6 million, partially offset by a decrease in borrowings of 18.4 million. 
 
 Deposit balances increased 31.4 million to 1.71 billion at June 30, 2024 from 1.68 billion at December 31, 2023. During the first half of 2024, total retail deposit balances increased 15.3 million and brokered deposit balances increased 16.1 million. Within retail deposit balances, an increase in money market accounts of 60.8 million and demand deposit accounts of 17.2 million was partially offset by a decrease in retail CDs of 45.3 million and savings accounts of 17.5 million. Increases in demand and money market accounts were driven by customer behavior as they sought out higher rates offered as CD specials matured. We utilize brokered CDs as an additional funding source to provide liquidity, manage cost of funds, reduce reliance on FHLB advances, and manage interest rate risk. Overall, the current rate environment contributes to continued competition for deposits with additional deposit rate specials offered to retain existing balances and attract new funds. 
 
 Advances decreased 14.9 million, or 5.4 to 260.1 million at June 30, 2024, from 275.0 million at December 31, 2023. We reduced short-term FHLB advances and the NexBank line of credit to improve the cost of funds while long-term advances increased to provide additional balance sheet liquidity. 
 
 Equity . Total shareholders' equity decreased 4.5 million to 158.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024. The Company recorded a net loss during that period of 1.8 million, 1.3 million of dividends declared and 3.0 million for the cost of repurchased shares. Decreases were partially offset by a 902,000 increase in the post-tax fair market value of derivatives and 866,000 related to share-based compensation plans. During the six months ended June 30, 2024, we repurchased 214,132 shares of common stock under the October 2020 stock repurchase plan at an average price of 14.03 per share for a total of 3.0 million, which completed the October 2020 share repurchase program. In April 2024, the Board of Directors authorized a new buyback plan of up to 10 of shares outstanding for a maximum of 944,279 shares. No shares have been repurchased to date under the new program.

Comparison of Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended June 30, 2024 (Restated) and 2023 
 
 General. A net loss attributable to the Company of 2.2 million was recorded for the three months ended June 30, 2024, compared to net income of 1.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023. A 10.2 million decrease in net interest income after provision for credit losses and a 392,000 increase in noninterest expense were partially offset by a 5.6 million increase in noninterest income. 
 
 Net Interest Income. Net interest income decreased 1.8 million to 14.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024, from 16.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023. This decrease was mainly the result of higher rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities, which increased 95 basis points to 3.28 for the three months ended June 30, 2024, compared to 2.33 for the same period in the prior year. This was due to higher rates paid on all deposits and borrowings and an increase in the average balances of CDs and borrowings. The cost of total deposits increased 93 basis points to 2.47 for the three months ended June 30, 2024, compared to 1.54 for the same period in 2023. The average yield on interest-earning assets increased 38 basis points to 5.55 for the three months ended June 30, 2024, compared to 5.17 for the same period last year, due primarily to higher yields on variable- and adjustable-rate assets and an increase in higher yielding loan volume due to originations, purchases and draws on new and existing lines of credit. 
 
 Total cost of funds increased 89 basis points to 2.87 for the three months ended June 30, 2024, from 1.98 for the same period in 2023. The net interest margin decreased 49 basis points to 2.76 for the three months ended June 30, 2024, from 3.25 for the same period in 2023. While increases in the cost of funding outpaced the growth of the yield on interest-earning assets, the Company has taken measures to reverse interest rate margin compression. Organic loan production was augmented with higher-yielding purchased loans through established third-party relationships. Lower yielding investment securities totaling 23.2 million were sold at a loss in the second quarter of 2024, replaced with 53.3 million of higher-yielding security investments during the second quarter of 2024. Income on the Bank's fair value hedging agreements on securities increased quarter-over-quarter by 67,000. The fair value hedge on loans established in 2024 increased interest income by 378,000 for the second quarter of 2024. 
 
 Interest Income. Total interest income increased 3.1 million, or 12.3 , to 28.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024, from 25.5 million for the comparable period in 2023, primarily due to higher yields on interest-earning assets. Interest and fees on loans receivable increased 2.4 million, to 23.7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024, from 21.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023, primarily due to an increase in average loan yields to 5.62 for the three months ended June 30, 2024, from 5.38 for the same period in 2023, coupled with an increase in the average balance of net loans receivable of 110.8 million compared to the second quarter of 2023. The loan portfolio has grown through draws on new and existing business lines of credit, originations of multi-family real estate loans, and purchases of auto, manufactured home, and purchased Bankers Healthcare Group commercial loans. Loan yields increased over the prior year due to higher rates on new originations as well as the repricing of variable- and adjustable-rate loans tied to the Prime Rate or other indices. The yield earned on investment securities also increased 87 basis points to 5.01 compared to the same period in 2023, as increases in floating bond rates, sales of lower-yielding bonds, purchases of new bonds at higher yields and a reduction in amortization of premium costs as prepayment speeds slow down have all positively impacted investment securities income. The yield on interest-earning deposits in banks also increased to 5.54 from 5.18 for the comparable period in 2023, benefitting from increases in rates paid on excess balances held at the FRB.

Interest Expense. Total interest expense increased 4.9 million, or 51.5 , to 14.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024, compared to 9.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023. The increase over the second quarter of 2023 was the result of an increase in the cost of deposits to 2.47 from 1.54 in same period one year ago along with higher volumes of CDs. A shift in the deposit mix from no or low-cost transaction and savings accounts to a higher volume of CDs and money market accounts and higher prevailing market rates resulted in a higher cost of deposits. Interest expense on borrowings increased due to an average balance increase of 52.5 million and an increase in the cost of advances from 4.41 to 4.85 , primarily FHLB advances, compared to the same period in 2023. 
 
 Average deposit account balances were composed of 85 in interest-bearing deposits and 15 in noninterest-bearing deposits at June 30, 2024, compared to 82 and 18 , respectively, at June 30, 2023. During the three months ended June 30, 2024, interest expense increased on CDs due to an increase in the average balances of 88.5 million, along with an increase in the average rates paid of 108 basis points, compared to the three months ended June 30, 2023. During the same period, the average balances of money market accounts increased 21.1 million with a 141-basis point average rate increase, resulting in an increase to interest expense. The average cost of interest-bearing deposit accounts increased to 2.91 for the three months ended June 30, 2024, from 1.87 for the three months ended June 30, 2023, due to changes to the deposit mix, driven by customer preferences and the use of higher-rate promotional products designed to retain existing deposits and generate new deposits. The mix of retail customer deposit balances shifted from non-maturity accounts towards higher cost term certificate products. Retail customer CDs represented 26.8 and 25.8 of retail customer deposits at June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Provision for Credit Losses. The Company recorded an 8.7 million provision for credit losses in the three months ended June 30, 2024. A provision for credit losses on loans of 8.6 million was the result of the charge-off activity previously discussed; an increase in the estimated CECL loss factors applied to commercial business loans, residential real estate and multi-family loans; and growth in the purchased auto loan portfolio. Increases were partially offset by a decrease in the loss factors applied to commercial real estate loans, home equity lines of credit and other consumer loans, and declining commercial business and construction loan balances. A provision for credit losses on unfunded commitments of 99,000 was also recorded during the quarter ended June 30, 2024, due to higher loss factors and a moderate increase in commitment balances at quarter end. This compares to a 300,000 loan loss provision for the quarter ended June 30, 2023. While the ACLL as a percentage of nonaccrual loans at period end has decreased to 82 compared to 677 for the same period in 2023, 85 of the nonaccrual loan balance is comprised of well-secured real estate loans, based on the current loan-to-value ratio, which the Company believes will be sufficient to repay the loans upon sale of the underlying collateral.

Noninterest Income. Noninterest income increased 5.6 million, or 329.4 , to 7.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024, from 1.7 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to the sale of six branch properties in the sale-leaseback transaction, partially offset by loss on sale of securities. While saleable mortgage loan production and related gains continued to be impacted by higher market rates on mortgage loans, the Company did see improvement due to the sale of SBA loans over the same quarter of 2023. The conversion of lower-yielding BOLI policies was initiated in the first quarter of 2024 and is expected to be finalized in the third and fourth quarters. The decrease in other income is due to 174,000 loan swap fee income recorded in the second quarter of 2023 and a quarter-over-quarter unrealized loss of 285,000 recorded for partnership investments.

The increase in expenses compared to the second quarter of 2023 is mainly due to higher incentive compensation of 133,000, payroll taxes of 175,000, tax on the property sale of 359,000, additional rent of 239,000, salaries of 175,000 and production commissions of 74,000, partially offset by lower advertising costs of 552,000, legal fees of 149,000 and consulting fees of 124,000. The Company continues to focus on controlling compensation expense and reducing advertising and other discretionary spending while the net interest margin compression due to higher market rates and an inverted yield curve persists.

Provision for Income Tax. An income tax benefit of 547,000 was recorded for the three months ended June 30, 2024, compared to income tax expense of 475,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2023, due to a year-over-year decrease in income before taxes of 4.9 million. The provision includes accruals for both federal and state income taxes. For additional information, see Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 1 of this Form 10-Q/A. 

Comparison of Results of Operations for the Six Months Ended June 30, 2024 (Restated) and 2023 
 
 General. A net loss attributable to the Company of 1.8 million was recorded for the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to net income of 5.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023. A 14.0 million decrease in net interest income after provision for credit losses was partially offset by a 5.5 million increase in noninterest income and a 176,000 decrease in noninterest expense. 
 
 Net Interest Income. Net interest income decreased 4.1 million to 28.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024, from 32.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023, as higher funding costs outpaced increased loan, investment and interest-earning deposit income. 
 
 Average earning assets increased 107.5 million year-over-year. The yield on average interest-earning assets increased 43 basis points to 5.49 for the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to 5.06 for the same period in the prior year, due to an increase in the average net loans receivable balance, higher loan yields, and an increase in yields earned on investment securities and interest-earning deposit accounts. 
 
 The average cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased to 3.21 for the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to 2.08 for the same period last year, due primarily to higher rates paid on all interest-bearing deposits and advances along with increases in the average balances of money market accounts, CDs and FHLB advances. Total cost of funds increased 105 basis points to 2.81 for the six months ended June 30, 2024, from 1.76 for the same period in 2023. The net interest margin decreased 59 basis points to 2.76 for the six months ended June 30, 2024, from 3.35 for the same period in 2023. 
 
 Interest Income. Total interest income increased 7.1 million, or 14.7 , to 55.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024, from 48.8 million for the comparable period in 2023, primarily due to an increase in yields on interest-earning assets and an increase in average net loans receivable balances. Interest and fees on loans receivable increased 5.7 million, to 46.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024, from 40.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023, primarily due to an increase in the average balance of net loans receivable of 118.8 million compared to the prior year, coupled with an increase in average loan yields to 5.57 for the six months ended June 30, 2024, from 5.27 for the same period in 2023. The loan portfolio increased as a result of additional auto, manufactured home, and Bankers Healthcare Group commercial loan purchases. Loan yields increased over the prior year due to higher rates on new originations as well as the repricing of variable- and adjustable-rate loans tied to the Prime Rate or other variable-rate indices. The yield earned on investment securities also increased 87 basis points to 4.88 compared to the same period in 2023, with half of the purchase of higher-yielding investments occurring late in the first quarter of 2023 which resulted in the related increase only impacting income for the second quarter of 2024. An increase in rates on floating bonds and a slowdown in prepayment speeds, which reduces amortization of premium costs, also positively impacted investment securities income.

Interest Expense. Total interest expense increased 11.3 million, or 68.6 , to 27.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to 16.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023. The increase over the first six months of 2023 was the result of a 112-basis point increase in the cost of deposits from 1.33 one year prior to 2.45 along with a higher volume of money market account and CD balances. A shift in the deposit mix from no or low-cost transaction, money market, and savings accounts to a higher volume of CDs resulted in higher costs of deposits. Interest expense on borrowings increased due to a 36.6 million increase in the average balance and a 50-basis point increase in the cost of advances, primarily FHLB advances, compared to the same period in 2023. 
 
 During the six months ended June 30, 2024, interest expense on CDs increased due to higher average balances of 141.9 million, along with a 135-basis point increase in the average rates paid, compared to the six months ended June 30, 2023. During the same period, the average balances of money market accounts decreased 17.6 million, with a 139-basis point average rate increase, resulting in an overall increase to interest expense. The average cost of interest-bearing deposit accounts increased to 2.88 for the six months ended June 30, 2024, from 1.62 for the six months ended June 30, 2023, due to the use of promotional products designed to retain existing deposits and generate new deposits. The mix of retail customer deposit balances shifted from non-maturity accounts towards higher cost CD and savings products. Retail customer CDs represented 23.3 and 23.0 of total deposits at June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Brokered CDs represented 13.1 and 10.9 of total deposits at June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Provision for Credit Losses. The Company recorded a 9.7 million provision for credit losses in the six months ended June 30, 2024. A provision for credit losses on loans of 9.9 million was the result of the charge-offs previously discussed; an increase in the estimated CECL loss factors applied to the Splash consumer loans, residential real estate, multi-family and commercial business loans; and growth in the purchased auto loan portfolio, partially offset by a decrease in the loss factors applied to Woodside auto and construction loans. A recapture of 170,000 was due to a lower year-over-year loss factor applied to unfunded commitment balances reducing the provision for credit losses recorded during the six months ended June 30, 2024. This compares to a 315,000 loan loss provision and a 515,000 unfunded commitment provision recapture for the six months ended June 30, 2023. While the ACLL as a percentage of nonaccrual loans at period end has decreased to 82 compared to 677 for the same period in 2023, 85 of the nonaccrual loan balance is comprised of well-secured real estate loans, based on the current loan-to-value ratio, which the Company believes will be sufficient to repay the loans upon sale of the underlying collateral.

The increase was primarily due to the sale of the six branch properties in the sale-leaseback transaction partially offset by the sale of securities and no loan swap fee income or investment services fee income during the six months ended June 30, 2024. The Company ended its investment services program in 2023. Income from the gain on sale of loans during the six months ended June 30, 2024, includes 116,000 from SBA loans compared to 65,000 in the same period of 2023. The conversion of lower-yielding BOLI policies initiated in the first quarter of 2024 contributed towards the 120,000 year-over-year recorded increase.

The decrease in expenses compared to the same period in 2023 is mainly due to lower advertising costs and a 218,000 reduction in the accrual for a civil money penalty assessed by the FDIC. The civil money penalty was originally accrued in the fourth quarter of 2023. These decreases were partially offset by higher payroll taxes of 628,000 related to employee retention tax credits recorded in 2023, tax on the sale-leaseback transaction of 359,000, additional rent of 239,000 and production commissions of 113,000. The Company continues to focus on controlling compensation expense and reducing advertising and other discretionary spending while the net interest margin compression persists, given higher market rates and an inverted yield curve. A reduction-in-force impacting 9 of our workforce took place in July 2024.

An income tax benefit of 100,000 was recorded for the six months ended June 30, 2024, compared to income tax expense of 1.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023, due to a year-over-year decrease in income before taxes of 8.4 million. The provision for the six months ended June 30, 2024, includes a tax penalty estimate for the early surrender of a BOLI contract. The provision includes accruals for both federal and state income taxes.

Rate/Volume Analysis 
 
 The following table presents the dollar amount of changes in interest income and interest expense for major components of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. It distinguishes between the changes related to outstanding balances and changes in interest rates. For each category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, information is provided on changes attributable to (i) changes in volume (i.e., changes in volume multiplied by old rate) and (ii) changes in rate (i.e., changes in rate multiplied by old volume). For purposes of this table, changes attributable to both rate and volume, which cannot be segregated, have been allocated proportionately to the change due to volume and the change due to rate.

Off-Balance Sheet Activities 
 
 In the normal course of operations, First Fed engages in a variety of financial transactions that are not recorded in the financial statements. These transactions involve varying degrees of off-balance sheet credit, interest rate and liquidity risks. These transactions are used primarily to manage customers requests for funding and take the form of loan commitments and lines of credit. For the six months ended June 30, 2024 and the year ended December 31, 2023, we engaged in no off-balance sheet transactions likely to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Liquidity Management 
 
 Liquidity is the ability to meet current and future short-term and long-term financial obligations. Our primary sources of funds consist of investment security principal and interest payments, customer and brokered deposit inflows, loan repayments and maturities, sales of securities, borrowings from the FHLB and utilization of the NexBank line of credit. While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are usually predictable sources of funds, deposit flows, calls of investment securities and borrowed funds, and prepayments on loans and investment securities are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions and competition, which can cause those sources of funds to fluctuate. 
 
 Management regularly adjusts our investments in liquid assets based upon an assessment of expected loan demand, expected deposit flows, yields available on interest-earning deposits and securities, and the objectives of our liquidity management, interest-rate risk and investment policies. 
 
 Our most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents followed by available-for-sale securities. The levels of these assets depend on our operating, financing, lending and investing activities during any given period. At June 30, 2024, cash and cash equivalents totaled 83.2 million and unpledged securities classified as available-for-sale had a market value of 266.7 million. The Bank pledged collateral of 578.4 million to support borrowings from the FHLB, with a remaining borrowing capacity of 257.6 million at June 30, 2024. The Bank also has an established discount window borrowing arrangement with the FRB, for which available-for-sale securities with a market value of 17.8 million were pledged as of June 30, 2024, providing a borrowing capacity of 17.0 million. First Northwest has a 20.0 million borrowing arrangement with NexBank which is secured by First Northwest's personal property assets (with certain exclusions), including all the outstanding shares of First Fed, cash, loans receivable, and limited partnership investments. The remaining borrowing capacity of the NexBank line of credit was 17.0 million at June 30, 2024.

Table of Contents 

At June 30, 2024, we had 2.9 million in commitments to originate new loans, 3.8 million in standby letters of credit and 155.0 million in undisbursed loans, including 51.2 million in undisbursed construction loan commitments and 1.6 million in undisbursed maritime fabrication loan commitments. 
 
 CDs due within one year as of June 30, 2024, totaled 482.4 million, or 77.6 of CDs with a weighted-average rate of 4.42 . If these maturing deposits are not renewed, we will seek other sources of funds, including other CDs, non-maturity deposits, and borrowings. We can attract and retain deposits by adjusting the interest rates offered and through sales and marketing efforts in the markets we serve. Depending on market conditions, we may be required to pay higher rates on such deposits or other borrowings than we currently pay on CDs. We believe that our branch network, and the general cash flows from our existing lending and investment activities, will provide adequate short-term and long-term liquidity. For additional information, see the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in Item 1 of this Form 10-Q/A. 
 
 First Fed has a diversified deposit base with approximately 57 of deposit account balances held by consumers, 30 held by business and public fund depositors, and 13 in brokered deposits. The average deposit account balance, excluding brokered and public fund accounts, was 28,000 at June 30, 2024. We estimate that 20-25 of our retail customer deposit balances are over the 250,000 FDIC insurance limit, representing less than 5 of deposit customers. Management believes that maintaining a diversified deposit base is an important factor in managing and maintaining adequate levels of liquidity. 
 
 The Company is a separate legal entity from the Bank and provides for its own liquidity. At June 30, 2024, the Company, on an unconsolidated basis, had liquid assets of 723,000. In addition to its operating expenses, the Company is responsible for paying dividends declared, if any, to its shareholders, and for Company stock repurchases, interest payments on subordinated notes held at the Company level, payments on the NexBank revolving credit facility, and commitments to limited partnership investments. The Company may receive dividends or capital distributions from the Bank, although there may be regulatory limitations on the ability of the Bank to pay dividends. 
 
 Capital Resources 
 
 At June 30, 2024, shareholders' equity totaled 158.9 million, or 7.2 of total assets. Our book value per share of common stock was 16.81 at June 30, 2024, compared to 16.99 at December 31, 2023. 
 
 At June 30, 2024, the Bank exceeded all regulatory capital requirements and was considered "well capitalized" under FDIC regulatory capital guidelines. 
 
 The following table provides the capital requirements and actual results for First Fed at June 30, 2024 (restated).

Effect of Inflation and Changing Prices 
 
 The consolidated financial statements and related financial data presented in this report have been prepared according to GAAP, which require the measurement of financial and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The primary impact of inflation on our operations is reflected in increased operating costs and the effect that general inflation may have on both short-term and long-term interest rates. Unlike companies in many other industries, virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution's performance than do general levels of inflation. Although inflation expectations do affect interest rates, interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 
 There has not been any material change in the market risk disclosures contained in the 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 This Item has been restated to reflect the changes described in the Explanatory Note and in Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 1 of this Form 10-Q/A. 
 
 (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. 
 
 An evaluation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act")) was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's Chief Executive Officer (Principal Executive Officer), Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial and Accounting Officer), and other members of the Company's management team as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report. The Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of June 30, 2024, the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were not effective in ensuring that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is (i) accumulated and communicated to the Company's management (including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer) in a timely manner, and (ii) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms, as a result of the material weakness described below. 
 
 (b) Changes in Internal Controls. 
 
 The Company has evaluated the effect of the facts leading to the restatement of the financial statements herein for the interim period ended June 30, 2024. Management has concluded that a material weakness existed in the design of controls over the timely recognition of changes in value of collateral-dependent individually evaluated loans and the methodology used to evaluate loans that possess characteristics distinct from existing loan groups evaluated on a pooled basis within the portfolio and, thus, in the determination of the adequacy of its allowance for credit losses on loans. It was further determined that such material weakness does not exist in the remainder of the loan portfolio. 
 
 Management, with oversight from the Company's Audit Committee, is committed to remediating the foregoing material weakness and has prepared a remediation plan including: 
 - Revising the Bank's loan-related policies, 
 - Strengthening an existing internal control to improve the identification and accounting for individually evaluated assets, and 
 - Strengthening an existing internal control to improve the evaluation of pooled loan groups utilized in the Current Expected Credit Loss model. 
 
 Except as described above, there have been no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended June 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. 

64

Table of Contents 

The Company intends to continually review and evaluate the design and effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures and to improve its controls and procedures over time and to correct any deficiencies that it may discover in the future. The goal is to ensure that senior management has timely access to all material financial and non-financial information concerning the Company's business. While the Company believes the present design of its disclosure controls and procedures is effective to achieve its goal, future events affecting its business may cause the Company to modify its disclosure controls and procedures. The Company does not expect that its disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting will prevent every error or instance of fraud. A control procedure, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control procedure are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control procedures, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns in controls or procedures can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. The design of any control procedure is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control procedure, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 
 From time to time, the Company is engaged in legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business, none of which are currently considered to have a material impact on the Company s financial position or results of operations. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 This Item has been restated to reflect the changes described in the Explanatory Note and in Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 1 of this Form 10-Q/A. 
 
 Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors set forth in Part I. Item 1A of the Company's 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 The Company has identified a material weakness in its internal controls and cannot provide assurances that this weakness will be effectively remediated or that additional material weaknesses will not occur in the future. 
 
 The Company s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act, which is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. 
 
 Management of the Company concluded that a material weakness in the Company s internal control over financial reporting existed as of June 30, 2024. Specifically, the Company did not maintain effective controls over the timely recognition of changes in value of collateral-dependent individually evaluated loans and the methodology used to evaluate loans that possess characteristics distinct from existing loan groups evaluated on a pooled basis within the portfolio and, thus, in the determination of the adequacy of its allowance for credit losses on loans. Although the Company is taking steps to remediate the material weakness, it cannot provide assurance that such remedial measures will be effective. If the Company fails to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, it may not be able to accurately report its financial results, which may, among other adverse consequences, cause investors to lose confidence in the Company s reported financial information.
