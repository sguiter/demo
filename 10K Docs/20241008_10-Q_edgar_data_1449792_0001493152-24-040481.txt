 Notes
to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements for the Quarterly Period Ended June 30, 2024 

 (in
thousands, except for share and per share amounts) 

reportable segments as defined in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (the SEC on July 26, 2024: Electrical Infrastructure Equipment Electrical Infrastructure and Critical Power Solutions Critical Power ). 

Presentation 

The
accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared pursuant to the rules of the SEC and
reflect the accounts of the Company as of June 30, 2024. Certain information and footnote disclosures, normally included in annual financial
statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States U.S. GAAP ), have
been condensed or omitted pursuant to those rules and regulations. We believe that the disclosures made are adequate to make the information
presented not misleading to the reader. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments,
necessary to fairly state the financial position, results of operations and cash flows with respect to the interim consolidated financial
statements have been included. The results of operations for the interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results for the
entire fiscal year. The year-end balance sheet data was derived from audited consolidated financial statements but this filing does not
include all disclosures required by U.S. GAAP for a year-end balance sheet. 

All
dollar amounts (except share and per share data) presented in the notes to our unaudited interim consolidated financial statements are
stated in thousands of dollars, unless otherwise noted. ASC 740-270 requires the use of an estimated annual effective tax rate to compute
the tax provision during an interim period unless certain exceptions are met. We have used a discrete-period computation method to calculate
taxes for the fiscal six-month period ended June 30, 2024. The Company anticipates that its annual effective tax rate will be 
for the year ending December 31, 2024. As of June 30, 2024, the Company continues to provide a 
valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets since the Company believes it is more likely than not that its deferred tax assets
will not be realized. 

These
unaudited interim consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Pioneer and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 

These
unaudited interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the risk factors under the heading Part
II - Item 1A. Risk Factors and the risk factors and the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto of the Company
and its subsidiaries included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

Liquidity 

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of
assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. As shown in the accompanying consolidated financial
statements, as of June 30, 2024, the Company had 
of cash on hand and working capital of .
The cash on hand was generated primarily from the sale of common stock under the ATM Program (as defined below), payment of all
unpaid principal and interest from the two subordinated promissory notes we received in connection with the sale of the transformer
business units in August 2019 for an aggregate principal amount of 
(the Seller Notes during the year ended December 31, 2022, and cash flows from operating activities. On October 20,
2020, we entered into an At the Market Sale Agreement with H.C. Wainwright Co., LLC Wainwright ), pursuant to
which we may offer and sell our shares of common stock from time to time through Wainwright, acting as sales agent or principal (the
 ATM Program ). Since October 20, 2020, and through June 30, 2024, the Company sold an aggregate of 
shares of common stock for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately ,
before any sales agent fees and expenses payable by us under the ATM Program. During the six months ended June 30, 2024, the Company
sold an aggregate of 
shares of common stock for an aggregate consideration of approximately ,
before any sales agent fees and expenses payable by the Company under the ATM Program. As of June 30, 2024, 
of common stock remained available for issuance under the ATM Program. 

The
Company has historically met its cash needs through a combination of cash flows from operating activities and bank borrowings, the
completion of the sale of the transformer business units in August 2019, sale of common stock under the ATM Program and collecting
all unpaid principal and interest from the Seller Notes. Historically, the Company s cash requirements were generally for
operating activities, debt repayment, capital improvements and acquisitions. The Company expects to meet its cash needs with the
working capital and cash flows from the Company s operating activities. The Company expects its cash requirements to be
generally for operating activities, product development and capital improvements. The Company expects that its current cash balance
is sufficient to fund operations for the next twelve months from the date our unaudited interim consolidated financial statements
are issued. 

Risks
and Uncertainties 

The
continuing impacts of the rising interest rates, inflation, changes in foreign currency exchange rates and geopolitical developments,
such as the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas, have resulted, and may continue
to result, in a global slowdown of economic activity, which may decrease demand for a broad variety of goods and services, including
those provided by the Company s clients, while also disrupting supply channels, sales channels and advertising and marketing activities
for an unknown period of time. As a result of the current uncertainty in economic activity, the Company is unable to predict the potential
size and duration of the impact on its revenue and its results of operations, if any. The extent of the potential impact of these macroeconomic
factors on the Company s operational and financial performance will depend on a variety of factors, including the extent of geopolitical
disruption and its impact on the Company s clients, partners, industry, and employees, all of which are uncertain at this time
and cannot be accurately predicted. The Company continues to monitor the effects of these macroeconomic factors and intends to take steps
deemed appropriate to limit the impact on its business. During the six months ended June 30, 2024, the Company was able to operate substantially
at capacity. 

There
can be no assurance that precautionary measures, whether adopted by the Company or imposed by others, will be effective, and such measures
could negatively affect its sales, marketing, and client service efforts, delay and lengthen its sales cycles, decrease its employees ,
clients , or partners productivity, or create operational or other challenges, any of which could harm its business and
results of operations. 

Contract
Estimates 

Revenue
from over time contracts is recognized proportionally over the term of the contract using an input method based on the proportion of
labor hours incurred as compared to the total estimated labor hours for the fixed-fee contract performance obligations, which the Company
considers the best available indicator of the pattern and timing in which contract performance obligations are fulfilled and control
transfers to the customer. This percentage is multiplied by the contracted dollar amount of the project to determine the amount of revenue
to recognize in an accounting period. 

There
are situations where the number of hours to complete projects may exceed the original estimate as a result of an increase in project
scope or unforeseen events. The related impact on income is recognized using the cumulative catch-up method, which the Company recognizes
in the current period. 

Recognition
of revenue on a contract requires estimates of the total labor hours at completion and the measurement of progress towards completion.
Due to the long-term nature of many of the Company s contracts, developing the estimated total labor hours at completion often
requires judgment. Factors that must be considered in estimating the total labor hours to be completed include the nature and complexity
of the work to be performed and the risk and impact of delayed performance. 

At
the outset of each contract, the Company gauges its complexity and perceived risks and establish an estimated total number of labor hours
at completion in line with these expectations. The Company follows a standard contract review process in which the Company reviews the
progress and performance on its ongoing contracts at least quarterly. 

and of reserves for expected credit losses as of June 30, 2024, and December
31, 2023, respectively. 

3) Determine
the transaction price 

The
transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which the Company will be entitled in exchange for transferring products
or services to the customer. The customer payments are generally due in 30 days. 

4) Allocate
the transaction price to performance obligations in the contract 

If
the contract contains a single performance obligation, the entire transaction price is allocated to the single performance obligation.
Contracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation
based on a relative standalone selling price basis. The Company determines standalone selling price based on the price at which the performance
obligation is sold separately. If the standalone selling price is not observable through past transactions, the Company estimates the
standalone selling price taking into account available information such as market conditions and internally approved pricing guidelines
related to the performance obligations. 

5) Recognize
revenue when or as the Company satisfies a performance obligation 

The
Company satisfies performance obligations either over time or at a point in time. Revenue is recognized at the time the related performance
obligation is satisfied by transferring a promised product or service to a customer. 

During
the three months ended June 30, 2024, the Company recognized of revenue over time, as compared to during the three months
ended June 30, 2023. Additionally, the Company recognized and of revenue at a point in time from the sale of our products

as services are delivered. The Company recognized and of service revenue during the three months ended June 30, 2024, and
June 30, 2023, respectively.

June 30, 2023, that was classified as deferred revenue as of December 31, 2022, resulting primarily from the progress made on the various
active contracts during the respective reporting periods. 

The
Company manages its accounts receivable credit risk by performing credit evaluations and monitoring amounts due from the Company s
customers. The Company had certain customers whose revenue individually represented 10 or more of the Company s total revenue,
or whose accounts receivable balances individually represented 10 or more of the Company s total accounts receivable. 

As
of June 30, 2024, one customer represented approximately of the Company s accounts receivable. As of December 31, 2023, one

Return
of a product requires that the buyer obtain permission in writing from the Company. When the buyer requests authorization to return material
for reasons of their own, the buyer will be charged for placing the returned goods in saleable condition, restocking charges and for
any outgoing and incoming transportation paid by the Company. The Company warrants title to the products, and warrants the products on
date of shipment to the buyer, to be of the kind and quality described in the contract, merchantable, and free of defects in workmanship
and material. Returns and warranties during the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, and June 30, 2023, were insignificant.

The
following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the accompanying
unaudited consolidated interim financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and with
our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on July
26, 2024. 

Unless
the context requires otherwise, references in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to the Company, Pioneer, 
 we, our and us refer to Pioneer Power Solutions, Inc. and its subsidiaries.

Special
Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 

This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements, which include information relating to future events,
future financial performance, financial projections, strategies, expectations, competitive environment and regulation. Words such as
 may, should, could, would, predicts, potential, continue, 
 expects, anticipates, future, intends, plans, believes, 
 estimates, and similar expressions, as well as statements in future tense, identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking
statements should not be read as a guarantee of future performance or results and may not be accurate indications of when such performance
or results will be achieved. Forward-looking statements are based on information we have when those statements are made or management s
good faith belief as of that time with respect to future events, and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual performance
or results to differ materially from those expressed in or suggested by the forward-looking statements. Important factors that could
cause such differences include, but are not limited to: 

General
 economic conditions and their effect on demand for electrical equipment, particularly in the commercial construction market, but
 also in the power generation, industrial production and infrastructure industries. 

The
 effects of fluctuations in sales on our business, revenues, expenses, net income (loss), income (loss) per share, margins and profitability. 

Many
 of our competitors are better established and have significantly greater resources and may subsidize their competitive offerings
 with other products and services, which may make it difficult for us to attract and retain customers. 

The
 potential loss or departure of key personnel, including Nathan J. Mazurek, our chairman, president and chief executive officer. 

Our
 ability to generate internal growth, maintain market acceptance of our existing products and gain acceptance for our new products. 

Unanticipated
 increases in raw material prices or disruptions in supply could increase production costs and adversely affect our profitability. 

Our
 ability to realize revenue reported in our backlog. 

Our
 ability to remediate the material weaknesses identified in our internal control over financial reporting in our Annual Report on
 Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, or inability to otherwise maintain an effective system of internal control. 

The
 effect that the restatement of the prior financial statements could have on investor confidence in us and raise reputational risk. 

Operating
 margin risk due to competitive pricing and operating efficiencies, supply chain risk, material, labor or overhead cost increases,
 interest rate risk and commodity risk. 

Strikes
 or labor disputes with our employees may adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. 

The
 impact of geopolitical activity on the economy, changes in government regulations such as income taxes, climate control initiatives,
 the timing or strength of an economic recovery in our markets and our ability to access capital markets. 

Material
 weaknesses in internal controls. 

Future
 sales of large blocks of our common stock may adversely impact our stock price. 

The
 liquidity and trading volume of our common stock. 

Our
 business could be adversely affected by an outbreak of disease, epidemic or pandemic, such as the global coronavirus pandemic, or
 similar public threat, or fear of such an event. 

Our
 ability to regain and maintain compliance with the continued listing standards of Nasdaq. 

Risks
 associated with litigation and claims, which could impact our financial results and condition. 

15 

The foregoing does not represent an exhaustive list of matters that may be covered by the forward-looking statements contained
herein or risk factors that we are faced with that may cause our actual results to differ from those anticipated in our forward-looking
statements. Moreover, new risks regularly emerge, and it is not possible for us to predict or articulate all risks we face, nor can we
assess the impact of all risks on our business or the extent to which any risk, or combination of risks, may cause actual results to
differ from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Except to the extent required by applicable laws or rules, we undertake
no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
You should review carefully the risks and uncertainties described under the heading Part II - Item 1A. Risk Factors in
this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Part I - Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2023, for a discussion of the foregoing and other risks that relate to our business and investing in shares of our common
stock.

Backlog 

Our
backlog is based on firm orders from our customers expected to be delivered in the future, most of which is expected to occur during
the next twelve months. Backlog may vary significantly from reporting period to reporting period due to the timing of customer commitments.
Backlog reflects the amount of revenue we expect to realize upon the shipment of customer orders for our products that are not yet complete
or for which work has not yet begun. As of June 30, 2024, backlog from our E-Bloc power systems and related equipment was approximately
 12,523, or 19 of the total backlog.

and an unfavorable sales mix in the service business. 

General
Corporate Expense . Our general corporate expenses consist primarily of executive management, corporate accounting and human resources
personnel, corporate office expenses, financing and corporate development activities, payroll and benefits administration, treasury,
tax compliance, legal, stock-based compensation, public reporting costs and costs not specifically allocated to reportable business segments. 

During
the three months ended June 30, 2024, our unallocated corporate overhead expense decreased by 556, or 33.1 , as compared to the three
months ended June 30, 2023, primarily due to a decrease in stock-based compensation expense. 

During
the six months ended June 30, 2024, our unallocated corporate overhead expense decreased by 140, or 5.8 , as compared to the six months
ended June 30, 2023, primarily due to a decrease in stock-based compensation expense. 

21 

Non-Operating
(Income) Expense 

Interest
Income . For the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, we had interest income of approximately 17 and 48, respectively, as compared
to interest income of approximately 79 and 132, respectively, during the three and six months ended June 30, 2023. We generated the
majority of our interest income from our cash on hand during the six months ended June 30, 2024, and 2023. 

Other
Expense (Income) . Other expense (income) in the consolidated statements of operations reports certain gains and losses associated
with activities not directly related to our core operations. 

For
the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, other non-operating income was 0 and 40, respectively, as compared to other non-operating
expense of 20 and 7, respectively, during the three and six months ended June 30, 2023. 

Provision
for Income Taxes . Our effective income tax rate for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, and 2023 was 0.0 . 

Net
Loss (Income) per Share 

We
generated a net loss of 2,283 during the three months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to net income of 848 during the three months
ended June 30, 2023. 

Our
net loss per basic and diluted share for the three months ended June 30, 2024, was 0.21, as compared to net income per basic share of 0.09 and net income per diluted share of 0.08 for the three months ended June 30, 2023. 

We
generated a net loss of 3,318 during the six months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to net income of 1,590 during the six months ended
June 30, 2023. 

Our
net loss per basic and diluted share for the six months ended June 30, 2024, was 0.32, as compared to net income per basic share of 0.16 and net income per diluted share of 0.15 for the six months ended June 30, 2023. 

LIQUIDITY
AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

General .
On October 20, 2020, we entered into an At the Market Sale Agreement with H.C. Wainwright Co., LLC Wainwright ),
pursuant to which we may offer and sell our shares of common stock from time to time through Wainwright, acting as sales agent or principal
(the ATM Program ). As of June 30, 2024, the Company had 6,512 of cash on hand generated primarily from the sale of common
stock under the ATM Program. Since October 20, 2020, and through June 30, 2024, the Company sold an aggregate of 1,835,616 shares of
common stock for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately 14,051, before any sales agent fees and expenses payable by us under the
ATM Program. During the six months ended June 30, 2024, the Company sold an aggregate of 919,557 shares of common stock for an aggregate
consideration of approximately 5,147, before any sales agent fees and expenses payable by the Company under the ATM Program. As of June
30, 2024, 69,853 of common stock remained available for issuance under the ATM Program. 

The
continuing impacts of the rising interest rates, inflation, changes in foreign currency exchange rates and geopolitical developments,
such as the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas, have resulted, and may continue
to result, in a global slowdown of economic activity, which may decrease demand for a broad variety of goods and services, including
those provided by our clients, while also disrupting supply channels, sales channels and advertising and marketing activities for an
unknown period of time. As a result of the current uncertainty in economic activity, we are unable to predict the potential size and
duration of the impact on our revenue and our results of operations, if any. The extent of the potential impact of these macroeconomic
factors on our operational and financial performance will depend on a variety of factors, including the extent of geopolitical disruption
and its impact on our clients, partners, industry, and employees, all of which are uncertain at this time and cannot be accurately predicted.
We continue to monitor the effects of these macroeconomic factors and intends to take steps deemed appropriate to limit the impact on
our business. During the six months ended June 30, 2024, we were able to operate substantially at capacity. 

There
can be no assurance that precautionary measures, whether adopted by us or imposed by others, will be effective, and such measures could
negatively affect our sales, marketing, and client service efforts, delay and lengthen our sales cycles, decrease our employees ,
clients , or partners productivity, or create operational or other challenges, any of which could harm our business and
results of operations. 

Cash
(Used in)/ Provided by Operating Activities . Cash used in our operating activities was 1,379 during the six months ended June 30,
2024, as compared to cash provided by operating activities of 366 during the six months ended June 30, 2023. The
increase in cash used in operating activities is primarily due to the increase in our net loss and working capital fluctuations. 

22 

Cash
Used in Investing Activities. Cash used in investing activities during the six months ended June 30, 2024, was 614, as compared
to 810 during the six months ended June 30, 2023. Additions to property and equipment during the six months ended June 30, 2024, were
 614, as compared to 810 of additions during the six months ended June 30, 2023. 

Cash
Provided by/ (Used in) Financing Activities. Cash provided by our financing activities was 4,923 during the six months ended June
30, 2024, as compared to cash used in financing activities of 228 during the six months ended June 30, 2023. The increase in cash provided
by financing activities is primarily due to the sale of common stock under the ATM Program. 

Working
Capital . As of June 30, 2024, we had working capital of 11,140, including 6,512 of cash on hand, compared to working capital of
 9,421, including 3,582 of cash on hand as of December 31, 2023. 

Assessment
of Liquidity . As of June 30, 2024, we had 6,512 of cash on hand generated primarily from the sale of common stock under the ATM
Program. We have historically met our cash needs through a combination of cash flows from operating activities and bank borrowings, the
completion of the sale of the transformer business units in August 2019, sale of common stock under the ATM Program and collecting all
unpaid principal and interest from the Seller Notes. Historically, our cash requirements were generally for operating activities, debt
repayment, capital improvements and acquisitions. 

We
expect to meet our cash needs with our working capital and cash flows from operating activities. We expect our cash requirements to be
generally for operating activities, capital improvements and product development. We expect that product development and promotional
activities related to our new initiatives will continue in the near future and we expect to continue to incur costs related to such activities.
We expect that our cash balance is sufficient to fund operations for the next twelve months from the date our unaudited consolidated
financial statements are issued. 

As
of June 30, 2024, we had no off-balance sheet transactions, arrangements, obligations (including contingent obligations), or other relationships
with unconsolidated entities or other persons that had, or that may have, a material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial
condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 

Capital
Expenditures 

The
Company had 614 of additions to property and equipment during the six months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to 810 of additions to
property and equipment during the six months ended June 30, 2023. 

Known
Trends, Events, Uncertainties and Factors That May Affect Future Operations 

We
believe that our future operating results will continue to be subject to quarterly variations based upon a wide variety of factors, including
the cyclical nature of the electrical equipment industry and the markets for our products and services. Our operating results could also
be impacted by changing customer requirements and exposure to fluctuations in prices of important raw supplies, such as copper, steel
and aluminum. We have various insurance policies, including cybersecurity, covering risks in amounts that we consider adequate. In addition
to these measures, we attempt to recover other cost increases through improvements to our manufacturing efficiency and through increases
in prices where competitively feasible. Lastly, other economic conditions we cannot foresee may affect customer demand. In addition,
the consequences of the ongoing geopolitical conflicts, such as the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the ongoing conflict
between Israel and Hamas, including related sanctions and countermeasures, and the effects of rising global inflation, are difficult
to predict, and could adversely impact geopolitical and macroeconomic conditions, the global economy, and contribute to increased market
volatility, which may in turn adversely affect our business and operations. We predominately sell to customers in the industrial production
and commercial construction markets. Accordingly, changes in the condition of any of our customers may have a greater impact than if
our sales were more evenly distributed between different end markets. For a further discussion of factors that may affect future operating
results see the sections entitled Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q
and Part I - Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K.

 Not

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our
management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO ),
evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), as of June 30, 2024. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed
to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act
is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosures, and is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms.
Based on this evaluation, and as a result of the material weaknesses described below, our CEO and CFO have concluded that our disclosure
controls and procedures were not effective as of June 30, 2024. In light of this determination, our management has performed additional
analyses, reconciliations, and other post-closing procedures and has concluded that, notwithstanding the material weakness in our internal
control over financial reporting, the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements for the periods covered by and included
in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q fairly state, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash
flows for the periods presented in conformity with U.S. GAAP. 

Material
Weaknesses in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

A
material weakness, as defined in the standards established by Sarbanes-Oxley, is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal
control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated
financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 

Internal
control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The following material weaknesses in our internal control over
financial reporting were present as of December 31, 2023, and continued to exist as of June 30, 2024: 

The
 Company did not maintain effective controls over the revenue recognition of over-time contracts and associated costs. The Company s
 underlying estimates of total labor hours required to complete over-time contracts were materially different from the actual labor
 hours required, which was determined to represent an error, and, as a result, the percentage of completion used to recognize revenue
 was materially different from the percentage of completion using actual labor hours incurred. Additionally, the Company did not properly
 account for recognition of costs incurred by contract. This material weakness resulted in the restatement of the
 Company s consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022, as well as its interim consolidated financial
 statements for the three months ended March 31, 2022, and 2023, the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, and 2023 and the three
 and nine months ended September 30, 2022, and 2023. 

The
 Company did not design and maintain effective controls over the accounting for inventory and related cost of sales, primarily due
 to the lack of an automated tracking system and the manual nature of its current processes and controls surrounding inventory. Specifically,
 we did not design and maintain effective controls over (1) complete and accurate inventory costing, including recording inventoriable
 costs at the lower of cost and net realizable value, (2) cycle count procedures and inventory system changes, which occur without
 proper review and documentation and (3) proper segregation of duties. 

The
 Company has a lack of sufficient accounting personnel with the necessary skills, knowledge, and expertise. This deficiency impacts
 our ability to ensure appropriate segregation of duties, and to accurately and timely close, consolidate and prepare financial statements
 as required to maintain compliance with reporting deadlines under applicable SEC regulations. 

Management s
Plan to Remediate the Material Weaknesses 

The
Company is implementing enhancements to its internal controls to remediate the identified material weaknesses in its internal control
over financial reporting. Specifically, the Company has: 

engaged
 external third parties for assistance as needed; 

initiated
 a review and update of significant accounting policies, procedures, and controls; and 

begun
 additional training for its accounting and financial reporting personnel. 

Additionally,
the Company plans to hire additional accounting and finance personnel with the requisite skills, knowledge and expertise to address identified
control deficiencies. 

The
Company is committed to maintaining a strong internal control environment and believes these remediation efforts will represent significant
improvements in its controls over the control environment. These steps will take time to be fully implemented and confirmed to be effective
and sustainable. Additional controls may also be required over time. While the Company believes that these efforts will improve its internal
control over financial reporting, the Company will not be able to conclude whether the steps the Company is taking will remediate the
material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting until a sufficient period of time has passed to allow management to
test the design and operational effectiveness of the new and enhanced controls. Until the remediation steps set forth above are fully
implemented and tested, the material weaknesses described above will continue to exist. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Other
than described above, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three
months ended June 30, 2024, that have materially affected, or that are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
over financial reporting.

PART
II OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM
1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

From
time to time, we may become involved in lawsuits, investigations and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. 

On
June 15, 2023, Terrence and Kay Mimick (the Plaintiffs filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court, District of Nebraska
naming the Company, its wholly-owned subsidiary, Pioneer Critical Power, Inc., and an individual acting in his capacity as an employee
of the Company, collectively as defendants. Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on July 7, 2023, alleging negligent driving, negligent
entrustment, and negligent hiring, training and supervision, as a result of a car accident that occurred on September 9, 2019, and seeking
special damages related to the injuries allegedly sustained by Plaintiffs. The amended complaint also named Titan Energy Systems, Inc.
as a defendant instead of Pioneer Critical Power, Inc. On July 27, 2023, the defendants filed an Answer to Plaintiff s Amended
Complaint. On October 6, 2023, a mediation was held, but the parties did not reach a settlement. In June 2024, another mediation was
held and the parties reached a settlement for all of the Plaintiffs claims. The case was dismissed with prejudice on July 23, 2024. 

As
of the date hereof, we are not aware of or a party to any other legal proceedings to which we or any of our subsidiaries is a party or
to which any of our property is subject, nor are we aware of any such threatened or pending litigation or any such proceedings known
to be contemplated by governmental authorities that we believe could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition
or operating results. 

We
can give no assurance that any other lawsuits or claims brought in the future will not have an adverse effect on our financial condition,
liquidity or operating results. 

We
are not aware of any material proceedings in which any of our directors, officers or affiliates or any registered or beneficial shareholder
of more than 5 of our common stock is an adverse party or has a material interest adverse to our interest. 

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS 

A
description of the risks associated with our business, financial condition and results of operations is set forth in Item 1A.
Risk Factors of our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission on July 26, 2024, and are supplemented with the following revised risk factors: 

We
may not meet the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq, which could result in a delisting of our common stock. 

As
previously disclosed, on April 18, 2024, we received a notice (the 10-K Notice from the Listing Qualifications staff of
Nasdaq (the Staff notifying us that as we had not yet filed our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December
31, 2023 (the Form 10-K ), we no longer complied with Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) for continued listing on Nasdaq (the Listing
Rule ). On May 24, 2024, we received an additional notice from Nasdaq notifying us that as we had not yet filed our Form 10-Q for
the quarter ended March 31, 2024 (the Q1 10-Q ), and because we remained delinquent in filing the Form 10-K, we did not
comply with the Listing Rule. On July 26, 2024, we filed the Form 10-K with the SEC and are now in compliance with such filing. 

On
August 21, 2024, we received a notice from Nasdaq notifying us that as we had not yet filed our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June
30, 2024 (the Q2 10-Q , and together with the Q1 10-Q, the Delinquent Filings ), we were not in compliance
with the Listing Rule. We previously submitted a plan to Nasdaq (the Plan on June 17, 2024, to regain compliance with
respect to the Delinquent Filings and Nasdaq granted an exception until September 20, 2024, to file the Delinquent Filings. Pursuant
to the notice we received on August 21, 2024, we were required to submit an update to the Plan to Nasdaq by September 5, 2024, to regain
compliance. We submitted an update to the Plan to Nasdaq on September 5, 2024, and we filed the Q1 10-Q on September 10, 2024. On September
19, 2024, Nasdaq granted us an additional exception of up to a maximum of 180 calendar days from the prescribed filing due date of the
Form 10-K to file the Q2 10-Q, or until October 14, 2024, to regain compliance. In the event we do not satisfy these terms, the Staff
will provide written notification that our securities will be delisted. At that time, we may appeal the Staff s determination to
a hearings panel. 

Although
we expect to take actions intended to restore our compliance with the listing requirements, we can provide no assurance that any action
taken by us would be successful. 

25 

If
our common stock is delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market, we expect that our common stock would begin trading on the over-the-counter
markets. The delisting of our common stock could result in a reduction in our trading price and would substantially limit the liquidity
of our common stock. In addition, delisting could materially adversely impact our ability to raise capital or pursue strategic restructuring,
refinancing or other transactions. Delisting from the Nasdaq Capital Market could also have other negative results, including the potential
loss of confidence by institutional investors. 

We
currently derive a significant portion of our revenues from two customers. Material or significant loss of business from these customers
could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. 

We
depend on two customers for a large portion of our business, and any change in the level of orders from these customers could have a
significant impact on our results of operations. Approximately 10 of our sales during the three months ended June 30, 2024, were made
to one customer and approximately 16 of our sales during the six months ended June 30, 2024, were made to another customer. Loss of
business from these customers could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. The majority of
our sales to these customers were made pursuant to contract terms and conditions for each project.
