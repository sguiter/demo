CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 
 Certain statements in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q (this report may constitute forward-looking statements for purposes of 
 the federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our and our management team s expectations, hopes, beliefs, intentions or strategies regarding the future. In addition, any statements that refer to 
 projections, forecasts or other characterizations of future events or circumstances, including any underlying assumptions, are forward-looking statements. The words anticipate, believe, continue, could, estimate, expect, intends, may, might, plan, possible, potential, predict, project, should, will, would and similar expressions may identify forward-looking 
 statements, but the absence of these words does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. Forward-looking statements in this report may include, for example, statements about: 
 our ability to access sources of capital to finance operations and growth; 

our financial and business performance, including our financial projections and business metrics; 

our ability to grow market share in our existing markets or any new markets we may enter through sales and marketing investments or otherwise; 

our ability to improve unit economics and increase the number, variety and density of supply of cars across our marketplace; 

changes in our strategy, future operations, financial position, estimated revenues and losses, forecasts, projected costs, prospects and plans; 

the implementation and effects of our restructuring plans; 

expectations regarding the time during which we will be an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act; 

our ability to retain or recruit officers, key employees and directors; 

the impact of the regulatory environment and complexities with compliance related to such environment; 

our ability to maintain and enhance our platform, marketplace and brand, and to attract hosts and guests; 

the expected costs associated with our research and development initiatives, including investments in technology and product development; 

our ability to maintain and enhance our value proposition to hosts and guests; 

our ability to fulfill our mission, including achieving our goals of reducing pollution and emissions, creating income-generating opportunities available to underrepresented communities and facilitating mobility alternatives; 

our ability to manage, develop and refine our platform, including our dynamic pricing and contactless experience; 

our ability to grow our supply of connected cars through our OEM and other strategic relationships with third parties; 

the continuing impact of global, national or regional events on our business, the transportation industry, travel trends, and the global economy generally; 

our ability to realize the expected benefits of the 2023 Business Combination (as defined below) and the acquisition of the HyreCar business; and 

other risks and uncertainties described in this report, including those under the section entitled Risk Factors . 

The forward-looking statements contained in this report are based on our current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effects on our business. There can be no assurance that future developments affecting our business will be those that we have anticipated. These forward-looking statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties (some of which are beyond our control) or other assumptions that may cause actual results or performance to be materially different from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those factors described in the section entitled Risk Factors . Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time and it is not possible for us to predict all such risk factors, nor can we assess the effect of all such risk factors on our business or the extent to which any factor or combination of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should any of the assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary in material respects from those projected in these forward-looking statements. 
 
 The forward-looking statements made by us in this report speak only as of the date of this report. Except to the extent required under the federal securities laws and rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ), we disclaim any 
 1 

obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. In light of these risks and uncertainties, there is no assurance that the events or results suggested by the forward-looking statements will in fact occur, and you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.

 million and million, respectively, in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents available to fund future operations. The Company s capital requirements will depend on many factors and the Company may need to use available capital resources and/or raise additional capital earlier than currently anticipated and will be required in the foreseeable future in order for the Company to continue as a going concern. When the Company pursues additional debt and/or equity financing, there can be no assurance that such financing will be available on terms commercially acceptable to the Company. If the Company is unable to obtain additional funding when needed, it will need to significantly reduce its spending, delay or cancel its planned activities, substantially change its corporate structure or curtail or discontinue its operations, which will likely have an unfavorable effect on the Company s ability to execute on its business plan, and have an adverse effect on its business, results of operations and future prospects. These matters raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue in existence as a going concern within one year after the date the financial statements are issued. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties.

All finite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis, which approximates the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are consumed. Approximately million of the acquired goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and is primarily attributable to intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition, including the assembled workforce of the acquired business, and expected synergies at the time of the acquisition.

Warrants The Company measures its warrant liability at fair value based on significant inputs not observable in the market, which caused them to be classified as Level 3 measurements within the fair value hierarchy. Changes in the fair value of the warrant liability related to updated assumptions and estimates were recognized as a warrant liability fair value adjustment within the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. The fair value of the warrant liability, as of September 30, 2024 was estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The significant unobservable inputs for the Monte Carlo model include the stock price, exercise price, risk-free rate of return, time to expiration, and the volatility. An increase or decrease in the unobservable inputs in isolation could result in a material increase or decrease in the estimated fair value. In the future, depending on the weight of evidence and valuation approaches used, these or other inputs may have a more significant impact on the estimated fair value.

Balance (end of period) 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and year ended December 31, 2023, the Company had no transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy of its assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value. Mudrick Convertible Notes and Mudrick Super Priority Note The Company measures its convertible promissory notes and the Mudrick Super Priority Note at fair value based on significant inputs not observable in the market, which caused them to be classified as Level 3 measurements within the fair value hierarchy. Changes in the fair value of the convertible promissory notes related to updated assumptions and estimates were recognized as a convertible promissory note fair value adjustment within the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. In determining the fair value of the Mudrick Convertible Notes and the Mudrick Super Priority Note as of September 30, 2024, the Company used a market-based approach. The valuation method utilized a negotiated discount rate and a market yield rate which are unobservable inputs. An increase or decrease in any of the unobservable inputs in isolation could result in a material increase or decrease in the estimated fair value. In the future, depending on the weight of evidence and valuation approaches used, these or other inputs may have a more significant impact on the estimated fair value.

. As of September 30, 2024, the Company does not have any finance leases. The effective termination date for the Lease was . The letter of credit originally issued in connection with the lease has been entirely drawn and there is no remaining balance on the letter of credit as of the date of the agreement. The Company had leasehold improvements and fixed assets at the Lease premises with net book values of million and thousand, respectively, that were surrendered to the Landlord. As a result of the Termination of Lease agreement, the Company was obligated for the following: Pay the Landlord million as partial payment of the termination fee, execute and deliver to the Landlord a Promissory Note of million, pay the Landlord all sublease rents, license fees, or other payments for occupancy of the premises, surrender and vacate the premises and surrender to the Landlord all existing tenant-owned furniture, fixtures, and equipment in the premises on the effective termination date, assign to Landlord all existing licenses and other occupancy agreements for any portion of the premises, and assign to Landlord all service contracts. The Company agreed to pay to the Landlord the aggregate sum of million Termination Fee ), consisting of the million fee payment noted above and the Promissory Note of million. The Company recognized a million net loss as a result of the Lease Termination. The Company elects not to apply the lease recognition requirements to its short-term leases. Accordingly, the Company recognizes lease payments related to short-term leases in the statements of operations and comprehensive loss on a straight-line basis over the lease term which has not changed from prior recognition. The Company is generally not able to readily determine the implicit rate in the lease and therefore uses the determined incremental borrowing rate at lease commencement to compute the present value of lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate represents an estimate of the market interest rate the Company would incur to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments on a collateralized basis over the term of a lease. When determining lease term, the Company considers renewal options that are reasonably certain to exercise and termination options that are reasonably certain to be exercised, in addition to the non-cancellable lease term.

 million, in exchange for the dismissal of all claims and counterclaims amongst the parties in connection with the civil suit and related cross complaint. The million settlement payment, less fees for legal services paid to counsel to the Company and other legal costs, resulted in a net payment to the Company of approximately million. Garfield Litigation In April of 2023, an action for attorneys fees and expenses was filed in the Court of Chancery for the State of Delaware against the Company (Garfield v. Getaround, Court of Chancery for the State of Delaware C.A. # 2023-0445-MTZ). The complaint alleges the plaintiff was a stockholder of InterPrivate II Acquisition Corp. IPVA who proposed certain amendments to IPVA s certificate of incorporation, which, if implemented, would enable IPVA to avoid violating provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law regarding corporate voting structures. The complaint further alleges such amendments were enacted in response to the plaintiff s notice, and the plaintiff is therefore entitled to receive an award of attorneys fees and expenses from the Company as IPVA s successor-in-interest, under the Court of Chancery's "corporate benefit" doctrine. On August 15, 2024 the parties reached a final settlement of this matter for an amount the Company does not consider to be material. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had accrued million and million, respectively, related to various pending claims and legal actions. The Company does not believe that a material loss in excess of these accrued amounts is reasonably possible. Indemnification The Company enters into standard indemnification arrangements in the ordinary course of business. Pursuant to these arrangements, the Company indemnifies, holds harmless and agrees to reimburse the indemnified parties for certain losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party. In some cases, the term of these indemnification agreements is perpetual. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these agreements is not determinable because it involves claims that may be made against the Company in the future but have not yet been made. The Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and officers that may require the Company to indemnify its directors and officers against liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers, other than liabilities

 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The Company's effective tax rate from continuing operations was for the nine months ending September 30, 2024 and for the nine months ending September 30, 2023. The Company's full allowance in the United States and various other foreign jurisdictions caused the quarterly effective tax rate to be different from the U.S. federal statutory tax rate. The Company s policy is to recognize interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax benefits as part of the income tax provision and include accrued interest and penalties with the related income tax liability on the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheets. To date, the Company has not recognized any interest and penalties in its condensed consolidated statements of operations, nor has it accrued for or made payments for interest and penalties. The Company has unrecognized tax benefits as of September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023.

As of September 30, 2024, our platform supports approximately 2.2 million unique guests and has approximately 66,000 active cars in more than 1,000 cities across 8 countries worldwide, including in the United States and across Europe.

 Notice of Delisting or Failure to Satisfy a Continued Listing Rule or Standard; Transfer of Listing . On July 9, 2024, Getaround, Inc. (the Company received notice the New York Stock Exchange NYSE suspended trading of its common stock on the NYSE effective immediately and started the process to delist the Company's common stock from the NYSE. The delisting process followed the NYSE s determination under Rule 802.01B of the NYSE Listed Company Manual that the Company did not meet the continued listing standard that requires listed companies to maintain an average global market capitalization of at least 15 million over a period of 30 consecutive trading days. The Company's common stock was formally delisted from listing and registration on NYSE effective August 16, 2024. The Company's common stock and public warrants are now quoted on the OTCQB Venture Market under the symbols "GETR" and "GETRW", respectively. 
 Going Concern. We have incurred cumulative losses from inception through September 30, 2024, and expect to incur additional losses for the foreseeable future. Our ability to fund our operations and capital expenditures beyond our current cash and cash equivalents resources will depend on our ability to generate cash from operating activities, which is subject to future operating performance, as well as general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other conditions, some of which may be beyond our control. We expect operating losses and negative cash flows to continue for the foreseeable future as we continue to develop and promote our platform, as well as to grow our user base through new markets. Our future capital requirements depend on many factors, including our needs to support our business growth, to respond to business opportunities, challenges or unforeseen circumstances, or for other reasons. As a result, if our current cash runway is insufficient for us to be able to achieve or maintain positive cash flow, we will be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us, or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital 
 29 

when desired, our business, results of operations, and financial condition would be adversely affected. These matters raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue in existence as a going concern within one year after the date the financial statements are issued. 
 Our Revenue Model 
 We operate a carsharing marketplace and generate revenue from fees charged to guests as well as subscriptions charged to hosts. A significant majority of our revenue in any period depends on a large number of Powerhosts, which we define as any host with three or more active cars in our marketplace. Getaround prices trips dynamically on the platform, leveraging our extensive data from the hundreds of millions of miles driven on our platform to intelligently price the risks of the trip, the market and the guest. 
 Our pricing system is designed to optimize each individual transaction value by balancing supply and demand information and utilizing dynamic pricing features that depend on multiple transaction attributes, such as trip length and location. The use of dynamic pricing features varies across geographies, as slightly different strategies are appropriate for different regions. In some geographies, all pricing is dynamically priced on a per trip basis, and varies by time of day, day of week, vehicle details, geography, historical demand and supply levels, among other factors. Hosts control the pricing of this model by setting a minimum daily rate for their vehicle, as well as other inputs such as the minimum trip duration. In other geographies, hosts have the option of using our pricing system to dynamically set prices on their vehicle, or to more specifically control prices directly on a per-day basis. If they choose to set per-day prices themselves, the system still provides personalized suggestions for pricing, based on a similar set of attributes and historical data as our fully dynamic model would do. Through these processes both the fee we charge the guest for usage of the vehicle subject to a booking, or the Trip Price, and in certain related fees, or Trip-related Fees, charged to the guest are capable of being set dynamically. Our pricing system also allows hosts in any geography to significantly increase their revenue yield by varying the Trip Price according to local supply and demand dynamics while Trip-related Fees, such as the booking fee and optional protection plans, are controlled by our pricing system based on a model that determines the risk profile of a trip, according to a number of risk factors such as lead time, trip duration, and an array of other factors. In some cases, prices for Trip-related Fees are set to offset the expected increased cost to the platform from riskier trips. Additionally, our dynamic pricing may improve revenue yield by incentivizing guests to book longer trips, thereby increasing the average order value and associated service revenue and host earnings. 
 The subscriptions that we charge to hosts vary by geography and typically include a Connect Subscription to access our connected car technology and may also include a Parking Subscription. Fees charged to hosts are independent of booking activity. 
 The revenue-generating components of a booked trip within our two-sided marketplace include: 
 Guests . For each trip on our platform, the amount we charge the guest consists of the Trip Price plus Trip-related Fees. The Trip Price and certain Trip-related Fees, such as a booking fee, are determined algorithmically at the time of booking while other fees may be charged during or after the trip, such as a toll fee or a late-return fee. The guest may also be charged various taxes, as applicable by geography, which we record as a pass-through and are excluded from Net Marketplace Value. 

Hosts . For each trip on our platform, we charge a commission to the host based on a percentage of the Trip Price. The average commission on our platform is approximately 40 and the host retains the remaining 60 . A typical trip on our platform may also incur reimbursements back to the host for incidental charges such as low fuel or excess mileage. Third-party liability insurance for the host is included with every trip, provided that we do not provide insurance covering hosts and their vehicles, guests, or third parties where the host is a commercial entity and declines coverage under our policies. 

Accordingly, under our model, our revenue consists of the commission that we charge to the host and 100 of the Trip-related Fees, which are net of reimbursements that may have been passed through to the host. 
 The table below shows the components of an illustrative booked trip, which is typically less than one day. Gross Booking Value and Net Marketplace Value in the table below exclude subscriptions charged to hosts and also exclude reductions in revenue resulting from incentive and refund payments made to hosts and guests. See the sections titled Key Business Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Measures below for more information on the calculation of these metrics. For illustration purposes, we included a common reimbursement line item for incidental charges and an example of a local sales tax (which we collect and remit to local authorities in certain jurisdictions).

Components of Results of Operations 
 Total Revenues 
 We have three revenue streams: Carsharing Revenue, Connect Subscription Revenue, Parking Revenue, and Other Revenue. 
 We generate substantially all of our revenue from our peer-to-peer carsharing marketplace platform that connects hosts and guests. We refer to that revenue stream as Carsharing Revenue. Carsharing Revenue is derived from trip reservation and other trip fees collected from guests who book and rent vehicles from the hosts through our platform at a mutually agreed upon rate. Within Europe, we are an intermediary of a sale of third-party vehicle insurance coverage to the guests during the booking process. We charge a nominal amount in exchange for being the intermediary in the sales transaction. Carsharing Revenue is presented net of payments due to hosts given that we act as an intermediary in the arrangement between the host and the guest. 
 We generate additional revenue from hosts subscriptions for the use of IoT hardware devices installed in certain cars, including the Getaround Connect IoT device. We refer to that revenue stream as Connect Subscription Revenue . 
 Carsharing Revenue and Connect Subscription Revenue are presented on a combined basis as Service revenue in our consolidated financial statements. Carsharing revenue represents substantially all of our Service Revenue as Connect Subscription Revenue has not been material in the periods presented. 
 The principal drivers of fluctuations in our Service revenue from period to period are our directed revenue management efforts, such as deliberate changes in pricing and availability optimization, and to a lesser extent, changes in the relative mix of cars on our marketplace, the relative mix of customer-specific use cases at a point in time (e.g., vacation travels and local trips), the scale of different cities across North America and Europe, foreign currency exchange rates, and the local pricing optimizations performed on a per-car and per-trip basis by our dynamic pricing system. 
 We also generate revenue by subleasing, on a monthly basis, dedicated parking spaces to our hosts. We refer to that revenue stream as Parking revenue and present it as Lease revenue in our consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Our Total Revenues are presented net of incentives and refunds. Please refer to Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the Annual Report ), for additional details on our revenue recognition policy. 
 Costs and Expenses 
 Cost of Revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) 
 Cost of Revenue includes payment-processing fees, server hosting charges, and chargebacks associated with operating our platform. Cost of Revenue (exclusive of amortization and depreciation) captures the costs directly related to and necessary for realization of transactions between the hosts and the guests through the Company s marketplace platform, other than the amortization 
 31 

of its platform technology. Cost of Revenue does not include depreciation and amortization. Cost of Revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) may vary as a percentage of Total Revenues from year to year depending on booking activity on our marketplace. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of online digital advertising, brand advertising, out of home and outdoor advertising, market research, agency costs, trade shows and other events, public relations, and compensation and related personnel costs of our salesforce and marketing teams. We expect that our sales and marketing expenses will vary from period to period as a percentage of net revenue for the foreseeable future. 
 Operations and Support 
 Operations and support expense primarily consists of trip support costs, compensation and related expenses of operations personnel, driver s license and identity checks, parking space lease expense, onboarding expenses and other operating costs. Trip support costs consist of auto insurance, insurance claims support and customer relations costs. 
 We expect that our operations and support costs will continue to increase for the foreseeable future to the extent that we continue to see growth in our key business metrics. Operations and support expenses may vary as a percentage of Total Revenues from year to year. 
 Technology and Product Development 
 Technology and product development expenses consist primarily of prototypes, product testing and testing equipment, and compensation and related personnel costs associated with the development, testing and maintenance of our software, hardware, and user experience. We expect that our technology and product development expenses vary from period to period as a percentage of Total Revenues for the foreseeable future. 
 
 General and Administrative 
 General and administrative expenses consist primarily of office space and facilities, non-auto insurance, professional services, business tools and subscriptions, bad debt and compensation and related personnel costs of our administrative teams. We expect that our general and administrative expenses will vary as a percentage of Total Revenues from period to period over the short term and decrease as a percentage of Total Revenues over the long term. 
 Depreciation and Amortization 
 Depreciation and amortization expenses consist of the associated depreciation and amortization of computer equipment, vehicle equipment, office furniture and equipment, leasehold improvements, and intangibles and the impairment of long-lived assets. We expect that our depreciation and amortization expenses will vary as a percentage of Total Revenues from period to period over the short term and decrease as a percentage of Total Revenues over the long term. 
 Convertible Promissory Note and Note Payable Fair Value Adjustment 
 Certain debt instruments issued by Getaround are carried at fair value on our balance sheet. Changes in fair value of those instruments are captured in our results of operation. Convertible promissory note fair value adjustment consists of unrealized gains and losses as a result of marking our convertible promissory notes to fair market value at the end of each reporting period. We will continue to recognize changes in the fair value of such instruments until each respective instrument is exercised, repaid, or qualifies for equity classification. For additional information on securities carried at fair value and fair value measurement please refer to Note 4 - Fair Value Measurement to our consolidated financial statements included herein. 
 Warrant Liability Fair Value Adjustment 
 Certain warrants issued by Getaround are deemed to be a liability for accounting purposes and are therefore carried at fair value on our balance sheet. Changes in the fair value of those liabilities are captured in our results of operations. Warrant liability fair value adjustment consists of unrealized gains and losses as a result of marking our liability classified warrants to fair market value at the end of each reporting period. We will continue to recognize changes in the fair value of such warrants until each respective warrant is exercised, expired, or qualifies for equity classification. For additional information on securities carried at fair value and fair value measurement please refer to Note 4 Fair Value Measurement to our consolidated financial statements included herein. 
 32 

Interest Expense, Net 
 Interest expense is associated with our outstanding debt, including amortization of debt discounts and issuance costs. 
 Other Income (Expense), Net 
 Other income (expense), net consists of various, individually immaterial items that are not directly related to operations of Getaround. 
 
 Income Tax Benefit 
 Income tax benefit consists primarily of income taxes in certain foreign and state jurisdictions in which we conduct business. We maintain a full valuation allowance against our U.S. deferred tax assets because we have concluded that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company s total revenues decreased by 1.4 million compared to the same period last year. Service revenue decreased by 1.3 million driven primarily by the April 1, 2024 suspension of operations in New York State, as well as what the Company believes to be a short-term impact of lower revenue from U.S. carsharing operations driven by the launch of the next generation of our Getaround TrustScore, which disincentivizes higher risk customers from booking trips on our marketplace. Lease revenue decreased by a total of 0.1 million, or 36 , primarily due to the suspension of operations in New York State which decreased the overall number of parking spaces generating Lease revenue.

Operations and support expenses decreased 1.6 million, or 10 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to a 1.1 million decrease in compensation expense and a 0.3 million net decrease in tolls, roadside assistance and fuel expenses, as well as other reductions as a result of improvement in operations and support costs driven by Getaround TrustScore.

General and administrative expenses decreased 0.6 million, or 5 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was largely attributable to a 0.8 million decrease in office rent expense due to the Green St. Lease termination in June of 2024, a 0.7 million decrease in bad debt expense driven in part by our risk and pricing strategy improvements through deployment of the Getaround TrustScore, and a 0.5 million decrease in legal services. These decreases are part of cost management efforts, and were partially offset by a 1.3 million net increase in compensation expense, primarily due to an increase in stock-based compensation.

Depreciation and amortization expense decreased by 2.2 million, or 54 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is primarily attributable to certain intangible assets being fully amortized in April 2024 as well as the disposal of certain fixed assets as a result of the Green St. Lease termination during the second quarter of 2024, resulting in less depreciation expense recorded for the third quarter of 2024. These decreases were partially offset by the increase in amortization expense related to newly developed technology placed in service in April 2024.

Our convertible debt and certain notes payable are carried at fair value on our balance sheet, which, at times, subjects such debt to significant fair value fluctuations. The convertible promissory note and note payable fair value adjustment changed by 9.4 million, or 108 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, following the change in the fair value of the outstanding convertible promissory notes and securities.

 Segment and Geographical Results of Operations 
 We view and operate our business as one operating segment. Refer to Note 17 Segment and Geographical Area Information to our consolidated financial statements included herein for additional details on this determination. 
 Key Business Metrics 
 We use the following key business metric to measure our performance, identify trends relevant to our business, formulate financial projections and operating plans, and make strategic decisions. As a marketplace platform we have one main key business metric: Trips. 
 Trips 
 Trips are a measure of unit transactions in our marketplace, one of the key variables impacting our service revenue. Trips represent the number of non-cancelled unique bookings that ended during the period, net of trips contributing to lease revenue. A Trip represents a single unit of transaction on our platform. We expect the number of Trips to grow as we attract prospective guests to the platform and as already existing cohorts of guests increase their activity on our platform.

 271 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we facilitated 243 thousand Trips, a decrease of 28 thousand or 10 from the 271 thousand Trips during the same period in the year prior. The overall decrease in Trips is largely attributable to the suspension of operations in New York State. 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 We use Gross Booking Value, Net Marketplace Value, Trip Contribution Profit, Trip Contribution Margin and Adjusted EBITDA, each of which are non-GAAP financial measures, in conjunction with GAAP measures as part of our overall assessment of our performance, including the preparation of our annual operating budget and quarterly forecasts, to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies, and to communicate with the Getaround Board concerning our financial performance. Our definitions of these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from definitions used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. In addition, other companies may not publish these or similar financial measures. Furthermore, these financial measures have certain limitations in that they do not include the impact of certain expenses that are reflected in our consolidated statements of operations that are necessary to run our business. Additionally, a limitation of NMV is that it is a measure that we have defined for internal purposes that may be unique to us, and therefore may not enhance the comparability of our results to other companies in our industry that have similar arrangements but present the impact of fees and commissions differently. Thus, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or in isolation from, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. 
 We compensate for these limitations by providing a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with GAAP. We encourage investors and others to review our financial information in its entirety, not to rely on any single financial measure, and to view the non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. 
 Gross Booking Value 
 Gross Booking Value GBV represents the dollar value of all service transactions on our platform during a period, charged to both guests and hosts, net of cancellations. This includes charges for transactions resulting from all revenue generating activities, 
 37 

inclusive of all pass-through fees and taxes, net of lease revenue. As such, we consider GBV to be a key indicator of our market scale. Growth of GBV reflects our ability to attract and retain guests and hosts on our platform. 
 
 The following tables present a reconciliation of Gross Booking Value from the most comparable GAAP measure, Service Revenues, for the periods presented:

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, GBV amounted to 65.1 million, a decrease of 4.2 million, or 6 , from the same period in the year prior, primarily attributable to the suspension of operations in New York State, as well as the temporary reduction in revenue driven by the launch of our Getaround TrustScore, as discussed under the Total Revenues paragraph herein. 
 Net Marketplace Value 
 Net Marketplace Value NMV represents the dollar value of all transactions on our platform contributing to service revenue during a period, charged to both guests and hosts, net of cancellations, hosts earnings, incentives, and pass-throughs. NMV does not represent revenue earned by us and is not a substitute for service revenue, which consists of carsharing revenue and Connect subscription revenue recorded in accordance with GAAP. We believe that NMV is a meaningful measure of our operating performance because our ability to generate increases in NMV is strongly correlated to our ability to generate increases in total revenue. Management uses NMV as supplemental information to evaluate the global dollar value of transactions on our platform contributing to service revenue, understand our business and make operating decisions because service revenue by itself is not comparable across geographies due to the accounting treatment and contractual differences in trip insurance related charges to guests. While revenue generated in the United States includes amounts of insurance billed to the guest and recognized as Service Revenue under GAAP, revenue generated in the rest of the world excludes such amounts where guests contract directly with our insurance partners via our marketplace.

For three months ended September 30, 2024, NMV amounted to 29.8 million, a decrease of 1.0 million, or 3 , from the 30.8 million for the year prior. The change was primarily driven by the suspension of operations in New York State, partially offset by a 0.3 million increase in the sale of European insurance. 
 Contribution Profit and Contribution Margin 
 Contribution Profit is defined as our Net revenue adjusted for variable operating expenses, which consist of cost of revenue, trip support costs, bad debt expense, and other operations and support costs. We define Contribution margin as Contribution profit divided 
 38 

by Net revenue recognized during the period presented. We believe these measures are leading indicators of our ability to achieve profitability and sustain or increase it over time. 
 The following tables present a reconciliation of Contribution Profit from the most comparable GAAP measure, Net revenue, for the periods presented:

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, Contribution profit slightly decreased by 0.1 million, a decrease of 1 , from the prior year. Lower net revenue was mostly offset by a decrease in variable operating expenses due to lower bad debt expense as compared to the third quarter of 2023. 
 Trip Contribution Profit and Trip Contribution Margin 
 Trip Contribution Profit is defined as our gross profit from Service revenue adjusted for: (i) cost of Service revenue, amortization and depreciation; and (ii) trip support costs, which consist of auto insurance expenses, claims support and customer relations costs. We define Trip Contribution Margin as Trip Contribution Profit divided by Service revenue recognized during the period presented. We believe these measures are leading indicators of our ability to achieve profitability and sustain or increase it over time. Trip Contribution Profit and Trip Contribution Margin are measures we use to understand and evaluate our operating performance and trends. Trip Contribution Profit and Trip Contribution Margin have generally increased over the periods as Service revenue increased while costs considered in the calculation of Trip Contribution Profit decreased as a percentage of Total Revenues. 
 The following tables present a reconciliation of Trip Contribution Profit from the most comparable GAAP measure, gross profit from Service revenue, for the periods presented:

For the three months ended September 30, 2024, Trip contribution profit amounted to 10.7 million, a decrease of 1.3 million, or 11 , from the year prior. The change is primarily attributable to a 0.5 million net decrease in gross profit from Service revenue, a 0.6 million decrease in Cost of Service revenue and an increase in Trip support costs of 0.3 million related to claims expense. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, our Trip Contribution Margin was 48 , a decrease from our Trip Contribution Margin of 52 in the same period of the year prior. The reduction in our Trip Contribution Margin is largely attributable to an increase in Trip support costs and a decrease in Cost of Service revenue discussed above. 
 39 

Adjusted EBITDA 
 We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income adjusted for: (i) fair value adjustment of instruments carried at fair value; (ii) interest income (expense) and other income (expense); (iii) income tax provision; (iv) depreciation and amortization; (v) stock-based compensation expense; (vi) contingent compensation; and (vii) certain expenses determined to be incurred outside of the regular course of business which includes: one-time expenses related to the shutdown of the Green St. Office, legal fees to raise capital, costs related to certain legal matters, settlements and business combination-related legal fees, initial implementation projects, and transaction costs associated with proposed business combinations that are not subject to deferral. Adjusted EBITDA is a key performance measure that we use to assess operating performance and operating leverage of our business. As Adjusted EBITDA facilitates internal comparisons of our historical operating performance on a more consistent basis, we use this measure for business planning purposes. Accordingly, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our results of operations in the same manner as our management and board of directors. The items excluded from our Adjusted EBITDA calculation are either non-cash in nature, or not driven by core results of recurring operations and therefore not predictable or recurring, rendering comparisons with prior periods and competitors less meaningful.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company s total revenues increased by 4.2 million, or 8 , compared to the prior year. 
 Service revenue increased by 4.4 million, or 8 , driven primarily by incremental Service revenue of 8.7 million arising from the 2023 Business Combination, partially offset by the impact from the suspension of operations in New York State, as well as lower revenue from U.S. carsharing operations driven by the launch of our Getaround TrustScore, as previously discussed. 
 Lease revenue decreased by a total of 0.2 million, or 21 , primarily due to the suspension of operations in New York State which decreased the overall number of parking spaces generating Lease revenue.

Total cost of revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) increased 0.3 million, or 5 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Cost of revenue varies with both the price and number of the transactions, which impact transaction processing fees, as well as with overall traffic, including research and development activities, on our platform that impacts the hosting charges. The overall increase is largely attributable to the full nine months of cost of revenue generated in 2024 from the 2023 Business Combination.

These decreases were partially offset in part by a 3.0 million net increase in compensation expense, primarily due to an increase in severance expense, and a net increase of 0.4 million in legal services.

Other income, net changed by 9.8 million, or 2972 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change was primarily a result of a 10.8 million gain from the Broadspire settlement as discussed in the "Recent Developments" section herein. The 15 million settlement payment, less fees for legal services paid to the legal counsel to the Company, and other legal costs, resulted in a net cash payment to us in the amount of 10.3 million and recognition of other income in the amount of 10.8 million. Additionally, there was a 1.5 million gain from settlements with various vendors as well as a 0.5 million gain from the settlement with iHeartMedia. This change is partially offset by the 2.9 million loss from the Green St. Lease termination. Please refer to Note 11 - Leases to our consolidated financial statement included in this document for additional details.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had income tax expense of 46.0 thousand, as compared to an income tax benefit of 0.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Any changes in our income tax benefit are primarily attributable to our international operations. 
 Segment and Geographical Results of Operations 
 We view and operate our business as one operating segment. Refer to Note 17 Segment and Geographical Area Information to our consolidated financial statements included herein for additional details on this determination. 
 Key Business Metrics 
 We use the following key business metric to measure our performance, identify trends relevant to our business, formulate financial projections and operating plans, and make strategic decisions. As a marketplace platform we have one main key business metric: Trips. 
 Trips 
 Trips are a measure of unit transactions in our marketplace, one of the key variables impacting our service revenue. Trips represent the number of non-cancelled unique bookings that ended during the period, net of trips contributing to lease revenue. A Trip represents a single unit of transaction on our platform. We expect the number of Trips to grow as we attract prospective guests to the platform and as already existing cohorts of guests increase their activity on our platform.

 724 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we facilitated 680 thousand Trips, a decrease of 44 thousand or 6 from the 724 thousand Trips during the same period in the year prior. The overall decrease in Trips is largely attributable to the suspension of operations in New York State. 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 We use Gross Booking Value, Net Marketplace Value, Trip Contribution Profit, Trip Contribution Margin and Adjusted EBITDA, each of which are non-GAAP financial measures, in conjunction with GAAP measures as part of our overall assessment of 
 45 

our performance, including the preparation of our annual operating budget and quarterly forecasts, to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies, and to communicate with the Getaround Board concerning our financial performance. Our definitions of these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from definitions used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. In addition, other companies may not publish these or similar financial measures. Furthermore, these financial measures have certain limitations in that they do not include the impact of certain expenses that are reflected in our consolidated statements of operations that are necessary to run our business. Additionally, a limitation of NMV is that it is a measure that we have defined for internal purposes that may be unique to us, and therefore may not enhance the comparability of our results to other companies in our industry that have similar arrangements but present the impact of fees and commissions differently. Thus, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or in isolation from, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. 
 We compensate for these limitations by providing a reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable financial measure stated in accordance with GAAP. We encourage investors and others to review our financial information in its entirety, not to rely on any single financial measure, and to view the non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. 
 Gross Booking Value 
 Gross Booking Value GBV represents the dollar value of all service transactions on our platform during a period, charged to both guests and hosts, net of cancellations. This includes charges for transactions resulting from all revenue generating activities, inclusive of all pass-through fees and taxes, net of lease revenue. As such, we consider GBV to be a key indicator of our market scale. Growth of GBV reflects our ability to attract and retain guests and hosts on our platform.

154,711 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, GBV amounted to 163.0 million, an increase of 8.3 million, or 5 , from the same period in the year prior, primarily attributable to the 16.4 million of incremental GBV arising from the 2023 Business Combination and improvements in revenue management, which generated higher GBV per Trip, partially offset by the temporary reduction in revenue driven by the launch of our Getaround TrustScore, which reduced rented hours and correspondingly reduced GBV generated by lower trust, higher risk guests, as discussed under Total Revenues above, as well as the suspension of operations in New York State. 
 Net Marketplace Value 
 Net Marketplace Value NMV represents the dollar value of all transactions on our platform contributing to service revenue during a period, charged to both guests and hosts, net of cancellations, hosts earnings, incentives, and pass-throughs. NMV does not represent revenue earned by us and is not a substitute for service revenue, which consists of carsharing revenue and Connect subscription revenue recorded in accordance with GAAP. We believe that NMV is a meaningful measure of our operating performance because our ability to generate increases in NMV is strongly correlated to our ability to generate increases in total revenue. Management uses NMV as supplemental information to evaluate the global dollar value of transactions on our platform contributing to service revenue, understand our business and make operating decisions because service revenue by itself is not comparable across geographies due to the accounting treatment and contractual differences in trip insurance related charges to guests. While revenue generated in the United States includes amounts of insurance billed to the guest and recognized as Service Revenue under GAAP, revenue generated in the rest of the world excludes such amounts where guests contract directly with our insurance partners via our marketplace.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, NMV amounted to 76.5 million, an increase of 5.9 million, or 8 , from the 70.6 million for the year prior. The change was primarily driven by a 5.7 million increase in Service revenue and a 1.2 million increase in the sale of European insurance. 
 Contribution Profit and Contribution Margin 
 Contribution Profit is defined as our Net revenue adjusted for variable operating expenses, which consist of cost of revenue, trip support costs, bad debt expense, and other operations and support costs. We define Contribution margin as Contribution profit divided by Net revenue recognized during the period presented. We believe these measures are leading indicators of our ability to achieve profitability and sustain or increase it over time.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Contribution profit increased by 5.3 million, an increase of 53 , from the prior year. The change is attributable to a 4.2 million increase in Net revenue, as well as a 1.1 million decrease in variable operating expenses due to lower bad debt expense. 
 Trip Contribution Profit and Trip Contribution Margin 
 Trip Contribution Profit is defined as our gross profit from Service revenue adjusted for: (i) cost of Service revenue, amortization and depreciation; and (ii) trip support costs, which consist of auto insurance expenses, claims support and customer relations costs. We define Trip Contribution Margin as Trip Contribution Profit divided by Service revenue recognized during the period presented. We believe these measures are leading indicators of our ability to achieve profitability and sustain or increase it over time. Trip Contribution Profit and Trip Contribution Margin are measures we use to understand and evaluate our operating performance and trends. Trip Contribution Profit and Trip Contribution Margin have generally increased over the periods as Service revenue increased while costs considered in the calculation of Trip Contribution Profit decreased as a percentage of Total Revenues.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Trip contribution profit amounted to 27.2 million, an increase of 2.4 million, or 10 , from the year prior. The change is attributable to a 5.0 million increase in gross profit from Service revenue partially offset by a 1.8 million net increase in Trip support costs and a 0.8 million decrease in Cost of Service revenue primarily driven by incremental cost of operations arising from the 2023 Business Combination. The increase in Trip support costs was partially offset by the beneficial impact of Getaround TrustScore. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our Trip Contribution Margin was 48 , an increase from our Trip Contribution Margin of 47 in the same period of 2023. The increase in our Trip Contribution Margin is largely attributable to an increase in gross profit from Service revenue discussed above. 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income adjusted for: (i) fair value adjustment of instruments carried at fair value; (ii) interest income (expense) and other income (expense); (iii) income tax provision; (iv) depreciation and amortization; (v) stock-based compensation expense; (vi) contingent compensation; and (vii) certain expenses determined to be incurred outside of the regular course of business which includes: one-time expenses related to the shutdown of the Green St. Office, legal fees to raise capital, costs related to certain legal matters and business combination-related legal fees, and investments in preparation of going public, initial implementation projects and transaction costs associated with proposed business combinations that are not subject to deferral. Adjusted EBITDA is a key performance measure that we use to assess operating performance and operating leverage of our business. As Adjusted EBITDA facilitates internal comparisons of our historical operating performance on a more consistent basis, we use this measure for business planning purposes. Accordingly, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our results of operations in the same manner as our management and board of directors. The items excluded from our Adjusted EBITDA calculation are either non-cash in nature, or not driven by core results of recurring operations and therefore not predictable or recurring, rendering comparisons with prior periods and competitors less meaningful.

The favorable change was driven primarily by an overall decrease in operating expenses, including an overall decrease in compensation expense, office rent, insurance expense, professional services, bad debt expense and trip support costs.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our principal sources of liquidity have historically consisted of cash generated from our financing activities. As of September 30, 2024, our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents of 30.8 million. Cash and cash equivalents consisted of institutional money market funds, and similar instruments that have an original maturity date of less than six months and are readily convertible into known amounts of cash. 
 Legacy Getaround consummated the Business Combination with InterPrivate II on December 8, 2022. Redemptions of Class A Common Stock prior to the 2022 Business Combination significantly reduced the proceeds from the transaction and resulted in the Company having insufficient capital to fund its business operations and continue as a going concern within at least one year from the transaction date. As a result, we have sought, and expect to continue to seek additional sources of capital in the near term. 
 We have incurred cumulative losses from inception through September 30, 2024 and expect to incur additional losses for the foreseeable future. Our ability to fund our operations and capital expenditures beyond our current cash and cash equivalents will depend on our ability to generate cash from operating activities which is subject to future operating performance, as well as general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, and other conditions, some of which may be beyond our control. We expect operating losses and negative cash flows to continue for the foreseeable future as we continue to develop and promote our platform, as well as to grow our marketplace globally. Our future capital requirements depend on many factors, including our needs to support our business growth, to respond to business opportunities, challenges, or unforeseen circumstances, or for other reasons. As a result, if our current cash runway is insufficient for us to be able to achieve or maintain positive cash flow, we will be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us, or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, results of operations, and financial condition would be adversely affected. These matters raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue in existence as a going concern within one year after the date the financial statements are issued. 
 On November 12, 2024, the Company and Mudrick Capital Management L.P., on behalf of certain funds, investors, entities or accounts that are managed, sponsored or advised by Mudrick Capital Management L.P. (the Purchaser ), amended and restated the Sixth A R Super Note to reflect an increased aggregate principal amount of 97,842,574 (the Seventh A R Super Note ). The Seventh A R Super Note will mature on August 7, 2026, at which time 108 of the principal and accrued interest will become due, payable in cash, unless earlier redeemed or repurchased.

Operating Activities 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, cash flows used in operating activities were 44.8 million and 44.0 million, respectively. Comparability of operating cash flows between comparable periods was impacted by changes in working capital primarily driven by following factors: (i) sales volumes and timing of collections, (ii) volume of purchases and timing of payments, and (iii) fluctuations in liability from obligation to remit insurance fees collected on behalf of an insurance company in Europe due to the timing of payments. 
 Investing Activities 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash flows used in investing activities amounted to 0.9 million, consisting of investments in software development. 
 
 49 

Net cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 amounted to 11.8 million, consisting of 0.8 million in purchases of property and equipment, 3.3 million of capitalized software, and 7.8 million related to the acquisition of Hyrecar, partially offset by 1.0 million from proceeds from the sale of property and equipment. 
 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash provided by financing activities was 60.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to proceeds from the issuance of the Mudrick Super Priority Note. 
 Net cash provided by financing activities was 13.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, consisting primarily of 3.0 million in proceeds from issuance of the Mudrick Bridge Note and 11.7 million in proceeds from issuance of the Mudrick Super Priority Note. 
 Contractual Obligations and Commitment 
 Contractual obligations are cash amounts that we are obligated to pay as part of certain contracts that we have entered into during the normal course of business. Below is a table that shows our contractual obligations as of September 30, 2024:

The contractual commitment amounts in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding. Obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a material penalty are not included in the table above. 
 Contingencies 
 We are involved in claims, lawsuits, indirect tax matters, and proceedings arising from the ordinary course of our business. Legal fees and other expenses associated with such actions are expensed as incurred. We record a provision for a liability when we determine that a loss-related matter is both probable and reasonably estimable. We disclose material contingencies when we believe that a loss is not probable but reasonably possible and can be reasonably estimated. These claims, suits, and proceedings are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. Determining both probability and the estimated amount is inherently uncertain and requires making numerous judgments, assumptions, and estimates. Many of these legal and tax contingencies can take years to resolve. Should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to be incorrect, it could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses, and related disclosures of contingencies at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from these estimates. 
 We deem our critical accounting policies and estimates to be as follows: Business combination accounting under ASC 805 Business Combination (see Note 1 - Nature of Business and Basis of Presentation); Revenue Recognition under ASC 606 - Revenue from contracts with customers; Stock-Based Compensation under ASC 718 - Compensation Stock Compensation; Costs and expenses; and Goodwill and other intangible assets under ASC 350 Intangibles Goodwill and Other. For a description of our significant accounting policies and estimates, see Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report. 
 The critical accounting policies requiring estimates, assumptions, and judgments that we believe have the most significant impact on our financials are described below. 
 50 

Fair Value Measurements 
 We measure fair value based on the price that would be received upon sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. As such, fair value may be based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. We use significant unobservable inputs to estimate the fair value of certain assets and liabilities. 
 Company Valuation and Fair Value Calculation of Common Stock Warrant Liability, Convertible Promissory Notes, and Certain Notes Payable 
 In the absence of a public trading market, prior to the closing of the 2022 Business Combination the fair value of our common stock was determined by the Getaround Board. The Getaround Board considers numerous objective and subjective factors to determine the fair value of our common stock at each meeting in which awards are approved. The factors considered include, but are not limited to: 
 (i) the results of contemporaneous independent third-party valuations of our common stock; 

(ii) the prices, rights, preferences and privileges of our preferred stock relative to those of our common stock; 

(iii) the lack of marketability of our common stock; 

(iv) actual operating and financial results; 

(v) current business conditions and projects; 

(vi) the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event; and 

(vii) precedent transactions involving our shares. 

The fair value of our common stock was determined with an option pricing method OPM that utilizes both income and market approaches, which are probability weighted depending on the scenario of (i) a consummation of a business combination transaction with a special purpose acquisition company or (ii) remaining private. 
 The valuation methodology utilized under the remain private scenario was determined by first valuing our total equity, as of the end of each reporting period. This value was determined utilizing both income and market approaches which were weighted equally in the valuation. The income approach was applied through the use of a discounted cash flow analysis and the market approach was applied through the use of guideline public company multiples that were used to value our company under certain scenarios. 
 In determining the value under the consummation of a business combination transaction with a special purpose acquisition company scenario, we utilized the preliminary terms of the letter of intent with such special purpose acquisition company. In addition, as the letter of intent provides shareholders the right to receive an earnout, we determined the probability-weighted value per share associated with the earnout by utilizing a Monte Carlo simulation to determine the probability of achieving the earnout and its fair value. 
 The fair value of our warrant liability is estimated based on the probability weighted average values from (i) a Black-Scholes calculation and (ii) the fair value calculated from the Company Valuation OPM under the scenario of remaining private. The value from the Black-Scholes calculation reflects the value in an initial public offering scenario with the contractual term of the warrants, which is weighted by an estimated probability of a potential initial public offering at the applicable valuation. The value from the OPM reflects the value in an alternative exit scenario at which point the warrants were expected to be exercised. The OPM value was weighted by an estimated probability of a potential alternative exit event at the applicable valuation date. 
 The significant unobservable inputs into the valuation model used to estimate the fair value of the common stock warrants include: 
 the timing of potential events (for example, a potential sale of the business or public offering) and their probability of occurring, 

the selection of guideline public company multiples, 

a discount for the lack of marketability of the preferred and common stock, 

the projected future cash flows, and 

the discount rate used to calculate the present value of the estimated equity value allocated to each share class. 

51 

In determining the fair value of the Mudrick Convertible Notes and Mudrick Super Priority Note, the Company used a market-based approach. The valuation method utilized a negotiated discount rate and a market yield rate which are unobservable inputs. 
 An increase or decrease in any of the unobservable inputs in isolation could result in a material increase or decrease in the estimated fair value. In the future, depending on the weight of evidence and valuation approaches used, these or other inputs may have a more significant impact on the estimated fair value. 
 Stock-Based Compensation 
 We measure compensation expense for all stock-based payment awards, including stock options and restricted stock units granted to employees, directors and non-employees based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the date of grant. The fair value of each stock option granted is estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The determination of the grant date fair value using an option-pricing model is affected by our estimated common stock fair value, as well as assumptions regarding a number of other complex and subjective variables. These variables include our expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the award, actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors, risk-free interest rate for the expected term of the award and expected dividends. Stock-based compensation is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. These amounts are reduced by forfeitures as the forfeitures occur.

PART II - Other information 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 For a discussion of legal proceedings, see Note 12: Commitments and Contingencies of the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 Our business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including those described in Part I. Item 1A of our Annual Report, under the section entitled Risk Factors, that represent challenges that we face in connection with the successful implementation of our strategy and growth of our business. You should carefully consider the Risk Factors, together with all of the other information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including our condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The occurrence of one or more of the events or circumstances described in the Risk Factors, alone or in combination with other events or circumstances, may adversely affect our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the Business Combination and may harm our business. 
 Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes to the Risk Factors described in Part I. Item 1A of our Annual Report. 
 There is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern based on our cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024. We will need to raise additional funding, which may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all, to continue as a going concern. Failure to obtain capital when needed may require us to curtail or cease our operations. 
 Our consolidated financial statements were prepared under the assumption that we will continue as a going concern. As of September 30, 2024, we had 30.8 million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents available to fund future operations. We expect operating losses and negative cash flows to continue for the foreseeable future as we continue to develop and promote our platform, as well as to grow our user base through new markets. We estimate that our existing cash resources will not be sufficient to fund our operations for at least 12 months from the issuance date of the financial statements included elsewhere in this report. Our ability to continue as a going concern will depend on our ability to obtain additional equity or debt financing, attain further operating efficiencies, reduce or contain expenditures and increase revenues. Based on these factors, management determined that there is substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. Our independent registered public accounting firm expressed substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern in its report dated March 28, 2024, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 If we are unable to continue as a going concern, we may have to liquidate our assets and may receive less than the value at which those assets are carried on our audited financial statements, and it is likely that investors will lose all or part of their investment. When we seek additional financing to fund our business activities as a result of the substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, investors or other financing sources may be unwilling to provide additional funding to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all. 
 Our common stock trades on the OTC Markets Group platform and there can be no assurance it will trade on the NYSE again. 
 Effective July 10, 2024, NYSE suspended trading in our common stock and started the process to delist our common stock from the NYSE because we did not comply with Section 802.01B of the NYSE Listed Company Manual, which requires listed companies to maintain an average global market capitalization over a consecutive 30 trading day period of at least 15,000,000. Since July 10, 2024, our common stock has been quoted on the OTC Pink Market under the ticker symbol GETR. The OTC Markets Group platform is generally considered less efficient than the NYSE. Quotation of our common stock on the OTC Markets Group platform may reduce the liquidity of our securities, limit the number of investors who trade in our securities, result in a lower stock price and larger spread in the bid and ask prices for shares of our common stock and could have an adverse effect on us. Additionally, we may become subject to the SEC rules that affect penny stocks, which are stocks below 5.00 per share that are not listed or quoted on a principal exchange such as the NYSE. These SEC rules would make it more difficult for brokers to find buyers for our securities and could lower the net sales prices that our stockholders are able to obtain. If our price of common stock remains low, we may not be able to raise equity capital. 
 53 

In addition, Rule 15g-9 under the Exchange Act imposes additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers that sell penny stocks to persons other than established customers and institutional accredited investors. For transactions covered by this rule, a broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and have received the purchaser s written consent to the transaction prior to sale. Consequently, the rule may affect the ability of broker-dealers to sell our common stock and affect the ability of holders to sell their shares of our common stock in the secondary market. Moreover, investors may be less interested in purchasing low-priced securities because the brokerage commissions, as a percentage of the total transaction value, tend to be higher for such securities, and some investment funds will not invest in low-priced securities (other than those which focus on small-capitalization companies or low-priced securities). 
 On July 23, 2024, we submitted a request for a review of the NYSE s determination to suspend trading in our common stock and commence the process for delisting our common stock from the NYSE. On August 2, 2024, the Company notified NYSE that it determined to officially withdraw its request for a hearing. 
 Our common stock and public warrants are quoted on the OTC Venture Market, but a market may not develop for these securities. 
 As described above, on July 9, 2024, we received notice that NYSE had suspended trading of our common stock on the NYSE effective immediately and started the process to delist our common stock from the NYSE. Our common stock resumed trading on the OTC Markets Group platform under its ticker symbol GETR on July 10, 2024. Our public warrants previously were listed on NYSE under the symbol GETR WS. On November 28, 2023, the NYSE halted trading in our public warrants due to the low trading price of the warrants and removed the public warrants from listing and registration on NYSE effective as of December 26, 2023. The public warrants are now quoted on the OTC Venture Market under the symbol GETRW. The over-the-counter market is a significantly more limited market than NYSE due to factors such as the reduced number of investors that will consider investing in securities traded over the counter, the reduced number of market makers in the securities, and the reduced number of securities analysts that follow such securities. As a result of the foregoing, holders of our securities may find it difficult to resell their securities at prices quoted in the market or at all. You may be unable to sell our securities unless a market for such securities can be established or sustained. 
 Our current cash runway is insufficient for us to be able to achieve or maintain positive cash flow and there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. As such, we will require additional capital to support our operations or the growth of our business, and we cannot be certain that this capital will be available on reasonable terms when required, or at all. 
 There is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for at least 12 months from the issuance date of the financial statements included elsewhere in this report and we expect our expenditures to continue to be significant in the foreseeable future as we implement our operating plans under new leadership, and that our level of expenditures will be significantly affected by the growth of supply and demand for shared vehicles in our marketplace. Additionally, the fact that we have a limited operating history at our current scale and as an international company means that our business model has not yet been fully proven. As a result, our future capital requirements may be uncertain and actual capital requirements may be different from those currently anticipated. We will need to seek equity or debt financing to finance a portion of our capital expenditures. Such financing might not be available to us in a timely manner or on terms that are acceptable, or at all. 
 Our ability to obtain the necessary financing to carry out our operating plans is subject to a number of factors, including general market conditions and investor acceptance of our business model. These factors may make the timing, amount, terms and conditions of such financing unattractive or unavailable to us. If we are unable to raise sufficient funds, we will have to significantly reduce our spending, delay or cancel our planned activities or substantially change our corporate structure. We might not be able to obtain any funding, and we might not have sufficient resources to conduct our business as projected, both of which could mean that we would be forced to curtail or discontinue our operations. 
 In addition, our future capital needs and other business reasons could require us to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain a credit facility. The sale of additional equity or equity-linked securities could dilute our stockholders. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased debt service obligations and could result in operating and financing covenants that would restrict our operations or our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders. If we cannot raise additional funds when we need or want them, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be negatively impacted.

 Re: Fundamental Change Forbearance 
 Ladies and Gentlemen: 
 Reference is made to the Indenture, dated as of December 8, 2022 (as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture, dated September 8, 2023, and the Second Supplemental Indenture, dated August 19, 2024, the Indenture ), by and among Getaround, Inc. (the Company and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as trustee (in such capacity, the Trustee and collateral agent (in such capacity, the Collateral Agent ), pursuant to which the Company issued the 8.00 / 9.50 Convertible Senior Secured PIK Toggle Notes due 2027 (the Notes ). Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings provided in the Indenture. 
 The undersigned hereby represents and warrants that it is the beneficial or record owner of, or has sole investment or voting discretion with respect to, the aggregate principal amount of Notes set forth opposite each Person s name on Annex A hereto (such Person, a Holder , and collectively, the Holders ), and has the power and authority to bind the beneficial owner(s) of such Notes including without limitation to act on behalf of, 

vote, direct the Trustee and the Collateral Agent as to, consent to matters concerning and waive any provision of, the Indenture and the Notes. 
 The undersigned hereby represents and warrants that the Holders collectively beneficially own all of the aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes, and has provided to the Trustee position statements from brokers or custodians of the Holders evidencing such beneficial ownership of the Notes. 
 The undersigned understands that: 
 (a) effective August 16, 2024, the Common Stock ceased to be listed on The New York Stock Exchange (the Delisting ); 

(b) such Delisting constitutes a Fundamental Change under the Indenture, as a result of which, pursuant to Section 4.02 of the Indenture: 

(i) each Holder shall have the Fundamental Change Repurchase Right to require the Company to repurchase such Holder s Notes on the relevant Fundamental Change Repurchase Date for a cash purchase price equal to the Fundamental Change Repurchase Price; and 

(ii) on or before the twentieth (20th) calendar day after the effective date of a Fundamental Change, the Company is required to send to each Holder, the Trustee, the Conversion Agent and the Paying Agent a Fundamental Change Notice to repurchase Notes no more than thirty five (35), nor less than twenty (20), Business Days after the date the Company sends the Fundamental Change Notice (such Section 4.02 of the Indenture, collectively, the Fundamental Change Provisions ); and 

(c) failure by the Company to deliver a Fundamental Change Notice shall constitute an Event of Default under Section 7.01(A)(iii) of the Indenture (the Fundamental Change Event of Default ); and 

(d) the Fundamental Change Event of Default would provide Holders of at least twenty five percent (25 of the aggregate principal amount of Notes then outstanding, the right, by notice to the Company and the Trustee, to declare the principal amount of, and all accrued and unpaid interest on, all of the Notes then outstanding to become due and payable immediately (the Fundamental Change Event of Default Acceleration ); and 

(e) the Company has requested that each of the Holders agree to temporarily forbear during the Forbearance Period (as defined below) from the exercise of (i) the Fundamental Change Repurchase Right and (ii) any rights and remedies available to them under the Indenture, the Notes or otherwise under applicable law, including the ability to declare the Fundamental Change Event of Default Acceleration (collectively, the Rights and 

#99947511v2 2 

Remedies ), solely to the extent arising from the Fundamental Change Provisions and the occurrence and continuation of the Fundamental Change Event of Default, in each case in connection with the Delisting, subject to the terms set forth herein. 

Accordingly, upon the terms set forth herein: 
 (a) From the date hereof until the Termination Date (as defined below), each Holder (severally and not jointly) hereby agrees that during the Forbearance Period it will forbear from exercising (i) the Fundamental Change Repurchase Right and (ii) any of the Rights and Remedies solely with respect to the Fundamental Change Provisions and the Fundamental Change Event of Default, in each case in connection with the Delisting (the Forbearance ). For the avoidance of doubt, during the Forbearance Period, each Holder agrees that it will not deliver any notice or instruction to the Trustee directing the Trustee to exercise any of the Rights and Remedies with respect to the Fundamental Change Provisions or the Fundamental Change Event of Default in connection with the Delisting. 

(b) The Holders hereby request that during the Forbearance Period the Trustee not take, and direct the Trustee not to take, any remedial action solely with respect to the Fundamental Change Provisions or the Fundamental Change Event of Default. The Holders agree that this letter may be delivered to the Trustee on any date during the Forbearance Period as a direction contemplated by Section 7.05 of the Indenture, and that the Holders shall, upon request from the Company, provide such further direction to the Trustee as may be necessary to effectuate the intent of the foregoing. In the event that notwithstanding the foregoing, the Trustee or any Person takes any action to declare all of the Notes immediately due and payable pursuant to Section 7.02(B) of the Indenture during the Forbearance Period solely due to the Fundamental Change Event of Default, each Holder agrees to rescind and cancel such acceleration to the fullest extent permitted under the Indenture. 

The Forbearance shall commence on the date hereof and continue until the date on which any Event of Termination (as defined below) shall have occurred (the Termination Date and the period commencing on the date hereof and ending on the Termination Date, the Forbearance Period ). From and after the Termination Date, the Forbearance shall immediately and automatically terminate and have no further force or effect, and each of the Holders shall be released from any and all obligations and agreements under this letter and shall be entitled to exercise any of the Rights and Remedies as if the forbearance under this letter had never existed, and all of the Rights and Remedies under the Indenture and in law and in equity shall be available without restriction or modification. 
 The Forbearance Period shall automatically terminate if any of the following events shall occur (each, an Event of Termination ): 
 #99947511v2 3 

(a) other than the Fundamental Change Event of Default in connection with the Delisting, there occurs any Default or Event of Default under the Indenture that is not cured within its applicable grace period; 

(b) a case under title 11 of the United States Code or any similar reorganization, liquidation, insolvency, or receivership proceeding under applicable law is commenced by the Company or any Guarantor; 

(c) the Company cures the Fundamental Change Event of Default by providing the Fundamental Change Notice, and no other Default or Event of Default has occurred and remains uncured at the time the Company cures such Fundamental Change Event of Default; or 

(d) the Holders consent to such termination in writing. 

The Forbearance is limited in nature and nothing contained herein is intended, or shall be deemed or construed (i) to impair the ability of the Holders or the Trustee to exercise any of the Rights and Remedies during the Forbearance Period for Defaults or Events of Default other than the Fundamental Change Event of Default, (ii) to constitute a waiver of the Fundamental Change Event of Default or any future Defaults or Events of Default or compliance with any term or provision of the Indenture or applicable law, other than as expressly set forth in this letter or (iii) to establish a custom or course of dealing between the Company, on the one hand, and any Holder, on the other hand. 
 The Holders have not waived, released or compromised, and do not hereby waive, release or compromise, any events, occurrences, acts, or omissions that may constitute or give rise to any Defaults or Events of Default, including, without limitation, the Fundamental Change Events of Default, that existed or may have existed, or may presently exist, or may arise in the future, nor does any Holder waive any Rights and Remedies. 
 The execution and delivery of this letter shall not, except as otherwise set forth herein (i) constitute an extension, modification, or waiver of any aspect of the Indenture or the Notes; (ii) extend the maturity of the Notes or the due date of any payment of any amount(s) due thereunder or payable in connection therewith; (iii) give rise to any obligation on the part of the Holders to extend, modify or waive any term or condition of the Notes; (iv) establish any course of dealing with respect to the Notes; or (v) give rise to any defenses or counterclaims to the right of the Holders to compel payment of the Notes or any amounts(s) due thereunder or payable in connection therewith or otherwise enforce their rights and remedies set forth in the Indenture. 
 Each Holder, severally on a pro rata basis based on the Holders pro rata share, hereby agrees to (i) indemnify and hold harmless the Trustee, the Collateral Agent and their affiliates, and their respective past, present and future directors, officers, shareholders, partners, members, employees, agents, representatives, advisors, subcontractors and controlling persons (collectively, the Indemnified Parties ), from and against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) (collectively, the Losses ), arising out of or related to the actions taken pursuant to and implementing the 
 #99947511v2 4 

directions in this letter including but not limited to the execution of the Second Supplemental Indenture and (ii) reimburse each Indemnified Party for all fees and expenses (including, without limitation, the fees and expenses of counsel) as they are reasonably incurred in connection with or arising out of or related to this letter and the directions hereunder, provided that Holders shall not be liable under this provision to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction shall have determined that such Losses resulted directly from any such acts or failures to act undertaken or omitted to be taken by such Indemnified Party through its gross negligence or willful misconduct. For purposes hereunder, the term pro rata share means a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the principal balance of such Holder s aggregate holdings of the Notes as of the date hereof as set forth in Annex A hereto; and the denominator of which shall be the total principal balance of all directing Holders aggregate holdings of the Notes as of such date. The foregoing indemnity is in all events secondary to any funds actually held by the Trustee or the Collateral Agent on account of principal or interest owed to the Holders that are available to pay or satisfy the Losses, and the Holders ratify the Trustee and/or the Collateral Agent s authority to set off such amounts on account of such Losses without the consent of any party. 
 Promptly upon receipt by an Indemnified Party of notice of any demand, claim, or commencement or threatened commencement of any action, suit, proceeding, or investigation which might constitute a Loss for which indemnity is given hereunder, the Trustee and the Collateral Agent, as applicable, shall notify the Holders, via overnight courier, e-mail, facsimile or equivalent service addressed to the Holders at the address listed in the signature page hereto and shall provide to such Holders copies of all documents received by the Trustee and the Collateral Agent in connection therewith. Upon such notice, in addition to the Indemnified Party s right to defend itself, the Holders may defend against the asserted Losses by counsel who is reasonably acceptable to the affected Indemnified Party, subject to such Indemnified Party s right to counsel in the event of an actual or perceived conflict of interest, as determined by the Indemnified Party in its sole discretion. 
 
 Nothing herein shall in any way affect, limit, or impair the rights of the Trustee or the Collateral Agent under the Indenture, the Notes or any Security Document, or any other documents or agreements related thereto. If the indemnity set forth herein shall, in the reasonable opinion of the Trustee or the Collateral Agent, become insufficient or impaired, the Trustee and the Collateral Agent shall have the right to request additional indemnities or to cease (or not commence) to do the acts indemnified against until such insufficiency or impairment is cured. 
 Each Holder hereby represents and warrants that (x) this letter has been duly authorized, executed and delivered and constitutes its legal, valid and binding obligations enforceable in accordance with their terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by (i) bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar laws affecting creditors rights generally and (ii) general principles of equity; and (y) it has independently reviewed this letter and not relied on any information from the Trustee or the Collateral Agent. 
 #99947511v2 5 

This letter shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the internal laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to the conflict of laws principles thereof that would require application of the laws of another jurisdiction. 
 No alteration, amendment or modification of this letter shall be effective or binding upon any party unless in writing and duly executed by the Holders constituting the entire aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes. This letter (including the indemnity set forth herein) and any direction made pursuant hereto shall be binding upon any successor or assign of the Holders. 
 This letter may be executed by each Holder in counterparts (and by different parties hereto in different counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single instrument.

 The parties, prior to the subject matter of this agreement, state as follows: 

PREAMBLE 
 
 Under a private agreement dated 13/11/2020, the Bank granted the Borrower a business-purpose loan of 2,400,000 euros (two million four hundred thousand euros), with a term of one year, intended to finance the Borrower s working capital needs to support its activities in France, according to the general and specific conditions stated in said document (hereinafter referred to as the Loan Agreement ). 
 
 This loan was granted to address the financial impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic under the conditions established by the amended law No. 2020-289 of March 23, 2020, on the 2020 supplementary budget, and by the amended decree of March 23, 2020, providing a State guarantee for credit institutions and financing companies. 
 
 Pursuant to the provisions of the Loan Agreement, the loan was the subject of an amortization addendum, hereinafter referred to as the Amortization Addendum, under which new financial terms were applied regarding the Optional Amortization Period selected by the Borrower as well as the guarantee fee due to BPI for said period (hereinafter referred to as the Additional Guarantee Fee that the Borrower requested the Bank to finance and amortize over the remaining term of the Loan. 
 
 The parties expressly declare to refer to the conditions stated in said documents. 
 
 The Loan Agreement and the Amortization Addendum are collectively referred to hereinafter as the Loan. 
 
 As a result of repayments made by the Borrower, the remaining balance due under said Loan, after payment of the 13/11/2023 installment, is 1,844,821.01 euros in principal, which includes the Additional Guarantee Fee of 38,090.12 euros financed by the Bank and amortized over the remaining term of the Loan. 
 
 This addendum is issued in accordance with the provisions of the Decree of July 8, 2021, amending the decree of March 23, 2020, granting the State guarantee for credit institutions and financing companies under Article 6 of the law No. 2020-289 of the 2020 supplementary budget, allowing for the extension of the Loan repayment period beyond six years. 
 
 Prior to this addendum: 
 
 The Borrower has requested that the Bank accept certain modifications to the financial conditions of the Loan (including the Additional Guarantee Fee financed by the Bank), specifically: 
 
 That instead of the originally agreed fixed interest rate of 0.75 percent per year (excluding insurance, if any), the Loan (including the Additional Guarantee Fee) will now bear interest at a fixed rate of 3.90 percent per year (excluding insurance, if any). 

To agree on a deferred repayment period of the principal balance of the said Loan (including the Additional Guarantee Fee) for a period of 12 months, which will begin after the due date of 11/13/2023. 

To extend the remaining repayment term of the said Loan (including the Additional Guarantee Fee) by 12 months, so that the initial repayment due date of 11/13/2026 is extended to 11/13/2027, taking into account 

the agreed deferral period below. 

The Bank accepts these modifications. 
 Having explained the above, the parties proceed to formalize the convention subject to these terms. 
 
 Article: Modification of the Financial Conditions of the Loan 
 Following the settlement of the installment due on 11/13/2023, the financial terms of the Loan are modified as follows: 
 
 Modification of the Interest Rate 
 The interest rate on the Loan, initially agreed under the Amortization Agreement at 0.75 percent per year, and applying equally to the Additional Guarantee Fee financed by the Bank, will be increased to 3.90 percent per year (excluding insurance, if any), effective from the date of the next installment, as defined below. 
 
 Modification of the Loan Repayment Terms - Deferred Repayment Period for Principal 
 The Bank grants the Borrower a deferred repayment period for the principal balance of 12 months, during which the Borrower will only be required to pay interest on the Loan (including the Additional Guarantee Fee), calculated monthly on the outstanding principal at a rate of 3.90 percent per year (excluding insurance, if any). 
 This interest will be calculated based on a 360-day annual basis and a 30-day month and will be payable in arrears on the same payment date as the original amortizations of the Loan. 
 
 Extension of the Remaining Repayment Term of the Loan 
 Furthermore, the Bank agrees to extend the remaining repayment term of the said Loan (including the Additional Guarantee Fee) by 12 months, so that the initial repayment due date of 11/13/2026 is now extended to 11/13/2027, under the following conditions: 
 
 Article: Repayment of the Loan 
 After the end of the deferred principal repayment period, the Loan (including the amount of the Additional Guarantee Fee) will be repayable in 36 equal monthly installments of 5,384.44, each comprising a portion of the outstanding principal and interest calculated at the fixed rate of 3.90 percent per year (excluding insurance, if any) on the outstanding principal after each installment. The interest will be calculated on a 360-day basis and a 30-day month. 
 
 The first repayment will take place on 12/13/2024, which will establish the dates for the remaining repayments. 
 An amortization schedule, including the repayment schedule, will be provided by the Bank to the Borrower. 
 
 The Borrower will receive an annual statement from the Bank detailing the repayment schedule of the amounts owed under the Additional Guarantee Fee, and upon request at any time. 
 
 Article: Insurance 
 Absence of Impact of Optional Insurance on the Above Financial Conditions 
 The contributions to any optional insurance applicable to the Loan under this addendum are not included in the calculation of the Loan s effective global rate. 
 
 Article: Processing Fees 
 500 (service not subject to VAT) due and collected by the Bank as a single payment on the date of signing this agreement, to be debited from one of the accounts held in the Borrower's name. 
 
 Article: Effective Global Rate of the Loan (TEG) 
 Calculated according to the legal method currently in force and based on a monthly actuarial rate of 0.326 percent, the Effective Global Rate of the Loan, taking into account the above modifications, is 3.91 percent per year as of the date of this agreement. 
 
 Article: Loan Account Adjustment 
 The Loan contract has been recorded on loan account number 30004 02999 00060840018 73 on the Bank s books at its Business Center. 
 For internal management purposes, the Loan subject to this restructuring will need to be transferred to a different loan account, whose details (account number, agency) will be provided to the Borrower either by letter or in the amortization schedule provided due to these changes. 
 It is expressly agreed that the accounting entries for this renumbering do not constitute a new debt, and therefore do not entail a novation of the Bank's debt resulting from the above-modified Loan. 
 
 Article: Modification of the Early Maturity Clause of the Loan 
 The specific terms of the Loan are modified to specify that in case of grossly reprehensible behavior by the Borrower, or if its situation is found to be irreparably compromised within the meaning of Article L.313-12 of the Monetary and Financial Code, the Loan shall become immediately due without prior notice. 
 
 Article: Additional Early Maturity 
 In addition to the early maturity cases contained in the Loan Contract, the Bank may demand the early repayment of all amounts due under the Loan, including principal, interest, fees, insurance contributions, and any costs in any of the 

following cases: 
 In the event of non-payment on the due date of any amount due under the Loan; 

In case of payment incident reported to the Bank of France; 

More generally, in case of non-compliance, misrepresentation, or failure to fulfill any obligation of the Borrower under the Loan; 

In case of merger, split, early dissolution, or any other operation resulting in a universal transfer of the Borrower s assets to a third company; 

In the event of amicable liquidation or dissolution of the Borrower; 

In the case of a sale of the Borrower's business in the context of an amicable or collective procedure; 

In the case of a partial transfer of assets of the Borrower's business representing an independent branch of activity; 

In case of Change of Control, defined as the case where GETAROUND INC., a company incorporated in the State of Delaware, ceases to hold a direct or indirect 100 percent share of the Borrower's capital and/or voting rights. 

Amounts thus due, as well as any unpaid amounts and costs incurred by the Bank due to the Loan, shall accrue interest at the above rate, increased by three percent per year. 
 
 This clause does not prejudice the due maturity and does not imply an agreement to delay payment. Interest will be capitalized if due for a full year, as per Article 1343-2 of the Civil Code. 
 
 In addition to the early maturity cases mentioned above and those provided in the Loan Contract, the Bank may also declare the Loan due immediately in cases where any other loan or credit extended to the Borrower under a separate agreement is declared due by a financial institution or third party, unless contested in good faith by the Borrower and pending legal resolution. 
 
 Article: Borrower's Rights and Obligations 
 While any amount is due to the Bank under the Loan, the Borrower undertakes to provide, at the Bank s request, all accounting, financial, or legal documents relating to its assets, liabilities, or any solvency-influencing events.
