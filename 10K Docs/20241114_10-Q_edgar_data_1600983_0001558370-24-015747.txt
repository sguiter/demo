 Cautionary Note on Forward-Looking Statements This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We intend such forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). All statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q other than statements of historical fact, including statements regarding our future operating results and financial position, including profitability, our business strategy and plans, market growth, product and service releases, the status of product development, compliance with applicable listing requirements or standards of The Nasdaq Capital Market, demand for our products and services, and our objectives for future operations, are forward-looking statements. In some cases the words believe, may, will, estimate, potential, continue, anticipate, intend, expect, could, would, project, plan, target, or the negative of these terms and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q include, but are not limited to, statements about: The success of our products and product candidates, which will require significant capital resources and years of development efforts; Our deployments and market acceptance of our products; Our ability to protect our intellectual property and to develop, maintain and enhance a strong brand; Our limited operating history by which performance can be gauged; Our ability to continue as a going concern; Our ability to comply with all applicable listing requirements or standards of The Nasdaq Capital Market; Our ability to operate and collect digital information on behalf of our clients, which is dependent on the privacy laws of jurisdictions in which our Autonomous Security Robots ASR and Emergency Communication Devices ECD operate, as well as the corporate policies of our clients, which may limit our ability to fully deploy our technologies in various markets; Our ability to raise capital; and Our ability to manage our research, development, expansion, growth, and operating expenses. 
 We have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations and projections about future events and trends that we believe may affect our financial condition, results of operations, business strategy, short-term and long-term business operations and objectives, and financial needs. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and assumptions and other important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those stated, including: We have not yet generated any profits or significant revenues, anticipate that we will incur continued losses for the foreseeable future, and may never achieve profitability. The report of our independent registered public accounting firm expresses substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, and we may not be able to continue to operate the business if we are not successful in securing additional funding. We expect to experience future losses as we implement our business strategy and will need to generate significant revenues to achieve profitability, which may not occur. We are subject to potential fluctuations in operating results due to our sales cycle.

 If we are unable to acquire new customers, our future revenues and operating results will be harmed. Likewise, potential customer turnover in the future, or costs we incur to retain our existing customers, could materially and adversely affect our financial performance. We are subject to the loss of contracts, due to terminations, non-renewals or competitive re-bids, which could adversely affect our results of operations and liquidity, including our ability to secure new contracts from other customers. Our future operating results are difficult to predict and may be affected by a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control. Our financial results will fluctuate in the future, which makes them difficult to predict. Changes in global economic conditions, including, but not limited to, those driven by inflation and interest rates, may adversely affect customer spending and the financial health of our customers and others with whom we do business, which may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, and cash resources. Adverse developments affecting the financial services industry, including events or concerns involving liquidity, defaults or non-performance by financial institutions, could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. We have a limited number of deployments, and limited market acceptance of our products could harm our business. We cannot assure you that we will effectively manage our growth. Our costs may grow more quickly than our revenues, harming our business and profitability. Any debt arrangements that we enter into may impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us, which may prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities. A breach of any of the restrictive covenants under such debt arrangements may cause us to be in default under our debt arrangements, and our lenders could foreclose on our assets. The other risks, uncertainties, and important factors described in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part I, Item 2 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission the SEC on April 1, 2024, as amended by our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A, filed with the SEC on April 29, 2024 (together, our Annual Report ), as updated in our other filings with the SEC. 
 Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks emerge from time to time. It is not possible for our management to predict all risks, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements we may make. In light of these risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, the future events and trends discussed in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may not occur and actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements. You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. The events and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements may not be achieved or occur. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, performance, or achievements. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and we undertake no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements for any reason after the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or to conform these statements to actual results or revised expectations, except as required by applicable law. In this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the words we, us, our, the Company and Knightscope refer to Knightscope, Inc., unless the context requires otherwise.

 KNIGHTSCOPE, INC. Notes to Condensed financial statements (Dollars in thousands, unless otherwise stated) (Unaudited) or for other future periods. These condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s audited financial statements and accompanying notes for the year ended December 31, 2023 included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on April 1, 2024. The Company s significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to those audited financial statements. Since its inception, the Company has incurred significant operating losses and negative cash flows from operations which is principally the result of scaling the business and significant research and development activities related to the development, continued improvement, and deployment of the Company s ASRs (hardware and software). Cash and cash equivalents on hand were million as of September 30, 2024, compared to million as of December 31, 2023. The Company has historically incurred losses and negative cashflows from operations. As of September 30, 2024, the Company also had an accumulated deficit of approximately million and stockholders equity of approximately million. The Company is dependent on additional fundraising in order to sustain its ongoing operations. Based on current operating levels, the Company will need to raise additional funds in the next twelve months by selling additional equity or incurring debt. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for the twelve months from the date of this report.

Capital Structure The Company has prioritized restructuring Knightscope s capital structure to better align with its public company peers. Below is a summary of actions taken, which we believe, set up the Company for long term success. Increase in Authorized Shares - On April 5, 2024, we held a special meeting of stockholders (the Special Meeting at which the Company s stockholders approved an amendment (the Share Increase Amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of the Company s Class A Common Stock, par value 0.001 per share from 114,000,000 to 228,000,000 shares. Our Board believes it is in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders to have additional shares available for use as our Board deems appropriate or necessary. As such, the primary purpose of the Share Increase Amendment was to provide the Company with greater flexibility with respect to managing its Class A Common Stock in connection with such corporate purposes as may, from time to time, be considered advisable by our Board. These corporate purposes could include, without limitation, (i) financing activities, including the at-the-market offering program that we commenced in February 2023, as amended in August 2023, with H.C. Wainwright Co., LLC as sales agent; (iii) stock dividends or splits; (iv) conversions of convertible securities; (v) issuance of stock options and other equity awards pursuant to our incentive plans; and (vi) establishing strategic relationships. Having an increased number of authorized but unissued shares of Class A Common Stock allows the Company to take prompt action with respect to corporate

 opportunities that develop, without the delay and expense of convening a special meeting of stockholders for the purpose of approving an increase in our capitalization. Our Board will determine whether, when and on what terms the issuance of shares of Class A Common Stock may be warranted in connection with any of the foregoing purposes. Preferred Stock Conversion to Common - On May 15, 2024 (the Preferred Stock Conversion Date ), pursuant to the terms of the Certificate of Incorporation, each share of the Company s Super Voting Preferred Stock was automatically converted into fully-paid, non-assessable shares of Class B common stock and each share of the Company s Ordinary Preferred Stock (together with the Super Voting Preferred Stock, the Preferred Stock was automatically converted into fully-paid, non-assessable shares of Class A common stock, in each case at the then effective applicable Conversion Rate, as a result of the receipt by the Company of a written request for such conversion from the holders of a majority of the voting power of the Preferred Stock then outstanding (the Automatic Conversion ). As a result of the Automatic Conversion, no shares of previously authorized preferred stock remain outstanding. Management believes this change helps the Company maintain compliance with Nasdaq listing rules by helping the Company meet the minimum stockholders equity requirement under the Equity Standard for continued listing pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) on The Nasdaq Capital Market. On August 16, 2024, at its Annual Meeting, the Company received stockholder approval to authorize 40,000,000 shares of blank check preferred stock, issuable in one or more series, and (ii) implement ancillary and conforming changes in connection with the authorization of blank check preferred stock and to remove provisions related to the Company s former Super Voting Preferred Stock and Ordinary Preferred Stock, which are no longer outstanding. The term blank check preferred stock refers to preferred stock, the creation and issuance of which is authorized in advance by a company s stockholders and the terms, rights and features of which are determined by the Board of Directors of a company without seeking further actions or vote of the stockholders. Extinguishment of Warrants with Anti-Dilution Features - On October 10, 2022, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the 2022 Purchase Agreement with Alto Opportunity Master Fund, SPC - Segregated Master Portfolio B (the Holder ), pursuant to which the Company issued and sold to the Holder in a private placement (i) senior secured convertible notes (the 2022 Notes ), and (ii) warrants (the 2022 Warrants to purchase up to 22,768 shares of the Company s Class A common stock.

In connection with the entry into the 2022 Purchase Agreement, the Company and the Holder also entered into a registration rights agreement (the 2022 Registration Rights Agreement ), pursuant to which the Company agreed to provide the Holder with certain registration rights under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder.

Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined in the August 2024 Note), the Holder may, at its option, require the Company to repay the Note in full, starting from the public announcement of such a Change of Control until 30 days after its completion. The August 2024 Note does not bear interest under normal circumstances; however, if an Event of Default occurs (as defined in the August 2024 Note), the outstanding principal will automatically bear interest at a rate of 10 per annum until the default is resolved or the Note is paid in full. As of November 13, 2024, approximately 1.8 million of the note is remaining.

 Financial Efficiency The Company is focused on scaling its business and on implementing strategies to decrease gross margin loss over time. We have continued our focus on controlling costs with steps that include decreasing expenditures for real estate leases we exited two long-term leases; optimizing team composition and size we increased the size of the sales team to drive growth; optimizing the manufacturing process through leverage of third-party manufacturers; reducing telecommunication service and cloud costs to further reduce our ongoing support, repair and maintenance costs; and continuing to streamline our ASR and ECD production processes towards a more traditional assembly line workflow for improved quality, efficiency, and throughput. 
 In the third quarter of 2024, Knightscope continued to streamline operations of the ECD product line which was acquired when the Company purchased the assets of CASE Emergency Management. Although the disruptions from restructuring changes we made in the first half of this year continue to impact operations, we are beginning to see benefits, primarily as we work closely with our third-party partners to streamline field services for our ECD clients. Additionally, we believe our efforts to improve the ASR K5 v5 are showing promise as we see increased customer retention and a resulting increase in install base. The Company plans to invest in what management believes will be revenue-generating activities such as expansion of the sales team, developing channel partnerships and updating its website to attract new leads. Our strategy is to try to keep fixed costs low while minimizing variable costs in conjunction with pursuing our overall growth objectives. As of October 31, 2024, the Company had a total backlog of approximately 2.9 million, comprised of 2.4 million related to orders for ECDs and 0.5 million related to ASR orders.

Product revenue decreased by approximately 0.7 million or approximately 52 in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to lower sales of ECD products which were impacted by the Company s decision to move production from Irvine, CA to its headquarters location in Mountain View, CA. As a result, there were significant disruptions in our ability to build and deliver units to customers. The Company expects some disruptions to continue in the near future as it evaluates opportunities to optimize production and operations, which may include seeking a new, larger facility. Service revenue, net for the three months ended September 30, 2024 remained relatively flat compared to the same period in the prior year. Cost of revenue, net In the first quarter of 2024, the Company made a strategic decision to outsource its ECD field services function to third-party service and maintenance organizations with technicians better able to efficiently support our clients. We expect that this outsourcing will allow the Company to better focus on its technology and innovation while reducing costs related to non-core business functions. However, we also expect that the short-term impact of these significant changes will result in higher costs and a decline in gross margin yield.

 Total cost of revenue, net of 3.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 remained relatively flat compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to 0.2 million in reduced headcount and 0.1 million of reduced cellular costs, partially offset by 0.4 million higher costs related to third party field services. Service cost of revenue, net for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by approximately 0.1 million to approximately 2.4 million, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. This was primarily due to a 0.2 million decline in headcount related expenses due to outsourcing of field services partially offset by a 0.4 million increase in third-party costs. Additionally, there was a 0.1 million decrease in cellular fees as the Company continues to innovate around data usage and associated costs. The service cost of revenue, net includes the average service cost per unit, depreciation of the ASRs, and third-party fees. Additional costs relate to the ongoing maintenance and support of our installed base of ECDs which consists primarily of service personnel, vehicle expense, and warranty repair costs. Product cost of revenue, net was approximately 0.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to approximately 0.8 million for the prior year period. Gross Profit (Loss) The revenue and cost of revenue described above resulted in a gross loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024 of approximately 0.7 million, net, compared to a gross profit of 0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

 investor relations costs and 0.7 million increase in third-party professional fees, primarily legal and finance services. These increases were partially offset by a decline in payroll expenses of 0.5 million and decline of 0.1 in stock compensation expense driven by a headcount reduction in the first quarter of 2024.

The decrease was due to lower production and installation of the ECD products as the Company has been restructuring the formerly CASE Emergency Management business it acquired in 2022. Service revenue, net, comprised of ASR MaaS agreements and ECD maintenance agreements remained relatively flat for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year. ASR services were impacted by the Company s decision to replace ASR K5 v3 machines with K5 v5 machines due to quality and reliability of the older version. Product revenue, primarily composed of the ECD line of products, decreased by approximately 1.8 million or approximately 42 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to a decline in product production and installations. In addition, the structural changes implemented during the first quarter of 2024 and the resulting disruption also led to a period-over-period decline in installations across the ECD products. Cost of revenue, net Service cost of revenue, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by approximately 1.2 million to approximately 8.3 million, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to write-offs related to K5 v3 machines. A high percentage of K5 v3 ASRs did not meet expected quality standards resulting in high service, maintenance and repair costs and low customer satisfaction. During the first quarter of 2024, we decided to discontinue the K5 v3 machines and replace them with the 

 33 

Table of Contents 
 improved, better performing K5 v5 machines. K5 v3 machines, totaling approximately 1.1 million, were written off and recorded in service cost of revenue, net in the current year period and we expect this trend to continue throughout the year as we replace existing client machines. In addition, the Company made the decision to outsource its ECD field services function to third-party service and maintenance organizations with technicians better able to efficiently support our clients. As a result of this change, we saw a 1.2 million increase in third-party fees year-over-year. We expect that this outsourcing will allow the Company to better focus on its technology and innovation while reducing costs related to non-core business functions. Higher costs were partially offset by a 0.4 million reduction in headcount costs, a 0.2 million decline in cellular fees and a 0.1 million decline in software related expenses. The service cost of revenue, net is primarily related to the average service cost per unit, depreciation of the ASRs, and third-party fees. Additional costs relate to the ongoing maintenance and support of our installed base of ECDs which consists primarily of service personnel, vehicle expense, and warranty repair costs. Product cost of revenue, net was approximately 2.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to approximately 2.9 million for the same period in the prior year. The approximate 0.5 million period over period decrease is primarily attributable to lower sales of ECD products. Gross Loss The revenue and cost of revenue described above resulted in a gross loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of approximately 2.7 million, net, compared to a gross loss of approximately 0.2 million, net, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The gross loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included a non-recurring expense of approximately 1.1 million attributed to the retirement of the K5 v3 machines.

The increase is primarily due to higher headcount than in the same period in the prior year which were lower following a workforce reduction in January 2023. Sales and Marketing

The increase was primarily due to increased advertising costs related to the marketing of our Public Safety Infrastructure Bond Offering that closed in March 2024. General and Administrative

Table of Contents 
 General and administrative expenses increased by approximately 0.5 million or approximately 5 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in the prior year. This was primarily driven by a 1.2 million increase in investor relations costs, partially offset by a reduction in payroll expense of 0.9 million, reduction in stock compensation expense of 0.6 million, and a 0.2 million reduction in corporate insurance fees. Third-party professional fees, primarily legal and finance, increased nearly 1.1 million, partially offset by a reduction in consulting fees of 0.2 million. Restructuring Charges 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Change Restructuring Charges 447 149 298 200 Percentage of total revenue 6 2 Restructuring charges were approximately 0.4 million for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to approximately 0.1 million for the same period in the prior year. These charges are related to the Company s strategic decision to outsource its field services team and to consolidate product production in one location. Other Income (expense)

Interest expense decreased by 0.1 million due to a lower debt balance in the current year period as compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in the fair value of warrant and derivative liabilities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 5.5 million more than in the same period in the prior year. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, we had 5.2 million and 2.3 million, respectively, of cash and cash equivalents. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had paid-in capital of 195.5 million, partially offset by an accumulated deficit of approximately 186.2 million, working capital of approximately 0.0 million and total stockholders equity of approximately 9.3 million. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in acquiring additional funding at levels sufficient to fund its future operations. Management s plans include seeking additional financing, such as issuances of equity and issuances of debt and/or convertible debt instruments. Sales of additional equity securities, convertible debt and/or warrants by the Company could result in the dilution of the interests of existing stockholders. The Company will require significant additional financing to meet its planned capital and operational needs and is pursuing opportunities to obtain additional financing through equity and/or debt alternatives. However, there can be no assurance that financing will be available when required in sufficient amounts, on acceptable terms or at all. If the Company is unable to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to it, the Company may have to significantly reduce its operations, delay, scale back or discontinue the development of one or more of its platforms or discontinue operations completely. At-the-Market Offering Program In February 2023, we commenced an at-the-market offering program with H.C. Wainwright Co., LLC Wainwright ), as sales agent, in connection with which we filed a prospectus supplement filed on February 9, 2023 (the February Prospectus Supplement ), allowing us to offer and sell from time to time of up to 20.0 million in shares of Class A Common Stock, subject to, and in accordance with,

In the event that our public float increases or decreases, we may sell securities in public primary offerings on Form S-3 with a value up to one-third of our public float, in each case calculated pursuant to General Instruction I.B.6 and subject to the terms of the ATM Agreement. In the event that our public float increases above 75.0 million, we will no longer be subject to the limits in General Instruction I.B.6 of Form S-3.

Controls and Procedures Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.
