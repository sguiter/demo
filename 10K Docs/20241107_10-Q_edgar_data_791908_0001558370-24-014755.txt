 Unrestricted cash equivalents Total unrestricted cash and cash equivalents Short-term restricted cash Long-term restricted cash Total restricted cash Total unrestricted and restricted cash and cash equivalents Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash consists of bank deposits held in business checking and interest-bearing deposit accounts. Cash equivalent balances are defined as highly liquid financial instruments with an original maturity of three months or less that are both readily convertible to known amounts of cash and so near their maturity that they present insignificant risk of changes in value because of changes in interest rates. Cash equivalents held by the Company are in money market funds and U.S. treasury bills, and are classified as available-for-sale. Allowances are recorded for available-for-sale debt securities with unrealized losses. The amount of credit losses that can be recognized for available-for-sale debt securities is limited to the amount by which carrying value exceeds fair value, and previously recognized credit losses are reversed if the fair value increases.

Cash accounts with any type of restriction are classified as restricted cash. If restrictions are expected to be lifted or to be used to pay a third party in the next twelve months, the restricted cash account is classified as current. On December 15, 2023, XRL deposited million into reserve accounts in connection with the funding of the Blue Owl Loan (see Note 8), of which million was deposited into a reserve account for interest and administrative fees and million was deposited into an operating reserve account to cover operating expenses of XRL. In September 2024, upon receipt of a specified threshold of commercial payments from Roche s VABYSMO, million was released from restricted cash to unrestricted cash pursuant to the terms of the Blue Owl Loan Agreement. Payments of interest under the Blue Owl Loan Agreement are made semi-annually using commercial payments received since the immediately preceding interest payment date under the Affitech CPPA. On each interest payment date, if the commercial payments received are less than the total interest due for the respective quarter, XRL is expected to cover the shortfall in interest payment due from the reserve account. Payments of administrative fees under the Blue Owl Loan Agreement are made semi-annually on January 1 and July 1 of each year from the reserve account. XOMA will be required to fund an additional million into the administrative fee escrow account on July 1, 2027.

 million and as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Effective Interest Rate Method The Company accounts for rights to future milestones, royalties, and commercial payments related to commercial products which have an established reliable sales pattern under the EIR method. The EIR is calculated by forecasting the expected cash flows to be received over the life of the asset relative to the receivable s carrying amount at the time when the Company determines that there are reliable cash flows. The carrying amount of a receivable is made up of the opening balance, which is increased by accrued income and decreased by cash receipts in the period to arrive at the ending balance. The EIR is recalculated at each reporting period as differences between expected cash flows and actual cash flows are realized and as there are changes to the expected future cash flows. Receivables related to income from purchased receivables under the EIR method, all which were short-term receivables, totaled million and as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

The Company classified the proceeds received from HCRP as unearned revenue, to be recognized as revenue under the units-of-revenue method over the life of the license agreements because of the Company s limited continuing involvement in the Royalty Sale Agreements. Such limited continuing involvement is related to the Company s undertaking to cooperate with HCRP in the event of litigation or a dispute related to the license agreements. Because the transaction was structured as a non-cancellable sale, the Company does not have significant continuing involvement in the generation of the cash flows due to HCRP and there are no guaranteed rates of return to HCRP, the Company recorded the total proceeds of million as unearned revenue recognized under the units-of-revenue method. The Company allocated the total proceeds between the Royalty Sale Agreements based on the relative fair value of expected payments to be made to HCRP under the license agreements. The unearned revenue is being recognized as revenue over the life of the underlying license agreements under units-of-revenue method. Under this method, amortization for a reporting period is calculated by computing a ratio of the allocated proceeds received from HCRP to the payments expected to be made by the licensees to HCRP over the term of the Royalty Sale Agreements, and then applying that ratio to the period s cash payment.

Overview XOMA is a biotech royalty aggregator. On July 10, 2024, we changed our name from XOMA Corporation to XOMA Royalty Corporation. We have a sizable portfolio of economic rights to future potential milestone and royalty payments associated with partnered commercial and pre-commercial therapeutic candidates. Our portfolio was built through the acquisition of rights to future milestones, royalties, and commercial payments, since our royalty aggregator business model was implemented in 2017, combined with out-licensing our proprietary products and platforms from our legacy discovery and development business. Our royalty aggregator business is primarily focused on early to mid-stage clinical assets, primarily in Phase 1 and 2, with significant commercial sales potential that are licensed to large-cap partners. We also acquire milestone and royalty revenue streams on late-stage clinical assets and commercial assets that are designed to address unmet markets or have a therapeutic advantage, have long duration of market exclusivity, and are expected to deliver a financial return to us in a short timeframe. We expect most of our future income and revenue to be based on payments we may receive for milestones and royalties associated with these acquired programs. The generation of future income and revenues related to licenses, milestone payments, and royalties is dependent on the achievement of milestones or product sales by our existing partners and licensees. We generated net loss of 17.2 million and 9.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, net cash used in operating activities was 10.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and we had an accumulated deficit of 1.2 billion as of September 30, 2024. We generated a net loss of 40.8 million, net cash used in operating activities was 18.2 million, and we had an accumulated deficit of 1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023. Portfolio Updates Royalty and Commercial Payment Purchase Agreements Twist Bioscience Royalty Purchase Agreement On October 21, 2024, we entered into a royalty purchase agreement with Twist Bioscience Corporation Twist Bioscience ). Under the terms of the agreement, we acquired 50 of certain contingent payments (including royalties, milestone payments, sublicense income, and option exercise payments) related to Twist Bioscience s 60-plus early-stage programs across 30 partners for a 15.0 million upfront payment. We are eligible to receive up to 0.5 billion in milestone payments and a 50 share of up to low single-digit royalties on future commercial sales. LadRx Agreements In January 2024, Zevra announced that the FDA accepted its NDA resubmission for arimoclomol and pursuant to the LadRx Agreement s , we made a 1.0 million milestone payment to LadRx in January 2024.

 In June 2024, the ImmunityBio License Agreement was terminated, and we entered into an amendment to the LadRx RPA. Under the LadRx RPA, as amended, we are eligible to receive potential low single-digit percentage royalty payments on aggregate net sales of aldoxorubicin. Additionally, the amendment removed the remaining 4.0 million regulatory milestone payment under the original agreement that had been contingent upon the achievement of a specified regulatory milestone for the product candidate related to aldoxorubicin. If LadRx licenses aldoxorubicin to an applicable third party, we are eligible to receive potential high single-digit percentage royalty payments on aggregate net sales of aldoxorubicin and a portion of any potential future milestone payments. In September 2024, Zevra announced that the FDA granted approval to Zevra s NDA for MIPLYFFA. The achievement of the commercial milestone payment under the LadRx AAA was considered probable as of September 30, 2024, and we recognized a 1.0 million contingent liability. Pursuant to the LadRx AAA, we earned a 2.2 million milestone payment upon FDA approval (net of certain outbound payments to third parties), and we are also eligible to receive mid-single-digit royalties on net sales of MIPLYFFA. Affitech Commercial Payment Purchase Agreement Pursuant to our Affitech CPPA, we are eligible to receive commercial payments from Roche consisting of 0.5 of net sales of VABYSMO for a ten-year period following the first commercial sale in each applicable jurisdiction. VABYSMO is approved by the FDA and the EMA for the treatment of wet, or neovascular, age-related macular degeneration, diabetic macular edema, and macular edema following retinal vein occlusion. Payments are due from Roche within 60 days of December 31 and June 30 of each year. In February 2024, we received 7.4 million representing our commercial payment received from sales of VABYSMO during the last six months of 2023 under the Affitech CPPA. In August 2024, we received 9.5 million representing our commercial payment received from sales of VABYSMO during the first six months of 2024 under the Affitech CPPA. We used these cash receipts to fund contractual interest payments and partially repay the principal balance on our Blue Owl Loan (see Note 8 to the condensed consolidated financial statements ). For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a total of 5.4 million and 10.0 million in income from purchased receivables related to the Affitech CPPA under the EIR method for sales of VABYSMO during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Agenus Royalty Purchase Agreement Based on updates received in July 2024, we evaluated the status of this program for potential impairment, and we recorded an impairment charge of 14.0 million in the third quarter of 2024 (see Note 5 to the condensed consolidated financial statements). Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires us to make estimates, assumptions, and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We routinely evaluate our estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a significant level of judgment and/or estimation uncertainty and could have or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Except as discussed in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2024, there have been no significant changes in our critical accounting estimates during the nine months ended September 30, 2024,

We expect the income related to VABYSMO to increase in future periods as we expect the related sales to increase in future periods. We expect the income from royalties on OJEMDA, which was launched in the second quarter of 2024, to increase in future periods as we expect the related sales to increase in future periods. There was no income from purchased receivables for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 R D Expenses For the three months ended September 30, 2024, R D expenses were 0.8 million compared with 25,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of approximately 0.8 million was primarily due to clinical trial costs related to KIN-3248. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, R D expenses were 2.0 million compared to 0.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of 1.9 million was primarily due to clinical trial costs related to KIN-3248. We are in the process of winding down the study, and we expect to incur continued R D costs related to KIN-3248 until the study is completed. We may also incur additional R D costs related to stability studies and the storage of the remaining programs obtained in the Kinnate acquisition. G A Expenses G A expenses include salaries and related personnel costs, professional fees, and facilities costs. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, G A expenses were 8.0 million compared with 6.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of 1.6 million included 1.4 million in total costs incurred after our acquisition of Kinnate, which included 1.1 million in legal and consulting costs, 0.1 million in information technology costs, and 0.1 million in insurance costs. We also had an increase of 0.2 million in salaries and related costs associated with Mr. Hughes role as CEO in a full-time capacity. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, G A expenses were 27.5 million compared with 18.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of 9.2 million was primarily due to 6.9 million in costs associated with our acquisition of Kinnate, which primarily included 3.6 million in severance costs for exit packages provided to Kinnate senior leadership, 2.6 million in legal and consulting costs, 0.2 million in information technology costs, and 0.1 million in insurance costs. In addition, we had an increase of 1.6 million in stock-based compensation expenses primarily due to the PSU grant to Mr. Hughes in connection with his appointment as full-time CEO in January 2024. We expect G A costs associated with our acquisition of Kinnate to decrease in future periods as we continue to wind down Kinnate operations. Royalty Purchase Agreement Asset Impairment Royalty purchase agreement asset impairment was 14.0 million and 23.0 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and consisted of the impairment charge of 9.0 million related to our Aronora RPA in the second quarter of 2024 and the impairment charge of 14.0 million related to our Agenus RPA in the third quarter of 2024.

There were no arbitration settlement costs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Other Income (Expense) Gain on the Acquisition of Kinnate During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a 19.3 million gain on the acquisition of Kinnate due to the fair value of net assets acquired in the acquisition of Kinnate exceeding the total purchase consideration (see Note 4 to the condensed consolidated financial statements).

Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was as follows (in thousands): 

Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change Other income (expense), net Investment income 1,698 385 1,313 5,088 1,238 3,850 Change in fair value of equity securities 89 (107) 196 624 (121) 745 Change in fair value of contingent consideration 75 (75) Sublease income 103 103 170 170 Other 18 18 Total other income (expense), net 1,890 278 1,612 5,900 1,192 4,708 Investment income increased by 1.3 million and 3.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared with the same periods in 2023 due to higher investment balances in 2024. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the change in fair value of equity securities was due to the change in market price for our shares of Rezolute s common stock. The change in fair value of contingent consideration for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was due to the reduction in the fair value of the 75,000 contingent consideration related to the Bioasis RPA to zero. There were no changes in fair value of contingent consideration for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Sublease income increased by 0.1 million and 0.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared with the same periods in 2023 due to the lease assignment agreement acquired under the Kinnate acquisition.

 Provision for Income Taxes We recorded no provision for federal income tax during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. We continue to maintain a full valuation allowance against our remaining net deferred tax assets. We had a total of 5.9 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, none of which would impact our effective tax rate to the extent that we continue to maintain a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets. We do not expect our unrecognized tax benefits to change significantly over the next twelve months. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our cash and cash equivalents, working capital, and cash flow activities as of and for each of the periods presented were as follows (in thousands): 

September 30, December 31, 2024 2023 Change Cash and cash equivalents (1) 142,050 153,290 (11,240) Working capital 137,887 149,814 (11,927) (1) Unrestricted. 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Net cash used in operating activities (10,845) (14,231) 3,386 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities 8,172 (6,222) 14,394 Net cash used in financing activities (10,061) (3,901) (6,160) Net decrease in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash (12,734) (24,354) 11,620 Net cash used in operating activities decreased by 3.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change was primarily driven by an increase in operating cash inflows from our partners and licensees (including 8.6 million related to the Viracta RPA and 5.0 million from Rezolute), partially offset by 7.7 million in net payments related to Kinnate operations after our acquisition. Net cash provided by investing activities was 8.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with net cash used in investing activities of 6.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The difference was largely due to the 18.9 million net cash obtained in our Kinnate acquisition plus an increase of 9.6 million in receipts of commercial payments from sales of VABYSMO, and 8.5 million received pursuant to our Viracta RPA, partially offset by new RPAs and CPPAs in 2024 (including 22.0 million for the Dar RPAs and 8.0 million for Talphera CPPA). Net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 10.1 million compared with 3.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The difference was primarily driven by principal payments under our Blue Owl Loan and a higher volume of stock option exercises in 2024. Capital Resources We have incurred significant operating losses since our inception and as of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 1.2 billion. As of September 30, 2024, we had 142.0 million in cash and cash equivalents and 4.8 million in restricted cash. Based on our current cash balance and our planned discretionary spending, such as royalty or other acquisitions, we believe that our current financial resources are sufficient to fund our planned operations, commitments, and contractual obligations for a period of at least one year following the filing date of this report. We have primarily financed our operations and acquisitions through debt facilities, the issuance of our common stock, Series A and Series B Preferred Stock, and amounts received as milestone payments under our license agreements.

 In December 2023, XRL entered into the Blue Owl Loan Agreement (see Note 8 to the condensed consolidated financial statements and further details below in Long-Term Debt ). We intend to use the net cash received from the Blue Owl Loan and Kinnate acquisition, together with our existing capital resources, to fund our ongoing operations, to repurchase common stock, and for working capital and other general corporate purposes. The generation of future income and revenue related to licenses, milestone payments, and royalties is dependent on the achievement of milestones or product sales by our existing partners. Milestone payments earned in prior periods are not indicative of anticipated milestone payments in future periods. We may seek additional capital through our 2018 Common Stock ATM Agreement or our 2021 Series B Preferred Stock ATM Agreement (see Note 12 to the condensed consolidated financial statements), or through other public or private debt or equity transactions. Our ability to raise additional capital in the equity and debt markets, should we choose to do so, is dependent on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the market demand for our common and preferred stock, which are subject to a number of development and business risks and uncertainties, our creditworthiness and whether were are able to raise such additional capital at a price or on terms that are favorable to us, if at all. If we are unable to raise additional funds when we need them, our business and operations may be adversely affected. Material Cash Requirements Our material cash requirements in the short and long term consist of the following: Operating Expenditures: Our primary uses of cash and our operating expenses include employee and related costs, consultant fees to support our administrative and business development efforts, legal and accounting fees, insurance costs, and costs associated with our investor relations and IT services. To support our royalty aggregator business model, we engage third parties to assist in the evaluation of potential acquisitions of milestone payments and royalty streams. Additional operating expenses, including consulting and legal costs, is expected to continue to increase in the fourth quarter of 2024 in response to an anticipated increase in the volume of royalty or acquisition targets evaluated or completed. In June 2023 we entered into a lease for our headquarters in Emeryville, California. The lease commenced in November 2023 and has a term of 65 months. As of September 30, 2024, we expect to incur incremental undiscounted costs of 0.4 million associated with our building lease. We will be required to make future R D and G A expenditures related to the obligations and liabilities we assumed in the Kinnate acquisition. We expect these costs to be funded in full by the cash we received upon close of the merger. Share Repurchase Program: On January 2, 2024, our Board authorized our first stock repurchase program, which permits us to purchase up to 50.0 million of our common stock through January 2027. We did not make any purchases under the program in the three months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, we had purchased a total of 660 shares of common stock pursuant to the stock repurchase program for 13,000. Long-Term Debt: Under the Blue Owl Loan Agreement, the outstanding principal balance will bear interest at an annual rate of 9.875 . XRL began making payments of interest under the Blue Owl Loan Agreement semi-annually, in March 2024 using the royalties received on worldwide net sales of VABYSMO, pursuant to the Affitech CPPA. On each interest payment date, any shortfall in interest payment will be paid from the interest reserve, any uncured shortfall in interest payment that exceeds the interest reserve will increase the outstanding principal amount of the loan, and any royalty payments in excess of accrued interest on the loan will be used to repay the principal of the loan until the balance is fully repaid. As of September 30, 2024, XRL held restricted cash of 4.8 million in reserve accounts that may only be used to pay interest and administrative fees and XRL s operating expenses pursuant to the Blue Owl Loan Agreement. As of September 30, 2024, the current and non-current portion of the initial term loan was 9.8 million and 108.1 million, respectively, and 4.7 million of the restricted cash was classified as non-current.

 Exarafenib Milestone Contingent Consideration: Under the Kinnate CVR Agreement, Kinnate CVR holders are entitled to 100 of net proceeds of the 30.5 million milestone related to the sale of exarafenib to Pierre Fabre in February 2024. We expect these payments to be fully funded by the receipt of the Exarafenib milestone asset. RPAs, AAAs, and CPPAs: A significant component of our business model is to acquire rights to potential future milestone payments and royalty payment streams. We expect to continue deploying capital toward these acquisitions in the near and long term. We have paid 1.0 million for a milestone payment due under our agreement with LadRx in January 2024 and 6.0 million for sales milestones due under our agreement with Affitech in March 2024. We have up to an additional 6.0 million and 1.0 million in milestone payments that may become due under the Affitech CPPA and LadRx Agreements, respectively. We will be obligated to pay an additional 11.0 million for each successive 22.0 million received by us under the Dar RPAs after achievement of a return threshold of 88.0 million. We recorded 4.0 million of contingent consideration related to our RPAs, AAAs, and CPPAs on our condensed consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2024. In addition, we have potential sales-based milestone payments that may become due under our agreements with Aronora and Kuros. All of these milestones and royalty payments represent a portion of the funds we may receive in the future pursuant to these agreements, and therefore we expect these payments to be fully funded by the related royalty or commercial payment receipts. Collaborative Agreements, Royalties, and Milestone Payments : We may need to make potential future milestone payments and pay legal fees to third parties as part of our licensing and development programs. Payments under these agreements become due and payable only upon the achievement of certain developmental, regulatory, and commercial milestones by our licensees. Because it is uncertain if and when these milestones will be achieved, such contingencies, aggregating up to 6.3 million (assuming one product per contract meets all milestone events) have not been recorded on our condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024. We are unable to determine precisely when and if our payment obligations under the agreements will become due as these obligations are based on milestone events, the achievement of which is subject to a significant number of risks and uncertainties. We expect all payments due to be funded by a portion of the related milestone or royalty revenue we receive or we expect these payments to be reimbursed by our licensees. Dividends : Holders of our Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to receive, when and as declared by our Board, cumulative cash dividends at the rate of 8.625 of the 25.00 liquidation preference per year (equivalent to 2.15625 per share of Series A Preferred Stock per year). Holders of Series B Depositary Shares are entitled to receive, when and as declared by our Board, cumulative cash dividends at the rate of 8.375 of the 25,000 liquidation preference per share of Series B Preferred Stock 25.00 per depositary share) per year, which is equivalent to 2,093.75 per year per share of Series B Preferred Stock 2.09375 per year per depositary share). Dividends on the Series A and Series B Preferred Stock are payable in arrears on or about the 15th day of January, April, July, and October of each year. Since original issuance, all dividends have been paid as scheduled. We expect to continue making these dividend payments as scheduled using our existing capital resources. Changes in Commitments and Contingencies Our commitments and contingencies were reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC. Except as described below, there have been no material changes during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from the commitments and contingencies previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. On April 3, 2024, we entered into the Kinnate CVR Agreement in connection with the Kinnate acquisition. Pursuant to the agreement, we are obligated to pay up to 30.5 million to Kinnate CVR holders upon the achievement of a certain specified milestone related to the February 2024 sale of exarafenib and related IP to Pierre Fabre. We may be obligated to make additional contingent payments from any license or other disposition of any or all rights to any product, product candidate or research programs active at Kinnate that occurs within one year from April 3, 2024.

 On April 29, 2024, we entered into the Dar RPAs pursuant to which we acquired rights to royalty and milestone payments related to XACIATO, OVAPRENE, and Sildenafil Cream. We are obligated to pay an additional 11.0 million for each successive 22.0 million received by us under the Dar RPAs after achievement of a return threshold of 88.0 million. On June 3, 2024, we entered into an amendment to the LadRx RPA that removed the 4.0 million regulatory milestone payment that had been contingent upon the achievement of a specified regulatory milestone for the product candidate related to aldoxorubicin. On September 20, 2024, Zevra announced that the FDA granted approval to Zevra s NDA for MIPLYFFA and we recognized a 1.0 million liability for a commercial milestone payment. Based on the reported 2024 sales of VABYSMO through September 30, 2024, we recognized 3.0 million in liabilities for sales-based milestone payments. ITEM 3.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS We are not currently engaged in any legal proceedings that, in the opinion of our management, if determined adversely to us, would individually or taken together, have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position or cash flows. However, from time to time, we may become involved in litigation, arbitration or other proceedings relating to claims arising from the ordinary course of business. We may become involved in material legal proceedings in the future, and the potential impact on us of any on-going proceeding which we do not currently believe to be material could become material. Such matters are subject to significant uncertainties, and there can be no assurance that any legal proceedings in which we are or may become involved will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
