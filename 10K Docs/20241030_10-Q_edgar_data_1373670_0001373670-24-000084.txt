 The Company elected the short-term lease recognition exemption for all leases that, at the commencement date, have a lease term of 12 months or less and do not include an option to purchase the underlying asset that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise. For such leases, the Company does not recognize right-of-use assets or lease liabilities and instead recognizes lease payments in the condensed consolidated income statements on a straight-line basis. Short-term lease cost of million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and 0.2 million and 0.7 million for the comparable prior year periods, is included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of income. 
 
 Legal Matters 
 Lawsuits, claims and proceedings may be instituted or asserted against us in the normal course of business. The Company is also subject to local, state and federal laws and regulations related to land development activities, house construction standards, sales practices, title company regulations, employment practices and environmental protection. As a result, the Company may be subject to periodic examinations or inquiry by agencies administering these laws and regulations. 
 
 The Company records an accrual for legal claims and regulatory matters when they are probable of occurring and a potential loss is reasonably estimable. The Company accrues for these matters based on facts and circumstances specific to each matter and revises these estimates when necessary. 
 
 In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting outcomes of legal claims and related contingencies, the Company generally cannot predict their ultimate resolution, related timing or eventual loss. If evaluations indicate loss contingencies that could be material are not probable, but are reasonably possible, the Company will disclose their nature with an estimate of the possible range of losses or a statement that such loss is not reasonably estimable. We believe that the disposition of legal claims and related contingencies will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and liquidity or on our financial condition.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 
 The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC on February 29, 2024 and our condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 Overview and Outlook 
 Our key financial and operating metrics are home deliveries, home closings revenue, average sales price of homes delivered, net new home orders, which refers to sales contracts executed reduced by the number of sales contracts canceled during the relevant period, and homebuilding gross margin. Our results for each key financial and operating metric, as compared to the same period in 2023, are provided below: Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Home deliveries Increased by 26.8 
 Increased by 20.3 
 Home closings revenue Increased by 25.7 
 Increased by 14.7 
 Average sales price of homes delivered Decreased by 0.8 
 Decreased by 4.7 
 Net new home orders Increased by 11.3 
 Increased by 4.7 
 Homebuilding gross margin percentage Decreased by 60 bps 
 Increased by 290 bps 

Our strong operating results continued to be driven by our superior infill and infill-adjacent locations in high-growth markets, reduced cycle times, and the strong demand for new homes in our markets. Our average active selling communities increased 22.1 for the quarter while the average sales price of homes delivered decreased 0.8 . We maintained a strong homebuilding gross margin of 32.7 . 
 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Residential Units Revenue and New Homes Delivered 
 The table below represents residential units revenue and new homes delivered for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (dollars in thousands): Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Home closings revenue 522,859 415,827 107,032 25.7 Mechanic s lien contracts revenue 96 (96) (100.0) Residential units revenue 522,859 415,923 106,936 25.7 New homes delivered 956 754 202 26.8 Average sales price of homes delivered 546.9 551.5 (4.6) (0.8) 
 
 The 25.7 increase in residential units revenue was primarily driven by the 26.8 increase in new homes delivered partially offset by a 0.8 decrease in average sales price of new homes delivered for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in new homes delivered is attributable to the limited competition in our infill and infill-adjacent community sites, our reduced cycle times, and the continued low supply of existing and new home inventory in our markets.

New Home Orders and Backlog 
 The table below represents new home orders and backlog related to our builder operations segments, excluding mechanic s lien contracts (dollars in thousands): Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Net new home orders 877 788 89 11.3 Revenue from net new home orders 454,358 452,436 1,922 0.4 Average selling price of net new home orders 518.1 574.2 (56.1) (9.8) Cancellation rate 8.5 6.1 2.4 39.3 Absorption rate per average active selling community per quarter 8.4 9.2 (0.8) (8.7) Average active selling communities 105 86 19 22.1 Active selling communities at end of period 106 86 20 23.3 Backlog revenue 581,848 622,560 (40,712) (6.5) Backlog units 809 916 (107) (11.7) Average sales price of backlog 719.2 679.7 39.5 5.8 
 
 Net new home orders increased 11.3 over the prior year period and our average active selling communities increased 22.1 due to the continued opening of new communities. As a result, our absorption rate per average active selling community decreased 8.7 year over year, which was primarily due to the impact of what we believe is buyer expectations for the expected drop in short-term rates to result in lower mortgage rates. Revenue from net new home orders was substantially in line with the prior year period. 
 
 Backlog revenue refers to homes under sales contracts that have not yet closed at the end of the respective period, and absorption rate refers to the rate at which net new home orders are contracted per average active selling community during the respective period. Sales contracts may be canceled prior to closing for a number of reasons, including the inability of the homebuyer to obtain suitable mortgage financing. Accordingly, backlog may not be indicative of our future revenue. 
 
 Backlog revenue decreased by 6.5 due to a 11.7 decrease in backlog units offset by a 5.8 increase in the average sales price of backlog units. 
 
 Our cancellation rate, which refers to sales contracts canceled divided by sales contracts executed during the relevant period, was 8.5 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 6.1 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Our cancellation rate remained in a historically low range under 10.0 since December 31, 2022. 
 
 Residential Units Gross Margin

 Residential units revenue increased by 106.9 million or 25.7 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, mainly due to a an increase in homes delivered of 26.8 and partially offset by a decrease in the average sales price of homes delivered. Cost of residential units as a percent of residential units revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was relatively unchanged at 67.3 compared to 66.7 in the same period in the previous year. 
 
 Residential units gross margin for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 60 bps to 32.7 , from 33.3 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in residential units gross margin is attributable to product mix and higher incentives.

 Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased by 0.2 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 due to an increase in builder operations revenues with better leveraging of overhead costs. 
 
 Builder Operations 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue for builder operations decreased by 0.2 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 due to an increase in builder operations revenues with better leveraging of our overhead costs. Builder operations expenditures include salary expenses, sales commissions, and community costs such as advertising and marketing expenses, rent, professional fees, and non-capitalized property taxes. 
 
 Corporate, Other and Unallocated 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses for the corporate, other and unallocated non-operating segment for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 2.3 million, compared to 0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Corporate, other and unallocated expenses generally include capitalized overhead adjustments that are not allocated to builder operations segments. 
 
 Equity in Income of Unconsolidated Entities 
 Equity in income of unconsolidated entities decreased to 1.0 million, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. See Note 3 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a summary of Green Brick s share in net earnings by unconsolidated entity.

 Income Tax Expense 
 Income tax expense was 23.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 21.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was substantially due to higher taxable income partially offset by a lower effective tax rate, lower state tax rates, and a discrete tax benefit for equity compensation deductions. See Note 11 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a discussion on the Company s income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024.

 Residential Units Revenue and New Homes Delivered 
 The table below represents residential units revenue and new homes delivered for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (dollars in thousands): Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Home closings revenue 1,512,901 1,319,393 193,508 14.7 Mechanic s lien contracts revenue 380 1,337 (957) (71.6) Residential units revenue 1,513,281 1,320,730 192,551 14.6 New homes delivered 2,764 2,298 466 20.3 Average sales price of homes delivered 547.4 574.1 (26.7) (4.7) 
 
 The 192.6 million increase in residential units revenue was driven by the 20.3 increase in new homes delivered partially offset by a 4.7 decrease in the average sales price of homes delivered for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in new homes delivered was primarily driven by an increase in active selling communities and home starts and an improvement in cycle times. The 4.7 decrease in the average sales price of homes delivered for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was a result of closing out infill communities and opening new communities in surrounding infill-adjacent areas. 
 
 New Home Orders 
 The table below represents new home orders and backlog related to our builder operations segments, excluding mechanic s lien contracts (dollars in thousands): Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Net new home orders 2,803 2,677 126 4.7 Revenue from net new home orders 1,539,549 1,572,859 (33,310) (2.1) Average selling price of net new home orders 549.3 587.5 (38.2) (6.5) Cancellation rate 7.1 6.5 0.6 9.2 Absorption rate per average active selling community per quarter 9.3 10.8 (1.5) (13.9) Average active selling communities 100 83 17 20.5 Active selling communities at end of period 106 86 20 23.3 
 
 Net new home orders increased 4.7 over the prior year period while our average active selling communities increased 20.5 . As a result, our absorption rate per average active selling community decreased 13.9 year over year, which was primarily due to the impact of increased mortgage rates, the metering of sales in certain infill communities, what we believe is the return of pre-pandemic seasonality that began in the second quarter, and buyer expectations for the expected drop in short-term rates to result in lower mortgage rates. The 2.1 decrease in revenue from net new home orders is primarily attributable to a higher mix of sales from newer, infill adjacent communities at lower average selling prices and fewer sales from closed-out, infill communities where we typically face more limited competition and have higher sales prices . 
 
 Our cancellation rate, which refers to sales contracts canceled divided by sales contracts executed during the relevant period, was 7.1 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 6.5 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our cancellation rate remained in a historically low range under 10.0 since December 31, 2022.

 Residential units revenue increased 192.6 million or 14.6 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to the increase in home deliveries of 20.3 , partially offset by lower average sales prices. Cost of residential units as a percent of residential units revenue was 66.4 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 69.3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to a combination of lower direct construction costs and lower lot costs associated with the higher mix of deliveries from infill-adjacent communities. 
 
 Residential units gross margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased 290 bps to 33.6 , from 30.7 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in residential units gross margin is attributable to product mix and limited competition in our infill and infill-adjacent community sites.

commissions, and community costs such as advertising and marketing expenses, rent, professional fees, and non-capitalized property taxes. 
 
 Corporate, Other and Unallocated 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses for the corporate, other and unallocated non-operating segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 6.0 million and de minimis for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was driven by incentive compensation and salary expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Corporate, other and unallocated expenses generally include capitalized overhead adjustments that are not allocated to builder operations segments. 
 
 Equity in Income of Unconsolidated Entities 
 Equity in income of unconsolidated entities decreased to 4.8 million, or 57.7 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 11.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease is mainly due to the sale of our ownership interest in Challenger during the three months ended March 31, 2024, wherein, we recognized only one month of net earnings from this investment compared to nine months in the prior year. See Note 3 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a summary of Green Brick s share in net earnings by unconsolidated entity. 
 
 Other Income, Net 
 Other income, net, increased to 25.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 13.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to a 10.7 million gain in the sale of our investment in Challenger. 
 
 Income Tax Expense 
 Income tax expense was 71.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 63.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was substantially due to higher taxable income partially offset by a lower effective tax rate, lower state tax rates, and a discrete tax benefit for equity compensation deductions. See Note 11 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a discussion on the Company s income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had 80.1 million and 179.8 million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, respectively. Our historical cash management strategy includes redeploying net cash from the sale of home inventory to acquire and develop land and lots that represent opportunities to generate desired margins and returns, and using cash to make additional investments in business acquisitions, joint ventures, share repurchases, or other strategic activities. 
 
 Our principal uses of capital for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were home construction, land purchases, land development, repayments of debt, operating expenses, share repurchases, and payment of routine liabilities. Historically, we have used funds generated by operations and available borrowings to meet our short-term working capital requirements. We remain focused on generating positive margins in our homebuilding operations and acquiring desirable land positions in order to maintain a strong balance sheet and remain poised for continued growth. 
 
 Cash flows for each of our communities depend on the community s stage in the development cycle. Early stages of development or expansion require significant cash outlays for land acquisitions, entitlements and other approvals, roads, utilities, general landscaping and other amenities, and home construction. These costs are a component of our inventory and are not recognized in our statement of income until a home closes. In the later stages of community life cycle, cash inflows may significantly exceed earnings reported for financial statement purposes, as the cash outflows associated with home construction and land development previously occurred. 
 
 Effective February 1, 2024, we sold our ownership interest in GB Challenger, LLC Challenger to the entity that already held the controlling interest in Challenger for approximately 64.0 million in cash. We have been using and intend to continue to use the proceeds from the transaction for investment in and expansion of opportunities with those builders in which we hold a controlling or one-hundred percent (100 ownership interest, particularly including the growth and expansion of our Trophy Signature Homes brand into the Austin and Houston markets and other potential new markets. 
 
 Our debt to total capitalization ratio, which is calculated as the sum of borrowings on lines of credit, the senior unsecured notes, and notes payable, net of debt issuance costs total debt ), divided by the total capitalization, which equals the sum of Green Brick Partners, Inc. stockholders equity and total debt, was approximately 16.4 as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Additionally, as of September 30, 2024, our net debt to total capitalization ratio, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, remained low at 12.5 . It is our intent to prudently employ leverage to continue to invest in our land acquisition, development and homebuilding activities.

Reconciliation of a Non-GAAP Financial Measure 
 In this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we utilize a financial measure of net debt to total capitalization ratio that is a non-GAAP financial measure as defined by the SEC. Net debt to total capitalization is calculated as total debt less cash and cash equivalents, divided by the sum of total Green Brick Partners, Inc. stockholders equity and total debt less cash and cash equivalents. We present this measure because we believe it is useful to management and investors in evaluating the Company s financing structure. We also believe this measure facilitates the comparison of our financing structure with other companies in our industry. Because this measure is not calculated in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP ), it may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. 
 
 The closest GAAP financial measure to the net debt to total capitalization ratio is the debt to total capitalization ratio. The following table represents a reconciliation of the net debt to total capitalization ratio as of September 30, 2024 (dollars in thousands): 
 Gross Cash and cash equivalents Net Total debt, net of debt issuance costs 297,276 (80,069) 217,207 Total Green Brick Partners, Inc. stockholders equity 1,520,737 1,520,737 Total capitalization 1,818,013 (80,069) 1,737,944 Debt to total capitalization ratio 16.4 Net debt to total capitalization ratio 12.5 
 
 Key Sources of Liquidity 
 The Company s key sources of liquidity were funds generated by operations and borrowings during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Cash Flows 
 The following summarizes our primary sources and uses of cash during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023: 
 
 Operating activities. Net cash used for operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 3.0 million, compared to 232.7 million provided by operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The net cash outflows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were primarily driven by an increase in inventory of 383.9 million, partially offset by 300.7 million of cash generated from business operations and the deferral of expense payments through a 82.5 million increase in accrued expenses and accounts payable. 
 
 Investing activities. Net cash provided by investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 34.6 million, compared to net cash used of 10.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The cash inflows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were primarily from proceeds of 64.0 million from the sale of our interest in Challenger in February 2024, partially offset by 25.8 million used in other investments in unconsolidated entities. 
 
 Financing activities. Net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 126.4 million, compared to net cash used of 69.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The cash outflows were primarily related to share repurchases of 48.0 million, repayments of our senior unsecured notes of 37.5 million and notes payable of 13.0 million. 
 
 Debt Instruments 
 Secured Revolving Credit Facility As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had no amounts outstanding under our 35.0 million Secured Revolving Credit Facility. Borrowings under the Secured Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a floating rate per annum equal to the rate announced by Bank of America, N.A. as its Prime Rate less 0.25 ,

Outstanding advances under the Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility accrue interest at the benchmark rate plus 2.5 . As amended, 300.0 million of the commitments under the credit facility mature on December 14, 2026, with the remaining 25.0 million of the commitments expiring December 14, 2025.

Interest accrues at an annual rate of 4.0 and is payable quarterly. Principal on the 2026 Notes of 12.5 million is due on August 8, 2025 and the remaining principal amount of 50.0 million is due on August 8, 2026.

 In February 2021, we issued 125.0 million of senior unsecured notes (the 2028 Notes of which 100.0 million is outstanding as of September 30, 2024. Interest accrues at an annual rate of 3.25 and is payable quarterly. Principal on the 2028 Notes is due in increments of 25.0 million annually on February 25 in each of 2025, 2026, 2027, and 2028.

 Optional prepayment is allowed with payment of a make-whole premium that fluctuates depending on market interest rates. Interest is payable quarterly in arrears. 
 
 Our debt instruments require us to maintain specific financial covenants, each of which we were in compliance with as of September 30, 2024. Specifically, under the most restrictive covenants, we are required to maintain the following: 
 
 a minimum interest coverage (consolidated EBITDA to interest incurred) of no less than 2.0 to 1.0. As of September 30, 2024, our interest coverage on a last 12 months basis was 33.16 to 1.0; 
 a Consolidated Tangible Net Worth of no less than approximately 960.0 million. As of September 30, 2024, our Consolidated Tangible Net Worth was 1,519.8 million; and 
 a maximum debt to total capitalization rolling average ratio of no more than 40.0 . As of September 30, 2024, we had a rolling average ratio of 17.3 . 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we believe that our cash on hand, capacity available under our lines of credit and cash flows from operations for the next twelve months will be sufficient to service our outstanding debt during the next twelve months and fund our operations. For additional information on our lines of credit, senior unsecured notes, and notes payable, refer to Note 5 to the condensed consolidated financial statements located in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 Preferred Equity

We will pay cumulative cash dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock, when and as declared by the Board, at the rate of 5.75 of the 25,000 liquidation preference per share. Dividends will be payable quarterly in arrears. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we paid dividends of 2.2 million on the Series A Preferred Stock.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations 
 
 Land and Lot Option Contracts 
 In the ordinary course of business, we enter into land purchase contracts in order to procure lots for the construction of our homes in the future. We are subject to customary obligations associated with such contracts. These purchase contracts typically require an earnest money deposit, and the purchase of properties under these contracts is generally contingent upon satisfaction of certain requirements, including obtaining applicable property and development entitlements. 
 
 We also utilize option contracts with lot sellers as a method of acquiring lots in staged takedowns, which are the schedules that dictate when lots must be purchased to help manage the financial and market risk associated with land holdings, and to reduce the use of funds from our corporate financing sources. Lot option contracts generally require us to pay a non-refundable deposit for the right to acquire lots over a specified period of time at pre-determined prices that typically include escalations in lot prices over time. 
 
 Our utilization of lot option contracts is dependent on, among other things, the availability of land sellers willing to enter into these arrangements, the availability of capital to finance the development of optioned lots, general housing market conditions and local market dynamics. Options may be more difficult to procure from land sellers in strong housing markets and are more prevalent in certain geographic regions. 
 
 We generally have the right, at our discretion, to terminate our obligations under both purchase contracts and option contracts by forfeiting the earnest money deposit with no further financial responsibility to the seller. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had earnest money deposits of 10.2 million at risk associated with contracts to purchase raw land and finished lots representing 3,380 total lots past feasibility studies with an aggregate purchase price of approximately 166.4 million. 
 
 Guarantees 
 In certain of our unconsolidated joint ventures, the joint ventures enter into loan agreements, whereby we or one of our subsidiaries will provide the joint venture lenders with customary completion guarantees subject to usual non-recourse terms. 
 
 Seasonality 
 
 The homebuilding industry experiences seasonal fluctuations in quarterly operating results and capital requirements. We typically experience the highest new home order activity in spring and summer, although this activity is highly dependent on the number of active selling communities, timing of new community openings, interest rates and other market factors. Since it typically takes four to seven months to construct a new home, we normally deliver more homes in the second half of the year as spring and summer home orders are delivered. Because of this seasonality, home starts, construction costs and related cash outflows have historically been highest in the second and third quarters, and the majority of cash receipts from home deliveries occur typically during the second half of the year.
