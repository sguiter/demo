subsidiary - Hangzhou Longjing Qiao Fu Vacation Hotel Co., Ltd. HZLJ ), and through Shanghai Hartford Health Management,
Ltd. HFSH and its percent owned subsidiary - Shanghai Qiao Garden International Travel Agency Qiao Garden
Int l Travel ), the Company engages in hospitality industry in China. Qiao Garden Int l Travel was disposed on December
31, 2020. 

The
Company engaged in early childhood education industry at Hartford International Education Technology Co., Ltd HF Int l
Education and its subsidiaries setup or acquired. 

Impacted
by the government regulation implemented in education industry and the restrictions posted by the Chinese government to control the pandemic
in China since 2021, to avoid further operation losses, on August 1, 2022, HFSH entered a contract with a related party, Shanghai Oversea
Chinese Culture Media Ltd. SH Oversea ), to sell percent ownership of HF Int l Education and its subsidiaries
for (RMB ). On August 1, 2022, HFUS entered a contract with SH Oversea and another individual, to sell 100 percent ownership
of HZHF and its subsidiaries for (RMB ). 

Beginning
in January 2024, the Company embarked on the development of a new business within the Media and Marketing sector. As part of its rebranding
strategy, on January 01, 2024, HFSH changed its legal name from Shanghai Hartford Health Management, Ltd. to Shanghai Hartford ZY Culture
Media Ltd. HFZY ). HFZY mainly engages in social media advertising business on mainstream social media platforms such as
Tik Tok, Toutiao, Kwai, RED, WeChat, and more. As an advertising partner of China s major social media platforms, the Company relies
on a high-quality and professional media strategy execution team and network to help customers use the massive media resources of different
types of social media platforms and receive competitive prices due to large-scale media resource procurement to purchase media resources.
It aims to become one of the total solution advertising providers for domestic social media industry in China and provide customers with
vertical integration services from early-stage advertising video creativity, shooting, editing, to advertising operation and management
on social media apps. Further expanding its business operations, HFUS reacquired full ownership of HZHF at no cost on April 1, 2024,
and subsequently rebranded it as Hangzhou Hartford WP Culture Media Ltd. HZWP ). On April 11, 2024, HFUS continued its
growth trajectory by establishing a new subsidiary named Shanghai DZ Culture Media Ltd. SHDZ ). On June 18, 2024, HFUS
successfully completed the acquisition of ShangXing HuoMao Network Technology Ltd. (SXHM). The acquisition was executed at no cost, and
there were no significant assets or liabilities exchanged during the transfer. 

million (USD million) as advanced payment from these customers. The Company also acquired advertising placement services
from 28 suppliers and prepaid RMB million (USD million). During the three months ended October 31, 2024, the Company recognized
USD million revenue from the advertisement placement services. The advertisements are published on the targeted media platforms as
determined by the customers. The Company is not the principal in this arrangement as the Company does not control the specified service
(i.e., the traffic) before that service is delivered to the customer, because (i) it is the targeted media platform, rather than the
Company, who is primarily responsible for providing the media publishing service; (ii) the media platforms are identified and determined
by the customers, rather than the Company, and the Company does not commit to acquire the traffic before transferring to the customers.
Therefore, the Company is not the principal in executing these transactions. The Company reports the amount received from the customers
and the amounts paid to the media suppliers related to these transactions on a net basis. 

In
the comparable period in prior year, impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic and Chinese regulation on education industry, both early childhood
education services and hospitality services have been sold on August 1, 2022, and the advertising revenue has not started until January
2024. Thus, there was no revenue recognized for the three months ended October 31, 2023. 

and
an accumulated deficit of . These conditions raise substantial doubt about the ability of Hartford Creative Group, Inc. to
continue as a going concern. 

In
view of these matters, continuation as a going concern is dependent upon several factors, including the availability of debt or equity
funding upon terms and conditions acceptable to the Company, and ultimately achieving profitable operations. Management believes that
the Company s business plan provides it with an opportunity to continue as a going concern. However, management cannot provide
assurance that the Company will meet its objectives and be able to continue in operation. 

The
financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of
assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the possible inability of the Company to continue as a going
concern.

Plan
of Operation 

After
years of experience in education and hospitality, the Company shifted its focus in January 2024 to social media advertising. On January
10, 2024, HFSH changed its legal name from Shanghai Hartford Health Management, Ltd. to Hartford ZY Culture Media (Shanghai) Co., Ltd.,
hereon refer to as HFZY . On June 18, 2024, the Company successfully completed the acquisition of ShangXing HuoMao Network
Technology Ltd. (SXHM). HFZY and SXHM started to deliver media and advertisement services. The pent-up demand from social media influencers 
marketing needs on social media apps lead the Company to seize the opportunity in providing advertisement services. the Company begins
to engage in social media advertising business on mainstream social media platforms such as Tik Tok, Toutiao, Kwai, RED, WeChat, and
more. As an advertising partner of China s major social media platforms, it aims to provide customers with vertical integration
services from early-stage advertising video creativity, photograph shooting, editing, to advertising operation and management on social
media apps. The Company will also gradually launch overseas TikTok advertising campaign, providing social media advertising solutions
for domestic Chinese customers to engage in international markets in the United States. 

During
the three months ended October 31, 2024, the Company recognized USD 0.5 million net revenue from the advertisement placement services.
The Company provides service to place advertisements. The advertisements are published on the targeted media platforms as determined
by the customers. Revenue is recognized at a point in time when the placement of advertisements is completed. As disclosed in Note 1
under category Revenue Recognition , the Company is not the principal in executing these transactions. The Company reports
the amount received from the customers and the amounts paid to the media platforms or upside agent related to these transactions on a
net basis. The Company expects the number of customers to grow and the advertising service revenue will significantly increase in the
next few months due to the vast demand in social media advertising services. 

Based
on market research and discussions among the Board and third-party suppliers and experts, the Company has further developed a plan of
mini-drama business. The Company is strategically positioned to capture considerable market interest and enhance revenue streams from
our innovative mini-drama business. While initial steps toward this ambitious goal have been initiated, it is important to note that
the commencement and future success of the mini-drama venture are not yet guaranteed.

Revenue:
 During the three months ended October 31, 2024, we generated 467,462 in revenue primarily from advertising placement services,
which we launched in January 2024. No revenue was recognized in the same period of 2023 as we had divested our early childhood education
and hospitality services in August 2022 

Operating
Cost and Expenses: Cost of revenue increased to 109,822 in the three months ended October 31, 2024, primarily due to expenses
related to designing and channel services. No costs were incurred in the same period of 2023. During the three months ended October 31,
2024, the selling, general and administrative expenses increased to 165,568 compared to 20,192 during the comparable period of 2023.
The increase was due to the increase of professional expenses as a result of the expansion of business operation. 

Other
Income (Expense): Other expense, net amount of 1,842 for the three months ended October 31, 2024, compared to Other expense,
net amount of 5,264 for the corresponding period of 2023. Other expenses for the three months ended October 31, 2024, primarily consisted
of net interest expense, resulting from interest payments on loans from related parties, offset by interest income from current loan
receivables. In the same period of 2023, other expenses were primarily due to interest expense. 

Income
tax expense: The income tax recognized for the three months ended October 31, 2024, resulted from the income tax from the operating
income in China. 

Net
Income (Loss): We recorded a net income of 127,269 or 0.00 per share for the three months ended October 31, 2024, compared
to a net loss of 25,456 or 0.00 per share for the same period of 2023, due to the factors discussed above.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

As
of October 31, 2024, we had a working capital deficit of 3,482,524 comprised of current assets of 1,723,082 and current liabilities
of 5,205,606. This represents a decrease of 83,441 in the working capital deficit from the July 31, 2024 amount of 3,565,965 . We
had an accumulated deficit of 5,783,574 compared to 5,910,843 at the previous year end. To date, we have funded our operations through
short-term debt and equity financing. 

As
of October 31, 2024, the Company has issued a total of 100,108,000 shares of common stock. On December 11, 2018, 96,090,000 shares of
common stock were issued at the price of 0.02 per share to raise an additional 1,921,800 in capital. On November 24, 2020, the Company
issued additional 1,000,000 shares of common stock to a significant shareholder of the Company at 0.02 per share. 

We
will seek additional financing in the form of debt or equity. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain any needed financing
on favorable terms, or at all, or that we will find qualified purchasers for the sale of our stock. If we are unable to raise sufficient
capital, we will be required to delay or forego some of our business plan, which would have a material adverse effect on our anticipated
results from operations and financial condition. Any sales of our securities would dilute the ownership of our existing investors. 

Future
Capital Expenditures 

We
believe that our funding requirements for the next twelve months will be in excess of 2,000,000. We are currently seeking further funding
through related parties loan and finance. 

We
are currently engaging consultants to evaluate and facilitate the potential uplisting of the Company s stock from the OTC market
to the Nasdaq exchange. If all conditions align favorably, the Company intends to secure financing through either debt or equity. The
funds raised will be allocated to cover the expenses associated with the uplisting process.
