Evelo Holdings is not an operating company but holds certain contractual rights to contingent payments and owns equity in Evelo, as well as certain assets it seeks to sell. The Company has a first priority security interest in the assets of Evelo Holdings, so if any payments are received by Evelo Holdings or any of its equity holdings or other assets are sold, the Company will receive substantially all of the proceeds from the same, until such time, if ever, that all of the indebtedness is repaid. Accordingly, the Company characterizes this investment as an Other Investment rather than a Debt Investment .

million and a fair value of million. As of December 31, 2023 , there were four investments on non-accrual status with a cost of million and a fair value of million. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , the Company recognized interest income of million from debt investments while on non-accrual status. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 , the Company did not recognize any interest income from debt investments while on non-accrual status. 
 
 The Company has a limited number of debt investments that contain a PIK provision. Contractual PIK interest, which represents contractually deferred interest added to the loan balance that is generally due at the end of the loan term, is generally recorded on an accrual basis to the extent such amounts are expected to be collected. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and , respectively, of the Company's total investment income was attributable to non-cash PIK interest. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and , respectively, of the Company's total investment income was attributable to non-cash PIK interest. The Company will generally cease accruing PIK interest if management does not expect the portfolio company to be able to pay all principal and interest due. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, no debt investments, which had accrued PIK interest into income, were placed on nonaccrual status. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , one debt investment, which had accrued PIK interest into income of million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was placed on nonaccrual status. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, three debt investments, which had accrued PIK interest into income of million and million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, were placed on nonaccrual status. 
 
 The Company receives a variety of fees from borrowers in the ordinary course of conducting its business, including advisory fees, commitment fees, amendment fees, non-utilization fees, success fees and prepayment fees. In a limited number of cases, the Company may also receive a non-refundable deposit earned upon the termination of a transaction. Debt investment origination fees, net of certain direct origination costs, are deferred and, along with unearned income, are amortized as a level-yield adjustment over the respective term of the debt investment. All other income is recognized when earned. Fees for counterparty debt investment commitments with multiple debt investments are allocated to each debt investment based upon each debt investment s relative fair value. When a debt investment is placed on non-accrual status, the amortization of the related fees and unearned income is discontinued until the debt investment is returned to accrual status. 
 
 Certain debt investment agreements also require the borrower to make an ETP, that is accrued into interest receivable and taken into income over the life of the debt investment to the extent such amounts are expected to be collected. The Company will generally cease accruing the income if there is insufficient value to support the accrual or the Company does not expect the borrower to be able to pay the ETP when due. The proportion of the Company s total investment income that resulted from the portion of ETPs not received in cash for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was and , respectively. The proportion of the Company s total investment income that resulted from the portion of ETPs not received in cash for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was and , respectively. 
 
 In connection with substantially all lending arrangements, the Company receives warrants to purchase shares of stock from the borrower. The warrants are recorded as assets at estimated fair value on the grant date using the Black-Scholes valuation model. The warrants are considered loan fees and are recorded as unearned income on the grant date. The unearned income is recognized as interest income over the contractual life of the related debt investment in accordance with the Company s income recognition policy. Subsequent to debt investment origination, the fair value of the warrants is determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model. Any adjustment to fair value is recorded through earnings as net unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments. Gains and losses from the disposition of the warrants or stock acquired from the exercise of warrants are recognized as realized gains and losses on investments. 

Realized gains or losses on the sale of investments, or upon the determination that an investment balance, or portion thereof, is not recoverable, are calculated using the specific identification method. The Company measures realized gains or losses by calculating the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment or sale and the amortized cost basis of the investment. Net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation reflects the change in the fair values of the Company s portfolio investments during the reporting period, including any reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation or depreciation when gains or losses are realized. 
 
 million and million, respectively. These amounts are capitalized and amortized and included in interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations over the life of the borrowings. The accumulated amortization balances as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were million and million, respectively. The amortization expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was million and million, respectively. The amortization expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was million and million, respectively. 
 
 U.S. federal excise tax on such income, as required. To the extent that the Company determines that its estimated current year annual taxable income will be in excess of estimated current year distributions, the Company accrues excise tax, if any, on estimated excess taxable income as taxable income is earned. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , million and million, respectively, was accrued for U.S. federal excise tax. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , million and million, respectively, was accrued for U.S. federal excise tax. 

The Company evaluates tax positions taken in the course of preparing the Company s tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are more-likely-than- not to be sustained by the applicable tax authority in accordance with ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes , as modified by ASC Topic 946. Tax benefits of positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than- not threshold, or uncertain tax positions, would be recorded as a tax expense in the current year. It is the Company s policy to recognize accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax benefits in income tax expense. The Company had material uncertain tax positions at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 . The Company s income tax returns for the 2024, 2023, 2022 and 2021 tax years remain subject to examination by U.S. federal and state tax authorities.

of the Company s gross assets (less cash and cash equivalents) including any assets acquired with the proceeds of leverage; provided, that, to the extent the Company s gross assets (less cash and cash equivalents) exceed 250 million, the base management fee on the amount of such excess over 250 million will be calculated at an annual rate of of the Company s gross assets (less cash and cash equivalents) including any assets acquired with the proceeds of leverage. The base management fee is payable monthly in arrears and is prorated for any partial month. 
 
 The base management fee payable at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was million and million, respectively. The base management fee expense was million and million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. The base management fee expense was and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. 
 
 The incentive fee has two parts, as follows: 
 
 The first part, which is subject to the Incentive Fee Cap and Deferral Mechanism, as defined below, is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears based on the Company s Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income for the immediately preceding calendar quarter. For this purpose, Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income means interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees (other than fees for providing managerial assistance), such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees received from portfolio companies) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus expenses for the quarter (including the base management fee, expenses payable under the Administration Agreement (as defined below), and any interest expense and any dividends paid on any issued and outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the incentive fee). Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature (such as original issue discount, debt instruments with PIK interest and zero coupon securities), accrued income the Company has not yet received in cash. The incentive fee with respect to the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income is of the amount, if any, by which the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income for the immediately preceding calendar quarter exceeds a hurdle rate of (which is annualized) of the Company s net assets at the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter, adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the relevant quarter, subject to a catch-up provision measured as of the end of each calendar quarter. Under this provision, in any calendar quarter, the Advisor receives no incentive fee until the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income equals the hurdle rate of 1.75 , but then receives, as a catch-up, of the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income with respect to that portion of such Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than quarterly (which is annualized). The effect of this catch-up provision is that, if Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income exceeds 2.1875 in any calendar quarter, the Advisor will receive 20.00 of the Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income as if the hurdle rate did not apply. 

Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income does not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. Because of the structure of the incentive fee, it is possible that the Company may pay an incentive fee in a quarter in which the Company incurs a loss. For example, if the Company receives Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income in excess of the quarterly minimum hurdle rate, the Company will pay the applicable incentive fee up to the Incentive Fee Cap, defined below, even if the Company has incurred a loss in that quarter due to realized and unrealized capital losses. The Company s net investment income used to calculate this part of the incentive fee is also included in the amount of the Company s gross assets used to calculate the 2.00 base management fee. These calculations are appropriately prorated for any period of less than three months and adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the current quarter. 
 
 The incentive fee on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income is subject to a fee cap and deferral mechanism which is determined based upon a look-back period of up to three years and is expensed when incurred. For this purpose, the look-back period for the incentive fee based on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income (the Incentive Fee Look-back Period includes the relevant calendar quarter and the 11 preceding full calendar quarters. Each quarterly incentive fee payable on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income is subject to a cap (the Incentive Fee Cap and a deferral mechanism through which the Advisor may recoup a portion of such deferred incentive fees (collectively, the Incentive Fee Cap and Deferral Mechanism ). The Incentive Fee Cap is equal to (a) 20.00 of Cumulative Pre-Incentive Fee Net Return (as defined below) during the Incentive Fee Look-back Period less (b) cumulative incentive fees of any kind paid to the Advisor during the Incentive Fee Look-back Period. To the extent the Incentive Fee Cap is zero or a negative value in any calendar quarter, the Company will not pay an incentive fee on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income to the Advisor in that quarter. To the extent that the payment of incentive fees on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income is limited by the Incentive Fee Cap, the payment of such fees will be deferred and paid in subsequent calendar quarters up to three years after their date of deferment, subject to certain limitations, which are set forth in the Investment Management Agreement. The Company only pays incentive fees on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income to the extent allowed by the Incentive Fee Cap and Deferral Mechanism. Cumulative Pre-Incentive Fee Net Return during any Incentive Fee Look-back Period means the sum of (a) Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income and the base management fee for each calendar quarter during the Incentive Fee Look-back Period and (b) the sum of cumulative realized capital gains and losses, cumulative unrealized capital appreciation and cumulative unrealized capital depreciation during the applicable Incentive Fee Look-back Period. 
 
 The second part of the incentive fee is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or, upon termination of the Investment Management Agreement, as of the termination date), and equals 20.00 of the Company s realized capital gains, if any, on a cumulative basis from the date of the election to be a BDC through the end of each calendar year, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis through the end of such year, less all previous amounts paid in respect of the capital gain incentive fee. However, in accordance with GAAP, the Company is required to include the aggregate unrealized capital appreciation on investments in the calculation and accrue a capital gain incentive fee on a quarterly basis, as if such unrealized capital appreciation were realized, even though such unrealized capital appreciation is not permitted to be considered in calculating the fee actually payable under the Investment Management Agreement. 
 
 There was performance based incentive fee expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The performance based incentive fee expense was million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The incentive fee on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income was subject to the Incentive Fee Cap and Deferral Mechanism for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, which resulted in million and million, respectively, of reduced expense and additional net investment income. The incentive fee on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income was subject to the Incentive Fee Cap and Deferral Mechanism for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, which resulted in million and million, respectively, of reduced expense and additional net investment income. This deferral represents a contingent future liability and is not accrued until the amount can be reasonably estimated and payment is probable. The remaining deferred amount may be paid up to three years after the date of deferment.

(based on fair value) of the Company s valuation of portfolio companies lacking readily available market quotations subject to review by an independent valuation firm. 
 
 The Company uses fair value measurements made by the valuation designee to record fair value adjustments to certain assets and liabilities and to determine fair value disclosures. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value is best determined based upon quoted market prices. However, in certain instances, there are no quoted market prices for certain assets or liabilities. In cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on estimates using present value or other valuation techniques. Those techniques are significantly affected by the assumptions used, including the discount rate and estimates of future cash flows. Accordingly, the fair value estimates may not be realized in an immediate settlement of the asset or liability. 
 
 Fair value measurements focus on exit prices in an orderly transaction (that is, not a forced liquidation or distressed sale) between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions. If there has been a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability, a change in valuation technique or the use of multiple valuation techniques may be appropriate. In such instances, determining the price at which willing market participants would transact at the measurement date under current market conditions depends on the facts and circumstances and requires the use of significant judgment. 
 
 The Company s fair value measurements are classified into a fair value hierarchy in accordance with ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement , based on the markets in which the assets and liabilities are traded and the reliability of the assumptions used to determine fair value. The three categories within the hierarchy are as follows: 

Level 1 
 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. 

Level 2 
 Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant inputs are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. 

Level 3 
 Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial instruments whose value is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation. 

Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of the Company s investments may fluctuate from period to period. Additionally, the fair value of the Company s investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that the Company may ultimately realize. Further, such investments are generally subject to legal and other restrictions on resale or otherwise are less liquid than publicly traded securities. If the Company was required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, the Company could realize significantly less than the value at which the Company has recorded such portfolio investment. 
 
 Cash and interest receivable: The carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value. These financial instruments are not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and are categorized as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy described above. 
 
 Money market funds: The carrying amounts are valued at their net asset value as of the close of business on the day of valuation. These financial instruments are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and are categorized as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy described above as these funds can be redeemed daily. 
 
 Debt investments: The fair value of debt investments is estimated by discounting the expected future cash flows using the period end rates at which similar debt investments would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and for the same remaining maturities. Significant increases (decreases) in this unobservable input would result in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement. These assets are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and are categorized as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy described above. 
 
 Under certain circumstances, the Company may use an alternative technique to value debt investments that better reflects its fair value such as the use of multiple probability weighted cash flow models when the expected future cash flows contain elements of variability. 
 
 Warrant investments: The Company values its warrants using the Black-Scholes valuation model incorporating the following material assumptions: 

Underlying asset value of the issuer is estimated based on information available, including any information regarding the most recent rounds of borrower funding. Significant increases (decreases) in this unobservable input would result in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement. 

Volatility, or the amount of uncertainty or risk about the size of the changes in the warrant price, is based on indices of publicly traded companies similar in nature to the underlying company issuing the warrant. A total of seven such indices are used. Significant increases (decreases) in this unobservable input would result in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement. 

The risk-free interest rates are derived from the U.S. Treasury yield curve. The risk-free interest rates are calculated based on a weighted average of the risk-free interest rates that correspond closest to the expected remaining life of the warrant. 

Other adjustments, including a marketability discount on private company warrants, are estimated based on management s judgment about the general industry environment. 

Historical portfolio experience on cancellations and exercises of the Company s warrants are utilized as the basis for determining the estimated time to exit of the warrants in each financial reporting period. Warrants may be exercised in the event of acquisitions, mergers or initial public offerings, and cancelled due to events such as bankruptcies, restructuring activities or additional financings. These events cause the expected remaining life assumption to be shorter than the contractual term of the warrants. Significant increases (decreases) in this unobservable input would result in significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement. 

Under certain circumstances the Company may use an alternative technique to value warrants that better reflects the warrants fair value, such as an expected settlement of a warrant in the near term or a model that incorporates a put feature associated with the warrant. The fair value may be determined based on the expected proceeds to be received from such settlement or based on the net present value of the expected proceeds from the put option. 
 
 The fair value of the Company s warrants held in publicly traded companies is determined based on inputs that are readily available in public markets or can be derived from information available in public markets. Therefore, the Company has categorized these warrants as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy described above. The fair value of the Company s warrants held in private companies is determined using both observable and unobservable inputs and represents management s best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the warrants at the measurement date. Therefore, the Company has categorized these warrants as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy described above. These assets are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. 
 
 Equity investments: The fair value of an equity investment in a privately held company is initially the face value of the amount invested. The Company adjusts the fair value of equity investments in private companies upon the completion of a new third -party round of equity financing. The Company may make adjustments to fair value, absent a new equity financing event, based upon positive or negative changes in a portfolio company s financial or operational performance. Significant increases (decreases) in this unobservable input would result in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement. The Company has categorized these equity investments as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy described above. The fair value of an equity investment in a publicly traded company is based upon the closing public share price on the date of measurement. Therefore, the Company has categorized these equity investments as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy described above. These assets are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. 
 
 Other investments: Other investments are valued based on the facts and circumstances of the underlying contractual agreement. The Company currently values these contractual agreements using a multiple probability weighted cash flow model as the contractual future cash flows contain elements of variability.

 The Company discloses fair value information about financial instruments, whether or not recognized in the consolidated statement of assets and liabilities, for which it is practicable to estimate that value. Certain financial instruments are excluded from the disclosure requirements. Accordingly, the aggregate fair value amounts presented do not represent the underlying value of the Company. 
 
 The fair value amounts have been measured as of the reporting date and have not been reevaluated or updated for purposes of these financial statements subsequent to that date. As such, the fair values of these financial instruments subsequent to the reporting date may be different than amounts reported.

 Market risk 
 
 The Company assumes interest rate risk (the risk that general interest rate levels will change) as a result of its normal operations. As a result, the fair values of the Company s financial instruments may change when interest rate levels change, and that change may be either favorable or unfavorable to the Company. Management attempts to match maturities of assets and liabilities to the extent believed necessary to minimize interest rate risk. Management monitors rates and maturities of assets and liabilities and attempts to minimize interest rate risk by adjusting terms of new debt investments and by investing in securities with terms that mitigate the Company s overall interest rate risk.

 Distributions are determined based on taxable income calculated in accordance with income tax regulations, which may differ from amounts determined under GAAP due to (i) changes in unrealized appreciation and depreciation, (ii) temporary and permanent differences in income and expense recognition, and (iii) the amount of spillover income carried over from a given tax year for distribution in the following tax year. The final determination of taxable income for each tax year, as well as the tax attributes for distributions in such tax year, will be made after the close of the tax year. 

2 
 Includes the impact of the different share amounts as a result of calculating per share data based on the weighted average basic shares outstanding during the period and certain per share data based on the shares outstanding as of a period end or transaction date. The issuance of common stock on a per share basis reflects the incremental net asset value changes as a result of the issuance of common stock in the Company s continuous public offering and pursuant to the Company s distribution reinvestment plan. The issuance of common stock at an offering price, net of sales commissions and dealer manager fees, that is greater than the net asset value per share results in an increase in net asset value per share.

 The total return equals the change in the ending market value over the beginning of period price per share plus distributions paid per share during the period, divided by the beginning price. 

4 
 Annualized.

 Overview 
 
 We are a specialty finance company that lends to and invests in development-stage companies in the technology, life science, healthcare information and services and sustainability industries, which we refer to as our Target Industries. Our investment objective is to maximize our investment portfolio s total return by generating current income from the debt investments we make and capital appreciation from the warrants we receive when making such debt investments. We are focused on making secured debt investments, which we refer to collectively as Venture Loans, to venture capital and private equity backed companies and publicly traded companies in our Target Industries, which we refer to as Venture Lending. Our debt investments are typically secured by first liens or first liens behind a secured revolving line of credit, or collectively Senior Term Loans. Some of our debt investments may also be subordinated to term debt provided by third parties. As of September 30, 2024, 86.2 , or 546.0 million, of our debt investment portfolio at fair value consisted of Senior Term Loans. Venture Lending is typically characterized by (1) the making of a secured debt investment after a venture capital or equity investment in the portfolio company has been made, which investment provides a source of cash to fund the portfolio company s debt service obligations under the Venture Loan, (2) the senior priority of the Venture Loan which requires repayment of the Venture Loan prior to the equity investors realizing a return on their capital, (3) the amortization of the Venture Loan and (4) the lender s receipt of warrants or other success fees with the making of the Venture Loan. 
 
 We are an externally managed, closed-end, non-diversified management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a BDC under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the 1940 Act. In addition, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we have elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. As a BDC, we are required to comply with regulatory requirements, including limitations on our use of debt. We are permitted to, and expect to, finance our investments through borrowings subject to a 150 asset coverage test. As defined in the 1940 Act, asset coverage of 150 means that for every 100 of net assets a BDC holds, it may raise up to 200 from borrowing and issuing senior securities. The amount of leverage that we may employ will depend on our assessment of market conditions and other factors at the time of any proposed borrowing. As a RIC, we generally are not subject to corporate-level income taxes on our investment company taxable income, determined without regard to any deductions for dividends paid, and our net capital gain that we distribute as dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes to our stockholders as long as we meet certain source-of-income, distribution, asset diversification and other requirements.

The largest debt investments in our portfolio may vary from period to period as new debt investments are originated and existing debt investments are repaid. Our five largest debt investments at cost represented 22 and 23 of total debt investments outstanding as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Our five largest debt investments at fair value represented 23 and 22 of total debt investments outstanding as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. No single debt investment at cost or fair value represented more than 10 of our total debt investments as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 
 Debt investment asset quality 
 
 We use an internal credit rating system which rates each debt investment on a scale of 4 to 1, with 4 being the highest credit quality rating and 3 being the rating for a standard level of risk. A rating of 2 represents an increased level of risk and, while no loss is currently anticipated for a 2 rated debt investment, there is potential for future loss of principal. A rating of 1 represents a deteriorating credit quality and a high degree of risk of loss of principal. Our internal credit rating system is not a national credit rating system. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our debt investments had a weighted average credit rating of 3.1. The following table shows the classification of our debt investment portfolio by credit rating as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:

As of September 30, 2024, there were three debt investments with an internal credit rating of 1, with an aggregate cost of 36.5 million and an aggregate fair value of 21.2 million and there were six debt investments with an internal credit rating of 2, with an aggregate cost of 36.9 million and an aggregate fair value of 33.5 million. As of December 31, 2023, there were four debt investments with an internal credit rating of 1, with an aggregate cost of 72.5 million and an aggregate fair value of 27.6 million and there were two debt investments with an internal credit rating of 2, with an aggregate cost of 43.8 million and an aggregate fair value of 39.3 million. The increase in the number of investments with internal credit ratings of 1 or 2 was principally a result of the increase in the risk of loss of principal caused by the portfolio companies low cash positions and the difficult equity fundraising market and/or the underperformance of certain portfolio companies.

As a result, quarterly comparisons of net increase in net assets resulting from operations may not be meaningful. 
 
 Investment income 
 
 Total investment income decreased by 4.6 million, or 15.7 , to 24.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, total investment income consisted primarily of 22.8 million in interest income from investments, which included 3.3 million in income from the accretion of origination fees and end of term payments ETPs ), 1.4 million in fee income and 0.4 million in PIK income. Interest income on debt investments decreased by 2.3 million, or 9.1 , to 22.8 million, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Interest income on debt investments for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 decreased primarily due to a decrease of 86.6 million, or 12.6 , in the average earning debt investments. The proportion of total investment income that resulted from the portion of ETPs not received in cash for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 4.6 and 5.1 , respectively. The decrease in the proportion of total investment income that resulted from the portion of ETPs not received in cash was a result of a decrease in final payments received in cash from prepayments for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Fee income, which includes success fee, other fee and prepayment fee income on debt investments, increased by 1.3 million, or 1014.5 , to 1.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to higher fee income earned on prepayments for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 PIK income decreased by 3.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, 1.5 and 13.5 , respectively, of total investment income was attributable to non-cash PIK interest. The decrease in PIK income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to a decrease in earning assets that contain a PIK feature for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023.

 We calculate the dollar-weighted annualized yield on average investment type for any period as (1) total related investment income during the period divided by (2) the average of the fair value of the investment type outstanding on (a) the last day of the calendar month immediately preceding the first day of the period and (b) the last day of each calendar month during the period. The dollar-weighted annualized yield on average investment type is higher than what investors will realize because it does not reflect our expenses or any sales load paid by investors. 

Investment income, consisting of interest income and fees on debt investments, can fluctuate significantly upon repayment of large debt investments. Interest income from the five largest debt investments at cost in the aggregate accounted for 21 and 24 of investment income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Interest income from the five largest debt investments at fair value in the aggregate accounted for 25 and 22 of investment income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Expenses 
 
 Total expenses increased by 0.7 million, or 6.4 , to 12.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Total expenses for each period consisted of interest expense, base management fee, incentive and administrative fees, professional fees and general and administrative expenses. 
 
 Interest expense increased by 0.8 million, or 11.8 , to 7.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Interest expense, which includes the amortization of debt issuance costs, increased primarily due to an increase in average borrowings of 24.5 million, or 5.9 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 and an increase in our effective cost of debt for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Base management fee expense decreased by 0.2 million, or 7.0 , to 3.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Base management fee decreased primarily due to a decrease of 56.2 million, or 7.6 , in average gross assets less cash for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 There was no performance based incentive fee expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The incentive fee on pre-incentive fee net investment income was subject to an Incentive Fee Cap and Deferral Mechanism in our Investment Management Agreement of 2.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 3.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The Incentive Fee Cap and Deferral Mechanism resulted in 2.4 million of reduced incentive fee expense and increased net investment income for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The incentive fee on pre-incentive fee net investment income was subject to the Incentive Fee Cap for the three months ended September 30, 2024 due to the cumulative incentive fees paid exceeding 20 of cumulative pre-incentive fee net return during the applicable quarter and the 11 preceding full calendar quarters. 
 
 Administrative fee expense, professional fees and general and administrative expenses were 1.4 million and 1.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Net realized gains and losses and net unrealized appreciation and depreciation 
 
 Realized gains or losses on investments are measured by the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment or sale and the cost basis of our investments without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized. Realized gains or losses on investments include investments charged off during the period, net of recoveries. The net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments primarily reflects the change in portfolio investment fair values during the reporting period, including the reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation or depreciation when gains or losses are realized. 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we realized net losses on investments totaling 33.9 million primarily due to the settlement of one of our debt investments. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we realized net losses on investments totaling 11.8 million primarily due to the settlement of one of our debt investments. Such net realized losses were primarily the result of portfolio companies ceasing operations due to their inability to raise additional capital and the sale of their assets for less than the cost of their debt investments. 
 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, net unrealized appreciation on investments totaled 29.3 million which was primarily due to (1) the reversal of previously recorded unrealized depreciation from the settlement of one of our debt investments and (2) the unrealized appreciation on one of our debt investments offset by (1) the unrealized depreciation on one of our other investments and (2) the unrealized depreciation on our warrant investments. During the three months ended September 30, 2023, net unrealized depreciation on investments totaled 17.5 million which was primarily due to the unrealized depreciation on two of our debt investments offset by (1) the reversal of previously recorded unrealized depreciation from the settlement of one of our debt investments and (2) the unrealized appreciation on one of our equity investments. The difficult equity fundraising market and under performance of certain portfolio companies, among other factors, resulted in us reducing the fair market value of the debt investments in such portfolio companies, thus increasing the unrealized depreciation on such debt investments.

Net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations can vary substantially from period to period for various reasons, including, without limitation, the recognition of realized gains and losses and unrealized appreciation and depreciation on investments. As a result, quarterly comparisons of net increase in net assets resulting from operations may not be meaningful. 
 
 Investment income 
 
 Total investment income decreased by 8.9 million, or 10.5 , to 76.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, total investment income consisted primarily of 71.6 million in interest income from investments, which included 10.8 million in income from the accretion of origination fees and end of term payments, 2.7 million in fee income and 2.1 million in PIK income. Interest income on debt investments decreased by 5.4 million, or 7.0 , to 71.6 million, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Interest income on debt investments for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 decreased primarily due to a decrease of 71.5 million, or 10.3 , in the average earning debt investments, offset by an increase in the Prime Rate which is the base rate for most of our variable rate debt investments. The proportion of total investment income that resulted from the portion of ETPs not received in cash for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 6.0 and 4.9 , respectively. The increase in the proportion of total investment income that resulted from the portion of ETPs not received in cash was a result of a decrease in earning assets for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Fee income, which includes success fee, other fee and prepayment fee income on debt investments, increased by 0.4 million, or 18.0 , to 2.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily due to higher fee income earned on prepayments for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 PIK income decreased by 3.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, 2.8 and 7.1 , respectively, of total investment income was attributable to non-cash PIK interest. The decrease in PIK interest as a percentage of total investment income was principally the result of a decrease in earning assets that contain a PIK feature for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 The following table shows our dollar-weighted annualized yield for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

 We calculate the dollar-weighted annualized yield on average investment type for any period as (1) total related investment income during the period divided by (2) the average of the fair value of the investment type outstanding on (a) the last day of the calendar month immediately preceding the first day of the period and (b) the last day of each calendar month during the period. The dollar-weighted annualized yield on average investment type is higher than what investors will realize because it does not reflect our expenses or any sales load paid by investors. 

Investment income, consisting of interest income and fees on debt investments, can fluctuate significantly upon repayment of large debt investments. Interest income from the five largest debt investments at cost in the aggregate accounted for 21 and 23 of investment income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Interest income from the five largest debt investments at fair value in the aggregate accounted for 23 and 21 of investment income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Expenses 
 
 Total expenses decreased by 0.4 million, or 1.1 , to 37.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Total expenses for each period consisted of interest expense, base management fee, incentive and administrative fees, professional fees and general and administrative expenses. 
 
 Interest expense increased by 2.6 million, or 12.3 , to 24.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Interest expense, which includes the amortization of debt issuance costs, increased primarily due to an increase in average borrowings of 16.0 million, or 3.7 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and an increase in our effective cost of debt for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Base management fee expense decreased by 0.4 million, or 4.6 , to 9.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Base management fee decreased primarily due to a decrease of 37.0 million, or 5.0 , in average gross assets less cash for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 Performance based incentive fee expense decreased by 2.8 million, or 90.5 , to 0.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This decrease was due to an Incentive Fee Cap and Deferral Mechanism in our Investment Management Agreement of 7.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 6.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The Incentive Fee Cap and Deferral Mechanism resulted in 7.2 million and 6.8 million of reduced incentive fee expense and increased net investment income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The incentive fee on pre-incentive fee net investment income was subject to the Incentive Fee Cap for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to the cumulative incentive fees paid exceeding 20 of cumulative pre-incentive fee net return during the applicable quarter and the 11 preceding full calendar quarters. 
 
 Administrative fee expense, professional fees and general and administrative expenses were 4.4 million and 4.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 Net realized gains and losses and net unrealized appreciation and depreciation 
 
 Realized gains or losses on investments are measured by the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment or sale and the cost basis of our investments without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized. Realized gains or losses on investments include investments charged off during the period, net of recoveries. The net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments primarily reflects the change in portfolio investment fair values during the reporting period, including the reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation or depreciation when gains or losses are realized. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we realized net losses on investments totaling 31.4 million primarily due to the settlement of one of our debt investments. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we realized net losses on investments totaling 28.5 million primarily due to the settlement of four of our debt investments. Such net realized losses were primarily the result of portfolio companies ceasing operations due to their inability to raise additional capital and the sale of their assets for less than the cost of their debt investments. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net unrealized appreciation on investments totaled 0.9 million which was primarily due to (1) the reversal of previously recorded unrealized depreciation from the settlement of one of our debt investments and (2) the unrealized appreciation on one of our other investments partially offset by (1) the unrealized depreciation on four of our debt investments and (2) the unrealized depreciation on our warrant and equity investments. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net unrealized depreciation on investments totaled 24.4 million which was primarily due to (1) the unrealized depreciation on four of our debt investments and (2) the unrealized depreciation on two of our equity investments offset by (1) the reversal of previously recorded unrealized depreciation from the settlement of three of our debt investments and (2) the unrealized appreciation on one of our equity investments. The difficult equity fundraising market and under performance of certain portfolio companies, among other factors, resulted in us reducing the fair market value of the debt investments in such portfolio companies, thus increasing the unrealized depreciation on such debt investments.

In addition, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had 3.3 million and 2.6 million, respectively, of restricted investments in money market funds. Restricted investments in money market funds may be used to make monthly interest and principal payments on our 2022 Asset-Backed Notes, our NYL Facility or our Nuveen Facility.

On April 26, 2024, our Board extended a previously authorized stock repurchase program which allows us to repurchase up to 5.0 million of our common stock at prices below our net asset value NAV per share as reported in our most recent consolidated financial statements. Under the repurchase program, we may, but are not obligated to, repurchase shares of our outstanding common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions from time to time. Any repurchases by us will comply with the requirements of Rule 10b 18 under the Exchange Act and any applicable requirements of the 1940 Act. Unless extended by our Board, the repurchase program will terminate on the earlier of June 30, 2025 or the repurchase of 5.0 million of our common stock. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we did not make any repurchases of our common stock.

The Nuveen Facility was not outstanding at December 31, 2023. 
 
 Our operating activities provided cash of 30.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and our financing activities used cash of 19.1 million for the same period. Our operating activities provided cash from principal payments received on our debt investments partially offset by cash used to purchase investments in portfolio companies.

We expect to raise additional equity and debt capital opportunistically as needed and, subject to market conditions, to support our future growth to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act. 
 
 In order to remain subject to taxation as a RIC, we intend to distribute to our stockholders all or substantially all of our investment company taxable income. In addition, as a BDC, we are required to maintain asset coverage of at least 150 . This requirement limits the amount that we may borrow. 
 
 We believe that our current cash, cash generated from operations, and funds available from our Credit Facilities will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure commitments for at least the next 12 months.

 Key Facility 
 
 We entered into the Key Facility effective November 4, 2013.

The Key Facility contains covenants that, among other things, require us to maintain a minimum net worth, to restrict the debt investments securing the Key Facility to certain criteria for qualified debt investments and to comply with portfolio company concentration limits as defined in the related loan agreement. After the period during which we may request advances under the Key Facility (or the Revolving Period ), we may not request new advances, and we must repay the outstanding advances under the Key Facility as of such date, at such times and in such amounts as are necessary to maintain compliance with the terms and conditions of the Key Facility, particularly the condition that the principal balance of the Key Facility not exceed sixty percent (60 of the aggregate principal balance of our eligible debt investments to our portfolio companies. 
 
 NYL Facility

The 2022 Asset-Backed Notes were rated A by Morningstar Credit Ratings, LLC on November 9, 2022. There has been no change in the rating since November 9, 2022. 
 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the 2022 Asset-Backed Notes had an outstanding principal balance of 91.0 million and 100.0 million, respectively. 
 
 Under the terms of the 2022 Asset-Backed Notes, we are required to maintain a reserve cash balance, funded through proceeds from the sale of the 2022 Asset-Backed Notes, which may be used to pay monthly interest and principal payments on the 2022 Asset-Backed Notes. We have segregated these funds and classified them as restricted investments in money market funds. At September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, there were approximately 1.0 million and 1.3 million, respectively, of such restricted investments.

In the normal course of business, we are party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk. These consist primarily of unfunded commitments to extend credit, in the form of loans, to our portfolio companies. Unfunded commitments to provide funds to portfolio companies are not reflected on our balance sheet. Our unfunded commitments may be significant from time to time. As of September 30, 2024, we had unfunded commitments of 189.9 million. This includes 20.0 million of undrawn revolver commitments. These commitments are subject to the same underwriting and ongoing portfolio maintenance requirements as are the financial instruments that we hold on our balance sheet. In addition, these commitments are often subject to financial or non-financial milestones and other conditions to borrowing that must be achieved before the commitment can be drawn. Since these commitments may expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future cash requirements. We regularly monitor our unfunded commitments and anticipated refinancings, maturities and capital raising, to ensure that we have sufficient liquidity to fund unfunded commitments. As of September 30, 2024, we reasonably believed that our assets would provide adequate financial resources to satisfy all of our unfunded commitments. 
 
 In addition to the Credit Facilities, we have certain commitments pursuant to our Investment Management Agreement entered into with our Advisor. We have agreed to pay a fee for investment advisory and management services consisting of two components (1) a base management fee equal to a percentage of the value of our gross assets less cash or cash equivalents, and (2) a two-part incentive fee. We have also entered into a contract with our Advisor to serve as our administrator. Payments under the Administration Agreement are equal to an amount based upon our allocable portion of our Advisor s overhead in performing its obligations under the agreement, including rent, fees and other expenses inclusive of our allocable portion of the compensation of our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Compliance Officer and their respective staffs. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our Investment Management Agreement and our Administration Agreement.

The incentive fee on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income is subject to a fee cap and deferral mechanism which is determined based upon a look-back period of up to three years and is expensed when incurred. For this purpose, the Incentive Fee Look-back Period includes the relevant calendar quarter and the 11 preceding full calendar quarters. Each quarterly incentive fee payable on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income is subject to the Incentive Fee Cap and Deferral Mechanism. The Incentive Fee Cap is equal to (a) 20.00 of Cumulative Pre-Incentive Fee Net Return during the Incentive Fee Look-back Period less (b) cumulative incentive fees of any kind paid to our Advisor during the Incentive Fee Look-back Period. To the extent the Incentive Fee Cap is zero or a negative value in any calendar quarter, we will not pay an incentive fee on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income to our Advisor in that quarter. To the extent that the payment of incentive fees on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income is limited by the Incentive Fee Cap, the payment of such fees will be deferred and paid in subsequent calendar quarters up to three years after their date of deferment, subject to certain limitations, which are set forth in the Investment Management Agreement. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Incentive Fee Cap and Deferral Mechanism resulted in deferral of 2.4 million and 3.5 million, respectively, of incentive fee which may become subject to payment up to three years after the date of deferment. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Incentive Fee Cap and Deferral Mechanism resulted in deferral of 7.2 million and 6.8 million, respectively, of incentive fee which may become subject to payment up to three years after the date of deferment. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the total amount subject to recoupment was 18.1 million and 10.8 million, respectively. 
 
 Distributions 
 
 In order to qualify and be subject to tax as a RIC, we must meet certain source-of-income, asset diversification and annual distribution requirements. Generally, in order to qualify as a RIC, we must derive at least 90 of our gross income for each tax year from dividends, interest, payments with respect to certain securities, loans, gains from the sale or other disposition of stock, securities or foreign currencies, income derived from certain publicly traded partnerships, or other income derived with respect to our business of investing in stock or other securities. We must also meet certain asset diversification requirements at the end of each quarter of each tax year. Failure to meet these diversification requirements on the last day of a quarter may result in us having to dispose of certain investments quickly in order to prevent the loss of RIC status. Any such dispositions could be made at disadvantageous prices or times, and may cause us to incur substantial losses. 
 
 In addition, in order to be subject to tax as a RIC and to avoid the imposition of corporate-level tax on the income and gains we distribute to our stockholders in respect of any tax year, we are required under the Code to distribute as dividends to our stockholders out of assets legally available for distribution each tax year an amount generally at least equal to 90 of the sum of our net ordinary income and net short-term capital gains in excess of net long-term capital losses, if any. Additionally, in order to avoid the imposition of a U.S. federal excise tax, we are required to distribute, in respect of each calendar year, dividends to our stockholders of an amount at least equal to the sum of 98 of our calendar year net ordinary income (taking into account certain deferrals and elections); 98.2 of our capital gain net income (adjusted for certain ordinary losses) for the one year period ending on October 31 of such calendar year; and any net ordinary income and capital gain net income for preceding calendar years that were not distributed during such calendar years and on which we previously did not incur any U.S. federal income tax. If we fail to qualify as a RIC for any reason and become subject to corporate tax, the resulting corporate taxes could substantially reduce our net assets, the amount of income available for distribution and the amount of our distributions. Such a failure would have a material adverse effect on us and our stockholders. In addition, we could be required to recognize unrealized gains, incur substantial taxes and interest and make substantial distributions in order to re-qualify as a RIC. We cannot assure stockholders that they will receive any distributions. 
 
 To the extent our taxable earnings in a tax year fall below the total amount of our distributions made to stockholders in respect of such tax year, a portion of those distributions may be deemed a return of capital to our stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Thus, the source of a distribution to our stockholders may be the original capital invested by the stockholder rather than our income or gains. Stockholders should review any written disclosure accompanying a distribution payment carefully and should not assume that the source of any distribution is our ordinary income or gains. 
 
 We have adopted an opt out dividend reinvestment plan, or DRIP, for our common stockholders. As a result, if we declare a distribution, then stockholders cash distributions will be automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock unless a stockholder specifically opts out of our DRIP. If a stockholder opts out, that stockholder will receive cash distributions. Although distributions paid in the form of additional shares of our common stock will generally be subject to U.S. federal, state and local taxes, stockholders participating in our DRIP will not receive any corresponding cash distributions with which to pay any such applicable taxes. If our common stock is trading above NAV, a stockholder receiving distributions in the form of additional shares of our common stock will be treated as receiving a distribution of an amount equal to the fair market value of such shares of our common stock. We may use newly issued shares to implement the DRIP, or we may purchase shares in the open market in connection with our obligations under the DRIP. 
 
 Related party transactions 
 
 We have entered into the Investment Management Agreement with our Advisor. Our Advisor is registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended. Our investment activities are managed by our Advisor and supervised by our Board, the majority of whom are independent directors. Under the Investment Management Agreement, we have agreed to pay our Advisor a base management fee as well as an incentive fee. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our Advisor earned 3.0 million and 3.2 million, respectively, pursuant to the Investment Management Agreement. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our Advisor earned 9.5 million and 12.7 million, respectively, pursuant to the Investment Management Agreement.

 We have also entered into the Administration Agreement with our Advisor. Under the Administration Agreement, we have agreed to reimburse our Advisor for our allocable portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by our Advisor in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including rent and our allocable portion of the costs of compensation and related expenses of our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Compliance Officer and their respective staffs. In addition, pursuant to the terms of the Administration Agreement our Advisor provides us with the office facilities and administrative services necessary to conduct our day-to-day operations. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our Advisor earned 0.4 million pursuant to the Administration Agreement. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, our Advisor earned 1.3 million and 1.2 million, respectively, pursuant to the Administration Agreement. 
 
 In connection with the Purchase Agreement, HTF Principals sold its trademark interest in Horizon Technology Finance , and granted us a royalty-free license to use the name Horizon Technology Finance. 
 
 We believe that we derive substantial benefits from our relationship with our Advisor. Our Advisor or its affiliates may manage other investment vehicles (the Advisor Funds ), with the same investment strategy as us, which now may include investment vehicles managed by affiliates of Monroe Capital. Our Advisor may provide us an opportunity to co-invest with the Advisor Funds. Under the 1940 Act, absent receipt of exemptive relief from the SEC, we and our affiliates are precluded from co-investing in negotiated investments. Monroe Capital's exemptive relief to permit joint transactions granted by the SEC on October 15, 2014, as amended, permits us to co-invest with the Advisor Funds, subject to certain conditions. 
 
 Critical accounting policies 
 
 The discussion of our financial condition and results of operation is based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ. In addition to the discussion below, we describe our significant accounting policies in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. 
 
 We have identified the following items as critical accounting policies. 
 
 Valuation of investments 
 
 Investments are recorded at fair value. Prior to July 30, 2022, our Board determined the fair value of our investments. Pursuant to the amended SEC Rule 2a-5 of the 1940 Act, on July 29, 2022, our Board designated our Advisor as the valuation designee. Our Board is responsible for oversight of the valuation designee. The valuation designee has established a Valuation Committee to determine in good faith the fair value of our investments, based on input of our Advisor s management and personnel and independent valuation firms which are engaged at the direction of the Valuation Committee to assist in the valuation of certain portfolio investments lacking a readily available market quotation at least once during a trailing twelve-month period. The Valuation Committee determines fair values pursuant to a valuation policy approved by our Board and pursuant to a consistently applied valuation process. This valuation process is conducted at the end of each fiscal quarter, with at least 25 (based on fair value) of our valuation of portfolio companies lacking readily available market quotations subject to review by an independent valuation firm. We apply fair value to substantially all of our investments in accordance with Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement , of the Financial Accounting Standards Board s, or FASB s, Accounting Standards Codification as amended, or ASC, which establishes a framework used to measure fair value and requires disclosures for fair value measurements. We have categorized our investments carried at fair value, based on the priority of the valuation technique, into a three-level fair value hierarchy. Fair value is a market-based measure considered from the perspective of the market participant who holds the financial instrument rather than an entity specific measure. Therefore, when market assumptions are not readily available, our own assumptions are set to reflect those that we believe market participants would use in pricing the financial instrument at the measurement date.

The availability of observable inputs can vary depending on the financial instrument and is affected by a wide variety of factors, including, for example, the type of product, whether the product is new, whether the product is traded on an active exchange or in the secondary market and the current market conditions. To the extent that the valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment. The three categories within the hierarchy are as follows: 

Level 1 
 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. 

Level 2 
 Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices in markets that are not active and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant inputs are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. 

Level 3 
 Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial instruments whose value is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation. 

Income recognition 
 
 Interest on debt investments is accrued and included in income based on contractual rates applied to principal amounts outstanding. Interest income is determined using a method that results in a level rate of return on principal amounts outstanding. Generally, when a debt investment becomes 90 days or more past due, or if we otherwise do not expect to receive interest and principal repayments, the debt investment is placed on non-accrual status and the recognition of interest income may be discontinued. Interest payments received on non-accrual debt investments may be recognized as income, on a cash basis, or applied to principal depending upon management s judgment at the time the debt investment is placed on non-accrual status. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized in interest income 0.2 million from debt investments while on non-accrual status. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we did not recognize any interest income from debt investments while on non-accrual status. 
 
 We receive a variety of fees from borrowers in the ordinary course of conducting our business, including advisory fees, commitment fees, amendment fees, non-utilization fees, success fees and prepayment fees. In a limited number of cases, we may also receive a non-refundable deposit earned upon the termination of a transaction. Debt investment origination fees, net of certain direct origination costs, are deferred, and along with unearned income, are amortized as a level yield adjustment over the respective term of the debt investment. All other income is recorded into income when earned. Fees for counterparty debt investment commitments with multiple debt investments are allocated to each debt investment based upon each debt investment s relative fair value. When a debt investment is placed on non-accrual status, the amortization of the related fees and unearned income is discontinued until the debt investment is returned to accrual status. 
 
 Certain debt investment agreements also require the borrower to make an ETP that is accrued into income over the life of the debt investment to the extent such amounts are expected to be collected. We will generally cease accruing the income if there is insufficient value to support the accrual or if we do not expect the borrower to be able to pay the ETP when due. 
 
 In connection with substantially all lending arrangements, we receive warrants to purchase shares of stock from the borrower. We record the warrants as assets at estimated fair value on the grant date using the Black-Scholes valuation model. We consider the warrants as loan fees and record them as unearned income on the grant date. The unearned income is recognized as interest income over the contractual life of the related debt investment in accordance with our income recognition policy. Subsequent to origination, the warrants are also measured at fair value using the Black-Scholes valuation model. Any adjustment to fair value is recorded through earnings as net unrealized gain or loss on investments. Gains and losses from the disposition of the warrants or stock acquired from the exercise of warrants are recognized as realized gains and losses on investments. 

66

Table of Contents 

Realized gains or losses on the sale of investments, or upon the determination that an investment balance, or portion thereof, is not recoverable, are calculated using the specific identification method. We measure realized gains or losses by calculating the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment or sale and the amortized cost basis of the investment. Net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation reflects the change in the fair values of our portfolio investments during the reporting period, including any reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation or depreciation, when gains or losses are realized. 
 
 Income taxes 
 
 We have elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code and operate in a manner so as to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to RICs. In order to qualify as a RIC and to avoid the imposition of corporate-level U.S. federal income tax on the amounts we distribute to our stockholders, among other things, we are required to meet certain source of income and asset diversification requirements, and we must timely distribute dividends to our stockholders out of assets legally available for distribution each tax year of an amount generally equal to at least 90 of our investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code and determined without regard to any deduction for dividends paid. We, among other things, have made and intend to continue to make the requisite distributions to our stockholders, which will generally relieve us from incurring any material liability for U.S. federal income taxes. 
 
 Depending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year, we may choose to carry forward taxable income in excess of current year distributions into the next tax year and incur a 4 excise tax on such income, as required. To the extent that we determine that our estimated current year annual taxable income will be in excess of estimated current year distributions, we will accrue excise tax, if any, on estimated excess taxable income as taxable income is earned. 
 
 We evaluate tax positions taken in the course of preparing our tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are more-likely-than-not to be sustained by the applicable tax authority in accordance with ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes , as modified by ASC Topic 946, Financial Services Investment Companies . Tax benefits of positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold, or uncertain tax positions, are recorded as a tax expense in the current year. It is our policy to recognize accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax benefits in income tax expense. We had no material uncertain tax positions at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

Recently issued accounting pronouncement 
 
 In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures ASU 2023-07 ). ASU 2023-07 is intended to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses, allowing financial statement users to better understand the components of a segment's profit or loss and assess potential future cash flows for each reportable segment and the entity as a whole. The amendments expand a public entity's segment disclosures by requiring disclosure of significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker, clarifying when an entity may report one or more additional measures to assess segment performance, requiring enhanced interim disclosures and providing new disclosure requirements for entities with a single reportable segment, among other new disclosure requirements. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, and early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance with respect to our consolidated financial statements and disclosures. 
 
 Recently adopted accounting pronouncement 
 
 In June 2022, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2022-03, Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions ASU 2022-03 ). ASU 2022-03 clarifies the guidance when measuring the fair value of an equity security subject to contractual restrictions that prohibit the sale of the security. The amendments in ASU 2022-03 were effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The adoption of ASU 2022-03 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 We are subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates. During the periods covered by our financial statements, the interest rates on the debt investments within our portfolio were primarily at floating rates. We expect that our debt investments in the future will primarily have floating interest rates. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 99 and 94 , respectively, of the outstanding principal amount of our debt investments bore interest at floating rates. Contractual interest rates on our commitments to lend to our portfolio companies are typically based on the Prime Rate as published in the Wall Street Journal. 
 
 Based on our September 30, 2024 consolidated statement of assets and liabilities (without adjustment for potential changes in the credit market, credit quality, size and composition of assets on the consolidated statement of assets and liabilities or other business developments that could affect net income) and the base index rates at September 30, 2024, the following table shows the annual impact on the change in net assets resulting from operations of changes in interest rates, which assumes no changes in our investments and borrowings:

While our 2027 Notes, our 2026 Notes, and our 2022 Asset-Backed Notes bear interest at a fixed rate, our Credit Facilities have floating interest rate provisions. The Key Facility is subject to an interest rate floor of 0.10 per annum, based on a prime rate index which resets monthly. The interest payable on the NYL Facility is based on the Three Year I Curve rate plus a margin of 3.20 with an interest rate floor and resets on any advance date. The interest payable on the Nuveen Facility is based on the United States Treasury constant maturity 3-year and 5-year rates plus a margin of 3.15 with an interest rate floor and resets on any advance date. Any other credit facilities into which we enter in the future may have floating interest rate provisions. We have used hedging instruments in the past to protect us against interest rate fluctuations, and we may use them in the future. Such instruments may include caps, swaps, futures, options and forward contracts. While hedging activities may insulate us against adverse changes in interest rates, they may also limit our ability to participate in the benefits of lower interest rates with respect to the investments in our portfolio with fixed interest rates. Engaging in commodity interest transactions such as swap transactions or futures contracts on our behalf may cause our Advisor to fall within the definition of commodity pool operator under the Commodity Exchange Act (the CEA ), and related Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the CFTC ), regulations. On January 31, 2020, our Advisor claimed an exclusion from the definition of the term commodity pool operator under the CEA and the CFTC regulations in connection with its management of us and, therefore, is not subject to CFTC registration or regulation under the CEA as a commodity pool operator with respect to its management of us.

Because we currently fund, and expect to continue to fund, our investments with borrowings, our net income is dependent upon the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we invest the funds borrowed. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our net income. In periods of rising interest rates, our cost of funds could increase, which would reduce our net investment income. 
 
 Inflation and Supply Chain Risk 
 
 Economic activity has continued to accelerate across sectors and regions. Nevertheless, due to global supply chain issues, geopolitical events, a rise in energy prices and strong consumer demand as economies continue to reopen, inflation is showing signs of acceleration in the U.S. and globally. Inflation is likely to continue in the near to medium-term, particularly in the U.S., with the possibility that monetary policy may tighten in response. Persistent inflationary pressures could affect our portfolio companies profit margins. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 (a) Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a 15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective and provided reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our periodic SEC filings is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. However, in evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of such possible controls and procedures. 
 
 (b) Changes in internal controls over financial reporting. 
 
 There have been no material changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a 15(f) and 15d 15(f) under the Exchange Act) during our most recently completed fiscal quarter, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 PART II 
 
 Item 1: Legal Proceedings. 
 
 We are not currently subject to any material legal proceedings, nor, to our knowledge, are any material legal proceeding threatened against us. From time to time, we may be a party to certain legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business, including proceedings relating to the enforcement of our rights under contracts with our portfolio companies. Our business is also subject to extensive regulation, which may result in regulatory proceedings against us. While the outcome of any such future legal or regulatory proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not expect that any such future proceedings will have a material effect upon our financial condition or results of operations. 
 
 Item 1A: Risk Factors. 
 
 In addition to other information set forth in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, you should carefully consider the factors set forth in Item 1A Risk Factors in our annual report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2023, which could materially affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. There have been no material changes during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to the risk factors set forth in Item 1A. Risk Factors of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.
