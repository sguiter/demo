 Description of the Company 
 Core Molding Technologies and its subsidiaries operate in the engineered materials market as operating segment as a molder of thermoplastic and thermoset structural products. The Company produces and sells molded products for varied markets, including medium and heavy-duty trucks, power sports, building products, industrial and utilities and other commercial markets. Core Molding Technologies has its headquarters in Columbus, Ohio, and operates six production facilities in the United States, Canada and Mexico. 

Business Overview 
 
 General 
 The Company s business and operating results are directly affected by changes in overall customer demand, operational costs and performance and leverage of our fixed cost and selling, general and administrative ("SG A") infrastructure. 
 
 Product sales fluctuate in response to several factors, including many that are beyond the Company s control, such as general economic conditions, interest rates, government regulations, consumer spending, raw material cost inflation, labor availability, and our customers production rates and inventory levels. The Company's customers operate in many different markets with different cyclicality and seasonality. 
 
 Operating performance is dependent on the Company s ability to manage changes in input costs for items such as raw materials, labor, and overhead operating costs. The Company has certain contractual commitments that restrict its ability to pass through changes in input costs to certain customers. As a result, during periods of significant increases or decreases in input costs operating results may be impacted. 
 
 Performance is also affected by manufacturing efficiencies, including items such as on time delivery, quality, scrap, and productivity. Market factors of supply and demand can impact operating costs. In periods of rapid increases or decreases in customer demand, the Company is required to ramp operational activity up or down quickly, which may impact manufacturing efficiencies more than in periods of steady demand. 
 
 Operating performance is also dependent on the Company s ability to effectively launch new customer programs, which are extremely complex in nature. The start of production of a new program is the result of a process of developing new molds and assembly equipment, validation testing, manufacturing process design, development and testing, along with training and often hiring employees. Meeting the targeted levels of manufacturing efficiency for new programs usually occurs over time as the Company gains experience with new tools and processes. Therefore, during a new program launch period, start-up costs and inefficiencies can affect operating results. 
 
 Business Outlook 
 
 Looking forward, based on industry analyst projections, customer forecasts, anticipated price changes, as well as anticipated new program launches, offset by current programs that we expect to continue to ramp down in the fourth quarter of 2024 as further described below, the Company expects revenues for the fourth quarter of 2024 to decrease by approximately 17 to 20 percent as compared to the same period in 2023. Additional factors contributing to our anticipated 2024 revenue outlook include an expected seasonal demand slowdown, decreased customer inventory builds due to optimizing inventory levels as well as a consumer demand environment that is more consistent with pre-pandemic levels.

 Beginning in the second half of 2024 and continuing through 2026, the Company s business with Volvo has and will begin transitioning from existing programs that the Company currently supplies to new programs that the Company does not support. Notwithstanding this transition and the completion of existing programs with Volvo, the Company continues to actively bid for new Volvo business, which we believe we will continue to secure outside of the current programs. Going forward we remain focused on continuing to replace phased out business from existing programs with new programs from Volvo or other customers. 
 
 The Company s raw material supply chains remain stable, and the Company anticipates raw material pricing in the fourth quarter of 2024 to remain flat or slightly lower as compared to 2023. Labor markets have also stabilized, although at higher cost levels over the past several years. The Company does not anticipate challenges in hiring hourly labor, although management believes wage pressure will continue primarily in Mexico. 
 
 As a result of overall demand level declines by our customers, the Company restructured its fixed cost and selling, general and administrative costs by reducing labor levels during the third quarter. As a result, the Company incurred restructuring charges, primarily severance costs, of 228,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and anticipates additional restructuring charges of approximately 81,000 in the three months ended December 31, 2024. The labor reduction is expected to provide annual savings of approximately 2,627,000.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Core Molding Technologies primary market risk results from changes in the price of commodities used in its manufacturing operations. Core Molding Technologies is also exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations associated with the Mexican Peso and Canadian Dollar. Core Molding Technologies does not hold any material market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes. The Company uses derivative financial instruments to hedge exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. 
 Core Molding Technologies has the following three items that are sensitive to market risks: (1) non-hedged loans under the Huntington Credit Agreement, all of which bear a variable interest rate; (2) non-hedged foreign currency purchases in which the Company purchases Mexican Pesos and Canadian Dollars with United States Dollars to meet certain obligations; and (3) raw material purchases in which Core Molding Technologies purchases various resins, fiberglass, and metal components for use in production. The prices and availability of these materials are affected by the prices of crude oil, natural gas and other feedstocks, tariffs, as well as processing capacity versus demand. 
 Assuming a hypothetical 10 change in short-term interest rates, interest paid on the Term Loan would be impacted, as the interest rate on these loans is based upon SOFR. It would not, however, have a material effect on earnings before tax as the Company has entered into a hedge to offset changes in SOFR. 
 Assuming a hypothetical 10 decrease in the United States Dollar to Mexican Peso and Canadian Dollar exchange rate, the Company would be impacted by an increase in operating costs, which would have an adverse effect on operating margins. 
 Assuming a hypothetical 10 increase in commodity prices, Core Molding Technologies would be impacted by an increase in raw material costs, which would have an adverse effect on operating margins. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures

Based upon this evaluation, the Company s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were (i) effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company s reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act was accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure, and (ii) effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company s reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. There were no changes in internal controls over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)) that occurred in the last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.
