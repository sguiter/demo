 million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The Company estimates the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities related to the regulatory and product development milestones using the probability-weighted scenario based discounted cash flow model, which is consistent with the initial measurement of the contingent consideration liabilities. Probabilities of success are applied to each potential scenario and the resulting values are discounted using a present-value factor. The passage of time in addition to changes in projected milestone achievement timing, present-value factor, the degree of achievement, if applicable, and probabilities of success may result in adjustments to the fair value measurement. The fair value of the contingent consideration liability recorded related to regulatory and product development milestones was determined using a weighted average probability of success of and as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and a weighted average present-value factor of and as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The projected fiscal year of payment range is from 2025 to 2031. Unobservable inputs were weighted by the relative fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities. 
 The revenue milestone associated with the Ashion acquisition is not expected to be achieved and therefore no liability has been recorded for this milestone.

Forward-Looking Statements 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that are intended to be covered by the safe harbor created by those sections. Forward-looking statements, which are based on certain assumptions and describe our future plans, strategies and expectations, can generally be identified by the use of forward-looking terms such as believe, expect, may, will, should, would, could, seek, intend, plan, goal, project, estimate, anticipate or other comparable terms. All statements other than statements of historical facts included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q regarding our strategies, prospects, expectations, financial condition, operations, costs, plans and objectives are forward-looking statements.

Forward-looking statements are neither historical facts nor assurances of future performance or events. Instead, they are based only on current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding the future of our business, future plans and strategies, projections, anticipated events and trends, the economy and other future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of our control. Actual results, conditions and events may differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Therefore, you should not rely on any of these forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause actual results, conditions and events to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements include, among others, the following: our ability to successfully and profitably market our products and services; the acceptance of our products and services by patients and healthcare providers; our ability to meet demand for our products and services; our reliance upon certain suppliers, including suppliers that are the sole source of certain supplies and products used in our tests and operations; approval and maintenance of adequate reimbursement rates for our products and services within and outside of the U.S.; the amount and nature of competition for our products and services; the effects of any judicial, executive or legislative action affecting us or the healthcare system; recommendations, guidelines and quality metrics issued by various organizations regarding cancer screening or our products and services; our ability to successfully develop and commercialize new products and services and assess potential market opportunities; our ability to effectively enter into and utilize strategic partnerships and acquisitions; our success establishing and maintaining collaborative, licensing and supplier arrangements; our ability to obtain and maintain regulatory approvals and comply with applicable regulations; our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property; the results of our validation studies and clinical trials, including the risks that the results of future studies and trials may differ materially from the results of previously completed studies and trials; our ability to manage an international business and our expectations regarding our international expansion and opportunities; our ability to raise the capital necessary to support our operations or meet our payment obligations under our indebtedness; the potential effects of changing macroeconomic conditions, including the effects of inflation, interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, and geopolitical conflict; the possibility that the anticipated benefits from our business acquisitions will not be realized in full or at all or may take longer to realize than expected; the possibility that costs or difficulties related to the integration of acquired businesses operations or the divestiture of business operations will be greater than expected and the possibility that integration or divestiture efforts will disrupt our business and strain management time and resources; the outcome of any litigation, government investigations, enforcement actions or other legal proceedings; and our ability to retain and hire key personnel. The risks included above are not exhaustive. Other important risks and uncertainties are described in the Risk Factors and in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations sections of the 2023 Form 10-K and subsequently filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. You are further cautioned not to place undue reliance upon any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. Except as otherwise required by the federal securities laws, we undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise.

Building on the success of the Cologuard and Oncotype DX tests, we are investing in our pipeline to develop innovative solutions for use before, during, and after a cancer diagnosis. 
 
 During the third quarter of 2024, we achieved many critical milestones, including: 
 delivering tests results to 1.2 million people including a record number for Cologuard and Oncotype DX, 
 growing total revenue 13 year-over-year while leveraging efficiencies in our operating expenses, 
 generating cash provided by operating activities of 138.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an improvement of 114.4 million in comparison to the three months ended September 30, 2023, 
 increasing customer satisfaction and brand awareness to all-time highs, 
 receiving U.S. Food and Drug Administration FDA approval for Cologuard Plus TM , our next-generation Cologuard test, 
 showcasing data at the European Society for Medical Oncology ESMO 2024 congress for our liquid biopsy colon cancer screening and multi-cancer screening tests, and 
 gaining acceptance from a top-tier journal for the first publication of Oncodetect TM , our molecular residual disease MRD test. 

Our Screening Tests 
 Cologuard Test 
 Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States U.S. and the leading cause of cancer deaths in the U.S. among non-smokers. Each year in the U.S., there are approximately 153,000 new cases of colorectal cancer and approximately 53,000 deaths. It is widely accepted that colorectal cancer is among the most preventable, yet least prevented cancers. 
 Our flagship screening product, the Cologuard test, is a patient-friendly, non-invasive stool-based DNA sDNA screening test that utilizes a multi-target approach to detect DNA and hemoglobin biomarkers associated with colorectal cancer and pre-cancer. Upon approval by the FDA in August 2014, our Cologuard test became the first and only FDA-approved sDNA non-invasive colorectal cancer screening test. Our Cologuard test is now indicated for average risk adults 45 years of age and older. In October 2024, the FDA approved Cologuard Plus, our next-generation Cologuard test, which we expect to launch with Medicare coverage and guideline inclusion in 2025. 
 Genetic Testing 
 We provide more than 5,000 predefined genetic tests for nearly all clinically relevant genes, additional custom panels, and comprehensive germline, whole exome PGxome ), and whole genome PGnome sequencing tests. 
 Riskguard TM , our hereditary cancer test, helps people understand their inherited risk of cancer, arming them with critical information to make more informed treatment decisions. 

Our Precision Oncology Tests 
 Our precision oncology portfolio delivers actionable genomic insights to inform prognosis and cancer treatment after a diagnosis. In breast cancer, the Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score test is the only test shown to predict the likelihood of chemotherapy benefit as well as the chance of cancer recurrence in the most common sub-type of early-stage breast cancer. As the only test proven to predict both the likelihood of chemotherapy benefit and cancer recurrence, the Oncotype DX test is recognized globally as standard of care and is included in all major breast cancer treatment guidelines. The OncoExTra test applies comprehensive tumor profiling, utilizing whole exome and whole transcriptome sequencing, to aid in therapy selection for patients with advanced, metastatic, refractory, relapsed, or recurrent cancer. With an extensive panel of approximately 20,000 genes and 169 introns, the OncoExTra test is one of the most comprehensive genomic (DNA) and transcriptomic (RNA) panels available today. We enable patients to take a more active role in their cancer care and make it easy for providers to order tests, interpret results, and personalize medicine.

International Business Background and Products 
 We commercialize or plan to commercialize our Oncotype tests internationally through employees in Canada, Japan and a number of European countries, as well as through exclusive distribution agreements. We have provided our Oncotype tests in approximately 120 countries outside of the U.S. We do not offer our Cologuard test outside of the U.S. 

Upcoming Test Launches 
 We are preparing to launch in 2025 new screening and diagnostic tests to address unmet patient needs and enhance our existing products. 
 Cologuard Plus - Our Cologuard Plus test sets a new performance standard in non-invasive colorectal cancer screening. Our Cologuard Plus test detects cancers and precancerous polyps with even greater sensitivity than our Cologuard test while reducing false positives by more than 30 percent. In October 2024, the FDA approved our Cologuard Plus test for adults ages 45 and older of average risk for colorectal cancer. This approval was based on results from our pivotal BLUE-C study, which showed 95 overall cancer sensitivity and 43 sensitivity for advanced precancerous lesions at 94 specificity when age-weighted to the U.S. population with no findings on colonoscopy. We expect to launch our Cologuard Plus test with Medicare coverage and guideline inclusion in 2025. 
 Oncodetect - We expect to launch our Oncodetect MRD test for patients with colorectal cancer, supported by forthcoming data releases and medical journal publications. We recently completed clinical validation of our tumor-informed platform utilizing colorectal cancer samples. Results will be submitted to MolDx for approval and subsequent Medicare reimbursement. Our tumor-informed Oncodetect test is designed to detect small amounts of tumor DNA that may remain in patients blood after they have undergone initial colorectal cancer treatment. This test will help patients and oncologists understand the success of initial treatment, guide further treatment, and monitor for cancer recurrence. 
 Pipeline Research and Development 
 We are continuing to advance our pipeline of future screening and diagnostic products, including risk assessment, screening and prevention, early disease diagnosis, adjuvant and/or neoadjuvant disease treatment, metastatic disease treatment selection, and patient monitoring. 
 Through our collaboration with Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research Mayo ), we have successfully performed validation studies involving multiple types of cancer using tissue, blood, and other sample types. Our research and development programs are also powered by technologies we have exclusively licensed from The Johns Hopkins University, Broad Institute, Inc. Broad Institute ), Oxford University, the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, and TwinStrand Biosciences, Inc. TwinStrand ). 
 We are focusing our research and development efforts on three main areas: 
 Colorectal Cancer Screening . Over the past decade, together with Mayo, we have been seeking to develop even better colorectal cancer screening tests. Beyond Cologuard Plus, we are also working to develop a blood-based screening test for colorectal cancer. In September 2024, we presented performance data for our blood-based colorectal cancer screening test at the ESMO Congress, showing sensitivities of 88 for colorectal cancer and 31 for advanced precancerous lesions at specificity of 90 for negative samples confirmed by colonoscopy. BLUE-C pivotal study results for our blood-based colorectal cancer screening test are expected in the first half of 2025.

 MRD Test Development. In addition to our expected 2025 launch of Oncodetect for patients with colorectal cancer, we plan to validate Oncodetect for other cancer types, including breast cancer, and continually enhance the performance characteristics of our MRD test offerings over time. We recently completed clinical validation of our tumor-informed platform utilizing colorectal cancer samples. Results will be submitted to MolDx for approval and subsequent Medicare reimbursement. In June 2023, we entered into a sponsored research agreement and exclusive license agreement with Broad Institute to utilize their Minor Allele Enriched Sequencing Through Recognition Oligonucleotides MAESTRO diagnostic testing technology to further our ability to develop and launch impactful MRD tests. We are developing the MAESTRO platform for use in certain future MRD tests. 
 Multi-cancer Screening Test Development. We are currently seeking to develop a multi-cancer screening test, which will be branded as Cancerguard TM , to help detect many different types of cancer from a single blood draw. ASCEND-2, a multi-center, prospective, case-control study of over 11,000 clinically characterized participants, validates the sensitivity and specificity of our multi-biomarker class approach across a broad range of cancer types, including the most aggressive cancers and cancers with no current standard of care for screening. We presented initial ASCEND-2 data in April 2024 at the American Association for Cancer Research AACR annual meeting, which demonstrated the ability to detect cancer signals from 21 cancer types with a mean sensitivity of 50.9 with 98.5 specificity and 56.8 sensitivity when breast and prostate cancer were excluded from the analysis. We plan to share additional analyses from ASCEND-2 at an upcoming scientific conference. Our multi-cancer screening test was recently approved by the FDA to be used within a real-world evidence study, providing an opportunity to test 25,000 people over the next three years. The first patient was enrolled within this study at Baylor Scott White, the primary study site, in August 2024. In the future, we plan to begin recruiting patients for the FDA registrational Study of All comeRs SOAR trial, which we expect to be the largest prospective, interventional multi-cancer screening trial ever conducted in the U.S. 
 Research and development, which includes our clinical study programs, accounts for a material portion of our operating expenses. As we seek to enhance our product portfolio and advance our pipeline, we expect that our research and development expenditures will continue to be a significant portion of our operating expenditures. 

2024 Priorities 
 Our top priorities for 2024 are to (1) focus on our people and customers, (2) bring our portfolio to life, and (3) magnify our impact. 
 Focus on our People and Customers 
 We want to continue to provide an exceptional experience for our patients and team members. We plan to improve customer relations by delivering simple and smooth workflows, providing communication that is clear and easy to understand, and providing results that are fast and accurate. We will also strive to ensure that Exact Sciences remains a great place to work by taking care of our people. 
 Bring our Portfolio to Life 
 We will focus on advancing new tests in our highest priority programs including colorectal cancer screening, MRD, and multi-cancer screening. We plan to continue investing in our clinical trials to enhance existing products and bring new products to patients and providers, including obtaining FDA approval and securing coverage for our next generation Cologuard test, Cologuard Plus. 
 Magnify our Impact 
 We are committed to improving lives through testing more people with our laboratory testing services in 2024 including expanding screening access to underserved populations. By testing more people, we will continue to expand our business in a cost-efficient manner allowing us to generate sustainable profits and increase shareholder value. Generating sustained profits will put the company in a better position to continue investing in life-changing cancer diagnostics to help achieve our mission.

 Recent Developments and Trends 
 We estimate there are up to 60 million Americans that are not up to date with their colon cancer screenings. The capacity for screening colonoscopies in the U.S. is relatively fixed because it is dependent on the number of gastroenterologists available to perform the procedures. Health systems, payers, and health care providers are motivated to increase screening rates because they are measured as part of the Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set HEDIS and Medicare Stars quality measure systems. More health systems and payers are recognizing the opportunity to partner with Exact Sciences to address their screening rates and related quality measures through large, organized screening programs. We aim to partner with them to implement our Cologuard test within these programs as a solution for patients who infrequently visit their health care provider. Cologuard utilization is increasing in this setting, helping us screen more Americans. 
 We have an opportunity to impact even more lives by increasing adoption of Oncotype DX tests internationally. In 2023, we secured reimbursement for the Oncotype DX test in Japan. Breast cancer is the most common cancer among Japanese women, with about 45,000 new diagnoses of early-stage HR+, HER2- breast cancer each year. With reimbursement in place, we estimate our Oncotype DX test could help more than 100 women per day understand if their cancer is likely to recur and whether chemotherapy should be used in their treatment plan. 

Results of Operations 
 We have incurred losses since our inception and, as of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately 3.63 billion. While our operating results have continued to improve, we expect to incur net losses for the near future, and it is possible we may never become profitable or sustain profitability. 
 Revenue. Our Screening revenue primarily includes laboratory service revenue from our Cologuard and Prevention Genetics, LLC PreventionGenetics tests while our Precision Oncology revenue primarily includes laboratory service revenue from global Oncotype DX and therapy selection tests.

 The increase in Screening revenue was mainly due to an increase in the number of completed Cologuard tests. The increase in completed Cologuard tests for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was due to growth across all customer segments, more patients rescreening with our Cologuard test, and expansion of organized screening programs run by payers and health systems. The increase in Precision Oncology revenue was mainly due to an increase in the number of completed Oncotype DX breast cancer tests, both domestically and internationally, led by an increased number of ordering providers outside the U.S., specifically in Japan. We discontinued our COVID-19 testing business in the second quarter of 2023 due to lower demand, which led to the decrease in COVID-19 testing revenue. A discussion on our COVID-19 testing business was provided in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

 Adjustments to revenue recognized during the period relating to prior period estimates were less than 1 of revenue recorded in our condensed consolidated statement of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Adjustments to revenue recognized during the period relating to prior period estimates were less than 2 of revenue recorded in our condensed consolidated statement of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The impact to revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was due to improvements made in our billing systems and processes, including international contracting and collections. 
 We expect continuing revenue growth for our Cologuard and Oncotype tests subject to seasonal variability. Our revenues are affected by the test volume of our products, patient adherence rates, payer mix, the levels of reimbursement, our order to cash operations, and payment patterns of payers and patients. 
 Cost of sales (exclusive of amortization of acquired intangible assets). The increase in cost of sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to an increase in production costs, personnel expenses, and facility and support services, which was a result of an increase in completed Cologuard and Oncotype tests and the corresponding increase in headcount to support the increase in tests completed. Cost of sales (exclusive of amortization of acquired intangible assets) as a percentage of revenue increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily due to higher Cologuard test volume from organized screening programs run by payers and health systems. We expect that cost of sales will generally continue to increase in future periods as a result of an increase in our existing laboratory testing services and as we launch our pipeline products. We also expect to see a corresponding increase in personnel and support services associated with this growth.

 Research and development expenses. The decrease in research and development expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to a decrease in resources needed to support our ongoing clinical studies as discussed in further detail above. The increase in research and development expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to the termination of a license agreement with The Translational Genomics Research Institute TGen resulting in the recognition of an expense of 25.8 million in the second quarter of 2024. In addition, personnel expenses grew for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily due to an increase in average headcount during the year. This was partially offset by a decrease in direct research and development costs as discussed above. We expect that research and development expenses will generally continue to increase in future periods as we continue to invest to advance new tests.

 Sales and marketing expenses. Sales and marketing expenses increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to continued investment in high impact sales and marketing opportunities. We anticipate sales and marketing expenses will generally increase in future periods as we reinvest in sales and marketing to meet demand for current products and the launch of new products, while continuing to decrease as a percentage of revenue over time, driven by the growth of Cologuard and Oncotype testing services.

 General and administrative expenses. The decrease in general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to a reduction in certain incentive-based compensation arrangements and a reduction in other discretionary spend including professional and legal fees as a result of our cost savings measures that were implemented. The decrease in general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to the settlement of certain legal matters in 2023, as further described in Note 15 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.These reductions were partially offset by increases in other general and administrative expense as a result of the change in fair value of our outstanding contingent consideration liabilities. Refer to Note 7 of our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further discussion of our outstanding contingent consideration liabilities. We expect general and administrative expenses throughout the remainder of 2024 will remain relatively consistent with costs incurred thus far in 2024. We expect general and administrative expenses will decrease over time as we leverage efficiencies in our personnel and information technology systems.

Amortization of acquired intangible assets increased to 71.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 68.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to amortization of the intangible asset acquired as part of our acquisition of Resolution Bioscience in September 2023 and our acquisition of intellectual property through a license from TwinStrand in July 2024. 
 Impairment of long-lived assets. Impairment of long-lived assets was 18.7 million and 31.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to zero and 0.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The impairment charges recorded during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 related to the closure of certain of our domestic facilities.

Income tax expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was primarily related to current foreign and state tax expense. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Overview 
 We have incurred losses since our inception, and have historically financed our operations primarily through public offerings of our common stock and convertible debt and through revenue generated by the sale of our laboratory testing services. We expect our operating expenditures to continue to increase to support future growth of our laboratory testing services, as well as an increase in research and development and clinical trial costs to support the advancement of our pipeline products and bringing new tests to market. We expect that cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand at September 30, 2024, along with cash flows generated through our operations, will be sufficient to fund our current operations for at least the next twelve months based on current operating plans. 
 We have access to a revolving line-of-credit (the Revolver of up to 150.0 million, which had its maturity date extended to November 2025 through an amended agreement in October 2022. The Revolver is collateralized by certain marketable securities which must continue to maintain a minimum market value of 150.0 million. PNC Bank, National Association has issued letters of credit totaling 4.4 million, which reduces the amount available for cash advances under the line of credit to 145.6 million. As of September 30, 2024, we had not drawn any funds under the Revolver. The Revolver is further described in Note 8 of our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 We may raise additional capital to expand our business, to pursue strategic investments, to take advantage of financing opportunities or for other reasons. If we are unable to obtain sufficient additional funds to enable us to fund our business plans and strategic investments, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected, and we may be required to delay the implementation of our plans or otherwise scale back our operations. There can be no certainty that we will ever be successful in generating sufficient cash flow from operations to achieve and maintain profitability and meet all of our obligations as they come due.

 Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 588.8 million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and approximately 432.3 million in marketable securities. 
 The majority of our investments in marketable securities consist of fixed income investments, and all are deemed available-for-sale. The objectives of this portfolio are to provide liquidity and safety of principal while striving to achieve the highest rate of return. Our investment policy limits investments to certain types of instruments issued by institutions with investment grade credit ratings and places restrictions on maturities and concentration by type and issuer. 
 Cash Flows

 Operating activities 
 The increase in cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to an increase in revenue. This was partially offset by an increase in operating expenses and cost of sales to support the increase in revenue as discussed in the Results of Operations section above and timing of payments on our accounts payable and accrued expenses and collections of our accounts receivable. 
 Investing activities 
 The increase in cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to cash provided by investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was due to a net increase of 507.4 million in cash used for purchases, maturities and sales of marketable securities as a result of a change in investing strategy towards more fixed income securities compared to money market funds as money market yields have decreased. We also increased our purchases of property, plant and equipment by 10.4 million due to additional investments in information technology infrastructure and lab automation. The increase in cash used in investing activities was partially offset by a decrease in cash used related to business combinations and asset acquisitions. We made payments of 45.0 million for our license of intellectual property from TwinStrand during the third quarter of 2024 compared to a cash payment of 50.0 for our acquisition of Resolution Bioscience, Inc. in the third quarter of 2023. 
 Financing activities 
 The increase in cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to proceeds of 266.8 million from the issuance of convertible notes in the second quarter of 2024 compared to proceeds of 138.0 million from the issuance of convertible notes in the first quarter of 2023. This was partially offset by a payment of 50.0 million in settlement of our previously outstanding accounts receivable securitization facility Securitization Facility upon maturity in June 2024. 
 Material Cash Requirements 
 A discussion of our material cash requirements as of December 31, 2023 was provided in the Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation of our 2023 Form 10-K. Other than the matters described below, there were no material changes outside the ordinary course of our business in our specified material cash requirements during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

 In April 2024, we entered into privately negotiated agreements (the Agreements with certain holders of our convertible notes due in 2028 2028 Notes ). Pursuant to the Agreements, we issued 620.7 million aggregate principal amount of a new series of Convertible Notes due in 2031 (the 2031 Notes in exchange for (i) the retirement of 359.7 million in aggregate principal amount of 2028 Notes, and (ii) payment to the Company of 266.8 million in cash. The net proceeds from the issuance of the Notes were approximately 259.8 million, after deducting commissions and the offering expenses payable by the Company. The 2031 Notes mature on April 15, 2031 and bear interest at a fixed rate of 1.75 per year, payable semiannually in arrears on October 15 and April 15 of each year, beginning on October 15, 2024. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had outstanding aggregate principal of 249.2 million on our convertible notes with a maturity date of January 15, 2025 (the 2025 Notes ), which are classified as convertible notes, net, current portion on the condensed consolidated balance sheet. Beginning July 15, 2024, which is six months prior to the maturity date of the 2025 Notes, holders of the 2025 Notes may elect to convert such notes at any time. In accordance with the terms of the 2025 Notes, any 2025 Notes that are converted after July 15, 2024 will be settled through a combination settlement under which the par value will be settled in cash and any amount in excess of par value will be settled in shares of our common stock. 2025 Notes that are not converted prior to the maturity date will be settled in cash upon maturity. 
 In June 2024, we repaid the previously outstanding balance of 50.0 million in full upon maturity of the Securitization Facility. Prior to maturity, the Securitization Facility accrued interest at a rate equal to a daily secured overnight financing rate SOFR plus a SOFR adjustment and an applicable margin. The interest rate was 6.87 as of the maturity date. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be appropriate under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Our exposure to market risk is principally confined to our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and our outstanding variable-rate debt. We invest our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities in securities of the U.S. governments and its agencies and in investment-grade, highly liquid investments consisting of commercial paper, bank certificates of deposit, and corporate bonds, which as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were classified as available-for-sale. We place our cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable securities with high-quality financial institutions, limit the amount of credit exposure to any one institution, and have established investment guidelines relative to diversification and maturities designed to maintain safety and liquidity. 
 Based on a hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in market interest rates, the potential losses in future earnings, fair value of risk-sensitive financial instruments, and cash flows are immaterial, although the actual effects may differ materially from the hypothetical analysis. While we believe our cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable securities do not contain excessive risk, we cannot provide absolute assurance that, in the future, our investments will not be subject to adverse changes

 in market value. In addition, we maintain significant amounts of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable securities at one or more financial institutions that are in excess of federally insured limits. Given the potential instability of financial institutions, we cannot provide assurance that we will not experience losses on these deposits. We do not utilize interest rate hedging agreements or other interest rate derivative instruments. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had no outstanding variable rate debt. If we were to draw down amounts under our Revolving Loan, we would be impacted by increases in prevailing market interest rates. All of our other significant interest-bearing liabilities bear interest at fixed rates and therefore are not subject to fluctuations in market interest rates; however, because these interest rates are fixed, we may be paying a higher interest rate, relative to market, in the future if circumstances change. 
 Foreign Currency Risk 
 The functional currency for most of our international subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar, and as a result we are not subject to material gains and losses from foreign currency translation of the subsidiary financial statements. Substantially all of our revenues are recognized in U.S. dollars, although a small portion is denominated in foreign currency as we continue to expand into markets outside of the U.S. Certain expenses related to our international activities are payable in foreign currencies. As a result, factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets will affect our financial results. 
 We enter into forward contracts to mitigate the impact of adverse movements in foreign exchange rates related to the re-measurement of monetary assets and liabilities and hedge our foreign currency exchange rate exposure. As of September 30, 2024, we had open foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts of 47.7 million. Although the impact of currency fluctuations on our financial results has been immaterial in the past, there can be no guarantee that the impact of currency fluctuations related to our international activities will not be material in the future. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). Based upon that evaluation, our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. Disclosure controls and procedures enable us to record, process, summarize and report information required to be included in our Exchange Act filings within the required time period. Our disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the periodic reports filed with the SEC is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive, financial and accounting officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 There have been no significant changes in internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

 EXACT SCIENCES CORPORATION 
 2010 EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN 
 (As amended and restated on July 31, 2024) 
 Article 1 Purpose. 
 This 2010 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as amended and restated (the Plan ), is intended to encourage stock ownership by all eligible employees of Exact Sciences Corporation (the Company ), a Delaware corporation, and its Participating Subsidiaries (as defined in Article 17) so that they may share in the growth of the Company by acquiring or increasing their proprietary interest in the Company through the purchase of shares of the Company's common stock Common Stock ). The Plan is designed to encourage eligible employees to remain in the employ of the Company and its Participating Subsidiaries. 
 It is intended that a component of the Plan constitutes an employee stock purchase plan within the meaning of Section 423(b) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code and such component, the 423 Component and the 423 Component shall be interpreted in accordance with that intent (although the Company makes no undertaking or representation to maintain such qualification). 
 In addition, this Plan authorizes the grant of Options (as defined in Article 5) under a component of the Plan that does not qualify as an employee stock purchase plan under Section 423 of the Code (such component, the Non-423 Component ). Such Options granted under the Non-423 Component shall be granted pursuant to such sub-plans, appendices, rules or procedures as may be adopted by the Committee (as defined in Article 2) to achieve tax, securities laws or other objectives for the eligible employees and the Participating Subsidiaries designated for participation in the Non-423 Component. Except as otherwise provided herein or by the Committee, the Non-423 Component will operate and be administered in the same manner as the 423 Component. 
 For purposes of this Plan, the Committee may designate separate offerings under the Plan in which eligible employees will participate, the terms of which need not be identical even if the dates of the applicable Offering Periods of such offerings are identical, provided that the terms of participation are the same within each separate offering under the 423 Component as determined under Section 423 of the Code. Unless otherwise determined by the Committee, each offering under the Plan in which employee of one or more Participating Subsidiaries may participate shall be deemed a separate offering for purposes of Section 423 of the Code, even if the dates of the applicable Offering Periods of each such offering are identical, and the provisions of the Plan shall separately apply to each offering. 
 Article 2 Administration of the Plan. 
 The Plan may be administered by a committee appointed by the Board of Directors of the Company (the Committee ). The Board of Directors may from time to time remove members from, or add members to, the Committee. Vacancies on the Committee, howsoever caused, shall be filled by the Board of Directors. The Committee may select one of its members as Chairman, and shall hold meetings at such times and places as it may determine. Acts by a majority of the Committee, or acts reduced to or approved in writing by a majority of the members of the Committee, shall be the valid acts of the Committee. 
 The Committee has authority at any time to (i) adopt, alter and repeal such rules, guidelines and practices for the administration of the Plan and for its own acts and proceedings as it shall deem advisable (ii) interpret the terms and provisions of the Plan (iii) determine when and how Options shall be granted and the provisions and terms of each offering (which need not be identical between offerings) (iv) determine eligibility for participation in the Plan, including which subsidiaries of the Company will be Participating Subsidiaries and whether such Participating Subsidiaries participate in the 423 Component or the Non-423 Component (within the limits of the Plan) (v) make all determinations it deems advisable for the administration of the Plan (vi) decide all disputes arising in connection with the Plan and (vii) otherwise supervise the administration of the Plan. Further, the 
 
 1 

Committee may adopt sub-plans, appendices, rules or procedures relating to the operation and administration of the Plan to accommodate the specific requirements of local laws and procedures, provided that the adoption and implementation of any such sub-plans, appendices rules and or procedures would not cause the 423 Component to violate Section 423 of the Code. 
 All interpretations and decisions of the Committee shall be binding on all persons, including the Company and the participants. No member of the Board of Directors or individual exercising administrative authority with respect to the Plan shall be liable for any action or determination made in good faith with respect to the Plan or any Option granted hereunder. 
 In the event the Board of Directors fails to appoint or refrains from appointing a Committee, the Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors shall have all power and authority to administer the Plan. In such event, the word Committee wherever used herein shall be deemed to mean the Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. 
 To the extent not prohibited by applicable law, the Committee may, from time to time, delegate some or all of its authority under the Plan to a subcommittee or subcommittees of the Committee, to one or more of the Company s officers or management team, or to other persons or groups of persons as it deems necessary, appropriate or advisable under conditions or limitations that it may set at or after the time of the delegation. For purposes of the Plan, reference to the Committee will be deemed to include any subcommittee, subcommittees, or other persons or groups of persons to whom the Committee delegates authority pursuant to this provision. 
 Article 3 Eligible Employees. 
 All employees of the Company or any of its Participating Subsidiaries who are employed on or before the forty-fifth (45 th day (or such other period of time not to exceed two (2) years) prior to the beginning of an Offering Period and whose customary employment at such time is more than 20 hours per week and for more than five months in any calendar year shall be eligible to receive Options under the Plan to purchase shares of Common Stock, provided that the Committee may allow employees whose customary employment is below these thresholds to be considered as eligible employees, including where applicable law requires that such employees be considered as eligible employees, subject in all cases to the provisions of this Article 3 and the requirements set forth in Article 7 hereof. 
 An employee who works for a Participating Subsidiary and is a citizen or resident of a jurisdiction other than the United States (without regard to whether such individual also is a citizen or resident of the United States or is a resident alien (within the meaning of Section 7701(b)(1)(A) of the Code)) may be excluded from participation in the Plan or an offering if the participation of such employee is prohibited under the laws of the applicable jurisdiction or if complying with the laws of the applicable jurisdiction would cause the Plan or an offering under the 423 Component to violate Section 423 of the Code. In the case of the Non-423 Component, an employee (or group of employees) may be excluded from participation in the Plan if the Committee has determined, in its sole discretion, that participation of such employee(s) is not advisable or practicable for any reason. 
 In no event may an employee be granted an Option if such employee, immediately after the Option was granted, would be treated as owning stock possessing five percent or more of the total combined voting power or value of all classes of stock of the Company or of any parent corporation or subsidiary corporation, as the terms parent corporation and subsidiary corporation are defined in Section 424(e) and (f) of the Code. For purposes of determining stock ownership under this paragraph, the rules of Section 424(d) of the Code shall apply, and stock which the employee may purchase under outstanding Options shall be treated as stock owned by the employee. 
 Article 4 Stock Subject to the Plan. 
 The stock subject to the Options under the Plan shall be shares of the Company's authorized but unissued common stock, par value .01 per share (the Common Stock ), or shares of Common Stock reacquired by the Company, including shares purchased in the open market. The aggregate number of shares of Common Stock which 
 
 2 

may be issued pursuant to the Plan is 5,800,000 subject to adjustment as provided in Article 12. If any Option granted under the Plan shall expire or terminate for any reason without having been exercised in full or shall cease for any reason to be exercisable in whole or in part, the unpurchased shares subject thereto shall again be available under the Plan. For avoidance of doubt, up to the maximum number of Shares reserved under this Article 4 may be used to satisfy purchases of shares of Common Stock under the 423 Component and any remaining portion of such maximum number of shares of Common Stock may be used to satisfy purchases of shares of Common Stock under the Non-423 Component. 
 Article 5 Offering Period and Stock Options. 
 The Plan shall be implemented by consecutive or overlapping Offering Periods, with a new Offering Period commencing on the first day of the relevant Offering Period and terminating on the last day of the relevant Offering Period (an Offering Period ). The Offering Periods shall (a) consist of one or more dates within each Offering Period on which shares of Common Stock may be purchased by participants in an Offering Period specified by the Committee prior to the scheduled beginning of the applicable Offering Period, to the extent they differ from the Exercise Dates set forth below Exercise Date(s) and (b) be of a duration, and commence on the dates, specified by the Committee prior to the scheduled beginning of the applicable Offering Period, to the extent they differ from the Offering Periods set forth below, provided that each Offering Period may not have a duration exceeding twenty-seven (27) months. Offering Periods under the Plan that began prior to November 1, 2024, shall consist of twenty-four-month periods commencing on November 1 and May 1 of each calendar year. For Offering Periods that began prior to November 1, 2024, there shall be four Exercise Dates occurring on each April 30 and October 31 (or, if such date is not a trading day, the first trading day thereafter) within each such Offering Period. Unless and until otherwise determined by the Committee, Offering Periods that begin on or after November 1, 2024, shall consist of six-month periods commencing on November 1 and May 1 of each calendar year. Unless and until otherwise determined by the Committee, for Offering Periods beginning on or after November 1, 2024, there shall be one Exercise Date per Offering Period, occurring on April 30 for Offering Periods that begin on November 1 and on October 31 for Offering Periods that begin on May 1 (or, if such Exercise Date is not a trading day, the first trading day thereafter). For the avoidance of any doubt, the Committee is vested with the authority to establish alternative sequential or overlapping Offering Periods, a different number of Exercise Dates within an Offering Period, a different duration for one or more Offering Periods or different commencement or ending dates for such Offering Periods with respect to future Offering Periods in accordance with the provisions contemplated in this Article 5 without stockholder approval. 
 On the first business day at the beginning of each Offering Period, the Company will grant to each eligible employee who is then a participant in the Plan an Option to purchase shares on the Exercise Dates (the Option ), at the Option Price hereinafter provided for, a maximum of 10,000 shares of Common Stock or such other smaller maximum number of shares of Common Stock that may be specified by the Committee prior to the scheduled beginning of the applicable Offering Period, on condition that such employee remains eligible to participate in the Plan on each Exercise Date. If the participant's accumulated payroll deductions on the last date of the Offering Period would enable the participant to purchase more than the maximum number of shares provided herein except for the share limitation set forth herein, the excess of the amount of the accumulated payroll deductions over the aggregate purchase price of the maximum number of Shares of Common Stock that may be purchased in accordance with this Article 5 shall be promptly refunded to the participant by the Company, without interest. The participant shall be entitled to exercise the Option so granted only to the extent of the participant's accumulated payroll deductions on the Exercise Date. The option price per share of Common Stock for each Exercise Date within an Offering Period shall be the lesser of (i) 85 of the average market price of the Common Stock on the first business day of the Offering Period and (ii) 85 of the average market price of the Common Stock on the applicable Exercise Date, in either event rounded up to the nearest cent (the Option Price ). The foregoing limitation on the number of shares subject to Option and the Option Price shall be subject to adjustment as provided in Article 12. 
 Unless a participant files a new authorization or withdraws from the Plan, the deductions and purchases under the authorization the participant has on file under the Plan will continue from one Offering Period to succeeding (but not overlapping) Offering Periods as long as the Plan remains in effect. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, to the extent that the Committee establishes multiple Exercise Dates within an Offering Period or 
 
 3 

overlapping Offering Periods with an Exercise Date based (in part) on the average market price of the Common Stock on the first business day of an Offering Period, the Committee shall have discretion to structure an Offering Period such that if the average market price of the Common Stock on an Exercise Date is less than or equal to the average market price of the Common Stock on the first business day of the Offering Period to which such Exercise Date relates, all participants shall be automatically withdrawn from such Offering Period immediately after the acquisition of shares of Common Stock for such Exercise Date and automatically enrolled in the immediately following Offering Period as of the first day thereof. 
 For purposes of the Plan, the term average market price on any date means (i) the average (on that date) of the high and low prices of the Common Stock on the principal national securities exchange on which the Common Stock is traded, if the Common Stock is then traded on a national securities exchange or (ii) the average of the closing bid and asked prices last quoted (on that date) by an established quotation service for over-the-counter securities, if the Common Stock is not reported on the NASDAQ or (iii) if the Common Stock is not publicly traded, the fair market value of the Common Stock as determined by the Committee after taking into consideration all factors which it deems appropriate, including, without limitation, recent sale and offer prices of the Common Stock in private transactions negotiated at arm's length. 
 For purposes of the Plan, the term business day means a day on which there is trading on the NASDAQ Capital Market or the aforementioned national securities exchange, whichever is applicable pursuant to the preceding paragraph and if neither is applicable, a day that is not a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday in State of Wisconsin. 
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, no participant may be granted an Option which permits his or her rights to purchase shares under the Plan, and any other employee stock purchase plan of the Company or Subsidiaries, to accrue at a rate which exceeds 25,000 of the fair market value of such shares (determined on the Option grant date or dates) for each calendar year in which the Option is outstanding at any time. The purpose of the limitation in the preceding sentence is to comply with Section 423(b)(8) of the Code and shall be applied taking Options into account in the order in which they were granted. Solely with respect to the 423 Component, for Offering Periods beginning on or after May 1, 2023, once the participant's accumulated payroll deductions would enable the participant to purchase the maximum amount of Common Stock permitted under the Section 423(b)(8) limitation described in this paragraph, payroll deductions will cease until the first day after the last Exercise Date in the calendar year in which accumulated payroll deductions reached such maximum amount. For both the 423 Component and the Non-423 Component, on any Exercise Date, if the participant s accumulated payroll deductions would otherwise enable the participant to purchase Common Stock in excess of the Section 423(b)(8) limitation described in this paragraph, the excess of the amount over the accumulated payroll deductions over the aggregate purchase price of the shares actually purchased shall be promptly refunded to the participant by the Company, without interest. 
 Article 6 Exercise of Option. 
 Each eligible employee who continues to be a participant in the Plan on an Exercise Date within an Offering Period shall be deemed to have exercised his or her Option on such date and shall be deemed to have purchased from the Company such number of full shares of Common Stock reserved for the purpose of the Plan as the participant's accumulated payroll deductions on such date will pay for at the Option Price, subject to the 10,000 maximum share limit (or other maximum share limit, as applicable) of the Option and the Section 423(b)(8) limitation described in Article 5. Only full shares of Common Stock may be purchased under the Plan, unless the Committee determines, in its sole discretion, that fractional shares may be purchased under the Plan. Unless otherwise determined by the Committee in advance of any Offering Period, unused payroll deductions remaining in a participant's account at the end of either an Exercise Date or an Offering Period, by reason of the inability to purchase a fractional share, shall be promptly refunded to the participant by the Company, without interest.

Article 7 Authorization for Entering the Plan. 
 An employee may elect to enter the Plan by filling out, signing and delivering an authorization to the Company (in such form and according to such procedures determined by the Committee which may include by electronic or other delivery). Such authorization shall 
 A. State the percentage to be deducted regularly from the employee's Compensation 
 B. Authorize the purchase of stock for the employee in each Offering Period in accordance with the terms of the Plan 
 C. Specify the exact name or names in which stock purchased for the employee is to be issued as provided under Article 11 hereof and 
 D. Include the employee's agreement any other terms and conditions for participation in the Plan that the Committee determines to be advisable. 
 Such authorization must be received by the Company at least ten days before the first day of the next Offering Period, or within such other time frame as determined by the Company and communicated to eligible employees, and shall take effect only if the employee is an eligible employee on the first business day of such Offering Period. 
 An employee cannot participate in more than one Offering Period at any time. 
 Unless a participant files a new authorization or withdraws from the Plan, the deductions and purchases under the authorization the participant has on file under the Plan will continue from one Offering Period to succeeding (but not overlapping) Offering Periods as long as the Plan remains in effect. The terms and conditions applicable to participation in the Plan in such successive Offering Periods shall be those in effect at the commencement of such successive Offering Periods, as set forth in the Plan and the authorization documentation available to eligible employees at such time. 
 The Company will accumulate and hold for each participant's account the amounts deducted from his or her Compensation. No interest will be paid on these amounts, unless required by applicable law. For purposes of the Plan, the term Compensation means the amount of base pay or wages (including 13th 14th month payments or similar concepts under local law), including, in the interest of clarity, paid time off, paid leaves of absence (including statutory paid leave) paid by the Company, and overtime (including on-call payments and shift differentials), quarterly sales incentive payments, and corporate year-end and quarter-end bonus awards, but excluding any other one-time payments, allowances, and reimbursements for expenses such as relocation allowances or travel expenses, income or gains related to other Company share-based awards, and similar items. For U.S. participants, Compensation will include elective amounts that are not includible in the participant s gross income by reason of Sections 125, 132(f), or 401(k) of the Code. The Committee shall have the discretion to determine the application of this definition to participants on payrolls outside of the United States. 
 Article 8 Maximum Amount of Payroll Deductions. 
 An employee may authorize payroll deductions in an amount (expressed as a whole percentage) not less than one percent (1 but not more than fifteen percent (15 of the employee's total Compensation. 
 Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Plan to the contrary, in non-U.S. jurisdictions where participation in the Plan through payroll deductions is prohibited or otherwise problematic under applicable laws (as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion), the Committee may provide that an eligible employee may elect to participate through other contributions in a form acceptable to the Committee in lieu of or in addition to payroll deductions, provided that, for any offering under the 423 Component, the Committee must determine that any alternative method of contribution is applied on an equal and uniform basis to all eligible employees in the offering. 
 
 5 

Any reference to payroll deductions in this Article 8 (or in any other section of the Plan) will similarly cover contributions by other means made pursuant to this Article 8. 
 Article 9 Change in Payroll Deductions. 
 Payroll deductions may not be increased or decreased during an Offering Period. However, a participant may withdraw in full from the Plan (as described in Article 10). The Committee may, in advance of any Offering Period, establish rules, procedures and deadlines permitting a participant to increase, decrease or terminate his or her payroll deductions during an Offering Period. 
 Article 10 Withdrawal from the Plan. 
 A participant may withdraw from the Plan (in whole but not in part), within such time prior to the Exercise Date for such Offering Period as may be established by the Committee, by delivering a withdrawal notice to the Company (in such form and according to such procedures determined by the Committee which may include by electronic or other delivery). In the event a participant elects to withdraw from the Plan, amounts then credited to such participant's account shall be returned to the participant as soon as practicable after such election is received by the Company (without any interest thereon except as may be required by applicable local laws), the participant shall cease to participate in the Plan and the participant s Option for such Offering Period shall terminate. 
 To re-enter the Plan, an employee who has previously withdrawn must file a new authorization at least ten days before the first day of the next Offering Period in which he or she wishes to participate, or within such other time frame as determined by the Company and communicated to eligible employees. The employee's re-entry into the Plan becomes effective at the beginning of such Offering Period, provided that he or she is an eligible employee on the first business day of the Offering Period. 
 Article 11 Issuance of Stock. 
 Certificates for stock issued to participants (or other indicia of ownership of such stock) shall be delivered as soon as practicable after each Exercise Date by the Company's transfer agent. 
 Stock purchased under the Plan shall be issued only in the name of the participant, or if the participant's authorization so specifies and if and to the extent permitted by the Company, in the name of the participant and another person of legal age as joint tenants with rights of survivorship. 
 Article 12 Adjustments. 
 Upon the happening of any of the following described events, a participant's rights under Options granted under the Plan shall be adjusted as hereinafter provided 
 A. In the event that the shares of Common Stock shall be subdivided or combined into a greater or smaller number of shares or if, upon a reorganization, split-up, liquidation, recapitalization or the like of the Company, the shares of Common Stock shall be exchanged for other securities of the Company, each participant shall be entitled, subject to the conditions herein stated, to purchase such number of shares of Common Stock or amount of other securities of the Company as were exchangeable for the number of shares of Common Stock that such participant would have been entitled to purchase except for such action, and appropriate adjustments shall be made in the purchase price per share to reflect such subdivision, combination or exchange and 
 B. In the event the Company shall issue any of its shares or other securities, including any of the shares of any of its subsidiaries, as a stock dividend upon or with respect to the shares of stock of the class which shall at the time be subject to Option hereunder, each participant upon exercising such an Option shall be entitled to receive (for the purchase price paid upon such exercise) the shares as to which the participant is exercising his or her Option and, in addition thereto (at no additional cost), such number of 
 
 6 

shares of the class or classes in which such stock dividend or dividends were declared or paid, and such amount of cash in lieu of fractional shares, as is equal to the number of shares thereof and the amount of cash in lieu of fractional shares, respectively, which the participant would have received if the participant had been the holder of the shares as to which the participant is exercising his or her Option at all times between the date of the granting of such Option and the date of its exercise. 
 Upon the happening of any of the foregoing events (or in the event of an extraordinary cash dividend or other distribution that affects the shares of Common Stock), the class and aggregate number of shares set forth in Article 4 hereof which are subject to Options which have been or may be granted under the Plan and the limitations set forth in the second paragraph of Article 5 shall also be appropriately adjusted to reflect the events specified in paragraphs A and B above. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any adjustments made pursuant to paragraphs A or B shall be made only after the Committee, based on advice of counsel for the Company, determines whether such adjustments would constitute a modification (as that term is defined in Section 424 of the Code). If the Committee determines that such adjustments would constitute a modification, it may refrain from making such adjustments. 
 If the Company is to be consolidated with or acquired by another entity in a merger, a sale of all or substantially all of the Company's assets or otherwise (an Acquisition ), the Committee or the board of directors of any entity assuming the obligations of the Company hereunder (the Successor Board shall, with respect to Options then outstanding under the Plan, either (i) make appropriate provision for the continuation of such Options by arranging for the substitution on an equitable basis for the shares then subject to such Options either (a) the consideration payable with respect to the outstanding shares of the Common Stock in connection with the Acquisition, (b) shares of stock of the successor corporation, or a parent or subsidiary of such corporation, or (c) such other securities as the Successor Board deems appropriate, the fair market value of which shall not materially exceed the fair market value of the shares of Common Stock subject to such Options immediately preceding the Acquisition (ii) shorten the Offering Period with respect to which such Options relate by setting a new Exercise Date on which such Offering Period will end, with such new Exercise Date occurring before the effective date of the Acquisition, and provided that each participant shall be notified of the new Exercise Date on which the Options will be exercised as provided in Article 6 hereof, unless prior to such date the participant has withdrawn from the Offering Period as provided in Article 10 hereof or the participant has ceased to be an eligible employee as provided in Article 14 hereof or (iii) terminate each participant's Option in exchange for a cash payment equal to the excess of (a) the fair market value, on the date of the Acquisition, of the number of shares of Common Stock that the participant's accumulated payroll deductions as of the date of the Acquisition could purchase, at an Option Price determined with reference only to the first business day of the applicable Offering Period and subject to the maximum share limitation set forth in Article 5 hereof, Code Section 423(b)(8) and fractional-share limitations on the amount of stock a participant would be entitled to purchase, over (b) the result of multiplying such number of shares by such Option Price. 
 The Committee or Successor Board, as applicable, shall determine the adjustments to be made under this Article 12, and its determination shall be conclusive. 
 Article 13 No Transfer or Assignment of Employee's Rights. 
 An Option granted under the Plan may not be transferred or assigned, except by will or the laws of descent and distribution, and shall be exercised, during the participant's lifetime, only by the participant. 
 Article 14 Termination of Employee's Rights Transfer of Employment. 
 Whenever a participant ceases to be an eligible employee because of retirement, voluntary or involuntary termination, resignation, layoff, discharge, death or for any other reason, his or her rights under the Plan shall immediately terminate, and the Company shall promptly refund, without interest (except where otherwise required by applicable law), the entire balance of his or her payroll deduction account under the Plan. 
 A participant will be deemed to have terminated employment, for this purpose, if the corporation that employs him or her, having been a Participating Subsidiary, ceases to be a subsidiary or to be designated as a 
 
 7 

Participating Subsidiary, or if the employee is transferred to any corporation other than the Company or a Participating Subsidiary. A participant will not be deemed to have terminated employment for this purpose, if the participant is on an approved leave of absence for military service or sickness or for any other purpose approved by the Company for up to 90 days, or if the employee s right to reemployment is guaranteed either by a statute or by contract or under the policy pursuant to which the leave of absence was granted or if the Committee otherwise provides in writing, if longer than 90 days. 
 If a participant transfers employment from the Company or any Participating Subsidiary participating in the 423 Component to any Participating Subsidiary participating in the Non-423 Component, such transfer shall not be treated as a termination of employment, but the participant shall immediately cease to participate in the 423 Component however, any contributions made for the Offering Period in which such transfer occurs shall be transferred to the Non-423 Component, and such participant shall immediately join the then-current offering under the Non-423 Component upon the same terms and conditions in effect for the participant s participation in the 423 Component, except for such modifications otherwise applicable for participants in such offering. A participant who transfers employment from any Participating Subsidiary participating in the Non-423 Component to the Company or any Participating Subsidiary participating in the 423 Component shall not be treated as terminating the participant s employment and shall remain a participant in the Non-423 Component until the earlier of (i) the end of the current Offering Period under the Non-423 Component, or (ii) the Offering Date of the first Offering Period in which the participant is eligible to participate following such transfer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Committee may establish different rules to govern transfers of employment between companies participating in the 423 Component and the Non-423 Component, consistent with the applicable requirements of Section 423 of the Code. 
 Article 15 Termination and Amendments to Plan. 
 Unless terminated sooner as provided below, the Plan shall terminate on October 31, 2030. The Plan may be terminated at any time by the Company's Board of Directors but such termination shall not affect Options then outstanding under the Plan. It will terminate in any case when all or substantially all of the unissued shares of stock reserved for the purposes of the Plan have been purchased. If at any time shares of stock reserved for the purpose of the Plan remain available for purchase but not in sufficient number to satisfy all then unfilled purchase requirements, the available shares shall be apportioned among participants in proportion to the amount of payroll deductions accumulated on behalf of each participant that would otherwise be used to purchase stock, and the Plan shall terminate. Upon such termination or any other termination of the Plan, all payroll deductions not used to purchase stock will be refunded, without interest (unless otherwise required under applicable law). 
 The Committee or the Board of Directors may from time to time adopt amendments to the Plan, provided that, without the approval of the stockholders of the Company, no amendment may (i) increase the number of shares that may be issued under the Plan (ii) change the class of employees eligible to receive Options under the Plan, if such action would be treated as the adoption of a new plan for purposes of Section 423(b) of the Code or (iii) cause Rule 16b-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to become inapplicable to the Plan (iv) otherwise be made to the extent stockholder approval is required under applicable law. 
 Article 16 Limits on Sale of Stock Purchased under the Plan. 
 The Plan is intended to provide shares of Common Stock for investment and not for resale. The Company does not, however, intend to restrict or influence any employee in the conduct of his or her own affairs. An employee may, therefore, sell stock purchased under the Plan at any time the employee chooses, subject to compliance with any applicable federal or state securities laws or other applicable securities or other laws and subject to any restrictions imposed under Article 23 to ensure that tax withholding obligations are satisfied. THE EMPLOYEE ASSUMES THE RISK OF ANY MARKET FLUCTUATIONS IN THE PRICE OF THE STOCK . 
 
 8 

Article 17 Participating Subsidiaries. 
 The term Participating Subsidiary shall mean any present or future subsidiary of the Company, as that term is defined in Section 424(f) of the Code, that has been designated by the Committee from time to time, in its sole discretion, as eligible to participate in the Plan, such designation to specify whether such participation is in the 423 Component or Non-423 Component. A Participating Subsidiary may participate in either the 423 Component or Non-423 Component, but not both. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any subsidiary is disregarded for U.S. tax purposes in respect of the Company or any Participating Subsidiary participating in the 423 Component, then such disregarded subsidiary shall automatically be a Participating Subsidiary participating in the 423 Component. If any subsidiary is disregarded for U.S. tax purposes in respect of any Participating Subsidiary participating in the Non-423 Component, the Committee may exclude such subsidiary from participating in the Plan, notwithstanding that the Participating Subsidiary in respect of which such subsidiary is disregarded may participate in the Plan. The Committee may so designate any subsidiary, or revoke any such designation, at any time and from time to time, either before or after the Plan is approved by the stockholders. 
 Article 18 Optionees Not Stockholders. 
 Neither the granting of an Option to an employee nor the deductions from an employee's Compensation shall constitute such employee a stockholder of the shares covered by an Option until such shares have been actually purchased by the employee. 
 Article 19 Section 409A. 
 The 423 Component of the Plan and the Options granted pursuant to an Offering Period are intended to be exempt from the application of Section 409A of the Code. Neither the Non-423 Component nor any Option granted pursuant to an Offering Period thereunder is intended to constitute or provide for nonqualified deferred compensation within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code. Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, if the Committee determines that any Option granted under the Plan may be or become subject to Section 409A of the Code or that any provision of the Plan may cause an Option granted under the Plan to be or become subject to Section 409A of the Code, the Committee may adopt such amendments to the Plan and or adopt other policies and procedures (including amendments, policies and procedures with retroactive effect), or take any other actions as the Committee determines are necessary or appropriate to avoid the imposition of taxes under Section 409A of the Code, either through compliance with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code or with an available exemption therefrom. 
 Article 20 Application of Funds. 
 The proceeds received by the Company from the sale of Common Stock pursuant to Options granted under the Plan will be used for general corporate purposes. 
 Article 21 Notice to Company of Disposition. 
 By electing to participate in the Plan, each participant agrees to notify the Company in writing immediately after the participant transfers Common Stock acquired under the Plan. Each participant further agrees to provide any information about such a transfer as may be requested by the Company or any subsidiary corporation in order to assist it in complying with the tax laws. Without limitation to the foregoing, the Company reserves the right to require participants to hold any shares of Common Stock acquired under the Plan with a designated broker or other third party to facilitate compliance with the applicable reporting and other compliance requirements. 
 Article 22 Withholding of Additional Income Taxes. 
 By electing to participate in the Plan, each participant acknowledges that the Company and its Participating Subsidiaries are required to withhold any Tax-Related Items with respect to the amounts deducted from the participant's Compensation and accumulated for the benefit of the participant under the Plan, and each participant 
 
 9 

agrees that the Company and Participating Subsidiaries may deduct additional amounts from the participant's Compensation, when amounts are added to the participant's account, used to purchase shares of Common Stock or refunded, in order to satisfy such withholding obligations. 
 At the time a participant s Option is exercised, in whole or in part, or at the time a participant disposes of some or all of the shares of Common Stock acquired under the Plan (or any other time that a taxable event related to the Plan occurs), the participant will make adequate provision for the payment and or withholding of any Tax-Related Items. In their sole discretion, and except as otherwise determined by the Committee, the Company or a Participating Subsidiary that employs the participant may satisfy their obligations to withhold Tax-Related Items by (a) withholding from the participant s wages or other cash compensation, (b) withholding a number of shares of Common Stock otherwise issuable following the exercise of the Option, (c) withholding from proceeds from the sale of shares of Common Stock issued upon exercise, either through a voluntary sale or a mandatory sale arranged by the Company, or (d) withholding by any other means determined by the Committee, in its sole discretion, and in compliance with applicable law. 
 For purposes of this Article 23, Tax-Related Items means any U.S. and non-U.S. federal, provincial, state and or local taxes (including, without limitation, income tax, social insurance contributions, fringe benefit tax, employment tax, stamp tax and any employer tax liability which has been transferred to a participant) for which a participant is liable in connection with participation in the Plan. 
 Article 23 Governmental Regulations. 
 The Company's obligation to sell and deliver shares of Common Stock under the Plan is subject to the approval of any governmental authority required in connection with the authorization, issuance or sale of such shares. 
 Government regulations may impose reporting or other obligations on the Company with respect to the Plan. For example, the Company may be required to identify shares of Common Stock issued under the Plan on its stock ownership records and send tax information statements to employees and former employees who transfer title to such shares. 
 Article 24 Rules Particular to Specific Jurisdictions. 
 Without limitation to and notwithstanding any other provision in this Plan, the Committee may adopt such sub-plans or rules relating to the operation and administration of the Plan to accommodate local laws, customs and procedures for jurisdictions outside of the United States, the terms of which may take precedence over other provisions of this Plan, with the exception of Article 4 hereof, but unless otherwise superseded by the terms of such sub-plan or rules, the provisions of this Plan will govern the operation of such sub-plan or rules. To the extent inconsistent with the requirements of Section 423, any such sub-plan or rules will be considered part of a Non-423 Offering, and Options granted thereunder will not be required by the terms of the Plan to comply with Section 423 of the Code. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Committee is authorized to adopt sub-plans or rules for particular non-U.S. jurisdictions that modify the terms of the Plan to meet applicable local requirements, customs or procedures regarding, without limitation, (i) eligibility to participate, (ii) the definition of Compensation, (iii) the dates and duration of Offering Periods or other periods during which participants may contribute payroll deductions towards the purchase of shares of Common Stock, (iv) the method of determining the Option Price and the discount from fair market value at which shares may be purchased, (v) any minimum or maximum amount of payroll deductions a participant may contribute in an Offering Period or other specified period under the applicable sub-plan or rules, (vi) the treatment of Options upon an Acquisition or adjustment event described in Article 12, (vii) the handling of payroll deductions and the methods for contributing to the Plan by means other than payroll deductions, (viii) establishment of bank, building society or trust accounts to hold payroll deductions, (ix) payment of interest or waivers therefrom, (x) conversion of local currency, (xi) obligations to pay payroll tax, (xii) 
 
 10 

determination of beneficiary designation requirements, (xiii) withholding procedures, and (xiv) handling of share issuances. 
 Article 25 Governing Law. 
 The validity and construction of the Plan shall be governed by the laws of Delaware, without giving effect to the principles of conflict of laws thereof. 
 Article 26 Approval of Board of Directors and Stockholders of the Company and Subsequent Restatements.
