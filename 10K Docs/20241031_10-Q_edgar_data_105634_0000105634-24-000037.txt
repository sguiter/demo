 Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our allowance for credit losses was million and million, respectively. The increase in our allowance for credit losses was primarily due to a reserve taken in the first quarter of 2024 for a specific customer bankruptcy within the commercial site-based services division of our United States building services segment. Allowances for credit losses are based on the best facts available and are reassessed and adjusted on a regular basis as additional information is received. Should anticipated collections fail to materialize, or if future economic conditions compare unfavorably to our forecasts, we could experience an increase in our credit losses.

 Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities 
 The timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. Contract assets include unbilled amounts from our construction projects when revenues recognized under the cost-to-cost measure of progress exceed the amounts invoiced to our customers, as the amounts are not yet billable under the terms of our contracts. Such amounts are recoverable from our customers based upon various measures of performance, including achievement of certain milestones, completion of specified units, or completion of a contract. In addition, many of our time and materials arrangements, as well as our contracts to perform turnaround services within the United States industrial services segment, are billed in arrears pursuant to contract terms that are standard within the industry, resulting in contract assets and/or unbilled receivables being recorded as revenue is recognized in advance of billings. 
 Also included in contract assets are amounts we seek or will seek to collect from customers or others for errors or changes in contract specifications or design, contract change orders or modifications in dispute or unapproved as to scope and/or price, or other customer-related causes of unanticipated additional contract costs (claims and unapproved change orders). Our contract assets do not include capitalized costs to obtain and fulfill a contract. Contract assets are generally classified as current within the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 Contract liabilities from our construction contracts arise when amounts invoiced to our customers exceed revenues recognized under the cost-to-cost measure of progress. Contract liabilities additionally include advanced payments from our customers on certain contracts. Contract liabilities decrease as we recognize revenue from the satisfaction of the related performance obligation and are recorded as either current or long-term, depending upon when we expect to recognize such revenue. The long-term portion of contract liabilities is included in Other long-term obligations in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 Contract assets, non-current Contract liabilities, current ) ) Contract liabilities, non-current ) ) Net contract liabilities ) ) 
 Contract assets and contract liabilities increased by approximately million and million, respectively, as a result of acquisitions made by us in 2024. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, net contract liabilities increased by approximately million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to an increase in net contract liabilities on our uncompleted construction projects, partially as a result of the timing of invoicing to our customers as we continue to effectively manage our working capital. There was significant impairment of contract assets recognized during the periods presented.

 Our remaining performance obligations at September 30, 2024 were approximately billion. Remaining performance obligations increase with awards of new contracts and decrease as we perform work and recognize revenue on existing contracts. We include a project within our remaining performance obligations at such time the project is awarded and agreement on contract terms has been reached. Our remaining performance obligations include amounts related to contracts for which a fixed price contract value is not assigned when a reasonable estimate of the total transaction price can be made. 
 Remaining performance obligations include unrecognized revenues to be realized from uncompleted construction contracts. Although many of our construction contracts are subject to cancellation at the election of our customers, in accordance with industry practice, we do not limit the amount of unrecognized revenue included within remaining performance obligations for these contracts as the risk of cancellation is very low due to the inherent substantial economic penalty that our customers would incur upon cancellation or termination. We believe our reported remaining performance obligations for our construction contracts are firm and contract cancellations have not had a material adverse effect on us. 
 Remaining performance obligations also include unrecognized revenues expected to be realized over the remaining term of service contracts. However, to the extent a service contract includes a cancellation clause which allows for the termination of such contract by either party without a substantive penalty, the remaining contract term, and therefore, the amount of unrecognized revenues included within remaining performance obligations, is limited to the notice period required for the termination. 
 Our remaining performance obligations are comprised of: (a) original contract amounts, (b) change orders for which we have received written confirmations from our customers, (c) pending change orders for which we expect to receive confirmations in the ordinary course of business, (d) claim amounts that we have made against customers for which we have determined we have a legal basis under existing contractual arrangements and as to which the variable consideration constraint does not apply, and (e) other forms of variable consideration to the extent that such variable consideration has been included within the transaction price of our contracts. Such claim and other variable consideration amounts were immaterial for all periods presented.

 companies for upfront consideration of million, inclusive of customary working capital adjustments. These acquisitions are comprised of: (a) two companies that have been included within our United States mechanical construction and facilities services segment, including: (i) a leading plumbing services provider in the Southeast region of the United States and (ii) a full service provider of mechanical construction and maintenance services in Central Texas, (b) two companies that have been included in our United States building services segment, including: (i) a provider of building automation and controls solutions in the Northeast region of the United States and (ii) a mechanical services contractor in the Western region of the United States, and (c) an instrumentation and electrical contractor, that has been included in our United States industrial services segment, which provides electrical, automation, digital integration, and fabrication services to various energy sector and process equipment customers. In connection with these acquisitions, we acquired working capital of million and other net assets of million, and have preliminarily ascribed million to goodwill and million to identifiable intangible assets. We expect that all of the goodwill and identifiable intangible assets acquired in connection with these 2024 acquisitions will be deductible for tax purposes. 
 Subsequent to September 30, 2024, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire an electrical contractor in the Southeast region of the United States for upfront consideration of approximately million. This transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2024, subject to customary closing conditions. 
 During calendar year 2023, we acquired companies for total consideration of million. Such acquisitions include: (a) a national energy efficiency specialty services firm, the results of operations of which have been included in our United States building services segment, and (b) seven companies, the results of operations of which were de minimis, consisting of: (i) three companies that have been included within our United States mechanical construction and facilities services segment, one of which provides mechanical and pipe fabrication services in the Midwestern region of the United States, and two of which add capabilities to our national fire protection services, and (ii) four mechanical services companies in the Western and Midwestern regions of the United States that have been included within our United States building services segment and enhance our presence in geographies where we have existing operations. In connection with these acquisitions, we acquired working capital of million and other net liabilities of million, including certain deferred tax liabilities, and have ascribed million to goodwill and million to identifiable intangible assets. We expect that million of the goodwill and identifiable intangible assets acquired in connection with these 2023 acquisitions will be deductible for tax purposes. 
 The purchase price allocations for the businesses acquired in 2024 are preliminary and subject to change during their respective measurement periods. As we finalize such purchase price allocations, adjustments may be recorded relating to finalization of intangible asset valuations, tax matters, or other items. Although not expected to be significant, such adjustments may result in changes in the valuation of assets and liabilities acquired. The purchase price allocations for the businesses acquired in 2023 have been finalized during their respective measurement periods with an insignificant impact.

 We have a credit agreement dated (the 2023 Credit Agreement ), which provides for a billion revolving credit facility (the 2023 Revolving Credit Facility expiring . If additional lenders are identified and/or existing lenders are willing to increase their current commitments, we may increase the 2023 Revolving Credit Facility by an amount equal to the greater of: (a) million or (b) the Company s Adjusted EBITDA (as such term is defined in the 2023 Credit Agreement) for the twelve-month period ending immediately prior to the increase in commitment. We may allocate up to million of available capacity under the 2023 Revolving Credit Facility to letters of credit for our account or for the account of any of our subsidiaries. 
 There were direct borrowings outstanding under the 2023 Revolving Credit Facility as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. However, outstanding letters of credit reduce the available capacity under this facility, and as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had million and million of letters of credit outstanding, respectively. 
 At the Company s election, borrowings under the 2023 Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at either: (1) a base rate plus a margin of to , depending on the Company s Leverage Ratio (as such term is defined in the 2023 Credit Agreement), or (2) a rate equal to the secured overnight financing rate as administered by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for the applicable tenor plus Adjusted Term SOFR plus a margin of to , depending on the Company s Leverage Ratio. The base rate is determined by the greater of: (a) the prime commercial lending rate announced by Bank of Montreal from time to time, (b) the federal funds effective rate, plus of 1.00 , (c) Adjusted Term SOFR for a one-month tenor, plus , or (d) . 
 A commitment fee is payable on the average daily unused amount of the 2023 Revolving Credit Facility, which ranges from to , depending on the Company s Leverage Ratio. The fee was of the unused amount as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Fees for letters of credit issued under the 2023 Revolving Credit Facility range from to of the respective face amounts of outstanding letters of credit, depending on the nature of the letter of credit, and are computed depending on the Company s Leverage Ratio. 
 Obligations under the 2023 Credit Agreement are guaranteed by most of our direct and indirect subsidiaries and are secured by substantially all of our assets. The 2023 Credit Agreement contains customary covenants providing for, among other things, the maintenance of certain financial ratios and certain limitations on the payment of dividends, common stock repurchases, investments, acquisitions, indebtedness, and capital expenditures. We were in compliance with all such covenants as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

 Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements 
 We have recorded goodwill and identifiable intangible assets in connection with our business acquisitions. Such assets are measured at fair value at the time of acquisition based on valuation techniques that appropriately represent the methods which would be used by other market participants in determining fair value. In addition, goodwill, intangible assets, and certain other long-lived assets are tested for impairment using similar valuation methodologies to determine the fair value of such assets. Periodically, we engage an independent third-party valuation specialist to assist with the valuation process, including the selection of appropriate methodologies and the development of market-based assumptions. The inputs used for these nonrecurring fair value measurements represent Level 3 inputs. 
 Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
 We believe that the carrying values of our financial instruments, which include accounts receivable and other financing commitments, approximate their fair values due primarily to their short-term maturities and low risk of counterparty default. Although there were no outstanding borrowings under our 2023 Credit Agreement as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the carrying value of any debt associated with this agreement would approximate its fair value due to the variable rate on such debt.

 NOTE 9 - 
 Income tax rate 
 The difference between the U.S. statutory tax rate of and our effective income tax rate for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was primarily a result of state and local income taxes and other permanent book-to-tax differences. 
 The increase in our income tax provision for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, when compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, was predominantly due to greater income before income taxes. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had unrecognized income tax benefits. 
 We file a consolidated federal income tax return including all of our U.S. subsidiaries with the Internal Revenue Service. We additionally file income tax returns with various state, local, and foreign tax agencies. Our income tax returns are subject to audit by various taxing authorities and are currently under examination for the years 2021 and 2022.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we issued and shares of common stock, respectively. These shares were issued upon either the satisfaction of required conditions under our share-based compensation plans or the purchase of common stock pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan, prior to the discontinuation of such employee stock purchase plan at the end of 2023. 
 We have paid quarterly dividends since October 25, 2011. We currently pay a regular quarterly dividend of per share. 
 In September 2011, our Board of Directors (the Board authorized a share repurchase program allowing us to begin repurchasing shares of our outstanding common stock. Subsequently, the Board has from time to time increased the amount authorized for repurchases under such program. In June 2024, our Board increased such amount by million. Since the inception of the repurchase program, the Board has authorized us to repurchase up to billion of our outstanding common stock. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock for approximately million, inclusive of the applicable excise tax. Since the inception of the repurchase program through September 30, 2024, we have repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock for approximately billion. As of September 30, 2024, there remained authorization for us to repurchase approximately million of our shares. The repurchase program has no expiration date, does not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of common stock, and may be suspended, recommenced, or discontinued at any time or from time to time without prior notice. We may repurchase our shares from time to time to the extent permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements, including provisions in our 2023 Credit Agreement placing limitations on such repurchases.

 ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
 Business Description 
 We are one of the largest specialty contractors in the United States and a leading provider of electrical and mechanical construction and facilities services, building services, and industrial services. Our services are provided to a broad range of commercial, technology, manufacturing, industrial, healthcare, utility, and institutional customers through approximately 100 operating subsidiaries. Such operating subsidiaries are organized into the following reportable segments: 
 United States electrical construction and facilities services; 
 United States mechanical construction and facilities services; 
 United States building services; 
 United States industrial services; and 
 United Kingdom building services. 
 We refer to our United States electrical construction and facilities services segment and our United States mechanical construction and facilities services segment together as our United States construction segments. 
 For a more complete description of our operations, refer to Item 1. Business of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Overview 
 The following table presents selected financial data for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands, except percentages and per share data): 
 For the three months ended 
 September 30, 
 2024 2023 Revenues 3,696,924 3,207,598 Revenues increase from prior year 15.3 13.5 Gross profit 734,726 545,472 Gross profit as a percentage of revenues 19.9 17.0 Operating income 363,538 234,983 Operating income as a percentage of revenues 9.8 7.3 Net income attributable to EMCOR Group, Inc. 270,263 169,409 Diluted earnings per common share 5.80 3.57 
 Revenues of 3.70 billion for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 set a new quarterly record for the Company and represent an increase of 15.3 from revenues of 3.21 billion for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. Demand for our services continues to be strong across most of the market sectors we serve and, as described in further detail below, we experienced revenue growth within the majority of our reportable segments. Revenues for the third quarter of 2024 included incremental acquisition contribution of approximately 84.9 million. 
 Operating income for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was 363.5 million, or 9.8 of revenues, establishing new quarterly records for the Company with respect to both operating income and operating margin. This compares to operating income of 235.0 million, or 7.3 of revenues, for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. The 128.6 million increase in operating income, and corresponding 250 basis point expansion in operating margin, were predominantly a result of improved operating performance within our United States construction segments, as described in further detail below. Operating income for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 included incremental acquisition contribution of 5.5 million, net of amortization expense attributable to identifiable intangible assets of 4.6 million. 
 Net income of 270.3 million, or 5.80 per diluted share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 compares favorably to net income of 169.4 million, or 3.57 per diluted share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. While the majority of the increase in our diluted earnings per share was a result of the increased operating income referenced above, diluted earnings per share for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 additionally benefited from a reduced weighted average share count given the impact of common stock repurchases made by us throughout 2023 and the first nine months of 2024.

 Impact of Acquisitions 
 In order to provide a more meaningful period-over-period discussion of our operating results, we may discuss amounts generated or incurred (revenues, gross profit, selling, general and administrative expenses, and operating income) from companies acquired. The amounts discussed reflect the acquired companies operating results in the current reported period only for the time period these entities were not owned by EMCOR in the comparable prior reported period. For further discussion regarding our acquisitions, refer to Note 4 - Acquisitions of Businesses of the notes to consolidated financial statements. 
 We acquired five companies during the first nine months of 2024 for upfront consideration of 192.3 million, inclusive of customary working capital adjustments. These acquisitions are comprised of: (a) two companies that have been included within our United States mechanical construction and facilities services segment, including: (i) a leading plumbing services provider in the Southeast region of the United States and (ii) a full service provider of mechanical construction and maintenance services in Central Texas, (b) two companies that have been included in our United States building services segment, including: (i) a provider of building automation and controls solutions in the Northeast region of the United States and (ii) a mechanical services contractor in the Western region of the United States, and (c) an instrumentation and electrical contractor, that has been included in our United States industrial services segment, which provides electrical, automation, digital integration, and fabrication services to various energy sector and process equipment customers. 
 We acquired eight companies during calendar year 2023 for total consideration of 99.6 million. Such acquisitions include: (a) a national energy efficiency specialty services firm, the results of operations of which have been included in our United States building services segment, and (b) seven companies, the results of operations of which were de minimis, consisting of: (i) three companies that have been included within our United States mechanical construction and facilities services segment, one of which provides mechanical and pipe fabrication services in the Midwestern region of the United States, and two of which add capabilities to our national fire protection services, and (ii) four mechanical services companies in the Western and Midwestern regions of the United States that have been included within our United States building services segment and enhance our presence in geographies where we have existing operations.

 As described below in more detail, our consolidated revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased to 3.70 billion compared to 3.21 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2023, and our consolidated revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased to 10.80 billion compared to 9.14 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Revenues of our United States electrical construction and facilities services segment were 845.0 million and 2,409.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to revenues of 697.4 million and 2,020.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The increase in this segment s revenues for both 2024 periods was primarily a result of growth within the network and communications market sector, predominantly due to our data center projects. Increased demand for cloud computing and data storage, driven in part by the emergence of artificial intelligence, has resulted in a greater number of construction project opportunities for us in several of the geographies in which we operate. In addition, this segment benefited from revenue growth within a number of the other market sectors in which we operate, such as: (a) the high-tech manufacturing market sector, inclusive of construction projects for customers engaged in the design and manufacturing of semiconductors, (b) the institutional market sector, given increased project revenues from certain schools and universities, (c) the manufacturing and industrial market sector, driven by increased activity with various energy sector customers, and (d) the transportation market sector, due to certain infrastructure projects currently underway. These increases were partially offset by a reduction in revenues within the commercial market sector due in part to reduced demand across the commercial real estate industry. 
 Our United States mechanical construction and facilities services segment revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 1,662.2 million, a 332.6 million increase compared to revenues of 1,329.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Revenues of this segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 4,745.1 million, a 1,142.8 million increase compared to revenues of 3,602.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This segment s results included 59.9 million and 116.0 million of incremental acquisition revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, the increases in this segment s revenues were attributable to revenue growth within the majority of the market sectors in which we operate, as well as greater levels of service work. For both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, this segment experienced notable increases in revenues within: (a) the high-tech manufacturing market sector, as a result of stronger demand for our mechanical construction and/or fire protection services by certain customers: (i) engaged in either the design and manufacturing of semiconductors or the production and development of electric vehicles and/or lithium batteries and (ii) within the biotech, life-sciences, and pharmaceutical industries, (b) the network and communications market sector, due to increased data center project activity as this segment benefited from the same market demand described above within our United States electrical construction and facilities services segment, (c) the institutional market sector, given several public sector projects which were active during the first nine months of 2024, (d) the healthcare market sector, due to an increase in projects throughout several of the regions in which we operate, and (e) the water and wastewater market sector, driven by construction activity on several projects within the Southeast region of the United States. Revenues of this segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 additionally benefited from increased activity within the manufacturing and industrial market sector, as a result of the re-shoring of critical supply chain by certain of our customers as well as an increase in food processing construction projects. Partially offsetting these increases was a reduction in revenues within the commercial market sector, largely as a result of the completion of various warehouse and distribution projects, which were active in 2023. 
 Revenues of our United States building services segment for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 796.9 million compared to revenues of 817.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Excluding incremental revenues from acquired companies of 7.7 million, this segment s revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 28.5 million. Revenues of this segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 2,359.2 million compared to revenues of 2,318.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Excluding incremental revenues from acquired companies of 28.6 million, this segment s revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 12.5 million. Within both 2024 periods, this segment s mechanical services division experienced increased revenues from: (a) HVAC project and retrofit work, as a result of greater: (i) project execution stemming from the increased availability of materials and equipment when compared to the prior year period, which experienced greater supply chain disruptions and delays, and (ii) demand for system upgrades and replacements, partially as our customers continue to seek ways to improve the energy efficiency or indoor air quality of their facilities, (b) service repair and maintenance volumes, given growth in our service contract base, and (c) building automation and controls projects, as we continue to expand our service offerings in this area. Offsetting this revenue growth in both 2024 periods were declines in revenues within this segment s commercial site-based services and government site-based services divisions due to the loss of certain facilities maintenance contracts not renewed pursuant to rebid.

 Revenues of our United States industrial services segment for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 286.4 million, compared to revenues of 252.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Revenues of this segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 964.5 million, compared to revenues of 875.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This segment s results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 included 17.4 million and 29.1 million, respectively, of incremental revenues from an acquired company. Excluding such acquisition contribution, the increase in this segment s revenues for both 2024 periods resulted from its field services division due to greater demand, including turnarounds of a larger size and scope growth on certain projects. 
 Our United Kingdom building services segment revenues were 106.4 million and 317.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to revenues of 110.7 million and 327.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The decrease in this segment s revenues for both 2024 periods was primarily a result of the loss of certain facilities maintenance contracts not renewed pursuant to rebid. Revenues of this segment for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were positively impacted by 2.8 million and 8.0 million, respectively, as a result of favorable exchange rate movements for the British pound versus the United States dollar. 
 Cost of sales and gross profit

 Our gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 734.7 million, or 19.9 of revenues, compared to gross profit of 545.5 million, or 17.0 of revenues, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Gross profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 2,008.0 million, or 18.6 of revenues, compared to gross profit of 1,471.6 million, or 16.1 of revenues, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in gross profit and the expansion in gross profit margin for both 2024 periods were driven by each of our domestic reportable segments due to an improved revenue mix, excellent project execution, and/or favorable pricing. Our gross profit for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 included incremental acquisition contribution of 15.6 million and 32.2 million, respectively, net of amortization expense attributable to identifiable intangible assets of 2.9 million and 5.9 million, respectively. 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses

 Our selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 371.2 million, or 10.0 of revenues, compared to selling, general and administrative expenses of 308.1 million, or 9.6 of revenues, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 1,051.7 million, or 9.7 of revenues, compared to selling, general and administrative expenses of 882.7 million, or 9.7 of revenues, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 included 10.2 million and 23.3 million, respectively, of incremental expenses directly related to companies acquired in 2024 and 2023, including amortization expense attributable to identifiable intangible assets of 1.7 million and 4.8 million, respectively. 
 Excluding incremental expenses from businesses acquired, the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses for both 2024 periods was predominantly attributable to greater: (a) salaries and related employment expenses, largely as a result of additional headcount to support our organic revenue growth as well as annual cost of living adjustments, and (b) incentive compensation expense across our reportable segments, due to higher projected annual operating results.

 While our SG A margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was consistent with that for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, our SG A margin for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 40 basis points when compared to that for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This increase in quarterly SG A margin was primarily a result of the true-up of our operating company incentive compensation accruals given the strong performance during the quarter, as evidenced in part by the increase in gross profit margin referenced above.

 Operating income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 363.5 million, an increase of 128.6 million compared to operating income of 235.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Operating margin for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 9.8 compared to an operating margin of 7.3 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, operating income was 956.3 million, an increase of 369.7 million compared to operating income of 586.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Operating margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 8.9 compared to an operating margin of 6.4 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 As described in more detail below, these increases in profitability were predominantly a result of improved operating performance within our United States construction segments, due to a more favorable mix of work and better project execution, including enhanced productivity, due in part to investments in virtual design and construction, prefabrication, and automation. Operating income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 included incremental acquisition contribution of 5.5 million and 8.9 million, respectively, net of amortization expense attributable to identifiable intangible assets of 4.6 million and 10.7 million, respectively. 
 Operating income of our United States electrical construction and facilities services segment was 119.1 million, or 14.1 of revenues, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 63.1 million, or 9.1 of revenues, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Operating income of this segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 299.3 million, or 12.4 of revenues, compared to 154.4 million, or 7.6 of revenues, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increases in operating income and operating margin of this segment for both 2024 periods were a result of greater gross profit and gross profit margin from projects within the majority of the market sectors in which we operate, due to both an increase in revenues as well as a more favorable mix of work. While the most significant increase in gross profit was experienced within the network and communications market sector, this segment additionally benefited from greater gross profit recognized on projects within the institutional, manufacturing and industrial, and high-tech manufacturing market sectors. 
 Our United States mechanical construction and facilities services segment s operating income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 214.8 million, or 12.9 of revenues, compared to operating income of 138.5 million, or 10.4 of revenues, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Operating income of this segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 579.0 million, or 12.2 of revenues, compared to 344.6 million, or 9.6 of revenues, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This segment s operating income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 included incremental acquisition contribution of 4.9 million and 9.6 million, respectively, net of amortization expense attributable to identifiable intangible assets of 3.4 million and 6.9 million, respectively. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, the increases in operating income and operating margin of this segment for both 2024 periods were primarily a result of contribution from projects within: (a) the high-tech manufacturing market sector, including certain mechanical construction or fire protection projects for customers engaged in either the design or manufacturing of semiconductors or the production and development of electric vehicles and/or lithium batteries, and (b) the network and communications market sector. While the most significant increases in gross profit were seen within the above referenced market sectors, this segment also experienced increases in gross profit within the majority of the other market sectors in which we operate, including commercial, institutional, manufacturing and industrial, and healthcare. 
 Operating income of our United States building services segment was 55.6 million, or 7.0 of revenues, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 57.2 million, or 7.0 of revenues, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Operating income of this segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 135.9 million, or 5.8 of revenues, compared to 140.9 million, or 6.1 of revenues, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. For both 2024 periods, increased gross profit from this segment s mechanical services division, due primarily to greater profitability across its portfolio of HVAC and building automation and controls projects and retrofits, was partially offset by reductions in gross profit from its commercial site-based services and government site-based services divisions, given the loss of certain facilities maintenance contracts not renewed pursuant to rebid. Operating income and operating margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were negatively impacted by an 11.0 million reserve recorded during the first quarter of 2024 for a specific customer bankruptcy within this segment s commercial site-based services division. Such reserve negatively impacted the operating margin of this segment for the first nine months of 2024 by approximately 40 basis points. 
 Our United States industrial services segment reported operating income of 3.3 million, or 1.1 of revenues, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to an operating loss of 0.2 million, or (0.1) of revenues, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, this segment reported operating income of 34.0 million, or 3.5 of revenues, compared to operating income of 22.7 million, or 2.6 of revenues, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Operating income and operating margin of this segment for both 2024 periods benefited from an improvement in gross profit margin within each of its field services and shop services divisions, largely due to favorable pricing and greater indirect cost absorption. 
 Operating income of our United Kingdom building services segment was 5.5 million, or 5.2 of revenues, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 8.9 million, or 8.0 of revenues, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Operating income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 16.7 million, or 5.2 of revenues, compared to 20.2 million, or 6.2 of revenues, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in operating income and operating margin for both 2024 periods was due to a decline in gross profit and gross profit margin. In addition to the impact of lower revenues, gross profit and gross profit margin were negatively affected by a less favorable mix of work when compared to the prior year periods, which included a greater number of higher margin projects.

 Our corporate administration expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 34.8 million, compared to 30.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our corporate administration expenses were 108.5 million, compared to 93.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in corporate expenses for both 2024 periods was primarily due to greater: (a) employment compensation costs, including salaries, incentive compensation, and share-based compensation, and (b) computer hardware and software costs, due to various information technology and cybersecurity initiatives currently in process. Partially contributing to the increase in corporate expenses for the first nine months of 2024 were certain severance expenses which were recorded during the first quarter of the year. 
 Other items 
 As a result of an increase in our average daily invested cash balance, coupled with the repayment, in December of 2023, of all previously outstanding borrowings under our credit facility, we generated net interest income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 8.3 million and 22.0 million, respectively, compared to net interest expense of 0.1 million and 4.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, our income tax provision was 101.8 million and 263.9 million, respectively, compared to an income tax provision of 64.9 million and 159.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Our effective income tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 27.4 and 27.0 , respectively, compared to an effective income tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 of 27.7 and 27.4 , respectively. Refer to Note 9 - Income Taxes of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding our income tax provision and effective income tax rate. 
 Remaining Unsatisfied Performance Obligations 
 The following table presents the transaction price allocated to remaining unsatisfied performance obligations remaining performance obligations for each of our reportable segments and their respective percentage of total remaining performance obligations (in thousands, except for percentages): 
 September 30, 2024 of Total December 31, 2023 of Total September 30, 2023 of Total Remaining performance obligations: United States electrical construction and facilities services 2,767,672 28 2,387,844 27 2,158,104 25 United States mechanical construction and facilities services 5,362,689 55 4,940,519 56 4,875,551 56 United States building services 1,334,163 14 1,264,818 14 1,313,779 15 United States industrial services 110,583 1 113,291 1 133,894 2 Total United States operations 9,575,107 98 8,706,472 98 8,481,328 98 United Kingdom building services 214,345 2 140,949 2 154,115 2 Total operations 9,789,452 100 8,847,421 100 8,635,443 100 
 Our remaining performance obligations at September 30, 2024 were approximately 9.79 billion compared to approximately 8.85 billion at December 31, 2023 and approximately 8.64 billion at September 30, 2023. When compared to December 31, 2023, remaining performance obligations at September 30, 2024 increased within all of our reportable segments, with the exception of our United States industrial services segment, which experienced a modest decline. Specifically, we saw increases within: (a) our United States electrical construction and facilities services segment, largely as a result of the award of several construction contracts within the network and communications, institutional, and healthcare market sectors, (b) our United States mechanical construction and facilities services segment, which experienced increases in remaining performance obligations across the majority of the market sectors in which we operate, with the most notable project awards in the network and communications, healthcare, hospitality and entertainment, water and wastewater, and manufacturing and industrial market sectors, (c) our United States building services segment, primarily due to increased project opportunities across its mechanical services division, and (d) our United Kingdom building services segment, given new facilities maintenance contracts and an increase in project awards. Remaining performance obligations at September 30, 2024 increased by 222.4 million as a result of acquisitions made by us during 2024. Partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in remaining performance obligations within the high-tech manufacturing market sector as a result of progress made on certain projects within our United States mechanical construction and facilities services segment. 
 See Note 3 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further disclosure regarding our remaining performance obligations.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 The following section discusses our principal liquidity and capital resources, as well as our primary liquidity requirements and sources and uses of cash. 
 We are focused on the efficient conversion of operating income into cash to provide for the Company s material cash requirements, including working capital needs, investment in our growth strategies through business acquisitions and capital expenditures, satisfaction of contractual commitments, including principal and interest payments on any outstanding indebtedness, and shareholder return through dividend payments and share repurchases. We strive to maintain a balanced approach to capital allocation in order to achieve growth, deliver value, and minimize risk. 
 Management monitors financial markets and overall economic conditions for factors that may affect our liquidity and capital resources and adjusts our capital allocation strategy as necessary. Negative macroeconomic trends could have an adverse effect on future liquidity if we experience delays in the payment of outstanding receivables beyond normal payment terms, an increase in credit losses, or significant increases in the price of commodities or the materials and equipment utilized for our project and service work, beyond those experienced to date. In addition, during economic downturns, there have typically been fewer small discretionary projects from the private sector and our competitors have aggressively bid larger long-term infrastructure and public sector contracts. Our liquidity is also impacted by: (a) the type and length of construction contracts in place, as performance of long duration contracts typically requires greater amounts of working capital, (b) the level of turnaround activities within our United States industrial services segment, as such projects are billed in arrears pursuant to contractual terms that are standard within the industry, and (c) the billing terms of our maintenance contracts, including those within our United States and United Kingdom building services segments. While we strive to negotiate favorable billing terms, which allow us to invoice in advance of costs incurred on certain of our contracts, there can be no assurance that such terms will be agreed to by our customers. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents, excluding restricted cash, of 1,035.5 million, which are maintained in depository accounts and highly liquid investments with original maturity dates of three months or less. Both our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements are expected to be met through our cash and cash equivalent balances, cash generated from our operations, and, as necessary, the borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility. Our credit agreement provides for a 1.30 billion revolving credit facility, for which there was 1.23 billion of available capacity as of September 30, 2024. 
 Refer to Note 7 - Debt of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our credit agreement. Based upon our current credit rating and financial position, we can also reasonably expect to be able to secure long-term debt financing if required to achieve our strategic objectives; however, no assurances can be made that such debt financing will be available on favorable terms. We believe that we have sufficient financial resources available to meet our short-term and foreseeable long-term liquidity requirements. 
 Cash Flows 
 The following table presents a summary of our operating, investing, and financing cash flows (in thousands): 
 For the nine months ended 
 September 30, 
 2024 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 938,402 475,897 Net cash used in investing activities (243,687) (134,032) Net cash used in financing activities (455,032) (276,157) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash 7,377 856 Increase in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash 247,060 66,564 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our cash balance, including cash equivalents and restricted cash, increased by approximately 247.1 million from 789.8 million at December 31, 2023 to 1,036.8 million at September 30, 2024. Changes in our cash position from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024 are described in further detail below. 
 Operating Activities Operating cash flows generally represent our net income as adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities. Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 938.4 million compared to approximately 475.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The favorable operating cash flow performance period-over-period was primarily a result of: (a) our improved operating performance and the corresponding increase in our net income and (b) the timing of cash receipts from our customers.

Table of Contents 

 Investing Activities Investing cash flows consist primarily of payments for acquisition of businesses, capital expenditures, and proceeds from the sale or disposal of property, plant, and equipment. Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by approximately 109.7 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to an increase in payments for acquisitions. 
 Financing Activities Financing cash flows consist primarily of the issuance and repayment of short-term and long-term debt, repurchases of common stock, payments of dividends to stockholders, and the issuance of common stock through certain equity plans. Net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 455.0 million compared to net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 of 276.2 million. The 178.9 million variance was primarily due to an increase in common stock repurchases made by us during the first nine months of 2024, partially offset by the impact of repayments on our outstanding debt in the prior year period. The timing of common stock repurchases is at management s discretion subject to securities laws and other legal requirements and depends upon several factors, including market and business conditions, current and anticipated future liquidity, share price, and share availability, among others. For additional detail regarding our share repurchase program, refer to Note 10 - Common Stock of the notes to consolidated financial statements. 
 We currently pay a regular quarterly dividend of 0.25 per share. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, cash payments related to dividends were 31.9 million and 24.2 million, respectively. Our credit agreement places limitations on the payment of dividends on our common stock. However, we do not believe that the terms of such agreement currently materially limit our ability to pay such quarterly dividends for the foreseeable future. 
 Effect of Exchange Rate Changes on Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, almost entirely with respect to the British pound. Therefore, the 6.5 million variance between the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was a direct result of exchange rate movements for the British pound versus the United States dollar. 
 Material Cash Requirements from Contractual and Other Obligations 
 As of September 30, 2024, our short-term and long-term material cash requirements for known contractual and other obligations were as follows: 
 Outstanding Debt and Interest Payments As of September 30, 2024, there were no direct borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility. Interest payments on any future borrowings will be determined based on prevailing interest rates at that time. Refer to Note 7 - Debt of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further detail of our debt obligations, including our revolving credit facility. 
 Operating and Finance Leases In the normal course of business, we lease real estate, vehicles, and equipment under various arrangements which are classified as either operating or finance leases. Future payments for such leases, excluding leases with initial terms of one year or less, were 398.0 million at September 30, 2024, with 95.7 million payable within the next 12 months. 
 Open Purchase Obligations As of September 30, 2024, we had 2.33 billion of open purchase obligations, of which payments totaling approximately 1.92 billion are expected to become due within the next 12 months. These obligations represent open purchase orders to suppliers and subcontractors related to our construction and services contracts. These purchase orders are not reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are not expected to impact future liquidity as amounts should be recovered through customer billings. 
 Insurance Obligations As described in further detail in Note 12 - Commitments and Contingencies of the notes to consolidated financial statements, we have loss payment deductibles and/or self-insured retentions for certain insurance matters. As of September 30, 2024, our insurance liabilities, net of estimated recoveries, were 231.7 million. Of this net amount, approximately 41.3 million is estimated to be payable within the next 12 months. Due to many uncertainties inherent in resolving these matters, it is not practical to estimate these payments beyond such period. To the extent that the amount required to settle claims covered by insurance continues to increase, the cost of our insurance coverage, including premiums and deductibles, is likely to increase. 
 Contingent Consideration Liabilities We have incurred liabilities related to contingent consideration arrangements associated with certain acquisitions, payable in the event discrete performance objectives are achieved by the acquired businesses during designated post-acquisition periods. The aggregate amount of these liabilities can change due to additional business acquisitions, settlement of outstanding liabilities, changes in the fair value of amounts owed based on performance during such post-acquisition periods, and accretion in present value. As of September 30, 2024, the present value of expected future payments relating to these contingent consideration arrangements was 26.3 million. Of this amount, 18.3 million is estimated as being payable within the next 12 months, with the remainder due pursuant to the terms of our contractual agreements, some of which extend into 2027. 
 35 

Table of Contents 

 In addition, material cash requirements for other potential obligations, for which we cannot reasonably estimate future payments, include the following: 
 Legal Proceedings We are involved in several legal proceedings in which damages and claims have been asserted against us. While litigation is subject to many uncertainties and the outcome of litigation is not predictable with assurance, we do not believe that any such matters will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity. Refer to Note 12 - Commitments and Contingencies of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information regarding legal proceedings. 
 Multiemployer Benefit Plans In addition to our Company sponsored benefit plans, we participate in certain multiemployer pension and other post-retirement plans. The cost of these plans is equal to the annual required contributions determined in accordance with the provisions of negotiated collective bargaining agreements. Our future contributions to the multiemployer plans are dependent upon a number of factors. Amounts of future contributions that we would be contractually obligated to make pursuant to these plans cannot be reasonably estimated. Refer to Note 14 - Retirement Plans of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 for more information regarding multiemployer benefit plans. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Other Commercial Commitments 
 The terms of our construction contracts frequently require that we obtain from surety companies, and provide to our customers, surety bonds as a condition to the award of such contracts. These surety bonds are issued in return for premiums, which vary depending on the size and type of the bond, and secure our payment and performance obligations under such contracts. We have agreed to indemnify the surety companies for amounts, if any, paid by them in respect of surety bonds issued on our behalf. As of September 30, 2024, based on the percentage-of-completion of our projects covered by surety bonds, our aggregate estimated exposure, assuming defaults on all our then existing contractual obligations, was approximately 2.4 billion, which represents approximately 25 of our total remaining performance obligations. 
 Surety bonds expire at various times ranging from final completion of a project to a period extending beyond contract completion in certain circumstances. Such amounts can also fluctuate from period to period based upon the mix and level of our bonded operating activity. For example, public sector contracts require surety bonds more frequently than private sector contracts and, accordingly, our bonding requirements typically increase as the amount of our public sector work increases. Our estimated maximum exposure as it relates to the value of the surety bonds outstanding is lowered on each bonded project as the cost to complete is reduced, and each commitment under a surety bond generally extinguishes concurrently with the expiration of its related contractual obligation. 
 Surety bonds are sometimes provided to secure obligations for wages and benefits payable to or for certain of our employees, at the request of labor unions representing such employees. In addition, surety bonds or letters of credit may be issued as collateral for certain insurance obligations. As of September 30, 2024, we satisfied approximately 48.1 million and 71.1 million of the collateral requirements of our insurance programs by utilizing surety bonds and letters of credit, respectively. All such letters of credit were issued under our revolving credit facility, therefore reducing the available capacity of such facility. 
 We are not aware of any losses in connection with surety bonds that have been posted on our behalf, and we do not expect to incur significant losses in the foreseeable future. 
 From time to time, we discuss with our current and other surety bond providers the amounts of surety bonds that may be available to us based on our financial strength and the absence of any default by us on any surety bond issued on our behalf and believe those amounts are currently adequate for our needs. However, if we experience changes in our bonding relationships or if there are adverse changes in the surety industry, we may: (a) seek to satisfy certain customer requests for surety bonds by posting other forms of collateral in lieu of surety bonds, such as letters of credit, parent company guarantees, or cash, in order to convince customers to forego the requirement for surety bonds, (b) increase our activities in our businesses that rarely require surety bonds, and/or (c) refrain from bidding for certain projects that require surety bonds. 
 There can be no assurance that we would be able to effectuate alternatives to providing surety bonds to our customers or to obtain, on favorable terms, sufficient additional work that does not require surety bonds. Accordingly, a reduction in the availability of surety bonds could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and/or cash flows. 
 In the ordinary course of business, we, at times, guarantee obligations of our subsidiaries under certain contracts. Generally, we are liable under such an arrangement only if our subsidiary fails to perform its obligations under the contract. Historically, we have not incurred any substantial liabilities as a consequence of these guarantees. 
 We do not have any other material financial guarantees or off-balance sheet arrangements other than those disclosed herein.

 New Accounting Pronouncements 
 We review new accounting standards to determine the expected impact, if any, that the adoption of such standards will have on our financial position and/or results of operations. See Note 2 - New Accounting Pronouncements of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding new accounting standards, including the anticipated dates of adoption and the effects on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or liquidity. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 The preparation of our consolidated financial statements is based on the application of significant accounting policies, which require management to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described further in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. We base our estimates on historical experience, known or expected trends, third-party valuations, and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from these estimates. There have been no significant changes to our critical accounting policies or methods during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 
 We have not used any derivative financial instruments during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, including trading or speculating on changes in interest rates or commodity prices of materials used in our business. 
 We are exposed to market risk for changes in interest rates for any borrowings under our revolving credit facility, which bear interest at variable rates. For further information regarding our credit facility and associated borrowing rates, refer to Note 7 - Debt of the notes to consolidated financial statements. 
 We are exposed to construction market risk and its potential related impact on accounts receivable or contract assets on uncompleted contracts. The amounts recorded may be at risk if our customers ability to pay these obligations is negatively impacted by economic conditions. We continually monitor the creditworthiness of our customers and maintain on-going discussions with customers regarding contract status with respect to change orders and billing terms. Therefore, we believe we take appropriate action to manage market and other risks, but there is no assurance that we will be able to reasonably identify all risks with respect to the collectability of these assets. 
 Amounts invested in our foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the end of the period. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded as accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income, a component of equity, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We believe our exposure to the effects that fluctuating foreign currencies may have on our consolidated results of operations is limited because our foreign operations primarily invoice customers and collect obligations in their respective local currencies. Additionally, expenses associated with these transactions are generally contracted and paid for in their same local currencies. 
 In addition, we are exposed to market risk of fluctuations in certain commodity prices of materials, such as copper and steel, which are used as components of supplies or materials utilized in our construction, building services, and industrial services operations. We are also exposed to increases in energy prices, particularly as they relate to gasoline prices for our fleet of approximately 13,800 vehicles. While we believe we can increase our contract prices to adjust for some price increases in commodities, there can be no assurance that such price increases, if they were to occur, would be recoverable. Additionally, our fixed price contracts generally do not allow us to adjust our prices and, as a result, increases in material costs could reduce our profitability with respect to projects in progress.

 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 
 Based on an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as required by Rule 13a-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934), our Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer, Anthony J. Guzzi, and our Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer, Jason R. Nalbandian, have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) are effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. 
 There have not been any changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

 (1) In September 2011, our Board of Directors (the Board authorized a share repurchase program allowing us to begin repurchasing shares of our outstanding common stock. Subsequently, the Board has from time to time increased the amount authorized for repurchases under such program. In June 2024, our Board increased such amount by 500 million. Since the inception of the repurchase program, the Board has authorized us to repurchase up to 2.65 billion of our outstanding common stock. As of September 30, 2024, there remained authorization for us to repurchase approximately 351.8 million of our shares. No shares have been repurchased by us since the program was announced other than pursuant to such program. The repurchase program has no expiration date, does not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of common stock, and may be suspended, recommenced, or discontinued at any time or from time to time without prior notice. Refer to Note 10 - Common Stock of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our share repurchase program. 
 (2) Excludes 886 shares surrendered to the Company by participants in our share-based compensation plans to satisfy minimum tax withholdings for common stock issued under such plans. 
 (3) Price paid per share excludes any applicable broker commission or excise tax due. However, as such amounts are considered direct costs associated with the repurchase of our common stock, they have been reflected as a reduction in the remaining authorization under our share repurchase program. 
 
 ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES. 
 Information concerning mine safety violations or other regulatory matters required by Section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and Item 104 of Regulation S-K (17 CFR 229.104) is included in Exhibit 95.1 to this quarterly report.
