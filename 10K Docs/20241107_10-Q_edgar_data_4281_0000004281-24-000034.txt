 A. 
 of its revenue from products sold to the commercial aerospace market which is less than the pre-pandemic 2019 annual rate of approximately . Aircraft production in the commercial aerospace industry continues to recover based on increases in demand for narrow body and wide body aircraft. We expect our commercial aerospace wide body and narrow body demand, including engine spares, also to continue to grow. Quality control issues at The Boeing Company Boeing are expected to negatively impact narrow body and wide body production rates in the near term. For instance, the Federal Aviation Administration stated that it will not approve production rate increases or additional production lines for the Boeing 737 MAX until it is satisfied that Boeing is in full compliance with required quality control procedures. In addition, a labor union work stoppage at Boeing has negatively impacted results. Boeing production levels have a material impact on the financial performance of Howmet. The timing and level of future aircraft builds by original equipment manufacturers are subject to changes and uncertainties, which may cause our future results to differ from prior periods due to changes in product mix in certain segments. 
 The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company in conformity with GAAP requires management to make certain judgments, estimates, and assumptions. These estimates are based on historical experience and, in some cases, assumptions based on current and future market expectations, including considerations relating to changes in the aerospace industry. The impact of these changes, including the macroeconomic considerations, remains highly uncertain. Management has made its best estimates using all relevant information available at the time, but it is possible that our estimates will differ from our actual results and affect the Consolidated Financial Statements in future periods and potentially require adverse adjustments to the recoverability of goodwill, intangible and long-lived assets, the realizability of deferred tax assets and other judgments and estimations and assumptions.

The 2024 rate was lower than the 2023 rate and the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21 primarily due to a net benefit related to U.S. federal and state research and development R D credits, a U.S. deduction on Foreign Derived Intangible Income FDII ), and a U.S. tax benefit recognized for foreign tax credits, partially offset by additional U.S. tax on Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income GILTI ), incremental state tax, nondeductible expenses, and foreign earnings subject to tax in jurisdictions with tax rates higher than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21 .

In 2016, the Company appealed to the Committee of the Abuse of Tax Law, where it received a favorable nonbinding decision. The FTA disagreed with the Committee of the Abuse of Tax Law s opinion, and the Company appealed to the Montreuil Administrative Court, where in 2020 the Company prevailed on the merits. The FTA appealed this decision to the Paris Administrative Court of Appeal in 2021. On March 31, 2023, the Company received an adverse decision from the Paris Administrative Court of Appeal. The Company appealed this decision to the French Administrative Supreme Court. The assessment amount was million), including million) of tax and interest up through 2017 and million) of penalties. The Company estimates additional interest to be million). On July 23, 2024, the Company received the French Administrative Supreme Court s decision.

 Lockheed Martin Corp v. Howmet Aerospace Inc. On November 30, 2023, Lockheed Martin Corporation Lockheed Martin filed a complaint in federal district court in the Northern District of Texas against the Company and its subsidiary RTI Advanced Forming, Inc. RTI as defendants. The complaint alleged that the Company and RTI breached a Master Purchase Order between Lockheed Martin and RTI related to the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter production program between Lockheed Martin and the United States government (the F-35 Program by seeking a fair market price adjustment for the provision of titanium mill products under RTI s separate agreements with Lockheed Martin s subcontractors for the F-35 Program. Following various claims and counterclaims and court-ordered mediation, the parties reached a confidential settlement agreement on April 2, 2024, to supply until December 31, 2026 subject to revised terms mutually agreed to by the parties. The settlement had no material impact on the results of operations in the current year. The parties stipulated to the dismissal of all claims and counterclaims with prejudice on April 2, 2024. 
 Other. In addition to the matters discussed above, various other lawsuits, claims, and proceedings have been or may be instituted or asserted against the Company, including those pertaining to environmental, product liability, safety and health, employment, tax and antitrust matters. While the amounts claimed in these other matters may be substantial, the ultimate liability cannot currently be determined because of the considerable uncertainties that exist. Therefore, it is possible that the Company s liquidity or results of operations in a period could be materially affected by one or more of these other matters. However, based on facts currently available, management believes that the disposition of these other matters that are pending or asserted will not have a material adverse effect, individually or in the aggregate, on the results of operations, financial position or cash flows of the Company.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 (U.S. dollars in millions, except per share amounts) 
 The following Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations MD A is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition. The MD A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Part I, Item 1 (Financial Statements and Supplementary Data) of this Form 10-Q. 
 Overview 
 Howmet is a global leader in lightweight metals engineering and manufacturing. Howmet s innovative, multi-material products, which include nickel, titanium, aluminum, and cobalt, are used worldwide in the aerospace (commercial and defense), commercial transportation, and industrial and other markets. 
 In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company derived approximately 52 of its revenue from products sold to the commercial aerospace market which is less than the pre-pandemic 2019 annual rate of approximately 60 . Aircraft production in the commercial aerospace industry continues to recover based on increases in demand for narrow body and wide body aircraft. We expect our commercial aerospace wide body and narrow body demand, including engine spares, also to continue to grow. Quality control issues at The Boeing Company Boeing are expected to negatively impact narrow body and wide body production rates in the near term. For instance, the Federal Aviation Administration stated that it will not approve production rate increases or additional production lines for the Boeing 737 MAX until it is satisfied that Boeing is in full compliance with required quality control procedures. In addition, a labor union work stoppage at Boeing has negatively impacted results. Boeing production levels have a material impact on the financial performance of Howmet. The timing and level of future aircraft builds by original equipment manufacturers OEM are subject to changes and uncertainties, which may cause our future results to differ from prior periods due to changes in product mix in certain segments. 
 For additional information regarding the ongoing risks related to our business, see section Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

The increase of 177, or 11 , in the third quarter of 2024 and the increase of 630, or 13 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to higher volumes in the commercial aerospace, defense aerospace, and industrial and other markets, and favorable product pricing, partially offset by lower volumes in the commercial transportation market. 
 Cost of goods sold COGS ). COGS as a percentage of Sales was 68.3 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 71.4 in the third quarter of 2023 and 69.1 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 72.2 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to higher volumes and favorable product pricing, partially offset by increased net headcount, primarily in the Engine Products segment, in support of expected revenue increases. There were no COGS net reimbursements in the third quarter and 6 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to the final settlement of the insurance claim related to a prior year mechanical failure resulting in substantial heat and fire-related damage to equipment at the Forged Wheels cast house in Barberton, Ohio (the Barberton Cast House Incident in the second quarter of 2024, compared to total COGS net charges of 1 in both the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2023, related to the fire that occurred at a Fastening Systems plant in France in 2019 (the France Plant Fire and Barberton Cast House Incident.

The decrease of 2, or 2 , in the third quarter of 2024 was primarily due to lower costs associated with closures, supply chain disruptions, and other items. The increase of 20, or 8 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to higher employment costs. 
 Restructuring and other (credits) charges . Restructuring and other (credits) charges were (1) in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 4 in the third quarter of 2023 or a decrease of 5. Restructuring and other (credits) charges were 21 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 8 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 or an increase of 13. Restructuring and other (credits) charges for the third quarter of 2024 were primarily due to a 1 gain related to the resolution of post-closing adjustments from the May 2024 sale of a small U.K. manufacturing facility in Engineered Structures. Restructuring and other (credits) charges for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were primarily due to a net loss on the sale of a small U.K. manufacturing facility in Engineered Structures of 13 and layoff costs of 8. Restructuring and other

The decrease of 10, or 19 , in the third quarter of 2024 and 24, or 14 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to the early redemptions of the 6.875 Notes due May 2025 (the 2025 Notes during various periods in 2024, the early redemptions of the 5.125 Notes due October 2024 (the 2024 Notes during various periods during 2023 and 2024, partially offset by the August 2024 issuance of 500 aggregate principal amount of 4.850 Notes due October 2031 (the 2031 Notes ), net of the cross-currency swap that synthetically converted the 2031 Notes into a lower fixed-interest-rate Euro liability.

Loss on debt redemption was 6 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to less than 1 in the third quarter of 2023 and 6 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 1 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in both the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to the debt premiums paid on the early redemption of the 2025 Notes in the third quarter of 2024. 
 See Note N to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item I of this Form 10-Q for additional detail related to the Company s debt.

The increase in expense of 6 in the third quarter of 2024 was primarily due to an increase in deferred compensation of 7. The increase in expense of 44 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to the reversal in the second quarter ended June 30, 2023 of 25, net of legal fees of 1, of the 65 pre-tax charge taken in the third quarter of 2022 related to the Lehman Brothers International (Europe) legal proceeding as a result of the final settlement of such proceeding in June 2023 (See Note Q to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item I of this Form 10-Q for reference), an increase in deferred compensation of 9, and increases in foreign currency losses, net, of 6. Non-service related net periodic benefit costs related to defined benefit plans and other postretirement benefit plans is expected to be relatively flat for the full year 2024 versus 2023. 
 See Note F to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item I of this Form 10-Q for additional detail. 
 Provision for income taxes. The estimated annual effective tax rate, before discrete items, applied to ordinary income was 20.9 in both the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 23.0 in both the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The tax rate including discrete items was 6.2 in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 22.3 in the third quarter of 2023. A discrete net tax benefit of 46 primarily attributable to additional U.S. federal and state R D credits claimed for prior years upon completion of the Company s R D study was recorded in the third quarter of 2024 compared to a discrete net tax benefit of 1 in the third quarter of 2023. The tax rate including discrete items was 15.1 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 25.0 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. A discrete net tax benefit of 58 primarily attributable to additional U.S. federal and state R D credits claimed for prior years upon completion of the Company s R D study and approved under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service was recorded in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a discrete net tax charge of 13, which included the income tax reserve recorded as a result of the French tax litigation (See Note Q to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item I of this Form 10-Q for reference), recorded in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The 2024 estimated annual effective tax rate is lower than the 2023 rate primarily due to a net benefit related to U.S. federal and state R D credits, a higher U.S. deduction on Foreign Derived Intangible Income FDII ), and a U.S. tax benefit recognized for foreign tax credits.

Net income. Net income was 332, or 0.81 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 188, or 0.45 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2023 and 841, or 2.04 per diluted share, in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 529, or 1.27 per diluted share, in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of 144 in the third quarter of 2024 and 312 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to higher volumes in the commercial aerospace, defense aerospace, and industrial and other markets, including engines spares, favorable product pricing, and a reduction in interest expense due to lower long-term debt levels, partially offset by lower volumes in the commercial transportation market. 
 Segment Information 
 The Company s operations consist of four worldwide reportable segments: Engine Products, Fastening Systems, Engineered Structures, and Forged Wheels. Segment performance under Howmet s management reporting system is evaluated based on a number of factors; however, the primary measure of performance is Segment Adjusted EBITDA. Howmet s definition of Segment Adjusted EBITDA (Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) is net margin plus an add-back for depreciation and amortization. Net margin is equivalent to Sales minus the following items: Cost of goods sold; Selling, general administrative, and other expenses; Research and development expenses; and Provision for depreciation and amortization. Special items, including Restructuring and other (credits) charges, are excluded from Net margin and Segment Adjusted EBITDA. Segment Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Differences between the total segment and consolidated totals are in Corporate (See Note C to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for a description of each segment). 
 The Company has aligned its operations consistent with how the Chief Executive Officer assesses operating performance and allocates capital. 
 On March 3, 2024, Howmet and the United Autoworkers at our Cleveland, Ohio location approved a new five-year collective bargaining agreement, covering approximately 750 employees within our Engineered Structures and Forged Wheels segments. The agreement positions our Cleveland location to continue to offer market competitive wages and benefits. The new agreement expires on February 28, 2029. The Company s next significant plant collective bargaining agreement in the U.S. expires in 2027.

 Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes that this measure is meaningful to investors because it provides additional information with respect to the Company s operating performance and the Company s ability to meet its financial obligations. Differences between the total segment and consolidated totals are in Corporate. 
 See Restructuring and other (credits) charges, Interest expense, net, Loss on debt redemption, and Other expense, net discussions above, under Results of Operations for reference. 
 Corporate expense increased 1, or 4 , in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to higher employment costs in 2024, partially offset by lower costs associated with closures, supply chain disruptions, and other items of 2, lower costs related to the collective bargaining agreement negotiations of 1, and higher net reimbursements related to the France Plant Fire and the Barberton Cast House Incident of 1. 
 Corporate expense decreased 15, or 17 , in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to lower costs associated with closures, supply chain disruptions, and other items of 12, lower costs related to the collective bargaining agreement negotiations of 8, and higher net reimbursements related to the France Plant Fire and the Barberton Cast House Incident of 7, partially offset by higher employment and legal costs in 2024.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Operating Activities 
 Cash provided from operations was 818 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 443 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of 375 was primarily due to higher operating results of 298 and lower working capital of 88, partially offset by higher pension contributions of 14. The components of the change in working capital primarily included favorable changes in receivables of 114, prepaid expenses and other current assets of 21, inventories of 9, partially offset by compensation related payments and other accrued expenses of 24, taxes, including income taxes of 22, and accounts payable of 10. 
 Management expects Howmet s estimated pension contributions and other postretirement benefit payments in 2024 to be approximately 65. 
 Financing Activities 
 Cash used for financing activities was 742 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 646 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of 96, or 15 , was primarily due to long-term debt payments made in 2024 of 433 (See Note N to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for reference), an increase in common stock repurchases of 160, increased dividends paid to common stock shareholders of 24 due to a 0.04 increase in dividends per common share, from 0.04 to 0.08 per share from the third quarter of 2023 to the third quarter of 2024, respectively, and 5 related to debt issuance costs for the 2031 Notes, partially offset by proceeds from the 2031 Notes debt issuance of 500 and 
 31 

a decrease in taxes paid for the net share settlement of equity awards of 29. On an annual basis, the current year debt actions are expected to reduce Interest expense, net by approximately 33. 
 On July 30, 2024, the Board of Directors of Howmet Aerospace approved the establishment of a 2025 dividend policy to pay cash dividends on the Company s common stock in 2025 at a rate of 15 plus or minus 5 of net income excluding special items. The declaration of future common stock dividends is subject to the discretion and approval of the Board of Directors of Howmet after the Board s consideration of all factors it deems relevant and subject to applicable law. The Company may modify, suspend, or cancel the dividend policy in any manner and at any time that it may deem necessary or appropriate. 
 The Company maintains a credit facility (the Credit Facility) pursuant to its Five-Year Revolving Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement with a syndicate of lenders and issuers named therein (See Note N to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for reference). There were no amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023, and no amounts were borrowed during 2024 or 2023 under the Credit Agreement. 
 On April 4, 2024, the Company established a commercial paper program under which the Company may issue unsecured commercial paper from time to time up to a maximum aggregate face amount of 1,000 . The Company s commercial paper will be sold on customary terms in the U.S. commercial paper market on a private placement basis. The proceeds of the commercial paper will be used for general corporate purposes. In conjunction with the commercial paper program, the Company was assigned short-term credit ratings by Moody s Investors Service, Inc., S P Global Ratings, and Fitch Ratings, Inc. 
 The Company has an effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3, filed with the SEC, which allows for offerings of debt securities from time to time. The Company may opportunistically issue new debt securities in accordance with securities laws or utilize commercial paper in order to, but not limited to, refinance existing indebtedness. 
 In the future, the Company may, from time to time, redeem portions of its debt securities or repurchase portions of its debt or equity securities, in either the open market or through privately negotiated transactions, in accordance with applicable SEC and other legal requirements. The timing, prices, and sizes of purchases depend upon prevailing trading prices, general economic and market conditions, and other factors, including applicable securities laws. Such purchases may be completed by means of trading plans established from time to time in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, block trades, private transactions, open market repurchases, tender offers, and/or accelerated share repurchase agreements or other derivative transactions. 
 The Company s costs of borrowing and ability to access the capital markets are affected not only by market conditions but also by the short-term and long-term debt ratings assigned to the Company by the major credit rating agencies. The Company believes that its cash on hand, cash provided from operations and availability of its Credit Facility, its commercial paper program, and its accounts receivables securitization program will continue to be sufficient to fund our operating and capital allocation activities. 
 The three major credit rating agencies have rated Howmet s debt with investment grade ratings. The Company s most recent short-term and long-term credit ratings from the three major credit rating agencies are as follows: Short-Term Long-Term Outlook Moody s Investors Service, Inc. Moody s P-2 Baa1 Stable S P Global Ratings S P A-3 BBB- Stable Fitch Ratings, Inc. Fitch F2 BBB Positive 
 On August 6, 2024, Moody s upgraded Howmet s short-term debt rating from P-3 to P-2, further upgraded Howmet s long-term debt rating two notches from Baa3 to Baa1, which was previously upgraded to Baa3 from Ba1 on February 29, 2024 citing demand in the markets served by Howmet along with the Company s improved financial leverage and updated the current outlook from positive to stable. 
 On August 6, 2024, Fitch affirmed Howmet s short-term debt rating at F2 and long-term debt rating at BBB and updated the current outlook from stable to positive. 
 On December 15, 2023, S P upgraded Howmet s long-term debt rating to BBB- and updated the current outlook from positive to stable, citing strong demand in the commercial aerospace market and the Company s improved financial leverage. 
 Investing Activities 
 Cash used for investing activities was 209 in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 163 in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of 46, or 28 , was primarily due to an increase in capital expenditures of 55 primarily related to capacity expansion projects in Engine Products and Forged Wheels and various automation projects, partially offset by proceeds primarily from the sale of assets at a small U.K. manufacturing facility in Engine Products of 8.

Document 

Exhibit 10.1 
 HOWMET AEROSPACE INC. 
 NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTOR COMPENSATION POLICY 
 Effective as of January 1, 2025 
 
 1. General. This Non-Employee Director Compensation Policy (the Policy ), sets forth the cash and equity-based compensation that has been approved by the Board of Directors (the Board of Howmet Aerospace Inc., a Delaware corporation, (the Company as payable to eligible non-employee members of the Board Non-Employee Directors ), effective as of January 1, 2025. The cash and equity-based compensation described in this Policy shall be paid or be made, as applicable, automatically and without further action of the Board, to each Non-Employee Director who may be eligible to receive such compensation. This Policy shall remain in effect until it is revised or rescinded by further action of the Board. The terms and conditions of this Policy shall supersede any prior cash or equity compensation arrangements between the Company and its Non-Employee Directors. 
 2. Cash Compensation. 
 (a) Annual Retainers . Each Non-Employee Director shall be eligible to receive an annual cash retainer of 120,000 for service on the Board. In addition, subject to paragraph 2(b) below, a Non-Employee Director shall receive the following additional annual retainers, as applicable 
 Non-Employee Director Position Additional Annual Cash Retainer Fee 
 Lead Director 45,000 Audit Committee Chair Fee 25,000 Compensation and Benefits Committee Chair Fee 20,000 Governance and Nominating Committee Chair Fee 20,000 Other Committee Chair Fee 15,000 
 (b) Payment of Chair Fees . At any one time, each non-Employee Director may receive only one additional annual retainer fee in connection with service as the Chair of a committee (whether in the position of Lead Director, Audit Committee Chair, Compensation and Benefits Committee Chair, Governance and Nominating Committee Chair or Other Committee Chair), regardless of how many committee Chair positions held by such director. For the avoidance of doubt, a non-Employee Director may simultaneously serve as the Chair of more than one committee, but will receive for such service only one additional annual retainer fee, equal to the highest of the additional annual retainer fees associated with his or her Chair positions. 
 1 

(c) Payment of Retainers. The annual retainers described in Section 2(a) shall be earned on a quarterly basis based on a calendar quarter and shall be paid by the Company in arrears not later than the third business day following the end of each calendar quarter (if not deferred by the Non-Employee Director in accordance with subsection (e) hereof). In the event a Non-Employee Director does not serve as a Non-Employee Director, or in the applicable positions described in Section 2(a), for an entire calendar quarter, the retainer paid to such Non-Employee Director shall be prorated for the portion of such calendar quarter actually served as a Non-Employee Director, or in such positions, as applicable. 
 (d) Exceptional Meeting Fees. A fee of 1,200 shall be paid to a Non-Employee Director for each Board or committee meeting attended by such Non-Employee Director in excess of five (5) special Board or committee meetings during the applicable calendar year and applies only to any non-regularly scheduled meeting in excess of a two-hour duration. Such exceptional meeting fees shall be paid by the Company in arrears not later than the third business day following the end of the calendar quarter in which any such exceptional meeting occurs (if not deferred by the Non-Employee Director in accordance with subsection (e) hereof). 
 (e) Deferral of Retainers. Non-Employee Directors may elect to defer payment of all or a portion of the annual retainers described in Section 2(a) and the exceptional meeting fees described in Section 2(d) into specified investment funds and or into vested restricted share units for shares of the Company's common stock, which deferral will be made pursuant to the terms of the Company's Amended and Restated Deferred Fee Plan for Directors or its successor plan (the Deferred Fee Plan ). Unless otherwise determined by the Board, any restricted share units will be granted under the Howmet Aerospace Stock Incentive Plan, as Amended and Restated, or its successor plan (the Equity Plan ), on the date on which such retainer(s) would otherwise have been paid in cash. The extent to which a Non-Employee Director may defer annual retainer payments into vested restricted share units will therefore be subject to any limit on awards granted to a Non-Employee Director set forth in the Equity Plan. 
 3. Equity Compensation. Non-Employee Directors shall be granted the equity awards described below. The awards described below in Sections 3(a) and 3(b) shall be granted under and shall be subject to the terms and provisions of the Equity Plan and shall be granted subject to an award agreement in substantially the same form approved by the Board prior to or as of the grant date, setting forth the terms of the award (the Award Terms ), consistent with the Equity Plan. For purposes of this Section 3, the number of shares subject to any restricted share unit award will be determined by dividing the grant date dollar value specified under subsection (a) or (b) hereof by the Fair Market Value (as defined in the Equity Plan) of a share of the Company's common stock on the date of grant. 
 2 

(a) Annual Equity Award. A person who is a Non-Employee Director immediately following each annual meeting of the Company's stockholders and who will continue to serve as a Non-Employee Director following such annual meeting shall be automatically granted on the second market trading day following the date of each such annual meeting a restricted share unit award with a grant date value equal to 175,000 (the Annual Equity Award ). The Annual Equity Award shall vest on the earlier of the first anniversary date of the grant date or the date of the Company's next subsequent annual meeting of stockholders following the grant date. 
 (b) Pro-Rated Annual Equity Award . On the fifth market trading day following a person's initial appointment as a Non-Employee Director, and provided such person has not otherwise received an Annual Equity Award for the relevant year under Section 3(a), the Non-Employee Director shall be automatically granted a restricted share unit award with a grant date value equal to 175,000, in each case multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is 365 less the number of days that have elapsed since the date of the Company's last annual meeting of stockholders and the Non-Employee Director's date of initial appointment, and the denominator of which is 365 (the Pro-Rated Award ). The Pro-Rated Award shall vest on the date of the Company's next subsequent annual meeting of stockholders following the date of the Non-Employee Director's appointment to the Board. 
 (c) Special Vesting of Equity Awards. Notwithstanding Sections 3(a) or (b) above and as shall be further set forth in the Award Terms (i) unvested equity awards shall vest in full upon the death of a Non-Employee Director or upon a Change in Control where a Replacement Award is not provided or the Non-Employee Director s service is terminated (where Change in Control and Replacement Award are as defined in the Equity Plan) and (ii) unvested equity awards shall vest on a pro-rata basis in the event of a Non-Employee Director's termination of service for any other reason. 
 (d) Deferral of Equity Award. Payment of the Annual Equity Award or any Pro-Rated Award will be deferred until the Non-Employee Director's separation from service, in accordance with the terms of the Deferred Fee Plan, unless otherwise required by applicable laws. 
 4. Stock Ownership Guideline. Within a period of six years from the date of a person's initial appointment as a Non- Employee Director, each Non-Employee Director is required to attain ownership of at least 750,000 in the Company's common stock and must maintain such ownership until retirement from the Board. 
 5. Director Compensation Limit. As further set forth in the Equity Plan, the sum of the grant date value of all equity awards granted and all cash compensation paid by the Company to a Non-Employee Director as compensation for services as a Non-Employee Director shall not exceed 750,000 during any calendar year. For avoidance of doubt, compensation shall count towards this limit for the calendar year in which it is granted or earned, and not later when distributed, in the event it is deferred.

6. Policy Subject to Amendment, Modification and Termination. This Policy may be amended, modified or terminated by the Board in the future at its sole discretion, provided that no such action that would materially and adversely impact the rights with respect to annual retainers payable in the calendar quarter during which a Non-Employee Director is then performing services shall be effective without the consent of the affected Non-Employee Director.
