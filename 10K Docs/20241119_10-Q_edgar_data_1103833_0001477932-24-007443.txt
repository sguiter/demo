In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as "may," "will," "could," "should," "expect," "plan," "project," "intend," "anticipate," "believe," "seek," "estimate," "predict," "potential," "pursue," "target," "continue," the negative of such terms or other comparable terminology. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause the Company's actual future outcomes to differ materially from those set forth in such statements. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: the possibility that certain tax benefits of our net operating losses may be restricted or reduced in a change in ownership or a further change in the federal tax rate; the inability to carry out plans and strategies as expected limitations on the availability of sufficient credit or cash flow to fund our working capital needs and capital expenditures and debt service; difficulty in fulfilling the terms of our convertible note payables, which could result in a default and acceleration of our indebtedness under our convertible note payables; the possibility that we issue additional shares of common stock or convertible securities that will dilute the percentage ownership interest of existing stockholders and may dilute the book value per share of our common stock; the relatively low trading volume of our common stock, which could depress our stock price; competition in the industries in which we operate, both from third parties and former employees, which could result in the loss of one or more customers or lead to lower margins on new projects; a general reduction in the demand for our services; our ability to enter into, and the terms of, future contracts; uncertainties inherent in estimating future operating results, including revenues, operating income or cash flow; complications associated with the incorporation of new accounting, control and operating procedures; the recognition of tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions; You should understand that the foregoing, as well as other risk factors discussed in this document and in Part I, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, could cause future outcomes to differ materially from those experienced previously or those expressed in such forward-looking statements.

OVERVIEW Crown Equity Holdings Inc. Crown Equity was incorporated in August 1995 in Nevada. The Company is offering its services to companies seeking to become public entities in the United States. It has launched a website, www.crownequityholdings.com, which offers its services in a wide range of fields. The Company provides various consulting services to companies and individuals dealing with corporate structure and operations globally. The Company also provides public relations and news dissemination for publicly and privately held companies. In December 2010, the Company formed two wholly owned subsidiaries Crown Tele Services, Inc. and CRWE Direct, Inc. Crown Tele Services, Inc. was formed to provide voice over internet VoIP services to clients at a competitive price and Crown Direct, Inc. was formed to provide direct sales to customers. Both entities had minimum sales during the quarter. In March, 2011, the Company formed a wholly owned subsidiary CRWE Real Estate, Inc. as a subsidiary to engage in potential real estate holdings. The entity had minimal activity during the quarter. The Company has focused its primary vision to using its network of websites to provide advertising and marketing services, as a worldwide online media advertising publisher, dedicated to the distribution of quality branding information. The Company offers Internet media-driven advertising services, which cover and connect a wide range of marketing specialties, as well as search engine optimization for clients interested in online media awareness. As part of its operations, the Company has utilized the services of software and hardware technicians in developing its websites and adding additional websites. This allows the Company to disseminate news and press releases for its customers as well as general news and financial information on a much bigger scale than it did previously. The Company markets its services to companies seeking market awareness of them and the services or goods that they offer. The Company then publishes information concerning these companies on its many websites. Crown Equity s office is located at 11226 Pentland Downs Street, Las Vegas, NV 89141. During the period ending September 30, 2024, the Company utilized the services of independent contractors and its following officers, Mike Zaman, Kenneth Bosket, and Montse Zaman, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 Compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, revenues were 369, and 0 for the same period ended in 2023. Revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 831 and 0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Revenues were higher in both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 due to earned revenues through click-based, and impression ads, and the publishing and disseminating of a press release. Operating expenses were 509,086 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 26,438 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, 497,785 of the 509,686 was amortization of the warrant discount. Operating expenses were 1,309,734 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 62,744 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, 1,244,500 of the 1,309,734 was amortization of the warrant discount. The increase in operating expenses was the increase in depreciation and amortization. Other expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were negative (4,289) and negative (3,507) for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Other expenses were negative (2,391,465) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and negative (4,979) for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was mainly due to the loss on debt conversion of related party payables and accounts payable to common stock in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Interest expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were (11,103) and (4,979), respectively. 20 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES As of September 30, 2024, Crown Equity had current assets of 3,544 and current liabilities of 308,645 resulting in a working capital deficit of 305,101. Net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 47,666 compared to net cash used in operating activities of 62,182 for the same period in 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we borrowed 40,366 from related parties. Our existing capital may not be sufficient to meet Crown Equity s cash needs, including the costs of compliance with the continuing reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. This condition raises substantial doubt as to Crown Equity s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if Crown Equity is unable to continue as a going concern. ITEM 3: QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As a smaller reporting company as defined by Item 12b-2 of the securities exchange act of 1934 (the exchange act and are not required to provide information required under this Item. ITEM 4: CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Based on their evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures(as defined in Rule 13a-15e under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 the Exchange Act ), our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q such disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms because of the identification of material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting which we view as an integral part of our disclosure controls and procedures. The material weaknesses relate to the lack of segregation of duties in financial reporting, as our financial reporting and all accounting functions are performed by an external consultant with no oversight by a professional with accounting expertise. Our CEO and CFO also do not possess accounting expertise and our company does not have an audit committee. These material weaknesses are due to the company s lack of working capital to hire additional staff. To remedy this material weakness, we intend to engage another accountant to assist with financial reporting as soon as our finances will allow. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 that occurred during our first quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 21 Table of Contents PART II OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1: LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.
