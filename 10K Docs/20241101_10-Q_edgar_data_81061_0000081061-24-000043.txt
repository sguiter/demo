The impact of the hurricane is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition or results of operations.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The objective of this section is to provide a summary of material information relevant to enhancing the stockholders understanding of the financial condition and results of operations of the Company. Following is an analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of the Company for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024 as compared with the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. This information should be read in conjunction with the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and the Annual Report. 
 Overview 
 The Company is engaged in the retail food industry and as of September 28, 2024 operated 1,379 supermarkets in Florida, Georgia, Alabama, South Carolina, Tennessee, North Carolina, Virginia and Kentucky. The Company has no other significant lines of business or industry segments. For the nine months ended September 28, 2024, 28 supermarkets were opened (including five replacement supermarkets) and 91 supermarkets were remodeled. Nine supermarkets were closed during the period. The replacement supermarkets that opened during the nine months ended September 28, 2024 replaced two supermarkets closed in the same period and three supermarkets closed in a previous period. Seven supermarkets closed in 2024 will be replaced on site in a subsequent period. In the normal course of operations, the Company replaces supermarkets and closes supermarkets that are not meeting performance expectations. The impact of future supermarket closings is not expected to be material. 
 Results of Operations 
 Sales 
 Sales for the three months ended September 28, 2024 were 14.6 billion as compared with 14.0 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 678 million or 4.9 . The increase in sales for the three months ended September 28, 2024 as compared with the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to new supermarket sales and a 3.4 increase in comparable store sales (supermarkets open for the same weeks in both periods, including replacement supermarkets). The Company estimates that its sales for the three months ended September 28, 2024 increased 80 million or 0.6 due to the impact of Hurricane Helene. Comparable store sales for the three months ended September 28, 2024 increased primarily due to the impact of inflation on product costs and Hurricane Helene. Sales for supermarkets that are replaced on site are classified as new supermarket sales since the replacement period for the supermarket is generally 12 to 15 months. 
 Sales for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 were 44.2 billion as compared with 42.4 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 1.8 billion or 4.3 . The increase in sales for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 as compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to new supermarket sales and a 2.5 increase in comparable store sales. Comparable store sales for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 increased primarily due to the impact of inflation on product costs. 
 Gross profit 
 Gross profit (sales less cost of merchandise sold) as a percentage of sales was 25.4 and 26.3 for the three months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 25.6 and 26.4 for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of sales for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024 as compared with the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to a Medicare reimbursement process change related to pharmacy fees effective January 1, 2024. The Medicare reimbursement process change reduces both gross profit and operating and administrative expenses. 
 Operating and administrative expenses 
 Operating and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were 19.1 and 19.5 for the three months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. Operating and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were 19.0 and 19.3 for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The decrease in operating and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024 as compared with the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to a Medicare reimbursement process change related to pharmacy fees effective January 1, 2024, partially offset by the increase in payroll costs as a percentage of sales. The Medicare reimbursement process change reduces both gross profit and operating and administrative expenses. 
 
 13 

Operating profit 
 Operating profit as a percentage of sales was 7.0 and 7.6 for the three months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. Operating profit as a percentage of sales was 7.4 and 7.9 for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The decrease in operating profit as a percentage of sales for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024 as compared with the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to the increase in payroll costs as a percentage of sales. 
 Investment income (loss) 
 Investment income for the three months ended September 28, 2024 was 332 million as compared with an investment loss for the three months ended September 30, 2023 of 43 million. Excluding the impact of net unrealized gains on equity securities in 2024 and net unrealized losses on equity securities in 2023, investment income would have been 108 million and 101 million for the three months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. Excluding the impact of net unrealized gains on equity securities in 2024 and net unrealized losses on equity securities in 2023, investment income for the three months ended September 28, 2024 as compared with the three months ended September 30, 2023 remained relatively unchanged. 
 Investment income for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 was 978 million and 584 million, respectively. Excluding the impact of net unrealized gains on equity securities in 2024 and 2023, investment income would have been 324 million and 407 million for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. Excluding the impact of net unrealized gains on equity securities in 2024 and 2023, the decrease in investment income for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 as compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was due to the decrease in net realized gains on investments, partially offset by the increase in interest and dividend income. 
 Income tax expense 
 The effective income tax rate was 20.2 and 19.7 for the three months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The increase in the effective income tax rate for the three months ended September 28, 2024 as compared with the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to the decreased impact of permanent deductions and credits relative to earnings before income tax expense. The effective income tax rate was 20.6 and 20.9 for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The decrease in the effective income tax rate for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 as compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to the increased impact of permanent deductions and credits relative to earnings before income tax expense. 
 Net earnings 
 Net earnings were 1.1 billion or 0.33 per share and 833 million or 0.25 per share for the three months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. Net earnings as a percentage of sales were 7.5 and 6.0 for the three months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. Excluding the impact of net unrealized gains on equity securities in 2024 and net unrealized losses on equity securities in 2023, net earnings would have been 930 million or 0.28 per share and 6.4 as a percentage of sales for the three months ended September 28, 2024 and 940 million or 0.28 per share and 6.7 as a percentage of sales for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Excluding the impact of net unrealized gains on equity securities in 2024 and net unrealized losses on equity securities in 2023, the decrease in net earnings as a percentage of sales for the three months ended September 28, 2024 as compared with the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to the decrease in operating profit as a percentage of sales. 
 Net earnings were 3.4 billion or 1.04 per share and 3.2 billion or 0.95 per share for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. Net earnings as a percentage of sales were 7.8 and 7.5 for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. Excluding the impact of net unrealized gains on equity securities in 2024 and 2023, net earnings would have been 2.9 billion or 0.90 per share and 6.7 as a percentage of sales for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 and 3.0 billion or 0.91 per share and 7.2 as a percentage of sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Excluding the impact of net unrealized gains on equity securities in 2024 and 2023, the decrease in net earnings as a percentage of sales for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 as compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to the decrease in operating profit as a percentage of sales and the decrease in net realized gains on investments, partially offset by the increase in interest and dividend income.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 In addition to reporting financial results for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 in accordance with GAAP, the Company presents net earnings and earnings per share excluding the impact of equity securities being measured at fair value with net unrealized gains and losses from changes in the fair value recognized in earnings (fair value adjustment). These measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, GAAP. The Company excludes the impact of the fair value adjustment since it is primarily due to temporary equity market fluctuations that do not reflect the Company s operations. The Company believes this information is useful in providing period-to-period comparisons of the results of operations. 
 Following is a reconciliation of net earnings to net earnings excluding the impact of the fair value adjustment for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023: 
 Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 (Amounts are in millions, except per share amounts) Net earnings 1,097 833 3,435 3,171 Fair value adjustment, due to net unrealized (gain) loss, on equity securities held at end of period (224) 144 (654) (225) Net gain on sale of equity securities previously recognized through fair value adjustment 48 Income tax expense (benefit) (1)

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and long-term investments totaled 15.8 billion as of September 28, 2024, as compared with 14.6 billion as of December 30, 2023 and 14.3 billion as of September 30, 2023. The increase from the third quarter of 2023 to the third quarter of 2024 was primarily due to the increase in the fair value of investments. 
 Net cash provided by operating activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 4.3 billion for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023. Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 as compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2023 remained relatively unchanged primarily due to the payment in 2023 of payroll taxes that were deferred under a coronavirus tax relief provision in 2020 and the timing of purchases of inventories, offset by the increase in income taxes paid. Income taxes paid in 2024 includes payments for 2023 that were deferred due to Hurricane Idalia. Income taxes paid in 2023 includes payments for 2022 that were deferred due to Hurricane Ian. 
 Net cash used in investing activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 2.3 billion and 2.8 billion for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The primary use of net cash in investing activities for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 was funding capital expenditures and net increases in investments. Capital expenditures for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 totaled 2.0 billion. These expenditures were incurred in connection with the opening of 28 supermarkets (including five replacement supermarkets) and the remodeling of 91 supermarkets. Expenditures were also incurred for new supermarkets and remodels in progress, construction or expansion of warehouses, new or enhanced information technology hardware and software and the acquisition or development of shopping centers in which the Company operates. For the nine months ended September 28, 2024, the payment for investments, net of the proceeds from the sale and maturity of investments, was 285 million. 
 Net cash used in financing activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 2.0 billion and 1.7 billion for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The primary use of net cash in financing activities was funding net common stock repurchases and dividend payments. Net common stock repurchases totaled 891 million and 683 million for the nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The Company currently repurchases common stock at the stockholders request in accordance with the terms of the Company s Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP), Non-Employee Directors Stock Purchase Plan (Directors Plan), 401(k) Plan and ESOP. The amount of common stock offered to the Company for repurchase is not within the control of the Company, but is at the discretion of the stockholders. The Company expects to continue to repurchase its common stock, as offered by its stockholders from time to time, at its then current value. However, with the exception of certain shares distributed from the ESOP, such purchases are not required and the Company retains the right to discontinue them at any time. 
 Dividends 
 The Company paid quarterly dividends on its common stock totaling 1.0 billion or 0.315 per share and 965 million or 0.29 per share during the nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 Capital expenditures projection 
 Capital expenditures for the remainder of 2024 are expected to be approximately 700 million, primarily related to new supermarkets, remodeling existing supermarkets, construction or expansion of warehouses, new or enhanced information technology hardware and software and the acquisition or development of shopping centers in which the Company operates. The shopping center acquisitions are financed with internally generated funds and assumed debt, if prepayment penalties for the debt are determined to be significant. This capital program is subject to continuing change and review. 
 Cash requirements 
 In 2024, cash requirements for operations, capital expenditures, common stock repurchases and dividend payments are expected to be financed by internally generated funds or liquid assets. Based on the Company s financial position, it is expected that short-term and long-term borrowings would be available to support the Company s liquidity requirements, if needed.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 The Company does not utilize financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes, nor does it utilize leveraged financial instruments. There have been no material changes in the market risk factors from those disclosed in the Annual Report. 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15. Based upon this evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer each concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information has been accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, in a manner that allows timely decisions regarding required disclosure. There have been no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation that occurred during the quarter ended September 28, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the internal control over financial reporting.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 As reported in the Annual Report, the Company is subject from time to time to various lawsuits, claims and charges arising in the normal course of business. The Company believes its recorded reserves are adequate in light of the probable and estimable liabilities. The estimated amount of reasonably possible losses for lawsuits, claims and charges, individually and in the aggregate, is considered to be immaterial. In the opinion of management, the ultimate resolution of these legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

 (1) Common stock is made available for sale by the Company only to its current employees and members of its Board of Directors through the ESPP and Directors Plan and to participants of the 401(k) Plan. In addition, common stock is provided to employees through the ESOP. The Company currently repurchases common stock subject to certain terms and conditions. The ESPP, Directors Plan, 401(k) Plan and ESOP each contain provisions prohibiting any transfer for value without the owner first offering the common stock to the Company. 
 The Company s common stock is not traded on an established securities market. The amount of common stock offered to the Company for repurchase is not within the control of the Company, but is at the discretion of the stockholders. The Company does not believe that these repurchases of its common stock are within the scope of a publicly announced plan or program (although the terms of the plans discussed above have been communicated to the participants). Thus, the Company does not believe that it has made any repurchases during the three months ended September 28, 2024 required to be disclosed in the last two columns of the table.
