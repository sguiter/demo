EXPLANATORY NOTE 

ii 

Item 3. Legal Proceedings 

In April 2024, an ex-shareholder of Otto Pvt
Ltd., an indirect wholly owned Bahamian subsidiary of SSi( Otto commenced litigation in the Bahamas, seeking legal
confirmation that it holds 9,000 shares (approximately a 9 interest) in Otto. The litigation, in which Otto is one of the defendants,
relates to a purported transaction in 2021, at which time Dr. Sudhir Srivastava, the Company s Chairman, Chief Executive Officer
and principal shareholder, was the sole shareholder of Otto. The plaintiff in the litigation alleges that at that time, it acquired the
9,000 Otto shares from Dr. Srivastava. However, as the plaintiff failed to pay the agreed upon consideration for the shares, in July
2022, the shareholding was cancelled. Dr. Srivastava along with Otto, has recently filed an action in the Bahamas to confirm the cancellation
of the shares and reconfirm their ownership and both actions are pending in the Bahamian courts. The Bahamian court has issued an interim
order to maintain the status quo as it stands today with respect to the 9,000 Otto shares at the center of the dispute, as well as Otto s
shareholdings in Sudhir Srivastava Innovations Pvt Ltd. SSI-India ), our Indian operating subsidiary and SSI-India s
assets during the pendency of the litigation. Based on legal opinions obtained from counsel, the Company believes that there will be
a favorable outcome in this case. 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Dr. Srivastava
and the Company have entered into an Indemnification Agreement on October 12, 2024, pursuant to which Dr. Srivastava has agreed to fully
indemnify the Company for any claims, damages and costs (including legal fees) which it incurs in connection with this litigation or
in relation to any of his ventures prior to consummation of the Company s acquisition by merger of CardioVentures, Inc. in April
2023. 

Item 7. Management s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

Introduction 

The Company was originally incorporated in
the state of Florida on February 4, 2015, under the name Avra Surgical Microsystems, Inc., and changed its name
to Avra Medical Robotics, Inc. AVRA on November 5, 2015. 

From inception through April 13, 2023, we were
engaged in developing a fully autonomous medical robotic system using proprietary software which integrated Artificial Intelligence and
Deep Learning, or Machine Learning. Our research and development efforts were based in Orlando, Florida, where we established a research
partnership with the University of Central Florida. 

In July and August 2022, AVRA and the management
of Cardio Ventures es began discussions to explore potential merger synergies, leading to a formal agreement in November 2022
by and among the Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company Merger Sub ), CardioVentures and Dr. Sudhir Srivastava,
who, through his holding company, owned a controlling interest in CardioVentures (the Merger Agreement ). Cardio
Ventures was primarily seeking a platform to raise funds in the U.S. to support operations of its subsidiary, SSI India. AVRA s
ability to attract funds from its high-net-worth investors became a focal point in these discussions, presenting a path for AVRA shareholders
to also benefit from the merger. Consequently, as part of the merger strategy, AVRA raised funds through convertible notes (at the rate
of 7 interest per annum), which were subsequently provided to Cardio Ventures via convertible notes issued by Cardio Ventures. Investors
like Andrew Economos and Dr. Fred Moll, both existing AVRA shareholders, contributed to these notes, foreseeing significant commercial
benefits and the potential for AVRA s turnaround post-merger, despite AVRA s status as an inactive company at the time. On
April 14, 2023, we consummated the acquisition of by merger of CardioVentures, Inc pursuant to the Merger Agreement. 

The Company is currently engaged in the business
of developing, manufacturing, and selling a surgical robotic system under our proprietary brand SSi Mantra , together
with allied accessories and a wide range of surgical instruments capable of supporting cardiac and a variety of other surgical procedures.
Having commenced commercial sales of our surgical robotic system in the second half of 2022, the year 2023 was our first full year of
commercial sales of our surgical robotic system and its allied instruments and accessories. Accordingly, the operating results detailed
below largely reflect the impact of the consummation of the Reverse Merger transaction in April 2023, when compared with operating results
for the corresponding period in 2022. 

1 

Our financial performance is largely driven by
increasing awareness of the benefits of robotically assisted surgery, improved learning curves for robotic surgeons and the affordability
and accessibility of surgical robotic technology. Our financial performance is also dependent on our obtaining regulatory approvals in
various regulated markets where we have plans to sell our products. Robotically assisted surgeries are increasingly being recognized as
an approved treatment modality from an insurance coverage perspective. 

Our manufacturing operations being based in India
derive significant operating cost advantages in terms of availability of quality and cost-effective fabrication/3D printing solutions,
electronic/electrical/mechanical components, outsourced services and skilled manpower. All these factors help us in having lower costs
of production which eventually helps us make our surgical robotic system cost effective and relatively affordable. 

During the years ended December 31, 2023, and
December 31, 2022, we sold 12 and 3 surgical robotic systems, respectively. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2023, we also
installed 4 systems in four hospitals, belonging to well-known hospital groups in India, for their clinical evaluation in anticipation
of orders from these hospital groups. In addition to this, we also installed 3 systems on a pay-per-use basis. These systems were installed
in December 2023 and accordingly had not generated any revenue as of December 31, 2023. We also installed one system at the Johns Hopkins
Hospital, in Baltimore, Maryland at no cost, for clinical training and ongoing research and development purposes. As such, at the end
of December 2023, we had a total of 23 installed systems of which 20 were installed during the year ended December 31, 2023. 

Results of Operations 

Introduction 

The following discussion should be read in conjunction
with our Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto. This section of the Annual Report on Form 10-K generally discusses 2023
and 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022. 

The Company has recently commenced its commercial
operations by way of the sale of its product and has not yet established consistent operational revenue cash flows to meet all its fixed
operating costs and hence may continue to incur losses for some time. These conditions raise doubt about the Company s ability to
continue as a going concern. 

The financial statements appearing elsewhere
in this report have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. 

The following table provides selected financial
data about our Company at December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022:

To date, the Company has mainly relied on debt
and equity raised in private offerings to finance its operations. During 2024, the company plans to raise additional capital through further
private or public offerings. However, if we are unable to do so and if we experience a shortfall in operating capital, we could be faced
with having to limit our expansion plans, research and development and marketing activities.

Total Revenue. During the
year ended December 31, 2023, the Company had total revenue of 5,875,314 (comprising 5,225,777 of system sales, 647,766 of
instrument sales and 1,771 of warranty sales), compared to total revenue of 1,436,147 (comprising 1,394,824 of system sales,
 41,323 of instrument sales and 0 of warranty sales) during the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase in net total is
primarily due to sale of increased number of surgical robotic systems and instruments in the year ended December 31, 2023 as
compared to the year ended December 31, 2022. 

Research and development expense. Research
and Development expense during the year ended December 31, 2023, were 1,058,660, as compared to 987,443 for the year ended December
31, 2022. Research and development expense primarily consists of salaries paid to engineers, amounting to 603,071 and 328,173 for the
years ended December 31, 2023, and 2022, respectively. The increase in the Research and development expenses as compared to the previous
year is in line with the Company s continued focus on improving the design and technological capabilities of its existing SSi Mantra
system and further expanding its product offerings. 

Stock compensation expense. We had
stock compensation expense of 9,723,492 and Nil during the years ended December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively. The
substantial increase in the stock compensation expense in 2023 is primarily the result of the award of stock grants to employees of the
subsidiaries and the issuance of stock awards and stock options to executive officers of the Company and its subsidiaries in November
2023 under our Incentive Stock Plan, in recognition of their efforts in developing and commercializing our SSi Mantra system. 

Depreciation and amortization expense. We
had depreciation and amortization expense of 152,738 for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to 96,577 in the year ended
December 31, 2022. The depreciation and amortization expense primarily consist of depreciation on fixed assets only. 

3 

Selling, General and Administrative expense. We
incurred 10,064,622 in selling, general and administrative expense S,G A expense during the year ended December
31, 2023, as compared to 1,935,149 for the year ended December 31, 2022. 

Our SG A expense comprise of expenses
relating to salaries and benefits, retirement benefits as well as costs related to recruitment, other compensation expenses of sales
and marketing and client management personnel, sales commission, travel and brand building, client events and conferences, training and
retention of senior management and other support personnel in enabling functions, telecommunications, utilities, travel and other miscellaneous
administrative costs. S,G A expense also include acquisition-related costs, legal and professional fees (which represent the costs
of third party legal, tax, accounting, immigration and other advisors), investment in product development, digital technology, advanced
automation and robotics, related to grant of our equity awards to members of our board of directors. We expect our S,G A expense
to increase as we continue to strengthen our support and enabling functions and invest in leadership development, performance management
and training programs. The increase in S,G A expense resulted from the increased scale of commercial operations during 2023 as compared
to the year ended December 31, 2022. 

Other Income (Expense) . We have
incurred 604,308 in net interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to net interest expense of 255,290
during the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase in interest expense from 2022 to 2023 resulted from an increase in bank
borrowings for working capital from HDFC Bank in India. 

Net Loss. We incurred a net loss
of 20,878,292 for the year ended December 31, 2023, as compared to a net loss of 3,213,882 for the year ended December 31, 2022. The
increase in net loss from 2022 to 2023 is primarily the result of the increase in stock compensation expenses and general and administrative
expenses of 9,723,492 and 8,129,473 respectively. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

The Company expects to require substantial funds
for scaling up its operations, incurring capital expenditures to have its own manufacturing facility for in-house machining and tooling
capacity and to continue to finance its research and development work in the field of surgical robotics. 

On April 15, 2023, the Company executed a Convertible
Promissory Note (the Line of Credit Note with Sushruta Pvt Ltd. Sushruta ), the Bahamian holding
company owned by Dr. Sudhir Srivastava, our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and principal shareholder. Pursuant to the Line of Credit
Note, Sushruta, in its discretion could make multiple advances to the Company through December 31, 2023 (the Maturity Date ),
in an aggregate amount of up to 20,000,000 for working capital purposes. The advances under the Line of Credit Note did not bear interest
and were due and payable on or before the Maturity Date. During the year ended December 31, 2023, Sushruta made advances aggregating
to 16,980,000 under the Line of Credit Note and exercised its option to convert the full amount of advances made into shares of our
common stock at a conversion price of 0.74 per share. Accordingly, 22,945,946 shares of our common stock were issued to Sushruta during
the year ended December 31, 2023.

Cash Flows Used in Operating Activities 

Net cash used in operating activities was
 15,370,894 for the year ending 31 December 2023, compared to 5,994,475 for the year ending 31 December 2022, reflecting higher
cash losses and increased working capital needs due to increased scale of operations. The major drivers contributing to the increase
of 9,376,419 in net cash used in operating activities year-over-year included the following: 

Increase
 in net cash loss to the extent of 2,466,612 (net of non-cash adjustments) in fiscal 2023
 compared to fiscal 2022. Non-cash adjustments included Stock compensation expense, shares
 issued to an accredited investor for advisory services, operating lease expense and depreciation
 and amortizations. 

Increase
 of 6,909,808 in operating assets and liabilities comprising mainly of an increase of 5,333,127
 in inventories and of 2,026,728 in accounts receivables in fiscal 2023 as compared to 2022
 and a net decrease of 450,047 in other operating assets and liabilities other than inventories
 and accounts receivables. 

As
 mentioned above, changes in accounts receivable contributed to lower cash flow of 2,026,728
 for fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022. Although the Company s revenue increased from
 system sales by 3,830,953, from Instruments Sale by 606,442 and from Warranty Sales by
 1,771 in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 however, a major part of these sales being
 on deferred payment basis, it has resulted in increase in account receivables. 

Increased
investment in inventory contributed to higher cash outflow of 5,333,127 for fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 due to revenue growth
and expansion of business activities. 

As
mentioned above, in the month of April 2023, simultaneous to his investment in the Company, Dr. Frederic Moll has been issued additional
shares for a value of 4,463,799 in recognition of his industry status and his strategic advisory contributions to the company and it
is recognized as one of the non-cash items. 

Cash Flows from Investing Activities 

During the year ended December 31, 2023, we
had net cash used in investing activities of 444,077, resulting mainly from investment in purchase of equipment. 

During the year ended December 31, 2022, we
had net cash provided from investing activities of 240,818, resulting mainly from disposal of property plant and equipment.

Cash Flows from Financing Activities 

During the year ended December 31, 2023, we
had net cash, provided by financing activities of 22,796,286, which comprised of 2,480,735 in proceeds from our bank overdraft facility
(net), 412,056 in proceeds from issuance of common stock against warrant and options, 16,980,000 in proceeds from issuance of convertible
notes to our principal shareholder, 3,000,000 in proceeds from issuance of convertible notes to other investors and 50,000 in proceeds
from the exercise of stock options. There was a decrease of 126,505 on account of repayment of term loans. 

During the year ended December 31, 2022, we
had net cash provided by financing activities of 5,896,161, which comprised of 2,609,630 in proceeds from bank overdraft facility (net),
 3,000,000 in proceeds from issuance of convertible notes to other investors and 286,531 in proceeds from a bank term loan. 

While we have been successful in raising funds
to finance our operations since inception and we believe that we will be successful in obtaining the necessary financing to fund our operations
going forward, we do not have any committed sources of funding and there are no assurance that we will be able to secure additional funding.
The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern; however,
if we cannot obtain financing, then we may be forced to further curtail our operations or consider other strategic alternatives. Even
if we are successful in raising the additional financing, there is no assurance regarding the terms of any additional investment and any
such investment or other strategic alternative would likely substantially dilute our current shareholders. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

Use of Estimates 

The preparation of consolidated financial
statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date
of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
from those estimates. Significant estimates included discount rate for measuring significant financing component for deferred collections
in revenue contracts, fair value of stock options, incremental borrowing rate for leases and useful life of property plant and equipment. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

There are no off-balance sheet arrangements that
have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues
or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors. 

Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data. 

See the Index to the Financial Statements beginning
on page F-1 following the signature page of this Amendment. 

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with
Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure . 

On May 3, 2024, the SEC entered an order barring
Borgers, the Company s then independent registered public accounting firm, from appearing or practicing before the SEC as an accountant
and therefore Borgers could no longer act as the Company s independent registered public accounting firm. Effective May 13, 2024,
the Company dismissed Borgers as its independent registered public accounting firm. Subsequently, the Company engaged BDO as the Company s
new independent registered public accounting firm. See the Explanatory Note appearing on page ii above for more
detailed information.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures . 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Management s Report on Disclosure Controls
and Procedures 

In connection with
the restatement of the Company s financial statements included in this Amendment, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer re-evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over
financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange
Act ), as of December 31, 2023. 

To ensure that information
required to be disclosed by us in the reports filed or submitted by us under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported, within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, including to ensure that information required to be disclosed
by us in the reports filed or submitted by us under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Based on that re-evaluation,
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as of December 31, 2023, our disclosure controls and procedures
and internal control over financial reporting were not effective, due to material weaknesses in SSi s internal control in that: 

We
 failed to design controls and procedures to provide reasonable assurance that U.S. GAAP was being properly applied to the matters
 resulting the restatement of our financial statements, including accounting for merger transaction, recognition of revenue in case
 of deferred payment sales, recognition of right of use of certain assets and lease liabilities and functional and other classifications,
 resulting in the accounting errors described in Note 1. Restatement of Previously Issued Consolidated Financial Statements ,
 in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Amendment. 

We
do not have written documentation of our internal control policies and procedures. Written documentation of key internal controls over
financial reporting is a requirement of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Management evaluated the impact of our failure to have
written documentation of our internal controls and procedures on our assessment of our disclosure controls and procedures and has concluded
that the control deficiency that resulted represented a material weakness. 

We
do not have sufficient segregation of duties within accounting functions, which is a basic internal control. Due to our size and nature,
segregation of all conflicting duties may not always be possible and may not be economically feasible. However, to the extent possible,
the initiation of transactions, the custody of assets and the recording of transactions should be performed by separate individuals.
Management evaluated the impact of our failure to have segregation of duties on our assessment of our disclosure controls and procedures
and procedures and has concluded that the control deficiency that resulted represented a material weakness. 

Remediation Plan 

The Company has been addressing and remediating
these material weaknesses with the support and assistance of the accounting and financial staff employed by our Indian operating subsidiary.
We are enhancing the review process for significant transactions to ensure proper accounting treatment under applicable guidelines and
are engaging external experts where necessary to assist in the application of accounting principles to complex transactions. In addition,
we are implementing a new ERP system which is designed to integrate all business functions within the accounting and financial department
to further address the abovementioned weaknesses. 

Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer do not expect that our disclosure controls or internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. Although our disclosure
controls and procedures were designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, a control system, no matter how
well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute assurance that the objectives of the system are met. Further,
the design of any control system is subject to resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their
costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all
control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the fact that
judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes. Additionally, controls
can be circumvented if there exists in an individual a desire to do so. There can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving
its stated goals under all potential future conditions.

(b) Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial
Reporting 

Except for the remediation efforts described
above, there were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the last fiscal quarter covered by
the Amended Form 10-K that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting.

SS Innovations International Inc. 

405, 3rd Floor, iLabs Info Technology Centre

Gurugram, Haryana 122016, India 

Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements 

We
 have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of SS Innovations International
 Inc. (the Company as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated
 statements of operations and comprehensive loss, consolidated statements of changes in equity,
 and cash flows for each of the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively referred
 to as the consolidated financial statements ). In our opinion, the consolidated
 financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
 the Company at December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash
 flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
 in the United States of America. 

Substantial Doubt about the Company s
Ability to Continue as a Going Concern 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements
have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements,
the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations and has negative cash flows from operating activities during the year ended
December 31, 2023. The Company is dependent on further funding to meet its obligations to sustain its operations. These conditions raise
substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard to these matters
are also described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments
that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

Emphasis of Matter - Restatement of Consolidated
Financial Statements 

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated
financial statements, the accompanying consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 and for each of the years then
ended, have been restated to correct misstatements. 

Basis for Opinion 

These consolidated financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s
consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with
the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with
the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have,
nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain
an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of
the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. 

Our audits included performing procedures
to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing
procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures
in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

F- 2 

Critical Audit Matter 

The
 critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit
 of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated
 to the Board of Directors and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material
 to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective,
 or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matter does not alter in any way
 our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by
 communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinion on the critical
 audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. 

Determination of the accounting acquirer
in the merger transaction 

As disclosed in Notes 1 and 4 to the consolidated
financial statements, on April 14, 2023, SS Innovations International, Inc. consummated the acquisition of CardioVentures Inc., a Delaware
corporation CardioVentures pursuant to a merger agreement the Merger Agreement ), with CardioVentures becoming
a wholly-owned subsidiary of AVRA, which was renamed as SS Innovations International, Inc. The Company accounted for the transaction
as a reverse recapitalization and concluded that CardioVentures was the accounting acquirer based upon the terms of the Merger Agreement
and evaluation of a number of indicative factors. 

We identified the evaluation of the Company s
determination of the accounting acquirer as a critical audit matter due to subjective management s judgments required in evaluating
the relative importance of the indicative factors, including the post-combination voting rights, composition of the board of directors
and management, the relative size of the entities, ongoing operations post-combination and the minority voting rights. Auditing management s
judgments involved especially challenging and subjective auditor judgment due to the nature and extent of audit effort required to address
these matters. 

The primary procedures we performed to address
this critical audit matter included: 

1. Reviewing relevant sections of the
 Merger Agreement and relevant supporting evidences to evaluate the reasonableness of management s
 judgments around the composition of the board of directors and senior management of the combined
 Company after the merger, the relative size of the entities, post-combination ongoing operations
 and voting rights held by the former shareholder groups to conclude the determination of
 accounting acquirer. 

2. Evaluating the appropriateness
 of disclosures in the financial statements is in accordance with ASC 805 Accounting
 for business combinations.

reverse stock split and increased its authorized common stock

Before 

In the previously filed financial statements
10K for the year ended December 31, 2023, the Merger transaction was referred as being accounted for as a reverse-merger in the nature
of recapitalization in accordance with ASC 805. As per the Note 1 of Form 10K originally filed, SSII was treated as the acquirer and
AVRA was the acquired company. In the previous financial statements, the opening balance incorrectly included the combined assets and
liabilities of both AVRA and Cardio Ventures for year ended December 31, 2022. Consequently, the assets and liabilities and operations
presented in the comparative financial statements prior to the merger were consolidated assets and liabilities of AVRA and SSII recorded
at historical cost basis. 

After 

Upon review of merger agreements and related
technical accounting guidance available in ASC 805, it was determined that AVRA s assets and liabilities should have been recorded
at their fair value as of the date of merger and comparative balances for the year ended December 31, 2022 should be considered only
for Cardio Ventures at historical cost basis, being the accounting acquirer in the merger transaction. The fair value of assets and liabilities
of AVRA was assessed as nil at the time of the merger. This revaluation resulted in a change in the recorded amounts for the acquired
assets, which has now been appropriately reflected in the restated financial statements. 

Additionally, the amount recognized as issued
equity interests in the consolidated financial statements was determined by considering the equity interests of Cardio Ventures outstanding
immediately before the business combination. In accordance with ASC 805, the equity structure (the number and type of equity interests
issued) reflects that of AVRA, including the equity interests issued by AVRA to effect the merger as reverse recapitalization. As a result,
the equity structure of Cardio Ventures (the accounting acquirer) has been restated using the exchange ratio established in the acquisition
agreement to reflect the number of shares issued by the legal parent (AVRA, the accounting acquiree) in the merger. 

Impact on restated consolidated financial
statements for year ended December 31, 2023 

The Company identified that fair value of
assets and liabilities of AVRA was assessed as nil at the time of merger. 

Additionally, the Company excluded Accumulated
deficit and Additional paid in Capital pertaining to AVRA as per ASC 805. 

Further, Selling, general and administrative
expenses and stock compensation expenses amounting to and respectively were excluded as they relate to the expenses
incurred by AVRA before merger and the same is not to be included in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss
subsequent to merger as per the guidance of ASC-805 reverse recapitalization. 

Impact on restated consolidated financial
statements for year ended December 31, 2022 

The Company identified that as per ASC 805,
balances pertaining to AVRA as at and for the year ended December 31, 2022 should not have been included in the consolidated financial
statements for the Company. Accordingly, the Company excluded all such balances of AVRA in the restated consolidated financial statements.
This led to exclusion in the balances of cash and cash equivalents , prepaid and other current assets , notes receivable
 , property, plant, and equipment , notes payable to related Party and other accrued liabilities . 

Additionally, the Company excludes previously
reported common stock, Accumulated deficit and additional paid in capital pertaining to AVRA as per ASC 805. Subsequently, the Company
recorded common stock pertaining to Cardio Ventures and duly adjusted the effect of reverse recapitalization as per ASC 805. 

Further, Selling, general and administrative
expense, Research and development expense, Stock compensation expense and Interest and other income, net amounting to , ,
 and respectively were not included as they relate to the expenses incurred by AVRA before merger and the same is
not to be included in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss subsequent to merger as per the guidance of ASC-805
reverse recapitalization. 

Differential impact of above adjustments has
been corrected in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.

reclassifications

2. Interest expenses related to credit notes and discounts on credit note have been reclassified from Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses to Interest Expense. This reclassification amounts to (for the year ended December 31, 2022, ), aligning the reporting with appropriate expense categorization standards. 

(3) Correction of accounting policies misapplications 

A. Revenue recognition 

Background 

The Company identified that it had inadvertently
failed to apply some of the relevant provisions of ASC 606, Revenue from Contacts, accordingly, in the preparation of our
revised financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, we have revised our revenue recognition policy
to incorporate discounting for the present value of expected revenue. 

Before 

In previously filed financial statements, our
revenue was recognized at nominal values without considering the time value of money. Also, in previously filed financial statements,
the Company recognized revenue from maintenance and warranty services starting in the first year following delivery. Further, the Company
included deferred revenue within the accrued liabilities. 

After 

The decision to adopt a discounting approach arises
from our commitment to providing stakeholders with a more precise representation of our revenue streams. By discounting future cash flows
to their present value, we ensure that our revenue reflects the economic reality of our transactions, considering the timing of cash receipts.
This adjustment aligns our financial statements with the best practices in revenue recognition and improves the comparability of our financial
information across periods. 

F- 18 

(as at December 31, 2022, ). 

Also, warranty income is recognized once the
performance obligation condition is fulfilled. To be in line with this provision, unrealized warranty income included in the revenue
were reversed and recorded as Deferred revenue in Balance sheet till the time performance obligation relation to this is not fulfilled.
Accordingly (as at December 31, 2022, was recorded as deferred revenue during the year and further the same was
reclassed as current and non-current and , respectively (as at December 31, 2022, and , respectively)
in these restated financial statements. 

Deferred revenue recorded earlier amounting
to in Other accrued liabilities was reversed as the same was not as per ASC 606 principles. 

Interest Income for the current period is
related to unwinding of account receivable balances recorded as interest income of which is adjusted with the net of System
 Warranty sale of (year ended December 31, 2022, in consolidated statement of Income and other comprehensive income. 

B. Lease 

Before 

For the years ended December 31, 2023 and
December 31, 2022, the Company identified that it had inadvertently failed to apply ASC 842, Leases, to certain operating
lease arrangements. 

Upon further review, the Company also determined
that similar issues impacted the consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. During
these periods, while preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Company inadvertently failed to apply ASC 842 to all of their
lease agreements. This resulted in the exclusion of material lease liabilities and related right-of-use assets from the financial statements. 

F- 19 

(as at December 31, 2022, was recorded to correct the balances
of ROU in line with the above provision of ASC 842. Classification of current and non-current amount of lease liability corrected by
 and respectively (as at December 31, 2022, and respectively). Further lease expenses were classified
based on Functional classification as as Selling, general and administrative expense, as cost of revenue expense and
 as Research and development expense (for the year ended December 31, 2022 lease expense classified amounting to as
Selling, general and administrative expense, as cost of revenue expense and as Research and development expense). 

Differential impact of above adjustments has
been corrected in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. 

4. Correction of other errors in measurement
of income/expense/asset/liabilities. 

We also noted errors in measurement of income/expense/assets/liabilities
throughout different financial statements captions which were corrected in the restated financial statements. Below are the major error
corrections made: 

(i) Reinstatement of liability for letter of credit (with recourse): The Company had earlier netted off the liability pertaining to letter of credit against accounts receivables. However, as per the terms of the letter of credit, there was a recourse option available with bank to recover the amount in case of default by the customer. To rectify this, a correction adjustment was made to restate the accounts receivable balance and the impact of the financing component on the income statement. This was rectified by the grossing up the accounts receivables and long-term debt current and non-current in consolidated financial statements for year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. Accounts receivable balance of 533,799 (as at December 31, 2022, has been restated along with corresponding restatement of current maturities of long-term borrowings. 

(ii) Personal expenses pertaining to Director earlier recorded as business expense of the Company: The Company identified that legal expenses amounting to (as at December 31, 2022, which were actually related to the personal expenses of Dr. Sudhir Prem Srivastava has been charged as business expense of the company. The expense has now been reversed and corresponding receivables from related party (Dr. Sudhir Prem Srivastava) has been recorded.

in noncurrent assets and

The Company identified that an
additional issuance of advisory shares to Dr. Frederic Moll during the year ended December 31, 2023, recognizing his strategic knowledge
and expertise within the industry to be recorded as selling, general and administration expense. This transaction has been classified
under Selling, General, and Administrative (SG A) expenses, totaling . This classification underscores the strategic value
Dr. Moll brings to the organization and aligns with our financial reporting standards. 

Included in Stock compensation
expenses pertaining to employees: Amounting to relating to stock compensation of AVRA which is being eliminated in the restated
consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023. Further, was additionally recognized for (a) the
grants and options which are vested immediately which was earlier not recorded as expense, (b) correction of granted fair value. 

(iv) Advance to vendors: For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company identified that an advance given to a vendor was not adjusted against respective capital and operating expenditures while the invoices were received by the Company. An adjustment was recorded to adjust the vendor advance against respective expenditure totaling . 

(v) Incorrect useful life of PPE: The Company identified that property, plant, and equipment were previously recorded incorrectly, with depreciation charged based on estimated useful life determined by management. Following a thorough analysis, the asset lives were corrected, and depreciation was recalculated accordingly. As a result of this adjustment property, plant, and equipment was reduced by as at December 31, 2023 (as at December 31, 2022, property, plant, and equipment was increased by ). 

(vi) Incorrect valuation of Inventory: The Company identified that the inventory was previously recorded at incorrect valuation. As a result of this adjustment inventory is increased by as at December 31, 2023 (as at December 31, 2022, inventory is increased by ). Consequent to this adjustment, cost of revenue has been decreased by for year ended December 31, 2023 (decrease in cost of revenue by ). 

(vii) Cut off errors: The Company identified that professional fees were recorded based on payments made during the current year, though they pertained to 2022. To correct this, a reversal adjustment of was made in the current year, and a provision for this amount has been recorded retroactively for 2022. Further the Company has identified that expense relating to origination fees has been recorded in its entirety as and when the convertible notes are issued and this expense needs to be amortized over the period of convertible notes, hence the Company has recorded the said expense to the extent it relates to current year and correspondingly recorded the differential amount in prepaid expense whose amount of amortization is for December 31, 2023 (amount of amortization for December 31, 2022 is ). 

(viii) Unrecognized Gratuity provision: The Company identified that the expense and provision for gratuity were never recorded. These were subsequently recorded from December 31, 2021, 2022, and 2023, with balances reconciled against the actuarial report. A gratuity liability recorded by (as at December 31, 2022, relates to non-current and (as at December 31, 2022, as current portion which was not accounted for earlier. 

(ix) Unrecognized accruals of expenses: The Company identified that there are some accruals which are not accounted for in books of accounts, as a result the accruals amounting to has been recorded in December 31, 2023 (as at December 31, 2022, accruals of 

(x) 
 Discounting

 discounting of security deposits has now been recorded, along with the corresponding prepaid security deposit. 

F- 21 

(as at December 31, 2022 : ). 

Differential impact of above adjustments has
been corrected in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. 

Going Concern 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements
have been prepared on a going concern basis which implies the Company will continue to meet its obligations for the next 12 months as
of the date these consolidated financial statements are issued. The Company has a working capital surplus of and an accumulated
deficit of as of December 31, 2023. The Company also had a net loss of for the year ended December 31, 2023,
which was mainly on account of non-cash items like Stock Compensation expense of , Depreciation of and advisory share
issue to Dr. Moll for included in SG A. In addition, the Company has been dependent on related parties to fund operations.
These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date
that the consolidated financial statements are issued. 

Management recognizes that the Company must obtain
additional resources to successfully implement its business plans. The Company has been able to augment its financial resources to further
supplement its operations. On April 15, 2023, the Company executed a Convertible Promissory Note (the Line of Credit Note with Sushruta Pvt Ltd. SPL ), the Bahamian holding company owned by Dr. Sudhir Srivastava, our Chairman, Chief Executive
Officer and principal shareholder. Pursuant to the Line of Credit Note, SPL, in its discretion could make multiple advances to the Company
through December 31, 2023 (the Maturity Date ), in an aggregate amount of up to for working capital purposes
and the advances under the Line of Credit Note do not bear interest and are due and payable on or before the Maturity Date. SPL, at its
option, could also convert the principal amount of any advance into shares of our common stock, at a conversion price of per share.
During the year ended December 31, 2023, SPL had advanced a total of under the Line of Credit Note upon SPL exercising its
option to convert, the outstanding balance of of the Line of Credit Note was converted in full into shares of our
common stock at a conversion price of per share. 

F- 22 

and a working
capital surplus of as compared to stockholders deficit of and a working capital deficit of as
of December 31, 2022. 

However, the Company s existing cash resources
and income from operations, are not expected to provide sufficient funds to carry out the Company s operations and business development
through the next twelve (12) months. The management of the Company is making efforts to raise further funding to scale up operations and
meet its longer-term capital needs. While management of the Company believes that it will be successful in its capital formation and planned
expansion of its operating activities, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to raise additional equity capital or be
successful in generating additional revenues and ultimately achieving profitability. The accompanying financial statements do not include
any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification
of liabilities that may result from the possible inability of the Company to continue as a going concern.

 of SSII s post-merger issued and outstanding common stock on a fully diluted basis, with treated as stock compensation expenses
for strategic value. Economos received of SSII s post-merger issued shares. 

Reverse Recapitalization Impact: As part
of the reverse recapitalization, CardioVentures acquired the net assets of AVRA at fair value at Closing. The fair value of AVRA s
net assets was assessed to be zero by management, resulting in a recognized loss of in additional paid-in capital. This loss
was due to the difference between the fair value of the shares issued of the total) and AVRA s net assets. 

For comparative periods, the assets and liabilities
of CardioVentures (the accounting acquirer) were recognized at their pre-combination carrying amounts, with retained earnings and equity
balances carried forward. The equity structure reflects that of AVRA (the legal parent) using the exchange ratio established in the Merger
Agreement.
