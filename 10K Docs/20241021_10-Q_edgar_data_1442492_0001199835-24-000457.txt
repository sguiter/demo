NOTES
 TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 
 (UNAUDITED) 

Lustre
and Erehwon entered into an Exploration and Development Agreement, dated July 18, 2023 (the Development Agreement ), with
Texakoma Exploration Production Company Texakoma ), for the exploration and development of the Lustre Field
Prospect, as described in the Development Agreement. Lustre and Erehwon are parties to an existing Acquisition and Participation
Agreement, under which those parties agreed to acquire certain oil and gas interests, and drill, complete, re-enter, re-complete, sidetrack,
and equip wells, in certain counties in Montana. 

Under
the terms of a Development Agreement, Texakoma agreed to pay Lustre and Erehwon (jointly, LOC ), the following amounts:
(i) 175,000 on or before July 21, 2023; and (ii) another 175,000 upon the spudding of the initial test well subject to
rig availability. Upon the spudding of that test well, LOC was required to deliver to Texakoma a partial assignment of an 85 working
interest in the oil and gas leases covering the first two initial drilling and spacing units. Under the Development Agreement the first
payment was paid by Texakoma in August 2023 and the Company received the second payment of 175,000 in September 2023. 

The
two test wells were successfully drilled and Texakoma paid 100 of the costs associated with the drilling and completion of the wells.
Lustre and Erehwon jointly have an undivided 15 working interest, carried through the tanks, in those two wells. In March 2024, Texakoma
exercised its option to participate in the development of the remainder of the Lustre Field Prospect. By exercising its option, Texakoma
agreed to drill eight additional wells, with Lustre and Erehwon having a 15 working interest carried through the tanks, and to pay Lustre
 706,603 spread over four months, for an 85 leasehold interest in the next eight drill sites and a 50 leasehold interest in the balance
of the Lustre Field Prospect acreage. As of May 31, 2024, Texakoma paid an additional 328,681 in accordance with the contract. The remaining
amounts due were paid by the end of first quarter 2025. The working and net revenue interest in any wells drilled subsequent to the first
ten wells will be shared by Texakoma and Lustre and Erehwon, jointly, on a 50:50 basis. 

Following
the Texakoma transaction, we retain a 100 leasehold interest and full control of an additional 30,556 net mineral acres in northeastern
Montana at the western edge of the Williston Basin. 

In
December 2023, we entered into a Participation Agreement, through Hell Creek Crude, LLC, our wholly owned subsidiary, Erehwon, and various
accredited investors. The Participation Agreement provided us with 2,034,000 to acquire certain leases and to drill a development well
in the Midfork Field in Montana. Several of the investors also hold 575,000 of our convertible debt, plus accrued interest of 73,317,
which indebtedness is included as investments under the Participation Agreement. 

Until
the total of the 2,682,317 in cash, notes and accrued interest is repaid to the various investors under the terms of the Participation
Agreement, the net working interest payments from the Participation Agreement will be split between the various investors and HCC and
Erehwon, collectively on a 90 /10 basis. After the repayment to the investors, the split between the investors, on one hand, and HCC
and Erehwon, on the other hand, will be on a 50 /50 basis. After the development well is drilled under the Participation Agreement,
the investors will have the option to invest in up to two additional wells in the field.

This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this Form 10-Q of Laredo Oil, Inc., a Delaware corporation, (the Company, 
 we, our, or us for the quarter ended August 31, 2024, includes consolidated comparative financial
statements and disclosures for the quarter ended August 31, 2023 which have been restated from the Form 10-Q previously filed for the
quarter ended August 31, 2023 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC on October 23, 2023 (the 2023
Original Filing ). 

Reference
Note 2 in the accompanying Notes to Financial Statements for detailed disclosure of items amended by this restatement. 

Restatement
of the Financial Statement for Fiscal Quarter Ended August 31, 2023 

This
Form 10-Q restates the 2023 Original Filing and related disclosures arising from an impairment analysis during the 2024 audit and the
related reaudit of the Company s fiscal year 2023 financial statements. 

The
reaudit requirement was authorized by the Company during the audit engagement for the year ended May 31, 2024. For the year ended May
31, 2024, a new auditing firm was engaged to replace the previous auditing firm, BF Borgers CPA PC Borgers ), who performed
the audit in connection with the financial statements for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2023 included in the 2023 Original Filing. 

During
the 2024 audit that was in progress, on May 3, 2024 the SEC entered, and the Company became aware of, an order instituting settled administrative
and cease-and-desist proceedings against Borgers, which order includes denying Borgers the privilege of appearing or practicing before
the SEC as an accountant. The Company and its new auditing firm determined that the 2023 audit performed by Borgers should not be included
in the 2024 filing, and the Company expanded its engagement with the new auditing firm to include a reaudit of the 2023 financial statements. 

In
the course of the 2023 reaudit, procedures were applied that led the Company and the new auditors to believe sufficient audit procedures
were not performed by Borgers when auditing the 2023 financial statements. 

For
the year ended May 31, 2024, management applied accounting procedures to examine the need for an impairment adjustment to the carrying
value of its unevaluated oil and natural gas properties. A triggering event related to the evaluation of the economic viability related
to the Company s Olfert 11-4 well on May 31, 2024 was noted. Although negotiation discussions with salt-water disposal well operators
in the area have been in progress for over two years, there was no assurance that access would, in fact, be attained in a timely manner.
Additionally, the value of the Company s Cat Creek Holdings, LLC Cat Creek equity method investment was determined
to have no continuing value. The conclusion reached was to impair 100 of the carrying value of the Company s oil assets associated
with the well and the remaining Cat Creek investment balance as of May 31, 2023. The new auditing firm recommends that this higher impairment
is more in line with the standard practices within the oil and gas exploration industry during periods in which unevaluated oil wells
and loss producing investments are recorded. 

Given
the combined auditing engagement for 2023 with the audit for 2024, the Company recorded an impairment adjustment as of May 31, 2023 and
at May 31, 2024. As a result, our previously issued 2024 financial statements included in the Original Filing should no longer be
relied upon. 

Except
for the changes relating to this impairment adjustment for 2023 and changes relating to asset adjustments, no other changes have been
made to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended May 31, 2023. Reference Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.

Business 

We
are an oil exploration and production company, primarily engaged in acquisition and exploration efforts to find mineral reserves on various
properties. From our inception in March 2008 through October 2009, we were primarily engaged in acquisition and exploration efforts for
mineral properties. Beginning in October 2009, we shifted our focus to locating mature oil fields with the intention of acquiring those
oil fields and recovering stranded oil reserves using enhanced recovery methods. From June 14, 2011 to December 31, 2020, we were a management
services company, managing the acquisition and operation of mature oil fields, focused on the recovery of stranded oil
from those mature fields using enhanced oil recovery methods for our then sole customer, Stranded Oil Resources Corporation, or SORC,
a wholly owned subsidiary of Alleghany Corporation, or Alleghany. We performed those services in exchange for a quarterly management
fee and reimbursement from SORC of our employee related expenses. Such fees and reimbursements were effectively all of our revenues prior
to the closing of the Securities Purchase Agreement with Alleghany described below. 

On
December 31, 2020, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with Alleghany. Under that agreement, we purchased all of the issued
and outstanding shares of SORC. As consideration for the SORC shares, we paid Alleghany 72,678 in cash and agreed to pay Alleghany a
seven-year royalty of 5.0 of our future revenues and net profits from our oil, gas, gas liquids and all other hydrocarbon operations,
subject to certain adjustments. Currently, SORC is not conducting any ongoing operations. 

Prior
to December 31, 2020, while implementing underground gravity drainage, or UGD, projects for Allegheny, we gained specialized know-how
and operational experience in evaluating, acquiring, operating and developing oil and gas properties, as well as expertise in designing,
drilling and producing conventional oil wells. Based upon that know-how, we identified and acquired 45,246 gross acres, and 37,932 net
acres, of mineral property interests in the State of Montana. We began drilling an exploratory well in Montana during May 2022. That
well, named the Olfert 11-4 well, has not yet been completed or put into production. More recently, we are continuing our efforts to
complete the Olfert 11-4 well and begin commercial production. We have also developed relationships with Texakoma Exploration and Production,
LLC, or Texakoma, and Erehwon Oil Gas, LLC, or Erehwon, designed to develop our acquired mineral property acreage. We also have
raised 2,034,000 from accredited investors pursuant to a participation agreement to fund the development of up to three wells in the
Midfork oil field in Montana. The first well, Reddig 11-21, has been drilled and is in the process of being put into production. We are
continually attempting to raise additional funds to develop our other mineral property interests we have purchased. We also have a 50 
interest in the Cat Creek oil field, located in Montana. Our various projects and relationships are described in more detail below. Our
ability to secure additional funding will determine whether we can achieve any future production for the acreage, and if we can secure
such financing, the pace of field development. 

Relationship
with Erehwon Oil Gas, LLC 

In
connection with securing this acreage in Montana, Lustre Oil Company LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company Lustre ),
entered into an Acquisition and Participation Agreement (the Erehwon APA and subsequent amendments with Erehwon Oil 
Gas, LLC Erehwon to acquire oil and gas interests and drill, complete, re-enter, re-complete, sidetrack, and equip wells
in Valley County, Daniels County and Roosevelt County, Montana. The amended Erehwon APA specifies calculations for royalty interests
and working interests for the first ten well completions and first ten well recompletions and for all additional wells and recompletions
thereafter. Lustre will acquire mineral leases and pay 100 of the costs and the split between Erehwon and Lustre will be 20 /80 . Under
the amended Erehwon APA, Lustre will fund 100 of the construction costs of the first ten wells and first ten completions. Until payout
as defined is attained, the distribution split between Erehwon and Lustre will be 10 /90 , thereafter, 20 /80 . Any additional wells
will be funded 80 by Lustre and 20 by Erehwon. 

Royalty
expenses for these wells will consist of a royalty interest to the landowner and an overriding royalty interest of between 3 and 6 
to two individuals who generated the prospects. Those individuals will also receive an amount equal to 5 of the cost of the first ten
new wells we complete and the first ten completed recompletions. 

Hell
Creek Crude, LLC Midfork Field Production Well 

In
December 2023, we entered into a Participation Agreement, through Hell Creek Crude, LLC, our wholly owned subsidiary HCC ),
Erehwon, and various accredited investors. The Participation Agreement provided us with 2,034,000 to acquire certain leases and to drill
a development well in the Midfork Field in Montana. Several of the investors also hold 575,000 of our convertible debt, plus accrued
interest of 73,317, which indebtedness is included as investments under the Participation Agreement. 

Until
the total of the 2,682,317 in cash, notes and accrued interest is repaid to the various investors under the terms of the Participation
Agreement, the net working interest payments from the Participation Agreement will be split between the various investors and HCC and
Erehwon, collectively on a 90 /10 basis. After the repayment to the investors, the split between the investors, on one hand, and HCC
and Erehwon, on the other hand, will be on a 50 /50 basis. After the development well is drilled under the Participation Agreement,
the investors will have the option to invest in up to two additional wells in the field.

Olfert
11-4 Montana Well 

In
January 2022, we executed a Net Profits Interest Agreement with Erehwon and Olfert No. 11-4 Holdings, LLC, or Olfert Holdings, for the
purpose of funding the first well, named Olfert #11-4, under the Acquisition and Participation Agreement described above. In exchange
for Olfert Holdings funding of the development of Olfert #11-4, Olfert Holdings receives 90 of amounts resulting from Olfert
#11-4 prior to Payout and 50 after Payout. The Net Profits Interest Agreement defines Payout 
as the point in time when the aggregate of all Net Profits Interest payments made to Olfert Holdings under the agreement
equals 105 of the total well development costs. 

We
also entered into the Olfert Holdings operating agreement, under which we agreed to make a capital contribution to Olfert Holdings in
the amount of 500,000, out of a total of 1,500,000 of capital to be raised by Olfert Holdings. As of May 31, 2024, we were credited
with a contribution of 59,935 in market value of well development costs, representing a 4.4 interest in Olfert Holdings. Since then,
other investors, including our Chief Financial Officer, assumed and funded our remaining capital commitment under the Olfert Holdings
operating agreement. 

As
part of our annual impairment analysis and in conjunction with our annual financial audit, we decided to take an accounting impairment
charge to reduce the asset value of the Olfert 11-4 well to salvage value. Although we still are working to put the well into production,
it has been two years since the well was shut-in pending gaining access to a proximate salt-water disposal well making the well economically
viable. Although the asset carrying value of the well has been reduced, we will continue to complete the well and bring it into production. 

Development
Agreement with Texakoma Exploration and Production, LLC 

Effective
July 18, 2023, Lustre and Erehwon entered into an Exploration and Development Agreement (the Development Agreement ), with
Texakoma. The Development Agreement provides for the exploration and development of the Lustre Field Prospect described
in the Development Agreement. Lustre and Erehwon are also parties to an existing Acquisition and Participation Agreement, under which
those parties agreed to acquire certain oil and gas interests, and drill, complete, re-enter, re-complete, sidetrack, and equip wells,
in certain counties in Montana. 

Under
the terms of the Development Agreement, Texakoma agreed to pay Lustre and Erehwon, jointly, the following amounts: (i) 175,000 on or
before July 21, 2023; and (ii) another 175,000 upon the spudding of the initial test well subject to rig availability.
Upon the spudding of that test well, Lustre and Erehwon were required to deliver to Texakoma a partial assignment of an 85 working interest
in the oil and gas leases covering the first two initial drilling and spacing units. The first payment under the Development Agreement
was paid by Texakoma at the end of August 2023, and the second 175,000 payment on September 29, 2023. 

The
two test wells were successfully drilled and Texakoma paid 100 of the costs associated with the drilling and completion of the wells.
Lustre and Erehwon jointly, have an undivided 15 working interest, carried through the tanks, in those two wells. In March 2024, Texakoma
exercised its option to participate in the development of the remainder of the Lustre Field Prospect. By exercising its option, Texakoma
agreed to drill eight additional wells, with Lustre and Erehwon having a 15 working interest carried through the tanks, and to pay Lustre
 706,603 spread over four months, for an 85 leasehold interest in the next eight drill sites and a 50 leasehold interest in the balance
of the Lustre Field Prospect acreage. As of May 31, 2024, 377,901 of the contractual amount was settled. The remaining balance was paid
as of August 1, 2024. The working and net revenue interest in any wells drilled subsequent to the first ten wells will be shared by Texakoma
and Lustre and Erehwon, jointly, on a 50:50 basis. 

Additional
Acreage North of the Fort Peck Reservation 

We
are in the process of raising 7.5 million to drill three exploratory wells by selling units of West Fork Resources, LLC. The purpose
of the package is to prove up portions of our over 30,000 acres of mineral rights located north of the Fort Peck Reservation at the western
edge of the Williston Basin.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Wells
associated with the Texakoma agreement and the HCC well described above are being put into production pending operational completion
of the Cranston saltwater disposal well. Until we receive adequate revenue from those wells, any cash needed for operations and oil field
expansion and development will most likely come from the sale of our debt and equity securities. From May 31, 2024 through October 14,
2024, we have raised 800,000 from the sale of 1,811,628 shares of unregistered common stock. 

Our
cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash at August 31, 2024 was 1,935,310. Our total debt outstanding as of August 31, 2024
was 3,031,212, including (i) 617,934 owed to Alleghany, which is classified as a current note payable, and (ii) 937,224 pursuant to
notes under the Paycheck Protection Program, or PPP, of which we have classified 872,358 as long-term debt, net of the current portion
totaling 64,866, which is classified as a current note payable, (iii) 123,894 short term convertible notes and bridge security , net
of deferred debt discount, (iv) a 310,061 revolving note classified as short-term, (v) a 750,000 note payable due to Cali Fields LLC,
classified as short-term, and (vi) a 292,099 note payable due to our Chief Financial Officer, classified as short-term. 

Results
of Operations 

During the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 ended
August 31, 2024, the Company recognized 6,048 of revenue from one of the three Texakoma wells being put into production. It is expected
that the wells will experience increased production after a proximate SWD well becomes operational. 

During the three months ended August 31, 2024 and
2023, we incurred operating expenses of 670,359 and 1,349,579, respectively. These expenses consisted of general operating expenses
incurred in connection with the day-to-day operation of our business, the preparation and filing of our required public reports and stock
option compensation expense. The decrease in expenses for the three months ended August 31, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023,
is primarily attributable to stock-based compensation expenses, offset by a net increase in other professional fees including IT, legal
and accounting services. 

During
the quarter ended August 31, 2024, we recognized other income related to the final two payments under the Texakoma Development Agreement.
During the quarter ended August 31, 2023, we recognized other income and expenses comprised of 175,000 related to the sale of underground
drilling equipment that formerly had been used in drilling operations in the Fredonia underground gravity drainage project and 175,000
related to the first payment as required under the Texakoma Development Agreement 

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements 

Refer
to Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The
process of preparing consolidated financial statements requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of liabilities and stockholders equity/(deficit) at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates in these consolidated financial statements include estimates
related to the valuation of stock-based compensation and asset retirement obligation. Changes in the status of certain facts or circumstances
could result in a material change to the estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and actual results
could differ from the estimates and assumptions. 

Going
Concern 

These
consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. We have routinely incurred losses since inception, resulting
in an accumulated deficit. We have recently received loans from accredited investors to fund our operations. There is no assurance that
such financing will be available in the future to meet our operating needs. This situation raises substantial doubt about our ability
to continue as a going concern within the one-year period after the issuance date of the consolidated financial statements included in
this report. 

Our
management has undertaken steps to improve operations, with the goal of sustaining operations for the next twelve months and beyond.
These steps include an ongoing effort to raise funds through the issuance of debt to fund our well development program and maintain operations.
We have attracted and retained key personnel with significant experience in the industry. At the same time, in an effort to control costs,
we have required a number of our personnel to multi-task and cover a wider range of responsibilities in an effort to restrict the growth
of our headcount. There can be no assurance that we can successfully accomplish these steps and it is uncertain that we will achieve
a profitable level of operations and obtain additional financing. We cannot assure you that any additional financing will be available
to us on satisfactory terms and conditions, if at all. 

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability
and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result from the possible inability of us to continue
as a going concern.

2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS continued 

Off
Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We
do not currently have any off-balance sheet arrangements or other such unrecorded obligations, and we have not guaranteed the debt of
any other party. 

ITEM
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

Our
exposure to market risk is confined to our cash equivalents. We invest in high-quality financial instruments, and we believe we are subject
to limited credit risk. Due to the short-term nature of our cash, we do not believe that we have any material exposure to interest rate
risk arising from our investments. 

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

(a)
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed
or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC. Our disclosure controls
and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our
reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosures. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including
the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure
controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives, and management necessarily is required
to use its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 

An
evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer,
or CEO, and Chief Financial Officer, or CFO, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period
covered by this report as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e). Based on that evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded
that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective in ensuring that information
required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported in a timely manner, and (2)
accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required
disclosure because of a material weakness in our control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination
of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement
of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Specifically, the
Company s management has concluded that as of August 31, 2024, we had no full-time employees with the requisite expertise in the
key functional areas of finance and accounting. As a result, there is a lack of proper segregation of duties necessary to ensure that
all transactions are accounted for accurately and in a timely manner. This material weakness resulted in the restatement of the Company s
financial statements for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2024. In light of this material weakness, we performed additional analysis
as deemed necessary to ensure that our financial statements were prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
Accordingly, management believes that the financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q present fairly in all material
respects our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. 

Our
small size and limited resources have prevented us from being able to employ sufficient resources to enable us to have an adequate level
of supervision and segregation of duties. Further we have limited specific oil and gas accounting personnel in our accounting department
due to our small size, lack of resources and limited technical accountants on staff. This led to material adjustments to oil and gas
investment and asset impairment evaluations. It is difficult for us to effectively segregate accounting duties and have proper financial
reporting, which creates a material weakness in internal controls. This lack of segregation of duties and limited personnel leads management
to conclude that our financial reporting disclosure controls and procedures are not effective to give reasonable assurance that the information
required to be disclosed in reports that we file under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed summarized and reported as and when required. 

(b)
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

None.
