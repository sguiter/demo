million of goodwill impairment charges associated with its reporting unit. See Note 5, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net . Impairment of Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets The Company tests intangible assets that are not amortized (i.e., indefinite-lived brands) for impairment at the asset level. Indefinite-lived intangibles are tested for impairment annually as of October 1 or more frequently if certain circumstances indicate a possible impairment may exist. The Company performs a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying value. If the Company determines that it is more likely than not that the intangible asset is impaired, it performs a quantitative assessment by comparing the fair value of the asset with its carrying amount. If the fair value, which is based on expected future cash flows, exceeds the carrying value, the asset is not considered impaired. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over the fair value of the asset. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded million of impairment charges associated with indefinite-lived assets. See Note 5, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net .

The payments under the tax receivable agreement are not conditioned upon continued ownership of the Company by the pre-IPO owners. We have determined that it is more likely than not that we will be unable to realize tax benefits related to certain basis adjustments and acquired net operating losses that were received in connection with the Reorganization Transactions and our IPO. As a result of this determination, we have t recorded the benefit of these deferred tax assets as of September 30, 2024. At the time of the Sponsor

If, in the future, we are not able to utilize the Common Basis, we would record a reduction in the tax receivable agreement liability to related parties that would result in a benefit recorded within our consolidated statements of operations. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our tax receivable agreement liability decreased by a net million due to the following: (1) a million decrease from tax receivable agreement payments made during the first quarter of 2024, and (2) a partially offsetting net increase of million, primarily due to the effects of the repurchase of Common Units in Bumble Holdings from Blackstone entities completed in the first quarter of 2024 and the effects of the repurchase of Common Units in Bumble Holdings from Bumble during 2024, the proceeds from which were used to fund Class A common stock repurchases during 2024.

During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company identified potential impairment triggering events indicating that the fair value of its reporting unit was more likely than not less than its carrying value. These triggering events included the Company s revised 2024 outlook and a decrease in the Company s stock price and market capitalization that was sustained during the third quarter of 2024. In accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles Goodwill and Other, the Company performed a quantitative goodwill impairment test. The fair value of the reporting unit was estimated using a combination of two approaches, an income approach, employing a discounted cash flow model, and a market approach, employing a guideline public company approach. These valuation approaches require the Company to make various assumptions regarding the timing and amount of expected cash flows, including, but not limited to, the revenue growth rate, the discount rate and valuation multiples. As a result of this impairment test, the Company recognized a goodwill impairment charge of million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. The fair value of the Company s reporting unit was impacted by its revised forecast, as well as adverse macroeconomic factors, including but not limited to, slower economic growth, a higher cost of borrowing, inflationary pressures, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. There were impairment charges recorded for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. Intangible Assets, Net

During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the decline in the Company's stock price and market capitalization indicated that the fair value of the Company's indefinite-lived assets was more likely than not less than its carrying value. The Company evaluated the fair value of its indefinite-lived assets by using the relief from royalty methodology based on management s assumptions. This valuation approach requires the Company to make various assumptions regarding the timing and amount of expected cash flows, including, but not limited to, the revenue growth rate, royalty rate, and discount rate. As a result, the Company recognized an impairment charge of million associated with the indefinite-lived assets during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, representing the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the Company's indefinite-lived intangible assets. Additionally, the Company assessed the recoverability of our long-lived assets and definite-lived intangible assets at the asset group level and determined that the carrying value of the Fruitz asset group was not recoverable. The Company then evaluated the fair value of the Fruitz asset group using a discounted cash flow method, which required the Company to make various assumptions, including, but not limited to, the revenue growth rate and discount rate. As a result of this impairment test, the Company recognized million of impairment charges during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. The impairment charges were allocated to the Fruitz asset group on a pro-rata basis based on the carrying amounts of the long-lived assets and definite-lived intangible assets. Additionally, the Company revised the remaining useful life of certain definite-lived intangible assets of Fruitz. There were impairment charges recorded for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. On July 1, 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of Geneva Technologies, Inc. Geneva for total cash consideration of million (the Purchase Consideration ), net of cash acquired. The principal assets of Geneva, which is a pre-revenue company, are a social networking and communications platform for building friendship and community and related intellectual property rights. As substantially all of the fair value of the acquired assets was concentrated in Geneva s developed technology, the transaction did not meet the definition of a business combination. As such, the Company accounted for this transaction as an asset acquisition in accordance with ASC 805, Business Combinations . The Purchase Consideration was allocated to the acquired assets and liabilities based on their relative fair values, with million allocated to developed technology, which will be amortized on a straight-line basis over four years, and million allocated to other assets and liabilities. Amortization expense related to intangible assets, net for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was million and million, respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was million and million, respectively.

There were no transfers between levels between September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The carrying value of accounts receivable, accounts payable, income tax payable, accrued expenses and other payables approximate their fair values due to the short-term maturities of these instruments. The Company uses interest rate derivative instruments to manage the risk related to fluctuating cash flows from interest rate changes on the debt. These instruments are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes and are recorded in Other current assets, Other noncurrent assets, Accrued expense and other current liabilities or Other long-term liabilities, with changes in fair value recognized in Other income (expense), net. The Company's derivative asset, which consists of interest rate swaps, is measured at fair value on a recurring basis using observable market data (Level 2) and totaled million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The fair value of interest rate swaps is estimated using a combined income and market-based valuation methodology based on Level 2 inputs, including forward interest rate yield curves obtained from independent pricing services. Derivative assets are included in Other noncurrent assets as of September 30, 2024 and Other current assets as of December 31, 2023 in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company s contingent earn-out liability is measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) and totaled million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Contingent earn-out liability is included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. As of September 30, 2024 , there is a contingent consideration arrangement, consisting of an earn-out payment to former shareholders of Worldwide Vision Limited of up to million. The Company determined the fair value of the contingent earn-out liability by using a probability-weighted analysis to determine the amount of the liabilities, and, if the arrangement is long-term in nature, applying a discount rate that captures the risks associated with the duration of the obligation. The number of scenarios in the probability-weighted analyses vary; generally, more scenarios are prepared for longer duration and more complex arrangements. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the fair value of the contingent earn-out liability reflects a risk-free r ate of a nd , respectively. The Company classified contingent earn-out arrangements as liabilities at the time of the acquisition, as they will be settled in cash, and remeasures the fair values of the contingent earn-out liabilities each reporting period thereafter until settled. The fair value of the contingent earn-out liabilities are sensitive to changes in the stock price, discount rates and the timing of the future payments, which

During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded impairment charges of million for indefinite-lived intangible assets, million for the Fruitz asset group and million for goodwill. The Company determined the fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets, Fruitz long-lived assets and definite-lived intangible assets and its reporting unit for goodwill impairment using unobservable inputs (Level 3).

pre-arbitration demands regarding Bumble s alleged violation of BIPA. The parties reached settlements to resolve all of these individual demands, and the settlements have been fully paid as of August 1, 2024. An accrual has been made based on the probable and estimable loss i n connection with the aforementioned class and individual matters . For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded and million, respectively, in costs in connection with the aforementioned class and individual matters. In February 2024, an additional class action lawsuit was filed in Illinois alleging that certain features of Bumble app violate BIPA. The case has been administratively terminated pending resolution of the plaintiff s individual claims in arbitration. Proceedings Related to the September 2021 Secondary Public Stock Offering (the SPO Six shareholder derivative complaints have been filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, United States District Court for the District of Delaware and Delaware Court of Chancery against the Company and certain directors and officers asserting claims under the U.S. federal securities laws that the Registration Statement and prospectus used for the SPO contained false and misleading statements or omissions by failing to disclose certain information concerning Bumble and Badoo app paying users and related trends and issues with the Badoo app payment platform, and that as a result of the foregoing, Bumble s business metrics and financial prospects were not as strong as represented in the SPO Registration Statement and prospectus. The Glover-Mott shareholder derivative complaint was filed in April 2022 in federal court. The Michael Schirano shareholder derivative complaint was filed in May 2023 in federal court. The United States District Court for the District of Delaware ordered the two actions consolidated in August 2023 under the caption In Re Bumble Inc. Stockholder Derivative Litigation. An amended consolidated complaint was filed in August 2023 alleging violations of Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, and Section 29(b) of the Exchange Act, as well as for breach of fiduciary duty, waste, and unjust enrichment against, among others, management, our Board of Directors and Blackstone. The complaint seeks unspecified damages; rescission of certain employment agreements between the individual defendants and the Company, disgorgement from defendants of any improperly or unjustly obtained profits or benefits; an award of costs and disbursements, including reasonable attorneys fees; punitive damages; pre- and post-judgment interest, and that the Company be directed to take action to reform its corporate governance and internal procedures. Two federal court shareholder derivative complaints were voluntarily dismissed in July 2023. In January 2023 and February 2023, purported shareholders Alberto Sanchez and City of Vero Beach Police Officers Retirement Trust Fund, respectively, filed shareholder derivative complaints in the Delaware Court of Chancery. In March 2023, the Delaware Court of Chancery consolidated those actions under the caption In re Bumble Inc. Stockholder Derivative Litigation. In April 2023, the consolidated action plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint that asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment against, among others, management, our Board of Directors, and Blackstone. The complaint seeks unspecified damages; a finding that the individual defendants breached their fiduciary duties; disgorgement from defendants of any unjustly obtained profits or benefits; and an award of costs and disbursement, including attorneys fees, accountants fees, and experts fees. In October 2023, the court denied defendants motion to dismiss the consolidated complaint. In August 2023, Bumble received litigation demands from (i) counsel representing the purported Bumble shareholder who filed the voluntarily dismissed William B. Federman Irrevocable Trust derivative action in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware and (ii) counsel representing the purported Bumble shareholder who filed the voluntarily dismissed Dana Messana derivative action in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware. Both litigation demands are directed to the Bumble Board and contain factual allegations involving the September 2021 SPO that are generally consistent with those in the derivative litigation filed in state and federal court. The letters demand, among other things, that Bumble s Board undertake an independent investigation into alleged legal violations, and that Bumble commence a civil action to pursue related claims against any individuals who allegedly harmed Bumble. In November 2023, Bumble formed a Special Litigation Committee SLC to investigate the claims at-issue in the In Re Bumble 

28 

to allow the SLC to conduct its investigation, and the United States District Court for the District of Delaware so-ordered a stipulation similarly staying the litigation until July 15, 2024 to allow the SLC to conduct its investigation. In June 2024, the stay was extended by 10 days to July 25, 2024 in both the United States District Court for the District of Delaware and the Delaware Court of Chancery. On July 25, 2024, the SLC submitted a report of its factual findings and legal analysis. The SLC determined that terminating and dismissing the litigation would best serve the interests of the Company and its stockholders. The SLC moved to terminate and dismiss with prejudice the litigation pending in the Delaware Court of Chancery, and pursuant to prior Court Order, agreed to meet and confer with the parties to the litigation pending in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware concerning proposed next steps in that litigation, including a motion by the SLC to dismiss the litigation. The SLC also informed counsel for the shareholders who brought litigation demands (William B. Federman Irrevocable Trust and Dana Messana) of its findings. In October 2024, the United States Court for the District of Delaware granted a stay of the litigation pending a decision on the SLC s forthcoming motion to terminate the Delaware Court of Chancery action. Management is unable to determine a range of potential losses that is reasonably possible of occurring. The Company has also received an inquiry from the SEC relating to the disclosures that were at issue in the SPO class action that has since been settled by the Company. The Company cannot predict at this point the length of time that the inquiry will be ongoing, the outcome or the liability, if any, that may arise therefrom. Proceedings Related to the California Unruh Civil Rights Act (the "Unruh Act") On April 9, 2024, a putative class action complaint was filed against the Company in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, also alleging that Bumble s women message first feature violates the Unruh Act. Plaintiffs in these lawsuits sought declaratory and injunctive relief, statutory damages, and attorneys fees and costs. On July 8, 2024, the named plaintiffs filed a notice voluntarily dismissing the action without prejudice. On August 16, 2024, the named plaintiffs refiled their Unruh Act claims in the Superior Court of the State of California for the County of Riverside, this time naming as defendants both the Company and its founder, Executive Chair and former CEO Whitney Wolfe Herd. Similar to the action filed on April 9, 2024, the litigation is a putative class action in which the named plaintiffs allege that the women message first feature violates the Unruh Act. Plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief, statutory damages, and attorneys fees and costs. On October 9, 2024, the action was removed to the United States District Court for the Central District of California, where it is currently pending. Proceedings Related to 2024 Financial Results In September 2024, a purported securities class action complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas, naming the Company and certain of its current executives and directors as defendants. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act, alleging that the defendants made or disseminated materially false and misleading statements and/or concealed material adverse facts concerning Bumble s relaunch strategy announced in 2024. The class action complaint seeks unspecified damages and an award of costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees, as well as equitable relief. On October 31, 2024, a shareholder derivative complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas, naming as defendants certain of our current and former executives and directors, as well as the Company as a nominal defendant. The complaint asserts state and federal claims based on the same alleged misstatements as the securities class action complaint. The complaints seek unspecified damages, attorneys fees, and other costs. The Company intends to vigorously defend against the claims asserted in the lawsuits. However, any litigation is inherently uncertain, and any judgment or injunctive relief entered against the Company, or any adverse settlement, could materially and adversely impact the business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects of the Company. Other Proceedings From time to time, the Company is subject to patent litigations asserted by non-practicing entities. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company determined that provisions of million and million, respectively, reflect our best estimate of any probable future obligation for the Company s litigations. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company paid million and million, respectively, to settle litigation matters, which amount is accordingly no longer reflected in the provision as of September 30, 2024. Legal expenses are included in General and administrative expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

million over the period of from May 2023. If at the end of the 18 months, or upon early termination, the Company has not reached the million in spend, the Company will be required to pay for the difference between the sum of fees already incurred and the minimum commitment. As of September 30, 2024, our minimum commitment remaining is m illion. 
 million shares of Class A common stock pursuant to a trading plan under Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act in the amount of million, excluding excise tax obligations. As of October 31, 2024, a total of million remained available for repurchase under the program, subject to an approximately million share repurchase limit, which may be increased pursuant to authorization from the Company s Board of Directors.

Profitability and Liquidity We use net earnings (loss) and net cash provided by (used in) operating activities to assess our profitability and liquidity, respectively. In addition to net earnings (loss) and net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, we also use the following measures: Adjusted EBITDA . We define Adjusted EBITDA as net earnings (loss) excluding income tax (benefit) provision, interest (income) expense, net, depreciation and amortization expense, stock-based compensation expense, employer costs related to stock-based compensation, foreign exchange (gain) loss, changes in fair value of contingent earn-out liability, interest rate swaps and investments in equity securities, transaction and other costs, litigation costs net of insurance reimbursements that arise outside of the ordinary course of business, tax receivable agreement liability remeasurement 

32 

(benefit) expense, impairment loss, and costs associated with our Restructuring Plan. Adjusted EBITDA margin represents Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue. 

 Free cash flow . We define free cash flow as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less capital expenditures. Free cash flow conversion represents free cash flow as a percentage of Adjusted EBITDA. 

 Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, free cash flow and free cash flow conversion are key measures we use to assess our financial performance and are also used for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, free cash flow and free cash flow conversion are helpful to investors, analysts and other interested parties because they can assist in providing a more consistent and comparable overview of our operations across our historical financial periods. In addition, these measures are frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate and assess performance. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures for additional information and a reconciliation of net earnings (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin and net cash provided by (used in) operating activities to free cash flow. Key Factors Affecting our Performance Our results of operations and financial condition have been, and will continue to be, affected by a number of factors, including those discussed below. Growth Strategy As previously disclosed, we are in the process of implementing a new strategy and transformation plan intended to deliver durable customer value and drive long-term sustainable revenue. As part of this new strategy, we are focusing on fostering a vibrant and healthy customer ecosystem, improving the customer experience through product innovation and optimization of operations, and evolving our revenue strategy to ensure we deliver value at every step of our customers journey through a rebalancing of Bumble app subscription tiers, among other things. As we address these areas of focus, our user growth and success in attracting new users, user engagement and monetization may be negatively impacted. Furthermore, if we do not successfully implement our new strategy, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. See also If we fail to retain existing users or add new users, or if our users decrease their level of engagement with our products or do not convert to paying users, our revenue, financial results and business may be significantly harmed and We are subject to certain risks as a mission-based company in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Brands, Products and Operations of our 2023 Form 10-K. Macroeconomic Conditions Macroeconomic conditions, including the conflicts in Eastern Europe and the Middle East, slower growth or economic recession, changes to fiscal and monetary policy and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have impacted and may continue to impact our results of operations, as well as our consumers who face greater pressure on disposable income. We continuously monitor the direct and indirect impacts of these circumstances on our business and financial results. For additional information, see Risk Factors General Risk Factors We are exposed to changes in the global macroeconomic environment beyond our control, which may adversely affect consumer discretionary spending, demand for our products and services, our expenses, and our ability to execute strategic plans. in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors of our 2023 Form 10-K. Factors Affecting the Comparability of Our Results of Operations As a result of a number of factors, our historical results of operations may not be comparable from period to period or going forward. Set forth below is a brief discussion of the key factors impacting the comparability of our results of operations. Share Repurchase Program In May 2024, our Board of Directors approved amendments to the share repurchase program to increase the authorized Class A common stock repurchase amount from 300.0 million to 450.0 million. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 14.2 million shares of Class A common stock for 89.7 million, excluding excise tax obligations. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 19.5 million shares of Class A common stock and 2.0 million Common Units for 174.1 million, excluding excise tax obligations. There were no share repurchases during the three months ended September 30, 2023. During 

 33 

the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we repurchased 1.3 million shares of Class A common stock for 20.9 million. As of September 30, 2024, a total of 119.0 million remained available for repurchase under the repurchase program. For additional information, see Note 2, Summary of Selected Significant Accounting Policies Share Repurchase Program, Note 12, Related Party Transactions Share Repurchase , to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 Financial Statements (Unaudited) of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Tax Receivable Agreement In connection with certain reorganization transactions and our IPO, we entered into a tax receivable agreement with certain of our pre-IPO owners that provides for the payment by the Company to such pre-IPO owners of 85 of the benefits that the Company realizes, or is deemed to realize, as a result of the Company's allocable share of existing tax basis acquired in our IPO and other tax benefits related to entering into the tax receivable agreement. The payments that we may be required to make under the tax receivable agreement to the pre-IPO owners may be significant and are dependent upon future taxable income. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our tax receivable agreement liability decreased by a net 17.2 million due to the following: (1) a 23.1 million decrease from tax receivable agreement payments made during the first quarter of 2024, and (2) a partially offsetting net increase of 5.9 million, primarily due to the effects of the repurchase of Common Units in Bumble Holdings from Blackstone entities completed in the first quarter of 2024 and the effects of the repurchase of Common Units in Bumble Holdings from Bumble during 2024, the proceeds from which were used to fund Class A common stock repurchases during 2024. For additional information, see Risk Factors Bumble Inc. will be required to pay certain of our pre-IPO owners for most of the benefits relating to tax depreciation or amortization deductions that we may claim as a result of Bumble Inc. s allocable share of existing tax basis acquired in the IPO, Bumble Inc. s increase in its allocable share of existing tax basis and anticipated tax basis adjustments we receive in connection with sales or exchanges of Common Units (including Common Units issued upon conversion of vested Incentive Units) in connection with or after the IPO and our utilization of certain tax attributes of the Blocker Companies , Risk Factors In certain cases, payments under the tax receivable agreement may be accelerated and/or significantly exceed the actual benefits Bumble Inc. realizes in respect of the tax attributes subject to the tax receivable agreement. in each case, in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors of our 2023 Form 10-K, and Note 4, Payable to Related Parties Pursuant to a Tax Receivable Agreement , to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 Financial Statements (Unaudited) of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Impairment Charges During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we identified potential impairment triggering events related to our indefinite-lived assets, long-lived assets and definite-lived intangible assets, and goodwill. These triggering events included our revised 2024 outlook and a decrease in our stock price and market capitalization that was sustained during the third quarter of 2024. As a result, we performed an interim impairment test. Based on the results of the test, we recognized impairment charges of 670.3 million for indefinite-lived intangible assets, 24.7 million for the Fruitz asset group and 197.2 million for goodwill during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. There were no impairment charges recorded for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. Given the aforementioned impairment recorded in 2024, it is reasonably possible that changes in judgments, assumptions and estimates we made in assessing the fair values of these assets could cause us to consider some portion, or all of the remaining carrying values of these assets, to become impaired. A further decline in our stock price, economic downturns, a decline in market conditions and/or unfavorable industry trends could potentially trigger impairment tests in the future. In addition, reduced demand for our products, slower growth rates in our industry, and changes in market-based interest rates could negatively impact the estimated future cash flows and discount rates used in the income approach to determine the fair values of these assets and could result in an impairment charge in the future. For additional information, see Note 2, Summary of Selected Significant Accounting Policies Impairment of Goodwill, Impairment of Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets and Impairment of Long-lived Assets and Definite-lived Intangible Assets and Note 5, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 Financial Statements (Unaudited) of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Acquisition On July 1, 2024, we completed the acquisition of Geneva Technologies Inc.( Geneva for total cash consideration of 17.5 million, net of cash acquired, of which 17.2 million was allocated to developed technology and 0.3 million was allocated to other assets and liabilities. For additional information, see Note 5, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 Financial Statements (Unaudited) of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Restructuring Plan On February 27, 2024, the Company announced that it adopted a restructuring plan (the Restructuring Plan to reduce its global workforce by approximately 350 roles to better align its operating model with future strategic priorities and to drive stronger operating leverage. The Restructuring Plan was completed in the third quarter of 2024, and we incurred approximately 20.4 million of total non-recurring charges through the third quarter of 2024, consisting primarily of employee severance, benefits, and related charges for impacted employees. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred non-recurring charges of 0.6 million and 20.4 million, respectively. For additional information, see Note 6, Restructuring Charges , to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 Financial Statements (Unaudited) of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Components of Results of Operations Our business is organized into a single reportable segment.

Revenue from lifetime subscriptions is deferred over the average estimated expected period of the subscriber relationship, which is currently estimated to be twelve months. Revenue from the purchase of in-app features is recognized based on usage and estimated breakage revenue associated with unused in-app purchases.

Revenue from partnerships is recognized according to the contractual terms of the partnership. Cost of revenue Cost of revenue consists primarily of in-app purchase fees due on payments processed through the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. Purchases on Android, mobile web and desktop may have additional payment methods, such as credit card or via telecom providers. These purchases incur fees which vary depending on payment method. Purchase fees are deferred and expensed over the same period as revenue. Cost of revenue also includes data center expenses such as rent, power and bandwidth for running servers, cloud hosting costs, employee compensation (including stock-based compensation) and other employee related costs, impairment of capitalized aggregator costs associated with breakage revenue and restructuring charges. Expenses relating to customer care functions such as customer service, moderators and other auxiliary costs associated with providing services to customers such as fraud prevention are also included within cost of revenue. Selling and marketing expense Selling and marketing expense consists primarily of brand marketing, digital and social media spend, field marketing, restructuring charges, compensation expense (including stock-based compensation) and other employee-related costs for personnel engaged in sales and marketing functions. General and administrative expense General and administrative expense consists primarily of compensation (including stock-based compensation) and other employee-related costs for personnel engaged in executive management, finance, legal, tax and human resources.

Depreciation and amortization expense Depreciation and amortization expense is primarily related to computer equipment, leasehold improvements, furniture and fixtures, developed technology, user base, white label contracts, trademarks and other definite-lived intangible assets. Impairment loss Impairment loss relates to impairment charges to indefinite-lived intangible assets, long-lived assets and definite-lived intangible assets, and goodwill as applicable. Interest income (expense), net Interest income (expense), net consists of interest income received on money market funds and related party loans receivables and interest expense incurred in connection with our long-term debt. Other income (expense), net Other income (expense), net consists of insurance reimbursement proceeds, impacts from foreign exchange transactions, tax receivable agreement liability remeasurement expense, loss on debt extinguishment, fair value changes in derivatives, sub-lease income and investments in equity securities. Income tax benefit (provision) Income tax benefit (provision) represents the income tax benefit or expense associated with our operations based on the tax laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate. These foreign jurisdictions have different statutory tax rates than the United States. Our effective tax rates will vary depending on the relative proportion of foreign to domestic income, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and changes in tax laws.

Total Revenue was 273.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 275.5 million for the same period in 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by a decline in Total Average Revenue per Paying User and unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, partially offset by growth in Total Paying Users.

Bumble App Revenue was 220.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 221.8 million for the same period in 2023. This decrease was primarily driven by a 9.9 decline in Bumble App ARPPU to 25.58 and unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, partially offset by a 10.2 increase in Bumble App Paying Users to 2.9 million. Badoo App and Other Revenue was 53.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 53.7 million for the same period in 2023. This decrease was primarily driven by a 5.9 decline in Badoo App and Other ARPPU to 12.03, partially offset by a 14.0 increase in Badoo App and Other Paying Users to 1.4 million. We began to include paying users and revenue generated from Fruitz in our key operating metrics in the fourth quarter of 2023 and prior period key operating metrics have not been recast. Total Revenue was 810.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 778.2 million for the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily driven by growth in Total Paying Users, partially offset by a decline in Total Average Revenue per Paying User and unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Bumble App Revenue was 653.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 624.0 million for the same period in 2023. This increase was primarily driven by a 14.0 increase in Bumble App Paying Users to 2.8 million, partially offset by an 8.1 decline in Bumble App ARPPU to 25.90 and unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Badoo App and Other Revenue was 156.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 154.2 million for the same period in 2023.

Income tax provision was 4.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 1.9 million for the same period in 2023. Income tax provision was 16.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 7.2 million for the same period in 2023. The income tax provision is higher year over year for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to the impact of Pillar Two minimum taxes applicable in 2024 and due to an increase in the unfavorable tax effects associated with the vesting and cancellation of certain stock-based awards in 2024. Pillar Two Minimum Tax On December 20, 2021, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development released the Pillar Two model rules providing a framework for implementing a 15 minimum tax, also referred to as the Global Anti-Base Erosion ("GloBE") rules, on earnings of multinational companies with consolidated annual revenue exceeding 750 million. Pillar Two legislation has been enacted in certain jurisdictions where the Company operates, including the UK and certain EU member states, and is effective for the Company's financial year beginning January 1, 2024. The Company has performed an assessment of its exposure to Pillar Two income taxes, including its ability to qualify for transitional safe harbor relief under the GloBE rules. While the Company expects to qualify for transitional safe harbor relief in most jurisdictions in which it operates, there are a limited number of jurisdictions where the transitional safe harbor is not available, including for certain entities classified as stateless constituent entities under the Pillar Two model rules. The Company s income tax provision for each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 includes the effects of Pillar Two minimum taxes based on currently enacted legislation and guidance. The Company will continue to closely monitor Pillar Two developments, including the release of additional administrative guidance on the application of the GloBE rules, and evaluate the potential impact to the Company s financial position. Non-GAAP Financial Measures We report our financial results in accordance with GAAP, however, management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures provide users of our financial information with useful supplemental information that enables a better comparison of our performance across periods. We believe Adjusted EBITDA provides visibility to the underlying continuing operating performance by excluding the impact of certain expenses, including income tax (benefit) provision, interest (income) expense, net, depreciation and amortization expense, stock-based compensation expenses, employer costs related to stock-based compensation, foreign exchange (gain) loss, changes in fair value of contingent earn-out liability, interest rate swaps and investments in equity securities, transaction and other costs, litigation costs net of insurance reimbursements that arise outside of the ordinary course of business, tax receivable agreement liability remeasurement (benefit) expense, impairment loss, and costs associated with our Restructuring Plan, as management does not believe these expenses are representative of our core earnings. We also provide Adjusted EBITDA margin, which is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue. In addition to Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin, we believe free cash flow and free cash flow conversion provide useful information regarding how cash provided by (used in) operating activities compares to the capital expenditures required to maintain and grow our business, and our available liquidity, after funding such capital expenditures, to service our debt, fund strategic initiatives, effectuate discretionary share repurchases and strengthen our balance sheet, as well as our ability to convert our earnings to cash. Additionally, we believe such metrics are widely used by investors, securities analysis, ratings agencies and other parties in evaluating liquidity and debt-service capabilities. We calculate free cash flow and free cash flow conversion using methodologies that we believe can provide useful supplemental information to help investors better understand underlying trends in our business. Our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies, have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation, or as substitutes for analysis of our operating results as reported under GAAP. Additionally, we do not consider our non-GAAP financial measures as superior to, or a substitute for, the equivalent measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Some of the limitations are: Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin exclude the recurring, non-cash expenses of depreciation and amortization of property and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets and, although these are non-cash expenses, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future; 

 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; 

 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin exclude stock-based compensation expense and employer costs related to stock-based compensation, which has been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, an important part of how we attract and retain our employees and a significant recurring expense in our business; 

 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin do not reflect the interest (income) expense, net or the cash requirements to service interest or principal payments on our indebtedness, and free cash flow does not reflect the cash requirements to service principal payments on our indebtedness; 

41 

Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin do not reflect income tax (benefit) provision we are required to make; and 

 Free cash flow and free cash flow conversion do not represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary purposes and does not reflect our future contractual commitments. 

 Adjusted EBITDA is not a liquidity measure and should not be considered as discretionary cash available to us to reinvest in the growth of our business or to distribute to stockholders or as a measure of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations. To properly and prudently evaluate our business, we encourage investors to review the financial statements included elsewhere in this report, and not rely on a single financial measure to evaluate our business. We also strongly urge investors to review the reconciliation of net earnings (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA, the computation of Adjusted EBITDA margin as compared to net earnings (loss) margin which is net earnings (loss) as a percentage of revenue, the reconciliation of net cash provided by (used in) operating activities to free cash flow, and the computation of free cash flow conversion as compared to operating cash flow conversion, which is net cash provided by (used in) operating activities as a percentage of net earnings (loss) in each case set forth below. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net earnings (loss) excluding income tax (benefit) provision, interest (income) expense, net, depreciation and amortization expense, stock-based compensation expense, employer costs related to stock-based compensation, foreign exchange (gain) loss, changes in fair value of contingent earn-out liability, interest rate swaps and investments in equity securities, transaction and other costs, litigation costs net of insurance reimbursements that arise outside of the ordinary course of business, tax receivable agreement liability remeasurement (benefit) expense, impairment loss, and restructuring costs. Adjusted EBITDA margin represents Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue. 

 42 

We define free cash flow as net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less capital expenditures. Free cash flow conversion represents free cash flow as a percentage of Adjusted EBITDA. Operating cash flow conversion represents net cash provided by (used in) operating activities as a percentage of net earnings (loss).

Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview As of September 30, 2024, we had 252.1 million of cash and cash equivalents, a decrease of 103.6 million from December 31, 2023 primarily due to share repurchases and the acquisition of Geneva, partially offset by cash generated from operations. Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations. Our primary uses of liquidity are operating expenses and capital expenditures, acquisition of businesses, funding of our debt obligations, partnership tax distributions, paying income taxes and obligations under our tax receivable agreement and effectuating share repurchases as discussed below. Based on current conditions, we believe that we have sufficient financial resources to fund our activities and execute our business plans during the next twelve months. In May 2023, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program of up to 150.0 million of our outstanding Class A common stock with repurchases under the program to be made on a discretionary basis from time to time, subject to general business and market conditions and other investment opportunities, through open market purchases or other means, including privately negotiated transactions. We announced increases in the share repurchase program authorized amount from 150.0 million to 300.0 million in November 2023 and from 300.0 million to 450.0 million in May 2024. This repurchase program may be commenced, suspended or discontinued at any time. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 14.2 million shares of Class A common stock for 89.7 million, excluding excise tax obligations. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 19.5 million shares of Class A common stock and 2.0 million Common Units for 174.1 million, excluding excise tax obligations. In addition, in October 2024, we repurchased an additional 4.4 million shares of Class A common stock pursuant to a trading plan under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, in the amount of 30.0 million, excluding excise tax obligations. There were no share repurchases during the three months ended September 30, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we repurchased 1.3 million shares of Class A common stock for 20.9 million. As of October 31, 2024, a total of 89.0 million remained available for repurchase under the repurchase program, subject to an approximately 3.1 million share repurchase limit which may be increased pursuant to authorization from the Company s Board of Directors. On February 27, 2024, we announced that the Company adopted the Restructuring Plan to reduce its global workforce. The Restructuring Plan was completed in the third quarter of 2024, and we incurred approximately 20.4 million of total non-recurring charges through the third quarter of 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we made 19.1 million of cash payments in connection with the Restructuring Plan. In July 1, 2024, we completed the acquisition of Geneva for a total cash consideration of 17.5 million, net of cash acquired.

Investing activities Net cash used in investing activities was 23.6 million and 22.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company had capital expenditures of 6.2 million and 12.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. In addition, the Company paid 17.4 million to acquire intangible assets from Geneva, net of deferred tax liabilities of 0.5 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company used 9.8 million for the acquisition of Official, net of cash acquired. Financing activities Net cash used in financing activities was 207.7 million and 58.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company used 151.8 million for share repurchases of our Class A common stock and Bumble Holdings used 22.2 million for the repurchase of Common Units. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company used 20.9 million for share repurchases of our Class A common stock. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company used 9.6 million and 13.9 million, respectively, for shares withheld to satisfy employee tax withholding requirements upon vesting of restricted stock units and made cash distribution payments of 7.9 million and 19.3 million, respectively, to the noncontrolling interest holders. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in financing activities included 11.9 million of tax receivable agreement payments. The Company used 4.3 million in both of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 to repay a portion of the outstanding indebtedness under our Original Term Loan. Indebtedness Senior Secured Credit Facilities In connection with the Sponsor Acquisition, in January 2020, we entered into a credit agreement (the Credit Agreement providing for (i) a term loan facility in an original aggregate principal amount of 575.0 million (the Original Term Loan Facility and (ii) a revolving facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to 50.0 million. In connection with a transaction whereby we distributed proceeds to our pre-IPO owners and to partially repay a loan from our Founder, in October 2020, we entered into the Incremental Term Loan Facility (the Incremental Term Loan Facility and together with the Original Term Loan Facility, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities in an original aggregate principal amount of 275.0 million. The Incremental Term Loan provides for additional senior secured term loans with substantially identical terms as the Original Term Loan Facility (other than the applicable margin). A portion of the net proceeds from our initial public offering was used to repay 200.0 million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding indebtedness under our Term Loan Facility in the three months ended March 31, 2021. The Credit Agreement was further amended in March 2023, pursuant to which the interest rate benchmark referenced to LIBOR was transitioned to SOFR. The borrower under the Credit Agreement is a wholly owned subsidiary of Bumble Holdings, Buzz Finco L.L.C. (the Borrower ). The Credit Agreement contains affirmative and negative covenants and customary events of default. Borrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate equal to, at the Borrower s option, either (i) LIBOR prior to March 31, 2023 and Adjusted Term SOFR beginning March 31, 2023 for the relevant interest period, adjusted for statutory reserve requirements (subject to a floor of 0.0 on the Original Term Loan and 0.50 on the Incremental Term Loan), plus an applicable margin or (ii) a base rate equal to the highest of (a) the rate of interest in effect as last quoted by the Wall Street Journal as the Prime Rate in the United States, (b) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50 and (c) adjusted LIBOR prior to April 1, 2023 and Adjusted Term SOFR beginning April 1, 2023, for an interest period of one month plus 1.00 (subject to a floor of 0.00 per annum), in each case, plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin for loans under the Revolving Credit Facility is subject to adjustment based upon the consolidated first lien net leverage ratio of the Borrower and its restricted subsidiaries and is subject to reduction after the consummation of our initial public offering. In addition to paying interest on the outstanding principal under the Credit Agreement, the Borrower is required to pay a commitment fee of 0.50 per annum (which is subject to a decrease to 0.375 per annum based upon the consolidated first lien net leverage ratio of the Borrower and its restricted subsidiaries) to the lenders under the Revolving Credit Facility in respect of the unutilized commitments thereunder. The Borrower must also pay customary letter of credit fees and an annual administrative agency fee. The Original Term Loan Facility amortizes in equal quarterly installments in aggregate annual amounts equal to 1.00 of the principal amount of the Original Term Loan Facility outstanding as of the date of the closing of the Original Term Loan Facility, with the balance being payable at maturity on January 29, 2027. The Incremental Term Loan Facility amortizes in equal quarterly installments in aggregate annual amounts equal to 1.00 of the principal amount of the Incremental Term Loan Facility outstanding as of the date of the closing of the Incremental Term Loan Facility, with the balance being payable at maturity on January 29, 2027. Following the 200.0 million aggregate principal payment of outstanding indebtedness during the three months ended March 31, 2021, quarterly installment payments on the Incremental Term Loan Facility are no longer required for the remaining term of the facility. Principal amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility are due and payable in full at maturity on January 29,

(1) We have contractual obligations with various third parties. In May 2023, we amended an agreement with one of our third parties related to cloud services, which superseded and replaced the September 2022 agreement. Under the amended terms, we are committed to pay a minimum of 12.0 million over the period of 18 months from May 2023. If at the end of the 18 months, or upon early termination, we have not reached the 12.0 million in spend, we will be required to pay for the difference between the sum of fees already incurred and the minimum commitment. As of September 30, 2024, our minimum commitment remaining with this third party is 2.6 million. Additionally, we have the following contractual obligations not reflected in the table set forth above: In connection with the IPO, in February 2021, we entered into a tax receivable agreement with certain of our pre-IPO owners that provides for the payment by the Company to such pre-IPO owners of 85 of the benefits that the Company realizes, or is deemed to realize, as a result of the Company s allocable share of existing tax basis acquired in our IPO and other tax benefits related to entering into the tax receivable agreement. The payments under the tax receivable agreement are not conditioned upon continued ownership of the Company by the pre-IPO owners. The payments that we may be required to make under the tax receivable agreement to the pre-IPO owners may be significant and are not reflected in the contractual obligations table set forth above as they are dependent upon future taxable income. Assuming no material changes in the relevant tax law, and that we earn sufficient taxable income to realize all tax benefits that are subject to the tax receivable agreement, we expect future payments under the tax receivable agreement related to the Offering Transactions and subsequent activity through September 30, 2024 to aggregate to 703.4 million and to range over the next 15 years from approximately 5.6 million to 77.2 million per year and decline thereafter. In determining these estimated future payments, we have given retrospective effect to certain exchanges of Common Units for Class A shares that occurred after the IPO but were contemplated to have occurred pursuant to the Blocker Restructuring. The foregoing numbers are merely estimates, and the actual payments could differ materially. See Note 4, Payable to Related Parties Pursuant to a Tax Receivable Agreement , for additional information. In connection with the Sponsor Acquisition in January 2020, we entered into a contingent consideration arrangement, consisting of an earn-out payment to the former shareholders of Worldwide Vision Limited of up to 150.0 million. The timing and amount of such payments, that we may be required to make, is not reflected in the contractual obligations table set forth above as the payment to the former shareholders of Worldwide Vision Limited is dependent upon the achievement of a specified return on invested capital by our Sponsor. See Note 11, Fair Value Measurements , in our 2023 Form 10-K for additional information. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates We have discussed the estimates and assumptions that we believe are critical because they involve a higher degree of judgment in their application and are based on information that is inherently uncertain in our 2023 Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. There have been no significant changes to these accounting policies and estimates for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Related Party Transactions For discussions of related party transactions, see Note 12, Related Party Transactions, to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 - Financial Statements (Unaudited).

Item 3 . Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk We conduct business in certain foreign markets, primarily in the United Kingdom and the European Union. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, revenue outside of the United States accounted for 52.9 and 47.9 of consolidated revenue, respectively. Revenue outside of the United States accounted for 51.4 and 46.8 of combined revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our primary exposure to foreign currency exchange risk is the underlying user s functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar, primarily the British Pound and Euro. As foreign currency exchange rates change, translation of the statements of operations of our international businesses into U.S. dollars affects year-over-year comparability of operating results. The average Euro versus the U.S. Dollar exchange rate was 0.9 and 0.3 higher in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The average British Pound versus the U.S. Dollar exchange rate was 2.7 and 2.6 higher in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Historically, we have not hedged any foreign currency exposures. We have performed a sensitivity analysis as of September 30, 2024 and 2023. A hypothetical 10 change in British Pound and Euro, relative to the U.S. Dollar, would have changed revenue by 19.1 million and 6.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, with all other variables held constant. This accounts for 2.4 and 0.8 of total revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our continued international expansion increases our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations and as a result such fluctuations could have a significant impact on our future results of operations. Interest Rate Risk At September 30, 2024, we had debt outstanding with a carrying value of 618.0 million. With consideration of the financial impact of our interest rate swaps, a hypothetical interest rate increase of 1 would have increased interest expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 by 0.7 million and 2.1 million, respectively, based upon the outstanding debt balances and interest rates in effect during that period. Borrowings under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities bear interest at a variable market rate. In order to reduce the financial impact of increases in interest rates, the Company entered into two interest rate swaps for a total notional amount of 350.0 million on June 22, 2020, which were set to expire on June 30, 2024. In January 2024, we replaced these interest rate swaps and entered into new interest rate swaps for the same notional value of 350.0 million to extend the expiration from June 2024 to January 2027. The financial impact of the interest rate swaps is to fix the variable interest rate element on 350.0 million of the long-term debt at a rate of 3.18 . See Note 9, Debt , within the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. Item 4 . Controls and Procedures. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company completed its implementation of a new enterprise resource planning ERP system. The new ERP system integrates various financial and operational processes to enhance accuracy, efficiency, and internal controls. A standardized internal control framework was used during implementation and monitoring controls have been established. Management will continue to assess and monitor the new ERP system to ensure the ongoing effectiveness of internal controls. Other than the ERP system implementation, there have been no material changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

The Company announced increases in the share repurchase program authorized amount from 150.0 million to 300.0 million in November 2023 and from 300.0 million to 450.0 million in May 2024.
