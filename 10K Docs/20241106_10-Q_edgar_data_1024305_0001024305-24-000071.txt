 OVERVIEW 
 We are one of the world s largest beauty companies, with an iconic portfolio of brands across fragrance, color cosmetics, skincare, and body care. Our brands empower people to express themselves freely, creating their own visions of beauty and we are committed to making a positive impact on the planet. Our strategic priorities include stabilizing and growing our Consumer Beauty brands through leading innovation and improved execution, accelerating our Prestige fragrance business and ongoing expansion into Prestige cosmetics, building a comprehensive skincare portfolio over the mid-to-long term leveraging existing brands, enhancing our organizational growth capabilities including digital and research and development, expanding our presence in growth channels such as the Travel Retail channel, in China and other growth engine markets (Latin America, including Brazil, the Middle East, North and South East Asia, Africa, and India), and establishing Coty as an industry leader in sustainability.

 We have been making progress on our strategic priorities. In Consumer Beauty, we have implemented the relaunch of our top brands. We are now focusing on accelerating our digital advocacy strategy to amplify our brand and product innovations and leveraging consumer analytics and insights to improve the return on investment of our marketing activities. In Prestige, we are accelerating our fragrance business with exceptional new launches and expanding our premium and ultra-premium categories, while also enhancing the assortment of our Prestige cosmetic products. We are continuing to thoughtfully expand our skincare portfolio (which contributed a low single digit percentage of our first quarter fiscal 2025 net revenue), with our focus on winning over the most discerning skin care consumers in our areas of excellence UV protection and photoaging prevention and repair, biotech-enhanced longevity science, and micro-dose formulations. We have successfully expanded our e-commerce capabilities, through best-in-class online launches, our digital advocacy strategy and active participation in key online shopping events, and increasing digital media competitiveness. 
 Our products are sold in approximately 121 countries and territories. As a geographically diverse company we are susceptible to global economic trends, geopolitical conflicts, domestic and foreign governmental policies, and changes in foreign exchange rates. In particular, economic conditions in China have had, and are expected to continue to have, an impact on our strategic initiatives, including our growth agenda in the region for Prestige products and our skincare growth priorities. Within the China market we continue to monitor and take actions to address the impact to our Consumer Beauty brands which have experienced sales declines as retailers and distributors continue to deplete their existing inventory. We remain attentive to economic and geopolitical conditions that may materially impact our business. 
 Changing market trends may impact sales of our products across and within product categories and regions. Tight order and inventory management by retailers in the first quarter has resulted in our sell-in tracking well below sell-out in a number of markets, including in the U.S. This trend was also present in Australia, China and Travel Retail Asia as well, each of which account for a low single digit percentage of our business. Also, Travel Retail Asia's sales were negatively impacted by the impact of regulatory restrictions in Asia reducing daigou (surrogate shopping) purchases. Within our Consumer Beauty segment, first quarter sales volume was impacted by negative market trends in the U.S. in the mass color cosmetics category. In addition, competitive pricing action within the body care category in Brazil negatively impacted the segment's sales volumes during the first quarter. 
 We expect that our net revenue for fiscal year 2025 will grow in the low to mid-single digits versus the prior year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and the early termination of the Lacoste fragrance license. We anticipate that our annual gross margin will remain in the mid-sixties, providing us with opportunities to fund new product initiatives and support our brands through advertising and consumer promotional investments. In anticipation of a more uncertain demand backdrop, including cautious retailer behavior and a complex macroeconomic environment, we are re-accelerating our cost reduction efforts across to deliver savings well above approximately 75.0. We continue to target advertising and consumer promotional spending in the high-twenties percentage of net revenues. However, our level of advertising and consumer promotional spending will depend on various factors, including seasonality, the timing of product launches, and budgetary considerations.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 To supplement the financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, we use non-GAAP financial measures for continuing operations and Coty Inc. including Adjusted operating income (loss), Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted net income (loss), and Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to Coty Inc. to common stockholders (collectively, the Adjusted Performance Measures ). The reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP are shown in tables below. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for or superior to, financial measures reported in accordance with GAAP. Moreover, these non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all the items associated with the operations of the business as determined in accordance with GAAP. Other companies, including companies in the beauty industry, may calculate similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes. 
 Despite the limitations of these non-GAAP financial measures, our management uses the Adjusted Performance Measures as key metrics in the evaluation of our performance and annual budgets and to benchmark performance of our business against our competitors. The following are examples of how these Adjusted Performance Measures are utilized by our management: 
 strategic plans and annual budgets are prepared using the Adjusted Performance Measures; 
 senior management receives a monthly analysis comparing budget to actual operating results that is prepared using the Adjusted Performance Measures; and 
 senior management s annual compensation is calculated, in part, by using some of the Adjusted Performance Measures. 
 In addition, our financial covenant compliance calculations under our debt agreements are substantially derived from these Adjusted Performance Measures. 
 Our management believes that Adjusted Performance Measures are useful to investors in their assessment of our operating performance and the valuation of the Company. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures address questions we routinely receive from analysts and investors and, in order to ensure that all investors have access to the same data, our management has determined that it is appropriate to make this data available to all investors. The Adjusted Performance Measures exclude the impact of certain items (as further described below) and provide supplemental information regarding our operating performance. By disclosing these non-GAAP financial measures, our management intends to provide investors with a supplemental comparison of our operating results and trends for the periods presented. Our management believes these measures are also useful to investors as such measures allow investors to evaluate our performance using the same metrics that our management uses to evaluate past performance and prospects for future performance. We provide disclosure of the effects of these non-GAAP financial measures by presenting the corresponding measure prepared in conformity with GAAP in our financial statements, and by providing a reconciliation to the corresponding GAAP measure so that investors may understand the adjustments made in arriving at the non-GAAP financial measures and use the information to perform their own analyses. 
 Adjusted operating income/Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations excludes restructuring costs and business structure realignment programs, amortization, acquisition- and divestiture-related costs and acquisition accounting impacts, stock-based compensation, and asset impairment charges and other adjustments as described below. For adjusted EBITDA, in addition to the preceding, we exclude adjusted depreciation as defined below. We do not consider these items to be reflective of our core operating performance due to the variability of such items from period-to-period in terms of size, nature and significance. They are primarily incurred to realign our operating structure and integrate new acquisitions, and implement divestitures of components of our business, and fluctuate based on specific facts and circumstances. Additionally, Adjusted net income attributable to Coty Inc. and Adjusted net income attributable to Coty Inc. per common share are adjusted for certain interest and other (income) expense items and preferred stock deemed dividends, as described below, and the related tax effects of each of the items used to derive Adjusted net income as such charges are not used by our management in assessing our operating performance period-to-period. 
 36 

Table of Contents 

 Adjusted Performance Measures reflect adjustments based on the following items: 
 Costs related to acquisition and divestiture activities: We have excluded acquisition- and divestiture-related costs and the accounting impacts such as those related to transaction costs and costs associated with the revaluation of acquired inventory in connection with business combinations because these costs are unique to each transaction. Additionally, for divestitures, we exclude write-offs of assets that are no longer recoverable and contract related costs due to the divestiture. The nature and amount of such costs vary significantly based on the size and timing of the acquisitions and divestitures, and the maturities of the businesses being acquired or divested. Also, the size, complexity and/or volume of past transactions, which often drives the magnitude of such expenses, may not be indicative of the size, complexity and/or volume of any future acquisitions or divestitures. 
 Restructuring and other business realignment costs: We have excluded costs associated with restructuring and business structure realignment programs to allow for comparable financial results to historical operations and forward-looking guidance. In addition, the nature and amount of such charges vary significantly based on the size and timing of the programs. By excluding the referenced expenses from our non-GAAP financial measures, our management is able to further evaluate our ability to utilize existing assets and estimate their long-term value. Furthermore, our management believes that the adjustment of these items supplements the GAAP information with a measure that can be used to assess the sustainability of our operating performance. 
 Asset impairment charges: We have excluded the impact of asset impairments as such non-cash amounts are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the timing and/or size of acquisitions. Our management believes that the adjustment of these items supplements the GAAP information with a measure that can be used to assess the sustainability of our operating performance. 
 Amortization expense: We have excluded the impact of amortization of finite-lived intangible assets, as such non-cash amounts are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the timing and/or size of acquisitions. Our management believes that the adjustment of these items supplements the GAAP information with a measure that can be used to assess the sustainability of our operating performance. Although we exclude amortization of intangible assets from our non-GAAP expenses, our management believes that it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets contribute to revenue generation. Amortization of intangible assets that relate to past acquisitions will recur in future periods until such intangible assets have been fully amortized. Any future acquisitions may result in the amortization of additional intangible assets. 
 Gain on sale and early license termination: We have excluded the impact of gain on sale and early license termination as such amounts are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the size of the sale and early license termination. 
 Costs related to market exit: We have excluded the impact of direct incremental costs related to our decision to wind down our business operations in Russia. We believe that these direct and incremental costs are inconsistent and infrequent in nature. Consequently, our management believes that the adjustment of these items supplements the GAAP information with a measure that can be used to assess the sustainability of our operating performance. 
 Gains on sale of real estate: We have excluded the impact of gains on sale of real estate as such amounts are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the size of the sale. Our management believes that the adjustment of these items supplements the GAAP information with a measure that can be used to assess the sustainability of our operating performance. 
 Stock-based compensation: Although stock-based compensation is a key incentive offered to our employees, we have excluded the effect of these expenses from the calculation of adjusted operating income and adjusted EBITDA. This is due to their primarily non-cash nature; in addition, the amount and timing of these expenses may be highly variable and unpredictable, which may negatively affect comparability between periods. 
 Depreciation and Adjusted depreciation: Our adjusted operating income excludes the impact of accelerated depreciation for certain restructuring projects that affect the expected useful lives of Property, Plant and Equipment, as such charges vary significantly based on the size and timing of the programs. Further, we have excluded adjusted depreciation, which represents depreciation expense net of accelerated depreciation charges, from our adjusted EBITDA. Our management believes that the adjustment of these items supplements the GAAP information with a measure that can be used to assess the sustainability of our operating performance. 
 Other (income) expense: We have excluded the impact of pension curtailment (gains) and losses and pension settlements as such events are triggered by our restructuring and other business realignment activities and the amount of such charges vary significantly based on the size and timing of the programs. Further, we have excluded the change in fair value of the investment in Wella, as well as expenses related to potential or actual sales transactions reducing equity investments, as our management believes these unrealized (gains) and losses do not reflect our underlying 
 37 

Table of Contents 

 ongoing business, and the adjustment of such impact helps investors and others compare and analyze performance from period to period. Such transactions do not reflect our operating results and we have excluded the impact as our management believes that the adjustment of these items supplements the GAAP information with a measure that can be used to assess the sustainability of our operating performance. 
 Noncontrolling interest: This adjustment represents the after-tax impact of the non-GAAP adjustments included in Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests based on the relevant noncontrolling interest percentage. 
 Tax: This adjustment represents the impact of the tax effect of the pretax items excluded from Adjusted net income. The tax impact of the non-GAAP adjustments is based on the tax rates related to the jurisdiction in which the adjusted items are received or incurred. Additionally, adjustments are made for the tax impact of any intra-entity transfer of assets and liabilities. 
 Constant Currency 
 We operate on a global basis, with the majority of our net revenues generated outside of the U.S. Accordingly, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can affect our results of operations. Therefore, to supplement financial results presented in accordance with GAAP, certain financial information is presented in constant currency , excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange translations to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange translations. Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period-over-period. We calculate constant currency information by translating current and prior-period results for entities reporting in currencies other than U.S. dollars into U.S. dollars using prior year foreign currency exchange rates. The constant currency calculations do not adjust for the impact of revaluing specific transactions denominated in a currency that is different to the functional currency of that entity when exchange rates fluctuate. The constant currency information we present may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. 
 Basis of Presentation of Acquisitions, Divestitures, Terminations and Market Exit from Russia 
 During the period when we complete an acquisition, divestiture, early license termination, or market exit, the financial results of the current year period are not comparable to the financial results presented in the prior year period. When explaining such changes from period to period and to maintain a consistent basis between periods, we exclude the financial contribution of: (i) the acquired brands or businesses in the current year period until we have twelve months of comparable financial results, and (ii) the divested brands or businesses or early terminated brands or markets exited in the prior year period, to maintain comparable financial results with the current fiscal year period. Acquisitions, divestitures, early license terminations, and market exits that would impact the comparability of financial results between periods presented in the Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are shown in the table below. 
 Period of acquisition, divestiture, termination Acquisition, divestiture, termination Impact on basis of first quarter 2025/2024 presentation Third quarter fiscal 2024 Termination: Lacoste First quarter fiscal 2024 net revenue excluded. 
 
 THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 AS COMPARED TO THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2023 
 NET REVENUES 
 In the three months ended September 30, 2024, net revenues increased 2 , or 30.1, to 1,671.5 from 1,641.4 in the three months ended September 30, 2023. Excluding net revenue from the first quarter of the prior period from Lacoste, net revenues increased 3 or 52.9 to 1,671.5 from 1,618.6 in the three months ended September 30, 2023, reflecting a positive price and mix impact of 5 (primarily due to positive pricing impact as a result of prior period price increases and in line with the overall premiumization strategy), partially offset by a decrease in unit volume of 1 (primarily due to color cosmetics in the United States as a result of ongoing retailer caution and negative market trends) and negative foreign currency exchange translation impact of 1 . The overall increase in net revenues reflects growth of prestige and mass fragrances, as a result of innovation from new launches including Gucci Flora Gorgeous Orchid, Burberry Goddess Intense, Chloe Signature Intense, Boss Bottled Absolu . The increase in net revenues was partially offset by negative performance in the color cosmetics category and certain brands in the body care category in Brazil. 
 The overall increase in net revenues reflects the continued success of our pricing and revenue management strategies, including the implementation of price increases across our product portfolio in the prior period. The overall increase in net revenues related to pricing is partially offset by volume declines primarily related to the Consumer Beauty product portfolio, specifically from Monange and the color cosmetics category.

 Digital and e-commerce channel sales growth also contributed to the increase in net revenues.

 Prestige 
 In the three months ended September 30, 2024, net revenues from the Prestige segment increased 5 , or 49.4 to 1,114.1 compared to 1,064.7 in the three months ended September 30, 2023. Excluding net revenue from the first quarter of the prior period from Lacoste, net revenues from the Prestige segment increased 7 or 72.2 to 1,114.1 from 1,041.9 in the three months ended September 30, 2023, reflecting a positive price and mix impact of 5 (primarily due to the positive pricing impact as a result of price increases in the prior period, in line with the overall premiumization strategy), and an increase in unit volume of 2 (primarily due to innovation in prestige fragrance). The increase in net revenues primarily reflects: 
 
 Prestige fragrance sales growth of 83.2, due to successful performance of Burberry , Chloe , and Hugo Boss from existing fragrance lines. In addition, continued brand innovation such as Gucci Flora Gorgeous Orchid , Burberry Goddess Intense , Chloe Signature Intense , and Boss Bottled Absolu contributed to the category sales growth . The category sales growth can also be attributed to positive market trends in most major markets. 
 These increases were partially offset by: 
 Prestige cosmetics and skincare declines of 6.0 and 5.0, respectively. 
 Consumer Beauty 
 In the three months ended September 30, 2024, net revenues from the Consumer Beauty segment decreased 3 , or 19.3, to 557.4 from 576.7 in the three months ended September 30, 2023, reflecting a negative foreign currency exchange translation impact of 3 , a decrease in unit volume of 1 (primarily due to color cosmetics brands in the United States), partially offset by a positive price and mix impact of 1 (primarily due to positive pricing impact as a result of price increases in the prior period). The decrease in net revenues primarily reflects: 
 Color cosmetics sales decline of 29.7, primarily due to negative market trends in the color cosmetics market in the United States which impacted net revenues from Covergirl and through increased returns and markdowns compared to the prior period. Sally Hansen also declined despite gaining market share in the current period; and 
 Mass bodycare decline of 15.8, primarily due to declines in sales volumes from Monange in Brazil. The decline can also be attributed to continued lower sales volumes for adidas as a result of category slowdown in China which resulted in higher trade inventory levels. 
 These decreases were partially offset by: 
 Mass fragrance sales growth of 23.1, due to brand innovation and geographical expansion of existing products into growth-engine markets; and 
 Mass skincare growth of 3.1. 
 
 COST OF SALES 
 In the three months ended September 30, 2024, cost of sales decreased 4 , or 22.6, to 576.9 from 599.5 in the three months ended September 30, 2023. Cost of sales as a percentage of net revenues decreased to 34.5 in the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 36.5 in the three months ended September 30, 2023, resulting in a gross margin increase of approximately 200 basis points, primarily reflecting: 
 (i) approximately 110 basis points related to a decrease in manufacturing and material costs as a percentage of net revenues, driven by increased manufacturing efficiencies, improvements in productivity, as well as procurement and material cost optimization; and 
 (ii) approximately 80 basis points related to decreased excess and obsolescence costs primarily associated with the Prestige product portfolio.

 The above reflects a positive impact from pricing net of inflation of approximately 130 basis points. 
 
 SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES 
 In the three months ended September 30, 2024, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 5 , or 40.6, to 808.0 from 767.4 in the three months ended September 30, 2023. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues increased to 48.3 in the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 46.8 in the three months ended September 30, 2023, or approximately 150 basis points. This increase primarily reflects: 
 (i) 110 basis points due to an increase in administrative costs as a percentage of net revenues due to higher compensation expense from increased headcount; 
 (ii) 40 basis points due to an increase in advertising and consumer promotional costs as a percentage of net revenues primarily due to increases in in-store merchandising execution and education, partially offset by declines in working media investment as a percentage of net revenues; 
 (iii) 40 basis points due to unfavorable transactional impact from our exposure to foreign currency as a percentage of net revenues; and 
 (iv) 40 basis points due to other miscellaneous operating expenses. 
 These increases were partially offset by the following decrease: 
 (i) 80 basis points due to a decrease in stock-based compensation cost primarily related to a reduction in expense recognized in connection with awards granted to the CEO. 
 
 OPERATING INCOME 
 In the three months ended September 30, 2024, operating income was 237.8 compared to income of 197.5 in the three months ended September 30, 2023. Operating income as a percentage of net revenues, increased to 14.2 in the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 12.0 in the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in operating margin is primarily driven by a decrease in cost of goods sold as a percentage of net revenues (approximately 200 basis points), a decrease in restructuring costs as a percentage of net revenues (approximately 170 basis points), a decrease in stock-based compensation expense (approximately 80 basis points) primarily related to a reduction in expense recognized in connection with a prior year's grant made to the CEO, partially offset by an increase in fixed costs as a percentage of net revenues (approximately 100 basis points) primarily related to people costs, an increase in advertising and consumer promotional costs as a percentage of net revenues (approximately 40 basis points), an increase in losses from our exposure to foreign currency (approximately 40 basis points), and an increase in expense related to other miscellaneous operating expenses (approximately 40 basis points). Our consolidated operating income margin was negatively impacted by a greater proportion of net revenues generated by the lower margin brands from our Brazilian business, and lower sales of the higher margin color cosmetics in the United States compared to the prior year.

 In the three months ended September 30, 2024, operating income for Prestige was 241.5 compared to income of 221.6 in the three months ended September 30, 2023. Operating margin increased to 21.7 of net revenues in the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 20.8 in the three months ended September 30, 2023, driven by a decrease in cost of goods sold as a percentage of net revenues (approximately 260 basis points), a decrease in amortization expense as a percentage of net revenues (approximately 20 basis points), partially offset by an increase in fixed costs as a percentage of net revenues (approximately 100 basis points) primarily related to people costs, an increase in losses from our exposure to foreign currency (approximately 80 basis points), and an increase in advertising and consumer promotional costs as a percentage of net revenues (approximately 20 basis points).

 Consumer Beauty 
 In the three months ended September 30, 2024, operating income for Consumer Beauty was 14.0 compared to income of 32.0 in the three months ended September 30, 2023. Operating margin decreased to 2.5 of net revenues in the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 5.5 in the three months ended September 30, 2023, driven by an increase in advertising and consumer promotional costs as a percentage of net revenues (approximately 120 basis points), an increase in fixed costs as a percentage of net revenues (approximately 110 basis points), an increase in losses from our exposure to foreign currency (approximately 80 basis points). Our Consumer Beauty operating income margin was negatively impacted by a greater proportion of Consumer Beauty net revenues generated by the lower margin brands from our Brazilian business, and lower sales by the higher margin color cosmetics brands in the United States compared to the prior year. 
 Corporate 
 Corporate primarily includes income and expenses not directly relating to our operating activities. These items are included in Corporate since we consider them to be Corporate responsibilities, and these items are not used by our management to measure the underlying performance of the segments. 
 In the three months ended September 30, 2024, the operating loss for Corporate was 17.7 compared to a loss of 56.1 in the three months ended September 30, 2023, as described under Adjusted Operating Income for Coty Inc. below. The decrease in the operating loss for Corporate was primarily driven by a 27.7 decrease in restructuring costs and a 12.7 decrease in stock-based compensation expense.

 Restructuring and Other Business Realignment Costs 
 In the three months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred a credit in restructuring and other business structure realignment costs of 0.7, primarily related to the Current Restructuring Actions, included in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
 In the three months ended September 30, 2023, we incurred restructuring and other business structure realignment costs of 27.3 as follows:

 In the three months ended September 30, 2024, stock-based compensation was 17.0 as compared with 29.7 in the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in stock-based compensation is primarily related to a reduction in expense recognized in connection with awards granted to the CEO. 
 Gain on Sale of Real Estate

 In the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized a gain of 1.7 related to sale of real estate.

 INTEREST EXPENSE, NET 
 In the three months ended September 30, 2024, net interest expense was 61.8 as compared with 69.8 in the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in interest expense is primarily due to lower debt balances in the current period as well as lower interest rates.

 In the three months ended September 30, 2024, other expense was 43.3 as compared with other expense of 76.6 in the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Other expense of 43.3 in the three months ended September 30, 2024 was principally comprised of net losses on forward repurchase contracts of 42.1. 
 Other expense of 76.6 in the three months ended September 30, 2023 was principally comprised of net losses on forward repurchase contracts of 75.7 and deferred financing fees of 5.2, partially offset by a favorable adjustment for the unrealized gain in the Wella investment of 4.0. 
 The decrease in Other expense of 33.3 is primarily due to lower net losses on forward repurchase contracts of 33.6 compared to the prior year period.

 INCOME TAXES 
 The effective income tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 31.7 and 80.0 , respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to the impact of a higher effective tax rate in the prior year period related to the revaluation of the Company's deferred tax liabilities due to a tax rate increase enacted in Switzerland resulting in an expense of 24.3. The effective tax rate of 31.7 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was higher than the Federal statutory rate of 21 primarily due to the limitation on the deductibility of executive stock compensation and the limitation on the deductibility of interest expense. 
 The effective tax rate of 80.0 in the three months ended September 30, 2023, was higher than the Federal statutory rate of 21 primarily due to an expense of 24.3 recognized on the revaluation of the Company's deferred tax liabilities due to a tax rate increase enacted in Switzerland as well as the limitation on the deductibility of executive stock compensation. 
 The effective income tax rates vary from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21 due to the effect of (i) jurisdictions with different statutory rates, including impacts of rate changes, (ii) adjustments to the Company s unrealized tax benefits UTBs and accrued interest, (iii) non-deductible expenses, (iv) audit settlements and (v) valuation allowance changes. Our effective tax rate could fluctuate significantly and could be adversely affected to the extent earnings are lower than anticipated in countries that have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries that have higher statutory rates.

 (b) The tax effects of each of the items included in adjusted income are calculated in a manner that results in a corresponding income tax expense/provision for adjusted income. In preparing the calculation, each adjustment to reported income is first analyzed to determine if the adjustment has an income tax consequence. The provision for taxes is then calculated based on the jurisdiction in which the adjusted items are incurred, multiplied by the respective statutory rates and offset by the increase or reversal of any valuation allowances commensurate with the non-GAAP measure of profitability. 
 (c) The amount represents the unrealized (gain) loss recognized for the change in fair value of the investment in Wella. 
 (d) For the three months ended September 30, 2024, this primarily represents recovery of previously written-off non-income tax credits and the amortization of basis differences in certain equity method investments. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, this primarily represents divestiture-related costs related to our equity investments and the amortization of basis differences in certain equity method investments. 
 The adjusted effective tax rate was 28.9 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 43.7 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The differences were primarily due to an expense of 24.3 recognized in the prior period on the revaluation of the Company's deferred tax liabilities due to a tax rate increase enacted in Switzerland. 
 
 NET INCOME (LOSS) ATTRIBUTABLE TO COTY INC. 
 Net income attributable to Coty Inc. was 82.9 in the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to net income of 1.6 in the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in the income was primarily driven by higher operating income of 40.3 in the current period and lower net losses from forward repurchase contracts of 33.6 in the current period. 
 We believe that adjusted net income attributable to Coty Inc. provides an enhanced understanding of our performance. See Overview Non-GAAP Financial Measures.

 FINANCIAL CONDITION 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Overview 
 Our primary sources of funds include cash expected to be generated from operations, borrowings from issuance of debt and lines of credit provided by banks and lenders in the U.S. and abroad. 
 Our cash flows are subject to seasonal variation throughout the year, including demands on cash made during our first fiscal quarter in anticipation of higher global sales during the second fiscal quarter and strong cash generation in the second fiscal quarter as a result of increased demand by retailers associated with the holiday season. 
 Our principal uses of cash are to fund planned operating expenditures, capital expenditures, interest payments, dividends, share repurchases, any principal payments on debt, and from time to time, acquisitions, and business structure realignment expenditures. Working capital movements are influenced by the sourcing of materials related to the manufacturing of products. 
 46 

Table of Contents 

 Cash and working capital management initiatives, including the phasing of vendor and tax payments and factoring of trade receivables from time-to-time, may also impact the timing and amount of our operating cash flows. 
 We remain focused on deleveraging our balance sheet using cash flows generated from our operations and other targeted initiatives. We continue to take steps to permanently reduce our debt to reduce interest costs and improve our long-term profitability and cash flows. Our 25.84 investment in Wella continues to give us the opportunity for further permanent debt reductions when our equity position is divested. 
 We have substantially completed the exit of our commercial activities in Russia. However, we anticipate that the process related to the liquidation of the Russian legal entity will take an extended period of time. We anticipate that we will incur future net cash costs of 10.0 to 15.0, which will be funded by our Russian subsidiary. The amount of future costs, including cash costs, will be subject to various factors, such as additional government regulation and the resolution of legal contingencies. 
 Debt Financing 
 We are in the process of deleveraging our company and improving the maturity mix of our debt, including through refinancing or repayment of a portion of our debt. We expect to continue to take actions to improve the maturity mix of our debt, including through redemptions and/or tender offers for near-dated maturities, from time to time as market conditions permit. 
 We have taken action to reduce variability in our interest payments including paying down variable interest rate debt outstanding under our 2018 Coty Term B Facility and issuing fixed rate bonds. While our revolving credit facility, which we draw on from time to time, is subject to variable interest rates, all of our long-term debt outstanding as of September 30, 2024 is fixed rate debt. 
 Share Repurchases 
 In connection with our Share Repurchase Program, we entered into forward repurchase contracts in June 2022, December 2022, and November 2023 with three large financial institutions to hedge for 200.0, and a potential 196.0 and 294.0 of share repurchases in 2024, 2025 and 2026, respectively. We physically settled the June 2022 forward repurchase contracts by delivering approximately 200.0 cash in exchange for 27.0 million shares of our Class A Common Stock during fiscal 2024. 
 Our remaining forward repurchase contracts permit a net cash settlement alternative in addition to the physical settlement. We may elect net cash settlement of all, or some of the remaining forward repurchase contracts based on factors such as timing, the market value of the underlying shares at the settlement date and other internal cash management considerations. We will continue to incur costs associated with the remaining forward repurchase contracts before settlement. Cash costs incurred in the current fiscal year to date for all forward repurchase contracts amounted to 6.7. 
 Our forward repurchase contracts include a provision for a potential true-up in cash upon specified changes in the price of Coty s Class A shares relative to the counterparties initial purchase price Hedge Valuation Adjustment ). After the September 30, 2024 balance sheet date, the price of Coty s Class A shares declined resulting in an increase in the liability to the counterparties to our forward repurchase contracts. The cash settlement liability under our outstanding forward repurchase contracts, based on Coty s share price as of November 4, 2024 totaled approximately 135.0, a 91.0 increase from September 30, 2024. The share price decline also resulted in a potential Hedge Valuation Adjustment event under the forward repurchase contracts maturing in 2026, with a corresponding potential cash true-up obligation. In November 2024, we entered into agreements with the applicable counterparties for a temporary contractual amendment to the Hedge Valuation Adjustment mechanism, which is effective from October 2024 through February 2025. This amendment does not apply to our forward repurchase contracts maturing in 2025. Declines in Coty s stock price that result in a Hedge Valuation Adjustment event for the 2025 and/or 2026 forward repurchase contracts can trigger related cash true-up payments to the counterparties. See Footnote 13 Equity for additional information on the Company's forward repurchase contracts. 
 Factoring of Receivables 
 From time to time, we supplement the timing of our cash flows through the factoring of trade receivables. In this regard, we have entered into factoring arrangements with financial institutions. 
 The net amount utilized under the factoring facilities was 191.3 and 195.3 as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively. The aggregate amount of trade receivable invoices factored on a worldwide basis amounted to 393.9 and 430.0 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

 Cash Flows Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows Data: (in millions) Net cash provided by operating activities 67.4 186.2 Net cash used in investing activities (77.3) (62.2) Net cash used in financing activities (10.4) (78.6) 
 Net cash provided by operating activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 67.4 and 186.2 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities of 118.8 was primarily the result of higher cash outflows from working capital, partially offset by higher cash-related net income. Working capital accounts were primarily impacted by higher outflows from changes in trade receivables, which was the result of net revenues phasing later in the first quarter and lower collections from factoring in the current period. Additionally, lower cash flows from changes in accounts payables and accrued expenses and other current liabilities were due to a mix of timing of spend and changes in vendor payment terms, as well as higher cash payments for interest due to a change in the timing of interest payments. Higher cash-related net income was due to higher overall first quarter net revenues from Prestige, partially offset by an increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses. 
 Net cash used in investing activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 77.3 and 62.2 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in cash used in investing activities of 15.1 was primarily due to timing of payments associated with capital expenditures. 
 Net cash used in financing activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 10.4 and 78.6, respectively. The decrease in cash used in financing activities of 68.2 was primarily driven by the impact from debt-related transactions in the first quarter of the prior year which did not reoccur in the current year and lower cash outflows for deferred financing costs. 
 Dividends 
 On April 29, 2020, the Board of Directors suspended the payment of dividends on Common Stock. As previously disclosed, we expect to suspend the payment of dividends until we approach a Net debt to Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization Adjusted EBITDA target of 2x. We expect to consider any future resumption of dividends in line with that target while continuing to pursue our deleveraging agenda and implementing our strategic initiatives. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors. 
 Dividends on the Convertible Series B Preferred Stock are payable in cash, or by increasing the amount of accrued dividends on Convertible Series B Preferred Stock, or any combination thereof, at the sole discretion of the Company. We expect to pay such dividends in cash on a quarterly basis, subject to the declaration thereof by our Board of Directors. The terms of the Convertible Series B Preferred Stock restrict our ability to declare cash dividends on our common stock until all accrued dividends on the Convertible Series B Preferred Stock have been declared and paid in cash. 
 For additional information on our dividends, see Note 13 Equity and Convertible Preferred Stock in the notes to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

 As of September 30, 2024, there have been no material changes to the items disclosed as critical accounting policies and estimates in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II Item 7 of our Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K.

 See Note 12 Derivative Instruments for updates to our foreign currency risk management and interest rate risk management. There have been no material changes in market risk from the information provided in Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk of our Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act, that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer (the CEO and our Chief Financial Officer CFO ), evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, our CEO and CFO concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.

 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management s evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act during the first fiscal quarter that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls 
 Our management, including our CEO and CFO, believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving our objectives and are effective at the reasonable assurance level. However, our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
