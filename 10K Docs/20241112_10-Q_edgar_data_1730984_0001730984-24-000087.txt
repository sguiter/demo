 of operation, the Bank has grown to full-service banking branches, with locations in California, in Nevada, in Washington, in New Mexico and in Colorado. The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and the Bank. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. The condensed consolidated financial statements include all adjustments of a normal and recurring nature, which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position and results of operations for the periods presented. Dollar amounts presented in the consolidated financial statements and footnote tables are rounded and presented to the nearest thousands of dollars except per share amounts. If the amounts are above 1.0 million, they are rounded one decimal point, and if they are above 1.0 billion, they are rounded two decimal points. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and, therefore, do not include all information and footnotes normally included in annual financial statements prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Accordingly, these condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated audited financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year. Certain prior year information has been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. None of the reclassifications impacted consolidated net income, earnings per share or shareholders equity. Restatement of Previously Issued Consolidated Financial Statements On July 18, 2023, the audit committee of the Company s board of directors concluded that the Company s previously issued unaudited interim consolidated financial statements for the period ended March 31, 2023 and the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022, as well as for the unaudited interim periods included in that fiscal year (collectively, Restated Periods ), should no longer be relied upon because of errors related to the accounting for unrealized losses on preferred equity securities that resulted in material misstatements of noninterest income and accumulated other comprehensive income. At the time of its purchase of the preferred equity securities for investment purposes, the Company inappropriately accounted for them as AFS debt securities under Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 320 Investments-Debt Securities . As such, the changes in the fair value of these securities were not recorded as part of net income but rather as a component of shareholders equity (in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax). However, as a result of subsequent research and third-party consultation, the Company determined that the securities should instead have been accounted for under ASC Topic 321 Investments-Equity Securities . The result of this change in classification of the preferred equity securities is that the change in the fair value of the securities each quarter should have been recorded in noninterest income on the consolidated statements of income. On July 25, 2023, the Company filed amendments to its Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarterly periods ended March 31, 2023, September 30, 2022, June 30, 2022, and March 31, 2022, and its Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022, (the Original Reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ), to reflect the restatement of the Company s consolidated financial statements for the Restated Periods (the Amended Form 10-Qs and the Amended Form 10-K, collectively, the Amended Reports ). As disclosed in the Original Reports, the Company recorded the change, net of taxes, in the fair value of preferred equity securities as part of other comprehensive loss, net of taxes, under ASC Topic 320 Investments-Debt Securities rather than as part of non-interest income under ASC Topic 321 Investments-Equity Securities . In addition, various footnotes in the Amended Reports reflect the effects of these restatements.

At December 31, 2023, the Company held investment securities, of which were in an unrealized loss position for more than twelve months and were in an unrealized loss position for less than twelve months. The Company anticipates full recovery of amortized cost with respect to these securities at maturity or sooner in the event of a more favorable market interest rate environment. Allowance for credit losses on investment debt securities available-for-sale Securities that were in an unrealized loss position as of September 30, 2024 were evaluated to determine whether the decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis resulted from a credit loss or changes in required yields by investors in these types of securities, among other factors. This assessment first includes a determination of whether the Company intends to sell the security, or it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current-period credit losses. In making this assessment, management considers the nature of the security and any related government guarantees, any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, creditworthiness of the issuers/guarantors, the underlying collateral, the financial conditions and prospects of the issuer, and any adverse conditions specifically related to the security, among other factors. As of September 30, 2024, the Company expects to recover the amortized cost basis of its securities, has no present intent to sell any investment securities with unrealized losses and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell securities with unrealized losses before recovery of their amortized cost and the decline in fair value is largely attributed to changes in interest rates and other market conditions. The issuers of these securities continue to make timely principal and interest payments. allowances for credit losses have been recognized on investment debt securities AFS in an unrealized loss position, as management does not believe any of the securities are impaired due to reasons of credit quality at September 30, 2024.

Any adverse or beneficial trends will trigger a review of the loan risk rating. Each loan is assigned a risk grade based on its characteristics. Loans with low to average credit risk are assigned a lower risk grade than those with higher credit risk as determined by the individual loan characteristics.

PEB ceased originating loans under this loan program in 2017. Under this loan program, the borrower, CalCAP and the participating lender contributed funds to a loss reserve account that is held in a demand deposit account at the participating lender. The borrower s contributions to the loss reserve account are attributed to the participating lender. Losses on qualified loans are charged to this account after approval by CalCAP. Under the program, if a loan defaults, the participating lender has immediate coverage of of the loss. The participating lender must return recoveries from the borrower, less expenses, to the credit loss reserve account. The funds in the loss reserve account are the property of CalCAP; however, in the event that the participating lender leaves the program any excess funds, after all loans have been repaid or unenrolled from the program by the participating lender and provided there are no pending claims for reimbursement, the remaining excess funds are distributed to CalCAP and the participating lender based on their respective contributions to the loss reserve account. Funds contributed by the participating lender to the loss reserve account are treated as a receivable from CalCAP and evaluated for impairment quarterly.

These leases expire on various dates through 2030. The Company s leases often have an option to renew one or more times, at the Company s discretion, following the expiration of the initial term. If at lease inception, the Company considers the exercising of a renewal option to be reasonably certain, the Company will include the extended term in the calculation of the ROU asset and lease liability. The Company uses the discount rate implicit in the lease whenever this rate is readily determinable. As this rate is rarely determinable, the Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, on a collateralized basis, over a similar term.

 The Company does not record loans at fair value on a recurring basis. However, from time to time, certain loans have individual risk characteristics not consistent with a pool of loans and are individually evaluated for credit reserves. Loans for which it is probable that payment of interest and principal will not be made in accordance with the original contractual terms of the loan agreement are typically individually evaluated. The fair value of individually evaluated loans is estimated using one of several methods, including collateral value, market value of similar debt, enterprise and liquidation value and discounted cash flows. Those individually evaluated loans not requiring an allowance represent loans for which the fair value of the expected repayments or collateral exceed the recorded investments in such loans. When the fair value of the collateral is based on an observable market price or a current appraised value which uses substantially observable data, the Company records the individually evaluated loan as nonrecurring Level 2. When an appraised value is not available or management determines the fair value of the collateral is less than the appraised value or the appraised value contains a significant assumption and there is no observable market price, the Company records the individually evaluated loan as nonrecurring Level 3. The Company records foreclosed assets, or other real estate owned OREO ), at fair value on a nonrecurring basis based on the collateral value of the property. When the fair value of the collateral is based on an observable market price or a current appraised value which uses substantially observable data, the Company records the OREO as nonrecurring Level 2. When an appraised value is not available or management determines the fair value of the collateral is less than the appraised value or the appraised value contains a significant assumption, and there is no observable market price, the Company records the OREO as nonrecurring Level 3. Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process by the appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income data available. Management also incorporates assumptions regarding market trends or other relevant factors and selling and commission costs ranging from to . Such adjustments and assumptions are typically significant and result in a Level 3 classification of the inputs for determining fair value. The Company had OREO at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

 Standby letters of credit Total commitments Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses. The actual liquidity needs or the credit risk that the Company will experience will likely be lower than the contractual amount of commitments to extend credit because a significant portion of these commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon. The commitments are generally variable rate and include unfunded home equity lines of credit, commercial real estate construction loans where disbursement is made over the course of construction, commercial revolving lines of credit, and unsecured personal lines of credit. The Company s outstanding loan commitments are made using the same underwriting standards as comparable outstanding loans. The reserve associated with these commitments included in interest payable and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets was at September 30, 2024 and at December 31, 2023. Commercial Real Estate Concentrations At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, in management s judgment, a concentration of loans existed in commercial real estate related loans. The Company s commercial real estate loans are secured by owner-occupied and non-owner occupied commercial real estate and multifamily properties. Although management believes that loans within these concentrations have no more than the normal risk of collectability, a decline in the performance of the economy in general, or a decline in real estate values in the Company s primary market areas in particular, could have an adverse impact on collectability . Other Assets The Company has commitments to fund investments in LIHTC partnerships and an SBIC fund. At September 30, 2024, the remaining commitments to the LIHTC partnerships and the SBIC fund were approximately million and , respectively. At December 31, 2023, the remaining commitments to the LIHTC partnerships and the SBIC fund were approximately million and , respectively.

The Company is required to provide collateral for certain local agency deposits in the states of California, Colorado, New Mexico and Washington. At both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the FHLB had issued letters of credit on behalf of the Company totaling million, as collateral for local agency deposits.

 Our principal objective is to continue to increase shareholder value and generate consistent earnings growth by expanding our commercial banking franchise through both strategic acquisitions and organic growth. Since 2010, we have expanded our geographic footprint through ten strategic acquisitions. We believe our strategy of selectively acquiring and integrating community banks has provided us with economies of scale and improved our overall franchise efficiency. Looking forward, we expect to continue to pursue strategic acquisitions and believe our targeted market areas present us with many and varied acquisition opportunities. We are also focused on continuing to grow organically and believe the metropolitan and community markets in which we operate currently provide meaningful opportunities to expand our commercial client base and increase both interest-earning assets and market share. We believe our geographic footprint, which now includes the San Francisco Bay area, the metropolitan markets of Los Angeles, California, Las Vegas, Nevada, Seattle, Washington, and Denver, Colorado, and community markets including Albuquerque, New Mexico, and Custer, Delta, and Grand counties, Colorado, provides us with access to low cost, stable core deposits that we can use to fund commercial loan growth. We strive to provide an enhanced banking experience for our clients by providing them with a comprehensive suite of sophisticated banking products and services tailored to meet their needs, while delivering the high-quality, relationship-based client service of a community bank. At September 30, 2024, on a consolidated basis, the Company had approximately 2.6 billion in total assets, 1.9 billion in total loans, 2.1 billion in total deposits and 321.7 million in shareholders equity. We continue to focus on growing our commercial loan portfolios through acquisitions as well as organic growth. At September 30, 2024, our 1.9 billion total loan portfolio included 319.4 million, or 16.7 , of loans acquired through business combinations (all of which were recorded to their estimated fair values at the time of acquisition), and the remaining 1.6 billion, or 83.3 , consisted of loans we originated or purchased not as part of a business combination. The profitability of our operations depends primarily on our net interest income after provision for credit losses, which is the difference between interest earned on interest earning assets and interest paid on interest bearing liabilities less provision for credit losses. Our net income is also affected by other factors, including the provision for credit losses on loans, noninterest income and noninterest expense. Set forth below is a discussion of the primary factors affecting our results of operations: Net interest income. Net interest income represents interest income less interest expense. We generate interest income from interest and fees received on interest earning assets, including loans and investment securities and dividends on Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco FHLB and Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco FRB stock we own. We incur interest expense from interest paid on interest bearing liabilities, including interest bearing deposits and borrowings. To evaluate net interest income, we measure and monitor: (i) yields on our loans and other interest earning assets; (ii) the costs of our deposits and other funding sources; (iii) our net interest margin; and (iv) the regulatory risk weighting associated with our assets. Net interest margin is calculated as the annualized net interest income divided by average interest earning assets. Because noninterest bearing sources of funds, such as noninterest bearing deposits and shareholders equity, also fund interest earning assets, net interest margin reflects the benefit of these noninterest bearing sources. Changes in market interest rates, the slope of the yield curve, and interest we earn on interest earning assets or pay on interest bearing liabilities, as well as the volume and types of interest earning assets, interest bearing and noninterest bearing liabilities and shareholders equity, usually have the largest impact on changes in our net interest spread, net interest margin and net interest income during a reporting period. From March 2022 through July 2023, in response to inflation, the Federal Open Market Committee ("FOMC") of the Federal Reserve increased the target range for the federal funds rate by 525 basis points. This was followed by a 50-basis point reduction in September 2024 to a range of 4.75 to 5.00 , where it remained as of September 30, 2024. The increase in the average yield on interest-earning assets during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 reflects the lagging benefit of variable rate interest-earning assets beginning to reprice higher. Noninterest income. Noninterest income consists of, among other things: (i) service charges on loans and deposits; (ii) gain on sale of loans; (iii) gain (loss) on equity securities; and (iv) other noninterest income. Gain on sale of loans includes income (or losses) from the sale of the guaranteed portion of Small Business Administration SBA loans, capitalized loan servicing rights and other related income.

Table of Contents 
 Provision for credit losses. We have established an allowance for credit losses by charging amounts to provision for credit losses at a level required to reflect estimated credit losses in the loan and available-for sale investment securities portfolios. For loans, management considers many factors, including, among others, historical loss experience, types and amounts of loans in the portfolio and adverse situations that may affect borrowers ability to repay. See Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates - Allowance for Credit Losses for a description of the manner in which the provision for credit losses is established. For investments, the Company evaluates available-for-sale debt securities in an unrealized loss position to determine whether the decline in the fair value below the amortized cost basis is due to credit-related factors or noncredit-related factors. Such situations may result from either a decline in the financial condition of the issuing entity or, in the case of fixed interest rate investments, from rising interest rates. In making this assessment, management considers the length of time and the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, the nature of the security, the underlying collateral, and the financial condition and prospects of the issuer, among other factors. This assessment also includes a determination of whether the Company intends to sell the security, or if it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current-period credit losses. If the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected from the security is less than the amortized cost basis of the security, a credit loss exists and an allowance for credit losses for available-for-sale securities is recorded for the credit loss, limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized costs basis. Any impairment that has not been recorded through an allowance for credit losses for available-for-sale securities is recognized in other comprehensive income. Changes in the allowance for credit losses for available-for-sale securities are recorded as provision for (or reversal of) credit loss. Losses are charged against the allowance for credit losses for available-for-sale securities, with a corresponding adjustment to the security's amortized cost basis, when management believes the uncollectibility of an available-for-sale security is confirmed or when either criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met. Noninterest expense. Noninterest expense includes, among other things: (i) salaries and related benefits; (ii) occupancy and equipment expense; (iii) data processing; (iv) Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC and state assessments; (v) outside and professional services; and (vi) other general and administrative expenses, including amortization of intangible assets. Salaries and related benefits include compensation, employee benefits and employment tax expenses for our personnel. Occupancy and equipment expense includes depreciation expense on our owned properties and equipment, lease expense on our leased properties and other occupancy-related expenses. Data processing expense includes fees paid to our third-party data processing system provider and other data service providers. FDIC and state assessments expense represents the assessments that we pay to the FDIC for deposit insurance and other regulatory costs to various states. Outside and professional fees include legal, accounting, consulting and other outsourcing arrangements. Amortization of intangibles represents the amortization of our core deposit intangible from various acquisitions. Other general and administrative expenses include expenses associated with travel, meals, training, supplies and postage. Noninterest expenses generally increase as we grow our business. Noninterest expenses have increased significantly over the past few years as we have grown through acquisitions and organically, and as we have built out our operational infrastructure. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our accounting and reporting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP and to general practices within the banking industry. To prepare financial statements and interim financial statements in conformity with GAAP, management makes estimates, assumptions and judgments based on available information. These estimates, assumptions and judgments affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes and are based on information available as of the dates of the financial statements. As this information changes, actual results could differ from the estimates, assumptions and judgments reflected in the financial statements. In particular, management has identified several accounting policies that, due to the estimates, assumptions and judgments inherent in those policies, are critical in understanding our financial statements. These critical accounting policies and estimates include determining the allowance for credit losses and related provision. There have been no material changes in the Company s critical accounting policies and estimates as previously disclosed in the Company s 2023 Annual Report. For a detailed discussion, refer to Management s Discussion and

 Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies in the Company s 2023 Annual Report, which was filed with the SEC on March 15, 2024. Comparison of Financial Condition at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 Total assets. Total assets increased 10.4 million, or 0.4 , to 2.6 billion at September 30, 2024, from December 31, 2023. The increase primarily was due to investment securities available-for-sale increasing 30.6 million or 18.8 , partially offset by decreases in loans receivable, net of 12.0 million or 0.6 and cash and cash equivalents of 6.3 million or 2.0 . Cash and cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents decreased 6.3 million, or 2.0 , to 301.3 million, at September 30, 2024, from 307.5 million at December 31, 2023. The decrease primarily was due to a 14.0 million decrease in federal funds sold and interest bearing balances in banks, as excess funds were used to fund loan growth and the increase in investment securities. Investment securities available-for-sale. Investment securities available-for-sale increased 30.6 million, or 18.8 , to 193.8 million at September 30, 2024 from 163.2 million at December 31, 2024. The increase was due to the purchase of 39.0 million of investment securities and 4.8 million of fair value upward adjustments due to unrealized gains on investment securities available-for-sale, partially offset by the routine amortization and repayment of investment principal balances and securities called and matured of 13.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The following table sets forth certain information regarding contractual maturities and the weighted average yields of our available for sale investment securities as of September 30, 2024. Expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities if borrowers have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties. The weighted average yields were calculated by multiplying each carrying value by its yield and dividing the sum of these results by the total carrying values. Yields on tax-exempt investments are not calculated on a fully tax equivalent basis.

Loans receivable, net. We originate a wide variety of loans with a focus on commercial real estate CRE loans and commercial and industrial loans. Total loans decreased 12.0 million, or 0.6 , to 1.9 billion at September 30, 2024 from 1.9 billion at December 31, 2023. The decrease was due to 200.4 million of loan repaymen ts and 14.0 million of loans sold, partially offset by 135.4 million of new loan originations and 64.4 million of loan purchases.

 Acquired loans. As of September 30, 2024, acquired non-PCD loans totaled 151.6 million, with a remaining net premium of 2.0 million, compared to 187.7 million with a remaining net premium of 2.1 million as of December 31, 2023. The net premium for acquired non-PCD loans includes a credit discount based on estimated losses in the acquired loans, partially offset by any premium based on market interest rates on the date of acquisition. As of September 30, 2024, acquired PCD loans totaled 25.2 million, with a remaining net non-credit discount of 1.6 million, compared to 27.5 million with a remaining net non-credit discount of 1.8 million as of December 31, 2023. Nonperforming assets and loans. Nonperforming assets generally consist of nonperforming loans and other real estate owned OREO ). Nonperforming loans generally consist of nonaccrual loans and accruing loans 90 days or more past due. There were no accruing loans 90 days or more past due or OREO at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Nonperforming loans, consisting solely of nonaccrual loans, totaled 9.7 million, or 0.51 of total loans, at September 30, 2024, compared to 13.0 million, or 0.67 of total loans, at December 31, 2023. The decrease in nonperforming loans was primarily due to the sale of three nonaccrual loans totaling 8.1 million during the third quarter of 2024, the pay-off of two non-accrual loans totaling 460,000 during the third quarter of 2024, and the complete charge-off of one non-accrual loan of 1.0 million during the third quarter of 2024, partially offset by two new loans totaling 3.5 million being placed on nonaccrual during the third quarter of 2024. At September 30, 2024, nonperforming loans totaling 2.0 million were guaranteed by governmental agencies, compared to 740,000 at December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were no performing (accruing) modified loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, nonaccrual loans included 2.4 million and 927,000 of loans 30-89 days past due, and 4.6 million and 2.1 million of loans less than 30 days past due, respectively. At September 30, 2024, the 4.6 million of nonaccrual loans less than 30 days past due was comprised of 18 loans, all of which were placed on nonaccrual due to concerns over the financial condition of the borrowers. In general, loans are placed on nonaccrual status after being contractually delinquent for more than 90 days, or earlier, if management believes full collection of future principal and interest on a timely basis is unlikely. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, all interest accrued but not received is charged against interest income. When the ability to fully collect nonaccrual loan principal is in doubt, cash payments received are applied against the principal balance of the loan until such time as full collection of the remaining recorded balance is expected. Interest received on such loans is recognized as interest income when received. A nonaccrual loan is restored to an accrual basis when principal and interest payments are brought current, and full payment of principal and interest is probable. Loans that are well secured and in the process of collection will remain on accrual status . Loans may be acquired at a premium or discount to par value, in which case the premium is amortized (subtracted from) or accreted (added to) interest income over the remaining life of the loan. Generally, over time, the effects of loan discount accretion and loan premium amortization decrease as the purchased loans mature or pay off before maturity. Upon the pay-off of a loan before maturity, any remaining (unaccreted) discount or (unamortized) premium is immediately taken into interest income; as loan payoffs may vary significantly from quarter to quarter, so may the impact of discount accretion and premium amortization on interest income. Modified loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. Occasionally, the Company offers modifications of loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty by providing principal forgiveness, interest rate reductions, other-than-insignificant payment delays, term extensions or any combination of these. When principal is forgiven, the amount of the forgiveness is charged-off against the allowance for credit losses for loans. Upon the Company s subsequent determination that a modified loan (or a portion thereof) is uncollectible, the loan (or portion thereof) is charged off. The amortized cost basis of the loan is reduced by the uncollectible amount and the allowance for credit losses for loans is adjusted by the same amount.

 Loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty as of September 30, 2024 totaled 2.7 million, compared to 4.3 million at December 31, 2023. All of such loans were on nonaccrual status as of such dates. Modified loans that are accruing and performing according to their modified terms are not considered nonperforming loans because they continue to accrue interest despite their modified status. The related allowance for credit losses on individually evaluated modified loans totaled 26,000 and 1.3 million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. This decrease in the ACL was due to one full charge-off and one partial charge-off totaling 1.3 million in the aggregate during the first quarter of 2024, all of which was specifically reserved for at December 31, 2023. The following table provides information regarding nonperforming loans, nonperforming assets and modified loans as of the dates indicated: 

September 30, December 31, 2024 2023 (Dollars in thousands) Loans accounted for on a nonaccrual basis: Commercial and industrial 356 2,072 Real estate: Residential 1,404 1,496 Multifamily residential 85 5,305 Owner occupied CRE 4,331 3,573 Non-owner occupied CRE 3,531 165 Construction and land 366 Total real estate 9,351 10,905 Consumer Total nonaccrual loans 9,707 12,977 Accruing loans 90 days or more past due Total nonperforming loans 9,707 12,977 Real estate owned Total nonperforming assets (1) 9,707 12,977 Modified loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty performing PCD loans 23,881 25,723 Nonperforming assets to total assets (1) 0.38 0.51 Nonperforming loans to total loans (1) 0.51 0.67 (1) Performing modified loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty are neither included in nonperforming loans above nor are they included in the numerators used to calculate these ratios. Interest foregone on nonaccrual loans was approximately 397,000 and 1.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 173,000 and 593,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Interest income recognized on nonaccrual loans was approximately 7,400 and 93,600 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 39,000 and 120,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Allowance for credit losses for loans. The allowance for credit losses is determined by us on a quarterly basis, although we are engaged in monitoring the appropriate level of the allowance on a more frequent basis. We assess the allowance for credit losses based on three categories: (i) originated loans, (ii) acquired non-PCD loans, and (iii) acquired PCD loans. The allowance for credit losses reflects management s estimate of current expected credit losses inherent in the loan portfolios. The computation includes elements of judgment and high levels of subjectivity. At September 30, 2024, the Company s allowance for credit losses for loans was 18.3 million, or 0.96 of total loans, compared to 22.0 million, or 1.14 of total loans, at December 31, 2023. Management currently believes that the 18.3 million allowance for credit losses at September 30, 2024 is adequate to absorb expected credit losses inherent in

 the Company s loan portfolio. No assurance can be given, however, that adverse economic conditions or other circumstances will not result in increased losses in the portfolio. We recorded net charge-offs of 1.5 million and 5.0 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net charge-offs of 24,000 and 399,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Net charge-offs during the first nine months of 2024 consisted primarily of a charge-off of one commercial nonaccrual loan, which was fully reserved for at June 30, 2024, a 480,000 charge-off related to a nonaccrual loan sold during the third quarter, and a complete write-down of one nonaccrual loan for 88,000, partially offset by two recoveries totaling 50,000 during the third quarter. These actions were taken due to collateral shortfalls deemed uncollectable. The following table presents certain credit ratios at the dates and for the periods indicated and each component of the ratio s calculations:

 As of September 30, 2024, the Company individually evaluated 18.1 million in loans, inclusive of the 9.7 million of nonperforming loans as of that date. Of these individually evaluated loans, 2.4 million had a specific allowance totaling 444,000 as of September 30, 2024. As of December 31, 2023, the Company individually evaluated 13.0 million in loans, all of which were on nonaccrual status. Of these individually evaluated loans, 9.7 million had a specific allowance totaling 4.4 million as of December 31, 2023. Management considers the allowance for credit losses for loans at September 30, 2024 to be adequate to cover losses inherent in the loan portfolio based on the assessment of the above-mentioned factors affecting the loan portfolio. While management believes the estimates and assumptions used in its determination of the adequacy of the allowance are reasonable, there can be no assurance that such estimates and assumptions will not be proven incorrect in the future, or that the actual amount of future losses will not exceed the amount of the established allowance for credit losses for loans or that any increased allowance for credit losses for loans that may be required will not adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. A further decline in national and local economic conditions due to unemployment levels, labor shortages, the effects of inflation, a potential recession, slowed economic growth or otherwise, could result in a material increase in the allowance for credit losses for loans and may adversely affect the Company s financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the determination of the amount of our allowance for credit losses for loans is subject to review by bank regulators, as part of their routine examination process, which may result in additions to our provision for credit losses based upon their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examination. Deposits. Deposits are our primary source of funding and generally consist of core deposits from the communities served by our branch and office locations. We offer a variety of deposit accounts with a competitive range of interest rates and terms to both consumers and businesses. Deposits include interest bearing and noninterest bearing demand accounts, savings accounts, money market accounts, certificates of deposit and individual retirement accounts. These accounts earn interest at rates established by management based on competitive market factors, management s desire to increase certain product types or maturities, and in keeping with our asset/liability, liquidity and profitability objectives. Competitive products, competitive pricing and high touch client service are important to attracting and retaining these deposits. Total deposits increased 3.7 million, or 0.2 , to 2.1 billion at September 30, 2024 from December 31, 2023. At September 30, 2024, noninterest bearing demand deposits totaled 618.3 million, or 28.9 of total deposits, compared to 646.3 million, or 30.3 of total deposits, at December 31, 2023, a decrease of 28.0 million . Additionally, lower-costing NOW and savings decreased 21.1 million and 12.0 million, while higher-costing money market accounts and time deposits increased 52.1 million and 12.6 million, from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024, respectively. The deposit mix shifted, in part, due to interest rate sensitive clients moving a portion of their non-operating deposit balances from lower costing deposits, including noninterest-bearing deposits, into higher costing money market and time deposits. We consider our deposit base to be seasoned, stable and well-diversified, and we do not have any significant industry concentrations among our non-insured deposits. We also offer an insured cash sweep product (ICS) that allows customers to insure deposits above FDIC insurance limits. At September 30, 2024, our average deposit account size (excluding public funds), calculated by dividing period-end deposits by the population of accounts with balances, was approximately 60,000. See Note 17 Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-Q for information regarding our top ten depositors.

Although deposits are our primary source of funds, we may from time to time utilize borrowings as a cost-effective source of funds when they can be invested at a positive interest rate spread, for additional capacity to fund loan demand, or to meet our asset/liability management goals. We are a member of and may obtain advances from the FHLB of San Francisco, which is part of the Federal Home Loan Bank System. The eleven regional Federal Home Loan Banks provide a central credit facility for their member institutions. These advances are provided upon the security of certain of our mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities. These advances may be made pursuant to several different credit programs, each of which has its own interest rate, range of maturities and call features. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had the ability to borrow up to 512.7 million and 576.9 million, respectively, from the FHLB of San Francisco. At both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were no FHLB advances outstanding. During the first quarter of 2024, the Bank was approved for discount window advances with the FRB of San Francisco secured by certain types of loans. At September 30, 2024, we had the ability to borrow up to 42.3 million from the FRB of San Francisco, with no FRB of San Francisco advances outstanding at that date. We may also utilize Fed Funds purchased from correspondent banks as a source of short-term funding. At both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had a total of 65.0 million in federal funds lines available from third-party financial institutions and no balances outstanding at these dates. At both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had outstanding junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures, net of fair value adjustments, assumed in connection with its previous acquisitions totaling 8.6 million. At September 30, 2024, the Company had outstanding subordinated debt, net of costs to issue, totaling 63.7 million compared to 63.9 million at December 31, 2023. We are required to provide collateral for certain local agency deposits. At both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the FHLB of San Francisco had issued letters of credit on behalf of the Bank totaling 40.6 million, as collateral for local agency deposits. Shareholders equity. Shareholders equity increased 8.8 million, to 321.7 million at September 30, 2024 from 312.9 million at December 31, 2023. The increase in shareholders equity primarily was due to 17.5 million of net income earned and a 3.4 million decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of taxes, partially offset by the repurchase of 9.2 million of Company common stock and cash dividends paid or accrued and payable totaling 3.4 million, during the first nine months of 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased a total of 454,154 shares of its common stock at a total cost of 9.2 million and an average price of 20.30 per share, leaving 465,598 shares available for future purchases under the current stock repurchase plan.

 Comparison of Results of Operations for the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 Earnings summary. Net income was 6.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 6.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 613,000 or 9.2 . The decrease was the result of a 1.9 million decrease in net interest income and a 571,000 increase in provision for credit losses, partially offset by a 1.1 million increase in noninterest income, a 445,000 decrease in noninterest expense, and a 366,000 decrease in provision for income taxes. Basic and diluted earnings per share were 0.54 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 0.56 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Net income was 17.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 21.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 3.5 million or 16.8 . The decrease was due to a 6.8 million decrease in net interest income and a 2.0 million increase in provision for credit losses, resulting from a 1.7 million provision for credit losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a 311,000 reversal of credit losses in the same period a year ago, partially offset by a 2.0 million increase in noninterest income, a 1.4 million decrease in noninterest expense and a 1.8 million decrease in provision for income taxes. Basic and diluted earnings per share were 1.55 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1.72 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Our efficiency ratio, which is calculated by dividing noninterest expense by the sum of net interest income before provision for (reversal of) credit losses and noninterest income, was 62.76 and 65.20 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 62.42 and 63.07 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The deterioration in the efficiency ratio during the three months and nine months September 30, 2024 as compared to the same periods in 2023 was primarily due to lower overall revenues, partially offset by lower noninterest expenses. Interest income. Interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 33.4 million, compared to 32.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 596,000 or 1.8 . The increase in interest income between periods reflects increases in interest income in all interest-earning asset categories, except loans. Increased yields earned on interest-earning assets, along with an increase in the average balances of investment securities and fed funds sold and interest bearing balances in banks, were the primary drivers of the increase in interest income, partially offset by a decrease in the average balance of loans. Interest income on loans, including fees, decreased 997,000, or 3.7 , to 26.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 27.2 million for three months ended September 30, 2023, due to a 105.3 million decrease in the average balance of loans, partially offset by a 11 basis point increase in the average loan yield. The average balance of loans was 1.9 billion for the third quarter of 2024, compared to 2.0 billion for the third quarter of 2023. The average yield on loans was 5.53 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 5.42 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in the average yield on loans from the third quarter of 2023 was due to the impact of increased rates on variable rate loans, as well as new loans being originated at higher market interest rates. Interest income on loans for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 included 114,000 and 372,000 in accretion of the net discount on acquired loans and revenue from PCD loans in excess of discounts. The balance of the remaining net discounts on these acquired loans totaled 449,000 and 419,000 at September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

 Net interest income and net interest margin. Net interest income decreased 1.9 million, or 7.8 , to 22.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 24.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net interest income decreased 6.8 million, or 9.1 , to 67.6 million, compared to 74.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. These decreases primarily were due to increases in interest expense on deposits and decreases in interest income on loans, partially offset by increases in interest income on federal funds sold and interest-bearing balances in banks, interest income on investment securities and dividends on FHLB stock. The average yield (annualized) on interest earning assets for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 5.45 , a 11 basis point increase from 5.34 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, while the average cost of interest bearing liabilities increased 58 basis points to 2.62 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.04 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The average yield (annualized) on interest earning assets for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 5.37 , a 16 basis point increase from 5.21 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, while the average cost of interest bearing liabilities increased 77 basis points to 2.52 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1.75 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increases in average yields on interest-earning assets and average rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023, were due to higher market interest rates generally. The annualized net interest margin was 3.73 and 4.03 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the annualized net interest margin was 3.72 and 4.12 , respectively. Net interest margin for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same periods in 2023, was negatively impacted by increased funding costs, due to shifts towards higher yielding deposits, which outpaced, on a percentage basis, increased yields on interest-earning assets.

 Rate/Volume Analysis. Increases and decreases in interest income and interest expense result from changes in average balances (volume) of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, as well as changes in weighted average interest rates. The following table sets forth the effects of changing rates and volumes on our net interest income during the periods shown. Information is provided with respect to (i) effects on interest income attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate) and (ii) effects on interest income attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume). Changes applicable to both volume and rate have been allocated to volume.

We recorded provisions for credit losses of 1.2 million and 1.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to a 674,000 provision for credit losses and a 311,000 reversal of the allowance for credit losses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The provisions for credit losses during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were primarily driven by increased quantitative loss rates due to changes in forecasted economic conditions, replenishment of the allowance due to charge-offs, and an increase in provision for credit losses for unfunded commitments. The increase in the provision for credit loss for unfunded commitments of 390,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was due to one new 9.5 million construction commitment and increased quantitative loss rates. Net charge-offs totaled 1.5 million during the third quarter of 2024, which included a 1.0 million complete charge-off of a commercial non-accrual loan, which was fully reserved for at June 30, 2024, a 480,000 complete charge-off of a non-accrual commercial real estate loan, which was sold during the third quarter of 2024, and a complete write-down of one non-accrual farmland loan for 88,000, partially offset by two recoveries totaling 50,000 during the third quarter. The quantitative reserve was impacted by declines in forecasted economic conditions for national gross domestic product and increasing forecasted national unemployment, both of which are key indicators utilized to estimate credit losses. Noninterest income. Noninterest income increased 1.1 million, or 66.0 , to 2.7 million for three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in noninterest income was primarily due to a 1.7 million increase in gain on equity securities and a 85,000 increase in other income and fees, partially offset by a 478,000 decrease in income on investment in SBIC fund, a 107,000 decrease in loan servicing fees and other fees due to lower loan origination volume and a 75,000 decrease in service charges and other fees primarily due to fewer customer deposits being placed in Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service CDARS and Insured Cash Sweep ICS money market product services via the IntraFi Network.

 Noninterest income increased 2.0 million, or 46.2 , to 6.3 million for nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 4.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in noninterest income was primarily due to a 1.7 million gain on equity securities in the current year period compared to a 2.1 million loss on equity securities in the prior year period, partially offset by a 1.2 million decrease in income on investment in SBIC fund, a 221,000 decrease in gain on sale of loans, a 277,000 decrease in loan servicing fees and other fees due to lower loan origination volume and a 269,000 decrease in service charges and other fees primarily due to fewer customer deposits being placed in CDARS and ICS money market product services via the IntraFi Network. The following table presents the key components of noninterest income for the periods indicated: 

Three months ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Change (Dollars in thousands) Gain on sale of loans 28 (28) (100.0) Gain (loss) on equity securities 1,420 (274) 1,694 618.2 Service charges and other fees 898 973 (75) (7.7) Loan servicing and other loan fees 324 431 (107) (24.8) (Loss) income on investment in SBIC fund (253) 225 (478) (212.4) Other income and fees 356 271 85 31.4 Total noninterest income 2,745 1,654 1,091 66.0 

Nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Change (Dollars in thousands) Gain on sale of loans 287 508 (221) (43.5) Gain (loss) on equity securities 1,672 (2,087) 3,759 (180.1) Service charges and other fees 2,471 2,740 (269) (9.8) Loan servicing and other loan fees 1,157 1,434 (277) (19.3) (Loss) income on investment in SBIC fund (212) 939 (1,151) (122.6) Other income and fees 915 769 146 19.0 Total noninterest income 6,290 4,303 1,987 46.2 Noninterest expense. Noninterest expense decreased 445,000, or 2.7 , to 16.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 16.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in noninterest expense was primarily due to a 715,000 decrease in salaries and employee benefits as a result of a decrease in the number of full-time equivalent employees and lower incentive accruals due to lower loan production, partially offset by a 199,000 increase in data processing expense due to newly implemented services and a 76,000 increase in occupancy and equipment expense. Noninterest expense decreased 1.4 million, or 2.9 , to 48.2 million for the nine months September 30, 2024, compared to 49.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in noninterest expense was primarily due to a 2.8 million decrease in salaries and employee benefits as a result of a 1.3 million decrease in bonus accruals and a decrease in the number of full-time equivalent employees, partially offset by a 487,000 increase in other expense due to increased legal costs, professional fees, FDIC insurance costs, and fraudulent check losses, a 521,000 increase in data processing expense due to newly implemented services and expenses relating to enhancements to the Bank s network, and a 362,000 increase in occupancy and equipment expense.

 The following table details the components of noninterest expense for the periods indicated: 

Three months ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Change (Dollars in thousands) Salaries and related benefits 9,569 10,284 (715) (7.0) Occupancy and equipment 2,209 2,133 76 3.6 Data processing 1,973 1,774 199 11.2 Other 2,323 2,328 (5) (0.2) Total noninterest expense 16,074 16,519 (445) (2.7) 

Nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Change (Dollars in thousands) Salaries and employee benefits 29,247 32,065 (2,818) (8.8) Occupancy and equipment 6,496 6,134 362 5.9 Data processing 5,376 4,855 521 10.7 Other 7,038 6,551 487 7.4 Total noninterest expense 48,157 49,605 (1,448) (2.9) Income taxes. The provision for income taxes decreased 366,000, or 13.9 , to 2.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, due to lower taxable income. The provision for income taxes decreased 1.8 million, or 21.5 , to 6.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 8.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, due to lower taxable income. The Company s effective tax rate was 27.4 and 27.2 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 28.5 and 28.4 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The effective tax rate was lower for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023, due to higher low income housing tax credits . Liquidity and Capital Resources Planning for our normal business liquidity needs, both expected and unexpected, is done on a daily and short-term basis through the cash management function. On a longer-term basis, it is accomplished through the budget and strategic planning functions, with support from internal asset/liability management software model projections. Management maintains a liquidity position that it believes will adequately provide funding for loan demand and deposit run off that may occur in the normal course of business. We rely on multiple sources to meet our potential liquidity needs. Our primary sources of funds are deposits, escrow and custodial deposits, principal and interest payments on loans and proceeds from sale of loans. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Bank sold 3.1 million in loan participation interests and 10.9 million in classified loans and received 200.4 million in principal loan repayments. While maturities and scheduled amortizations of loans are generally predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by market interest rates, economic conditions, and competition. Deposits increased 3.7 million to 2.1 billion and liquid assets, in the form of cash and cash equivalents, time deposit in banks and investment securities, increased 23.6 million to 495.5 million at September 30, 2024 from December 31, 2023. Management believes that our securities portfolio is of high quality and that the securities would therefore be marketable. Securities purchased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 39.0 million, and securities repayments, maturities and sales during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 13.1 million. Certificates of deposit scheduled to mature in one year or less at September 30, 2024, totaled 434.5 million. It is management s policy to maintain deposit rates that are competitive with other local financial institutions. Based on this management strategy, we believe that most of our maturing certificates of deposit will remain with us.

 In addition to these primary sources of funds, management has several secondary sources available to meet potential funding requirements. As of September 30, 2024, the Bank had an available borrowing capacity of 512.7 million with the FHLB of San Francisco, with no borrowings outstanding at that date or at December 31, 2023. During the first quarter of 2024, the Bank was approved for discount window advances from the FRB of San Francisco secured by certain types of loans. At September 30, 2024, we had the ability to borrow up to 42.3 million from the FRB of San Francisco, with no borrowings outstanding at that date. The Bank also had, as of that date, federal funds lines with four correspondent banks, with available commitments totaling 65.0 million. There were no amounts outstanding under these facilities at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Subject to market conditions, we expect to utilize these borrowing facilities from time to time in the future to fund loan originations and deposit withdrawals, to satisfy other financial commitments, repay maturing debt and to take advantage of investment opportunities to the extent feasible. Liquidity management is both a daily and long-term function of the Company s management. Excess liquidity is generally invested in short-term investments, such as overnight deposits and federal funds. On a longer-term basis, a strategy is maintained of investing in various lending products and investment securities, including U.S. Government obligations and U.S. agency securities. We use our sources of funds primarily to meet our ongoing commitments, to pay maturing deposits and fund withdrawals, and to fund loan commitments. At September 30, 2024, loan commitments and letters of credit totaled 71.3 million, including 9.7 million of undisbursed construction and development loan commitments. For information regarding our commitments, see Note 17 Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1. Financial Information of Part I of this report. Our cash flows are comprised of three primary classifications: cash flows from operating activities, cash flows from investing activities, and cash flows from financing activities. Net cash provided by operating activities for both the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 22.4 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in investing activities was 19.4 million, which consisted primarily of purchases of investment securities, partially offset by a net decrease in loans receivable, compared to 52.9 million of net cash provided by investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 9.3 million, which was comprised primarily of stock repurchases and dividends, partially offset by a net increase in deposits, compared to 49.8 million of net cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Management believes our capital sources are adequate to meet all reasonably foreseeable short-term and long-term cash requirements. There has not been a material change in our liquidity and capital resources since the information disclosed in our 2023 Annual Report other than set forth above. We are not aware of any reasonably likely material changes in the mix and relative cost of such resources. BayCom Corp is a separate legal entity from the Bank and must provide for its own liquidity. At September 30, 2024, BayCom Corp had liquid assets of 25.3 million. In addition to its operating expenses, BayCom Corp is responsible for paying to its shareholders any dividends that have been declared, funding stock repurchases, and making payments on its junior subordinated debentures and subordinated notes. BayCom Corp can receive dividends and other capital distributions from the Bank, although there are regulatory restrictions on the ability of the Bank to pay dividends and make other capital distributions. On August 22, 2024, the Company announced that its Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of 0.10 per share on the Company s outstanding common stock, which was paid on October 10, 2024 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on September 19, 2024. The Company expects to continue to pay quarterly cash dividends on its common stock, subject to the Board of Directors discretion to modify or terminate this practice at any time and for any reason without prior notice. Assuming continued payment of the cash dividend at this rate of 0.10 per share, our average total dividend paid each quarter would be approximately 1.1 million based on the number of our outstanding shares at September 30, 2024. The dividends we pay may be limited as more fully discussed under Business Supervision and Regulation BayCom Corp Dividends and Regulatory Capital Requirements contained in Part I. Item 1. Business of the 2023 Annual Report. From time to time, our Board of Directors has authorized stock repurchase programs. In general, stock repurchases allow us to proactively manage our capital position and return excess capital to shareholders. Stock repurchases also provide us with shares of common stock necessary to satisfy obligations related to stock compensation awards. In May 2024, our Board of Directors announced a new stock repurchase program, to commence following completion of the existing stock repurchase program (which was completed during the quarter ended June 30, 2024), for 

 54

 the repurchase of up to 560,000 shares, or approximately 5.0 of the Company s outstanding common stock, over a one- year period. Purchases under the Company s stock repurchase programs may be made through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, or otherwise in compliance with Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The repurchase programs may be suspended, terminated, or modified at any time for any reason, including market conditions, the cost of repurchasing shares, the availability of alternative investment opportunities, liquidity, and other factors deemed appropriate. The Company s stock repurchase programs do not obligate the Company to purchase any particular number of shares. As of September 30, 2024, there remained 465,598 shares available for repurchase under the Company s existing stock repurchase program. For additional information on the Company s stock repurchases, see Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds contained in Part II of this report. Regulatory Capital The Bank, as a state-chartered, federally insured commercial bank and member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, is subject to capital requirements established by the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve requires the Bank to maintain levels of capital adequacy that generally parallel the FDIC requirements. The capital adequacy requirements are quantitative measures established by regulation that require the Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of capital. The FDIC requires the Bank to maintain minimum ratios of Total Capital, Tier 1 Capital, and Common Equity Tier 1 Capital to risk-weighted assets as well as Tier 1 Leverage Capital to average assets. Consistent with our goal to operate a sound and profitable organization, our policy is for the Bank to maintain Well Capitalized status under the Federal Reserve regulations. Based on capital levels at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Bank was considered Well Capitalized at both of those dates.

At September 30, 2024, the Bank s Common Equity Tier 1 capital exceeded the required capital conservation buffer. For a bank holding company with less than 3.0 billion in assets, the capital guidelines apply on a bank-only basis and the Federal Reserve expects the holding company s subsidiary bank(s) to be Well Capitalized under the prompt corrective action regulations. If the Company were subject to regulatory guidelines for bank holding companies with 3.0 billion or more in assets, at September 30, 2024, the Company would have exceeded all regulatory capital requirements.

Business Supervision and Regulation United Business Bank Capital Requirements and Note 19 - Regulatory Matters in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in the 2023 Annual Report.

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk We are exposed to interest rate risk through our lending and deposit gathering activities. Our results of operations are highly dependent upon our ability to manage interest rate risk. We consider interest rate risk to be a significant market risk that could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Interest rate risk is measured and assessed on a quarterly basis. For information regarding the Company s market risk, see Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market and Interest Rate Risk, in the Company s 2023 Annual Report. In our opinion, there has not been a material change in our interest rate risk exposure since the information disclosed in our 2023 Annual Report. Item 4. Controls and Procedures (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures An evaluation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), was carried out as of September 30, 2024 under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s principal executive officer, principal financial officer and several other members of the Company s senior management. In designing and evaluating the Company s disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Additionally, in designing disclosure controls and procedures, management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures. The design of any disclosure controls and procedures also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. The Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that as of September 30, 2024, based on their evaluation, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that information we are required to disclose in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (1) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and (2) accumulated and communicated to BayCom Corp s management, including its CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure, specified in the SEC s rules and forms. (b) Changes in Internal Controls There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act, that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024, that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting. The Company does not expect that its disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud. A control procedure, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control procedure are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control procedures, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls may be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by override of the control. The design of any control procedure is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control procedure, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

Purchases under the Company s stock repurchase programs may be made through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, or otherwise in compliance with Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The repurchase programs may be suspended, terminated, or modified at any time for any reason, including market conditions, the cost of repurchasing shares, the availability of alternative investment opportunities, liquidity, and other factors deemed appropriate. The Company s stock repurchase programs do not obligate the Company to purchase any specific number of shares. Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities Not applicable. Item 4.
