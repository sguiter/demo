), on its net effectively connected income. Any such income might also be subject to U.S. state and local income taxes. In addition, the Fund would be subject to a 30 U.S. branch profits tax in respect of its dividend equivalent amount, as defined in Section 884 of the Code, attributable to its effectively connected income (generally, the after-tax amount of certain effectively connected income that is not treated as reinvested in the trade or business). If the Fund were treated as engaged in a trade or business in the United States during any taxable year, it would be required to file a U.S. federal income tax return for that year, regardless of whether it recognized any effectively connected income. If the Fund did not file U.S. federal income tax returns and were later determined to have engaged in a U.S. trade or business, it would generally not be entitled to offset its effectively connected income and gains against its effectively connected losses and deductions (and, therefore, would be taxable on its gross, rather than net, effectively connected income). If the Fund recognizes any effectively connected income, the imposition of U.S. taxes on such income may have a substantial adverse effect on the return to shareholders. Due to the new and evolving nature of digital assets and a general absence of clearly controlling authority with respect to digital assets, many significant aspects of the U.S. federal income tax treatment of digital assets (including with respect to the amount, timing, and character of income recognition) are uncertain. The Manager believes that, in general, gains and losses recognized by the Fund from the sale or other disposition of digital assets will be treated as capital gains or losses. However, it is possible that the IRS will not agree with the Fund s U.S. federal tax treatment of digital assets. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Fund has defined the threshold for recognizing the benefits of tax positions in the financial statements as more-likely-than-not to be sustained by the applicable taxing authority and requires measurement of a tax position meeting the more-likely-than-not threshold, based on the largest benefit that is more than 50 likely to be realized. Tax positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold are recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current period. As of, and during the periods ended September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, the Fund did not have a liability for any unrecognized tax amounts. However, the Manager s conclusions concerning its determination of more likely than not tax positions may be subject to review and adjustment at a later date based on factors including, but not limited to, further implementation guidance, and ongoing analyses of and changes to tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof. The Manager of the Fund has evaluated whether or not there are uncertain tax positions that require financial statement recognition and has determined that no reserves for uncertain tax positions related to federal, state and local income taxes existed as of September 30, 2024 or June 30, 2024 .

Shares of the Fund were held by related parties of the Fund. Genesis Global Trading, Inc. filed a certificate of dissolution during the three months ended September 30, 2024, and has therefore been removed from the list of related parties. On November 20, 2023, it was announced that CoinDesk Indices, Inc., the Index Provider and Reference Rate Provider, previously an affiliate of the Manager and the Fund at the time of this event, was acquired by an unaffiliated third party. This transaction did not have any impact on the Fund, or disrupt the operations of the Fund. The Manager s indirect parent, an affiliate of the Fund, holds a minority interest in Coinbase, Inc., the parent company of the Custodian, that represents less than of Coinbase, Inc. s ownership. In accordance with the LLC Agreement governing the Fund, the Fund pays a fee to the Manager, calculated as of the aggregate value of the Fund s digital asset holdings, less its liabilities (which include any accrued but unpaid expenses up to, but excluding, the date of calculation), as calculated and published by the Manager or its delegates (the Manager s Fee ). The Manager s Fee accrues daily in U.S. dollars and is payable in Fund Components then held by the Fund in proportion to their respective Fund Component s Weighting. The U.S. dollar amount of the Manager s Fee will be converted into Fund Components on a daily basis by multiplying such U.S. dollar amount by the Weighing for each Fund Component and dividing the resulting product for each Fund Component by the U.S. dollar value for such Fund Component on such day. For purposes of these financial statements, the U.S. dollar value of Fund Components is determined by reference to the Digital Asset Trading Platform Market that the Fund considers its principal market as of 4:00 p.m., New York time, on each valuation date. Forked Assets have been distributed in payment of the Manager s Fee during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. As partial consideration for receipt of the Manager s Fee, the Manager shall assume and pay all fees and other expenses incurred by the Fund in the ordinary course of its affairs, excluding taxes, but including marketing fees; the administrator fee, if any; custodian fees; transfer agent fees; trustee fees; the fees and expenses related to the listing, quotation or trading of the Shares on any secondary market (including customary legal, marketing and audit fees and expenses) in an amount up to in any given fiscal year; ordinary course legal fees and expenses; audit fees; regulatory fees, including, if applicable, any fees relating to the registration of the Shares under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act and fees relating to registration and any other regulatory requirements in the Cayman Islands; printing and mailing costs; the costs of maintaining the Fund s website and applicable license fees (together, the Manager-paid Expenses ). The Fund may incur certain extraordinary, non-recurring expenses that are not Manager-paid Expenses, including, but not limited to, taxes and governmental charges, expenses and costs of any extraordinary services performed by the Manager (or any other service provider) on behalf of the Fund to protect the Fund or the interests of shareholders (including in connection with any Forked Assets), any indemnification of the Custodian or other agents, service providers or counterparties of the Fund, the fees and expenses related to the listing, quotation or trading of the Shares on any secondary market (including legal, marketing and audit fees and expenses) to the extent exceeding in any given fiscal year and extraordinary legal fees and expenses, including any legal fees and expenses incurred in connection with litigation, regulatory enforcement or investigation matters (collectively, Additional Fund Expenses ). In such circumstances, the Manager or its delegate (i) will instruct the Custodian to withdraw from the digital asset accounts Fund Components in proportion to their respective Weightings at such time and in such quantity as may be necessary to permit payment of such Additional Fund Expenses and (ii) may either (x) cause the Fund (or its delegate) to convert such Fund Components into U.S. dollars or other fiat currencies at the price per single unit of such asset (determined net of any associated fees) at which the Fund is able to sell such asset or (y) when the Manager incurs such expenses on behalf of the Fund, cause the Fund (or its delegate) to deliver such Fund Components, and/or Forked Assets in kind to the Manager, in each case in such quantity as may be necessary to permit payment of such Additional Fund Expenses. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Fund incurred Manager s Fees of and , respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 , there were accrued and unpaid Manager s Fees. In addition, the Manager may pay Additional Fund Expenses on behalf of the Fund, which are reimbursable by the Fund to the Manager. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , the Manager did t pay any Additional Fund Expenses on behalf of the Fund. On March 2, 2022, the Board of Directors of the Manager approved the purchase by DCG, the indirect parent company of the Manager, of up to an aggregate total of million worth of Shares of the Fund and shares of any of the following five investment products the Manager also acts as the sponsor and manager of, including Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (BTC) (NYSE Arca: GBTC), Grayscale Bitcoin Cash Trust (BCH) (OTCQX: BCHG), Grayscale Ethereum Trust (ETH) (NYSE Arca: ETHE), Grayscale Ethereum Classic Trust (ETC)

billion through XRP sales that should have been registered under the federal securities laws, but were not. Subsequently, in July 2023, the District Court for the Southern District of New York held that while XRP is not a security , certain sales of XRP to certain

of the Fund s NAV as of September 30, 2024. If a Fund Component is determined to be a security under federal or state securities laws by the SEC or any other agency, or in a proceeding in a court of law or otherwise, it may have material adverse consequences for such Fund Component. For example, it may become more difficult for such Fund Component to be traded, cleared and custodied as compared to other digital assets that are not considered to be securities, which could, in turn, negatively affect the liquidity and general acceptance of such Fund Component and cause users to migrate to other digital assets. As such, any determination that a Fund Component is a security under federal or state securities laws may adversely affect the value of such Fund Component and, as a result, an investment in the Shares. To the extent that a Fund Component is determined to be a security, the Fund and the Manager may also be subject to additional regulatory requirements, including under the Investment Company Act of 1940, and the Manager may be required to register as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. If the Manager determines not to comply with such additional regulatory and registration requirements, the Manager will terminate the Fund. Any such termination could result in the liquidation of the Fund s digital assets at a time that is disadvantageous to shareholders. Additionally, as an example of a network disruption, the Solana network experienced a significant disruption on September 14, 2021, later attributed to a type of denial of service attack, and was offline for 17 hours, only returning to full functionality 24 hours later. While persons associated with Solana Labs and/or the Solana Foundation are understood to have played a key role in bringing the network back online, the broader community also played a key role, as Solana validators coordinated to upgrade and restart the network. Furthermore, like any smart contract platform that utilizes bridge technology, digital assets transferred to or from other blockchains are vulnerable to certain types of exploits. For example, on February 3, 2022, hackers were able to manipulate the Wormhole bridge smart contract code which enables the transfer of certain digital assets to the Solana network, to divert approximately Ether from the Wormhole bridge to the attacker s Ether wallet. While Jump Crypto, the creators of the Wormhole bridge, replenished the stolen Ether, effectively backstopping user losses, they or other creators may not be able to do so again in the future. The development of bridges on Digital Asset Networks is ongoing and further attacks on bridges compatible with a Digital Asset Network of a Fund Component could have a material adverse effect on the value of such Fund Component and an investment in the Shares. To the extent a private key required to access a Fund Component address is lost, destroyed or otherwise compromised and no backup of the private key is accessible, the Fund may be unable to access the relevant Fund Component controlled by the private key and the private key will not be capable of being restored by the network of such Fund Component. The processes by which the Fund Component transactions are settled are dependent on the peer-to-peer network of such Fund Component, and as such, the Fund is subject to operational risk. A risk also exists with respect to previously unknown technical vulnerabilities, which may adversely affect the value of the Fund Component. The Fund relies on third-party service providers to perform certain functions essential to its operations. Any disruptions to the Fund s service providers business operations resulting from business failures, financial instability, security failures, government mandated regulation or operational problems could have an adverse impact on the Fund s ability to access critical services and be disruptive to the operations of the Fund.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, our unaudited financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States U.S. GAAP ). The following discussion may contain forward-looking statements based on assumptions we believe to be reasonable. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include, but are not limited to, those set forth under Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Quarterly Report, or in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors and Forward-Looking Statements or other sections of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2024. 
 Fund Overview 
 The Fund is a passive entity that is managed and administered by the Manager and does not have any officers, directors or employees. The Fund holds Fund Components and, from time to time on a periodic basis, issues Creation Baskets in exchange for deposits of Fund Components. As a passive investment vehicle, the Fund s investment objective is for the value of the Shares to reflect the value of the Fund Components held by the Fund, determined by reference to the Digital Asset Reference Rates and weightings within the Fund, less the Fund s expenses and other liabilities. While an investment in the Shares is not a direct investment in the Fund Components, the Shares are designed to provide investors with a cost-effective and convenient way to gain investment exposure to the Fund Components. To date, the Fund has not met its investment objective and the Shares quoted on OTCQX have not reflected the value of Fund Components, less the Fund s expenses and other liabilities, but instead have traded at both premiums and discounts to such value, which at times have been substantial. The Fund is not managed like a business corporation or an active investment vehicle. 
 Prior to July 1, 2022, the Fund determined which Fund Components to hold pursuant to the Target Coverage Ratio Methodology. Effective July 1, 2022, the Manager replaced the Target Coverage Ratio Methodology as the fund construction criteria and adopted the DLCS Methodology. Prior to the adoption of the DLCS Methodology, the Digital Asset Reference Rates used to value the Fund Components were Index Prices, or Old Indicative Prices. In connection with the adoption of the DLCS Methodology, the Manager changed the Digital Asset Reference Rates used to value the Fund Components and as of the date of this Quarterly Report, each of the Digital Asset Reference Rates are Indicative Prices. See Item 1. Business Investment Objective and Item 1. Business Valuation of Digital Assets and Determination of NAV in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. 
 Any references in this section to the Digital Reference Rates prior to July 1, 2022 are to the Digital Asset Reference Rates in effect prior to the adoption of the DLCS Methodology. In addition, all references in this section to the NAV and NAV per Share of the Fund for periods prior to July 1, 2022 have been calculated using Index Prices and/or Indicative Prices, based on the digital assets held by the Fund pursuant to the Target Coverage Ratio Methodology. All references in this section to the NAV and NAV per Share of the Fund for periods subsequent to July 1, 2022 have been calculated using Indicative Prices. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Investment Transactions and Revenue Recognition 
 The Fund considers investment transactions to be the receipt of Fund Components for Share creations and the delivery of Fund Components for Share redemptions or for payment of expenses in Fund Components. At this time, the Fund is not accepting redemption requests from shareholders. The Fund records its investment transactions on a trade date basis and changes in fair value are reflected as net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments. Realized gains and losses are calculated using the specific identification method. Realized gains and losses are recognized in connection with transactions including settling obligations for the Manager s Fee in the Fund Components. 
 Principal Market and Fair Value Determination 
 To determine which market is the Fund s principal market for each Fund Component (or in the absence of a principal market, the most advantageous market) for purposes of calculating the Fund s net asset value in accordance with U.S. GAAP Principal Market NAV ), the Fund follows Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 820-10, Fair Value Measurement , which outlines which outlines the application of fair value accounting. ASC 820-10 determines fair value to be the price that would be received for each Fund Component in a current sale, which assumes an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820-10 requires the Fund to assume that each Fund Component is sold in its principal market to market participants or, in the absence of a principal market, the most advantageous market. Market participants are defined as buyers and sellers in the principal or most advantageous market that are independent, knowledgeable, and willing and able to transact. 
 22 

The Fund only receives Fund Components in connection with a creation order from the Authorized Participant (or a Liquidity Provider) and does not itself transact on any Digital Asset Markets. Therefore, the Fund looks to market-based volume and level of activity for Digital Asset Markets. The Authorized Participant(s), or a Liquidity Provider, may transact in a Brokered Market, a Dealer Market, Principal-to-Principal Markets and Exchange Markets (referred to as Trading Platform Markets in this Quarterly Report), each as defined in the FASB ASC Master Glossary (collectively, Digital Asset Markets ). 
 In determining which of the eligible Digital Asset Markets is the Fund s principal market for each Fund Component, the Fund reviews these criteria in the following order: 
 First, the Fund reviews a list of Digital Asset Markets that maintain practices and policies designed to comply with anti-money laundering AML and know-your-customer KYC regulations, and non-Digital Asset Trading Platform Markets that the Fund reasonably believes are operating in compliance with applicable law, including federal and state licensing requirements, based upon information and assurances provided to it by each market. 

Second, the Fund sorts these Digital Asset Markets from high to low by market-based volume and level of activity of each Fund Component traded on each Digital Asset Market in the trailing twelve months. 

Third, the Fund then reviews pricing fluctuations and the degree of variances in price on Digital Asset Markets to identify any material notable variances that may impact the volume or price information of a particular Digital Asset Market. 

Fourth, the Fund then selects a Digital Asset Market as its principal market for such Fund Component based on the highest market-based volume, level of activity and price stability in comparison to the other Digital Asset Markets on the list. Based on information reasonably available to the Fund, Trading Platform Markets have the greatest volume and level of activity for the Fund Components. The Fund therefore looks to accessible Trading Platform Markets as opposed to the Brokered Market, Dealer Market and Principal-to-Principal Markets to determine its principal market for each Fund Component. As a result of the aforementioned analysis, a Trading Platform Market has been selected as the Fund s principal market for each Fund Component. 

The Fund determines its principal market for each Fund Component (or in the absence of a principal market the most advantageous market) annually and conducts a quarterly analysis to determine (i) if there have been recent changes to each Digital Asset Market s trading volume and level of activity in the trailing twelve months, (ii) if any Digital Asset Markets have developed that the Fund has access to, or (iii) if recent changes to each Digital Asset Market s price stability have occurred that would materially impact the selection of the principal market and necessitate a change in the Fund s determination of its principal market for each Fund Component. 
 The cost basis of each Fund Component received in connection with a creation order is recorded by the Fund at the fair value of such Fund Component at 4:00 p.m., New York time, on the creation date for financial reporting purposes. The cost basis recorded by the Fund may differ from proceeds collected by the Authorized Participant from the sale of the corresponding Shares to investors. 
 Investment Company Considerations 
 The Fund is an investment company for U.S. GAAP purposes and follows accounting and reporting guidance in accordance with the FASB ASC Topic 946, Financial Services Investment Companies . The Fund uses fair value as its method of accounting for digital assets in accordance with its classification as an investment company for accounting purposes. The Fund is not a registered investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940. U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates and these differences could be material.

(1) Net assets in the above table and subsequent paragraphs are calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP based on the Digital Asset Market price of each Fund Component on the Digital Asset Trading Platforms that the Fund considered each Fund Component s principal market, as of 4:00 p.m., New York time, on the valuation date. 

Net realized and unrealized loss on investments in digital assets for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 17,218), which includes a realized gain of 2,362 on the transfer of digital assets to pay the Manager s Fee, a realized gain of 778 as a result of the quarterly rebalance of digital assets, and net change in unrealized appreciation on investments in digital assets of 20,358). Net decrease in net assets resulting from operations was 20,353) for the three months ended September 30, 2024, which consisted of the net realized and unrealized loss on investments in digital assets, plus the Manager s Fee of 3,135. Net assets decreased to 506,603 at September 30, 2024, a 4 decrease for the three-month period. The decrease in net assets primarily resulted from the price depreciation of Fund Components during the period, and the withdrawal of approximately 37 Bitcoin, 228 Ether, 878 SOL, 105,692 XRP, and 748 AVAX to pay the foregoing Manager s Fee. 
 Net realized and unrealized loss on investments in digital assets for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was 30,819), which includes a realized gain of 794 on the transfer of digital assets to pay the Manager s Fee, a realized gain of 907 as a result of the quarterly rebalance of digital assets, and net change in unrealized depreciation on investments in digital assets of 32,520). Net decrease in net assets resulting from operations was 32,403) for the three months ended September 30, 2023, which consisted of the net realized and unrealized loss on investments in digital assets, plus the Manager s Fee of 1,584. Net assets decreased to 240,229 at September 30, 2023, a 12 decrease for the three-month period. The decrease in net assets primarily resulted from the price depreciation of Fund Components during the period, and by the withdrawal of approximately 39 Bitcoin, 244 Ether, 808 SOL, 70,811 ADA and 18,862 MATIC to pay the foregoing Manager s Fee. 
 Cash Resources and Liquidity 
 The Fund has not had a cash balance at any time since inception. When selling Fund Components and/or Forked Assets to pay Additional Fund Expenses on behalf of the Fund, the Manager endeavors to sell the exact amount of Fund Components and/or Forked Assets needed to pay expenses in order to minimize the Fund s holdings of assets other than the Fund Components. As a consequence, the Manager expects that the Fund will not record any cash flow from its operations and that its cash balance will be zero at the end of each reporting period. Furthermore, the Fund is not a party to any off-balance sheet arrangements. 
 In exchange for the Manager s Fee, the Manager has agreed to assume most of the expenses incurred by the Fund. As a result, the only ordinary expense of the Fund during the periods covered by this Quarterly Report was the Manager s Fee. The Fund is not aware of any trends, demands, conditions or events that are reasonably likely to result in material changes to its liquidity needs.

The following chart sets out the historical premium and discount for the Shares as reported by OTCQX and the Fund s NAV per Share from November 22, 2019 to September 30, 2024. Prior to July 1, 2022, the NAV per Share was calculated based on the Fund Components held by the Fund pursuant to the Target Coverage Ratio Methodology and using Index Prices or Old Indicative Prices. Effective July 1, 2022, the NAV per Share is calculated based on the Fund Components held by the Fund pursuant to the DLCS Methodology and using Indicative Prices. As a result, the NAV per Share for periods subsequent to July 1, 2022 is not directly comparable to the NAV per Share in periods prior to July 1, 2022.

PART II OTHE R INFORMATION: 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 The Manager and an affiliate of the Fund, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (BTC) Grayscale Bitcoin Trust ), are currently parties to certain legal proceedings. Although the Fund is not a party to these proceedings, the Fund may in the future be subject to legal proceedings or disputes. 
 On January 30, 2023, Osprey Funds, LLC Osprey filed a suit in Connecticut Superior Court against the Manager alleging that statements the Manager made in its advertising and promotion of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust violated the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act, and seeking statutory damages and injunctive relief. On April 17, 2023, the Manager filed a motion to dismiss the complaint and, following briefing, a hearing on the motion to dismiss was held on June 26, 2023. On October 23, 2023, the Court denied the Manager s motion to dismiss. On November 6, 2023, the Manager filed a motion for reargument of the Court s order denying the Manager s motion to dismiss. On November 16, 2023, Osprey filed an opposition to the Manager s motion for reargument, and on November 30, 2023, the Manager filed a reply in further support of its motion for reargument. On March 11, 2024, the Court denied the Sponsor s motion for reargument. On March 25, 2024, the Manager filed an application for interlocutory appeal. On March 28, 2024, Osprey filed an opposition to the Manager s application for interlocutory appeal. On April 1, 2024, the Court denied the Manager s application for interlocutory appeal. On April 10, 2024, Osprey filed a motion to amend the complaint. The amended complaint went into effect on April 25, 2024. A scheduling order was entered by the Court with trial scheduled to begin on July 15, 2025. On July 31, 2024, the Manager filed a motion to strike the amended complaint. On August 30, 2024, Osprey filed an opposition to the Manager s motion to strike the amended complaint. On October 11, 2024, the Court denied the Manager s motion to strike. The Manager and Grayscale Bitcoin Trust believe this lawsuit is without merit and intend to vigorously defend against it. 
 As of the date of this Quarterly Report, the Manager does not expect the foregoing proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on the Fund s business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 The Manager and/or the Fund may be subject to additional legal proceedings and disputes in the future. 
 Item 1A. Ri sk Factors 
 There have been no material changes to the Risk Factors last reported under Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of the registrant s Annual Report on Form 10-K, except as set forth below. 
 The SEC has taken, and may in the future take, the view that some of the digital assets held by the Fund are securities, which has adversely affected, and could adversely affect the value of such digital assets and the price of the Shares and result in potentially extraordinary, nonrecurring expenses to, or termination of, the Fund. 
 Depending on its characteristics, a digital asset may be considered a security under the federal securities laws. The test for determining whether a particular digital asset is a security is complex and difficult to apply, and the outcome is difficult to predict. Public, though non-binding, statements by senior officials at the SEC have indicated that the SEC did not consider Bitcoin or Ether to be securities, and does not currently consider Bitcoin to be a security. In addition, the SEC, by action through delegated authority approving exchange rule filings to list shares of trusts holding Ether as commodity-based ETPs, appears to have implicitly accepted that Ether is not a security. The SEC staff has also provided informal assurances via no action letter to a handful of promoters that their digital assets are not securities. On the other hand, the SEC has brought enforcement actions against the issuers and promoters of several other digital assets on the basis that the digital assets in question are securities, including Fund Components. More recently, the SEC has also brought enforcement actions against Digital Asset Trading Platforms for allegedly operating unregistered securities exchanges on the basis that certain of the digital assets traded on their platforms are securities. 
 For example, in June 2023, the SEC brought the Binance Complaint and the Coinbase Complaint alleging violations of a variety of securities laws. In its complaints, the SEC asserted that SOL, ADA, MATIC, FIL, ATOM, SAND, MANA, ALGO, AXS, COTI, CHZ, FLOW, ICP, NEAR, VGX, DASH and NEXO, are securities under the federal securities laws. In addition, in November 2023, the SEC brought the Kraken Complaint, alleging that Kraken operated as an unregistered securities exchange, brokerage and clearing agency, and in its complaint the SEC again asserted that SOL and various other digital assets are securities under the federal securities laws . In July 2024, the SEC amended the Binance Complaint to remove its claims asserting that SOL, ADA, MATIC, FIL, ATOM, SAND, MANA, ALGO, AXS and COTI are securities under the federal securities laws. However, there can be no guarantee that the SEC will not bring similar claims involving these or other digital assets in the future. 
 35 

Whether a digital asset is a security under the federal securities laws depends on whether it is included in the lists of instruments making up the definition of security in the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Investment Company Act. Digital assets as such do not appear in any of these lists, although each list includes the terms investment contract and note, and the SEC has typically analyzed whether a particular digital asset is a security by reference to whether it meets the tests developed by the federal courts interpreting these terms, known as the Howey and Reves tests, respectively. For many digital assets, whether or not the Howey or Reves tests are met is difficult to resolve definitively, and substantial legal arguments can often be made both in favor of and against a particular digital asset qualifying as a security under one or both of the Howey and Reves tests. Adding to the complexity, the SEC staff has indicated that the security status of a particular digital asset can change over time as the relevant facts evolve, though recent arguments advanced in ongoing litigation may suggest that the SEC no longer believes the status of a digital asset can change over time. 
 As part of determining whether a Fund Component is a security for purposes of the federal securities laws, the Manager takes into account a number of factors, including the various definitions of security under the federal securities laws and federal court decisions interpreting elements of these definitions, such as the U.S. Supreme Court s decisions in the Howey and Reves cases and their progeny, as well as reports, orders, press releases, public statements and speeches by the SEC, its commissioners and its staff providing guidance on when a digital asset may be a security for purposes of the federal securities laws. Finally, the Manager discusses the security status of each Fund Component with external counsel and typically receives a memorandum regarding the status of each Fund Component under the federal securities laws from them. Through this process the Manager believes that it is applying the proper legal standards in determining that the Fund Components are not securities in light of the uncertainties inherent in the Howey and Reves tests. 
 In light of these developments, and the uncertainties and fact-based nature of the analysis as to whether a Fund Component is a security under the federal securities laws, the Manager acknowledges that the SEC takes the position that certain Fund Components, including SOL and XRP, are each a security and the Manager s conclusion otherwise does not preclude legal or regulatory action based on the presence of a security. 
 As is the case with the Fund Components, analyses from counsel typically review the often-complex facts surrounding a particular digital asset s underlying technology, creation, use case and usage development, distribution and secondary-market trading characteristics as well as contributions of and marketing or promotional efforts by the individuals or organizations who appear to be involved in these activities, among other relevant facts, usually drawing on publicly available information. This information, usually found on the internet, often includes both information that originated with or is attributed to such individuals or organizations, as well as information from third-party sources and databases that may or may not have a connection to such individuals or organizations, and the availability and nature of such information can change over time. The Manager and counsel often have no independent means of verifying the accuracy or completeness of such information, and therefore of necessity usually must assume that such information is materially accurate and complete for purposes of the Howey and Reves analyses. After having gathered this information, counsel typically analyzes it in light of the Howey and Reves tests, in order to inform a judgment as to whether or not a federal court would conclude that the digital asset in question is or is not a security for purposes of the federal securities laws. Often, certain factors appear to support a conclusion that the digital asset in question is a security, while other factors appear to support the opposite conclusion, and in such a case counsel endeavors to weigh the importance and relevance of the competing factors. This analytical process is further complicated by the fact that, at present, federal judicial case law applying the relevant tests to digital assets is limited and in some situations inconsistent, with no federal appellate court having considered the question on the merits, as well as the fact that because each digital asset presents its own unique set of relevant facts, it is not always possible to directly analogize the analysis of one digital asset to another. Because of this factual complexity and the current lack of a well-developed body of federal case law applying the relevant tests to a variety of different fact patterns, the Manager has not in the past received, and currently does not expect that it would be able to receive, opinions of counsel stating that a particular digital asset is or is not a security for federal securities law purposes. The Manager understands that as a matter of practice, counsel is generally able to render a legal opinion only when the relevant facts are substantially ascertainable and the applicable law is both well-developed and settled. As a result, given the relative novelty of digital assets, the challenges inherent in fact-gathering for particular digital assets, and the fact that federal courts have only recently been tasked with adjudicating the applicability of federal securities law to digital assets, the Manager understands that at present counsel is generally not in a position to render a legal opinion on the securities-law status of a specific Fund Component or any other particular digital asset. 
 As such, notwithstanding the Manager s view that each of the Fund Components are not securities, the SEC has taken and a federal court may in the future take a different view as to the security status of certain Fund Components, such as SOL or XRP. If the Manager determines that a Fund Component is a security under the federal securities laws, whether that determination is initially made by the Manager itself, or because a federal court upholds an allegation that such Fund Component is a security, the Manager does not intend to permit the Fund to continue holding that Fund Component in a way that would violate the federal securities laws. Because the legal tests for determining whether a digital asset is or is not a security often leave room for interpretation, for so long as the Manager believes there to be good faith grounds to conclude that each of the Fund Components is not a security, the Manager does not intend to dissolve the Fund on the basis that any of the Fund Components could at some future point be finally determined to be a security. 
 36 

Any enforcement action by the SEC or a state securities regulator asserting that a Fund Component is a security, or a court decision to that effect, would be expected to have an immediate material adverse impact on the trading value of that Fund Component, as well as the Shares. This is because the business models behind most digital assets are incompatible with regulations applying to transactions in securities. If a digital asset is determined to be a security, it is likely to become difficult or impossible for the digital asset to be traded, cleared or custodied in the United States through the same channels used by non-security digital assets, which in addition to materially and adversely affecting the trading value of the digital asset is likely to significantly impact its liquidity and market participants ability to convert the digital asset into U.S. dollars. Any assertion that a digital asset is a security by the SEC or another regulatory authority may have similar effects. For example, the SEC has alleged that certain Fund Components are securities. In 2020 the SEC filed a complaint against the issuer of XRP, Ripple Labs, Inc., and two of its executives, alleging that they raised more than 1.3 billion through XRP sales that should have been registered under the federal securities laws, but were not. In the weeks following the SEC s complaint against XRP s issuer, XRP s market capitalization fell to less than 10 billion, which was less than half of its market capitalization in the days prior to the complaint, and certain significant market participants, including the Fund s authorized participant at the time, announced they would no longer support XRP, among other measures, including the delisting of XRP from major digital asset trading platforms. Following these developments, the Manager removed XRP from the Fund s portfolio. Subsequently, in July 2023, the District Court for the Southern District of New York held that while XRP is not a security , certain sales of XRP to certain buyers (but not other types of sales to other buyers) amounted to investment contracts under the Howey test. Following the filing of the court order, the Manager discussed the security status of XRP with external counsel and continues to believe that XRP is not a security. The District Court entered a final judgment in the case on August 7, 2024. In October 2024, the SEC filed a notice of appeal. In July 2023, another judge in the District Court for the Southern District of New York, in litigation between the SEC and the issuer of the UST and LUNA digital assets, suggested that he disagreed with the approach underlying the XRP decision. Likewise, in June and November 2023, the SEC asserted in the Binance, Coinbase and Kraken Complaints that SOL is a crypto asset security and at times that it was offered and sold as an investment contract. Following the filing of the Coinbase Complaint, Binance Complaint, and the Kraken Complaint, the Manager discussed the security status of SOL with external counsel and continues to believe that SOL is not a security. In the days following the announcement of the Binance Complaint and Coinbase Complaint, the price of various digital assets named in the Binance Complaint and the Coinbase Complaint, as well as Fund Components such as Bitcoin, Ether, and SOL, declined significantly. In September 2024, the SEC filed an enforcement action against Mango Labs, LLC, Mango DAO, and Blockworks Foundation, and in October 2024, the SEC filed an enforcement action against Cumberland DRW, LLC, in both instances describing a number of digital assets, including SOL, as examples of crypto assets that are offered and sold as securities. Despite these allegations, the Manager has discussed the security status of the Fund Components, including XRP and SOL, with external counsel and does not believe that any of the Fund Components are securities. However, in light of these developments and the uncertainties and fact-based nature of the analysis as to whether certain of such digital assets are securities under the federal securities laws, the Manager acknowledges that the SEC takes the position that one or more are securities. Nonetheless, the outcomes of such complaints and the consequent litigation is unknown and unknowable at this time and the price of these digital assets may decline as these cases advance through the federal court system. 
 The Binance Complaint, the Coinbase Complaint, the Kraken Complaint and the SEC s actions against XRP s issuer and the issuer of the UST and LUNA digital assets, as well as seemingly inconsistent views of different district court judges, underscore the continuing uncertainty around which digital assets are securities and what the correct analysis is to determine each digital asset s status. For example, the conflicting district court opinions and analyses demonstrate that factors such as how long a digital asset has been in existence, how widely held it is, how large its market capitalization is, the manner in which it is offered, sold or promoted, and whether it has actual use in commercial transactions, ultimately may have limited or no bearing on whether the SEC, a state securities regulator or any particular court will find it to be a security. 
 In addition, if a significant portion of the Fund Components are determined to be securities, the Fund could be considered an unregistered investment company under the Investment Company Act, which could necessitate the Fund s liquidation. In this case, the Fund and the Manager may be deemed to have participated in an illegal offering of investment company securities and there is no guarantee that the Manager will be able to register the Fund under the Investment Company Act at such time or take such other actions as may be necessary to ensure the Fund s activities comply with applicable law, which could force the Manager to liquidate the Fund. 
 Moreover, whether or not the Manager or the Fund were subject to additional regulatory requirements as a result of any determination that the Fund s assets include securities, the Manager may nevertheless decide to terminate the Fund, in order, if possible, to liquidate the Fund s assets while a liquid market still exists. For example, in response to the SEC s action against the issuer of XRP, certain significant market participants announced they would no longer support XRP and announced measures, including the delisting of XRP from major digital asset trading platforms, resulting in the Manager s conclusion that it was likely to be increasingly difficult for U.S. investors, including Grayscale XRP Trust (XRP), an affiliate of the Fund, to convert XRP into U.S. dollars. The Manager subsequently dissolved Grayscale XRP Trust (XRP) and liquidated its assets. Similarly, following the SEC s complaints against Binance and Coinbase in June 2023, the trading platform Robinhood and crypto service providers Revolut and Bakkt each announced that they would cease support for SOL. Furthermore, if a federal court upholds an allegation that a Fund Component is a security, the Fund itself may be terminated and, if practical, its assets liquidated.
