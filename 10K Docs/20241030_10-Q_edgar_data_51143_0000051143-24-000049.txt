 Transfer of Financial Assets 
 The company has an existing agreement with a third-party investor to sell IBM short-term commercial financing receivables on a revolving basis. This agreement previously allowed for sales up to billion. In December 2023, the company amended and renewed its agreement for a term, which reduced the limit to billion in January 2024. In addition, the company enters into agreements with third-party financial institutions to sell certain of its client financing receivables, including both loan and lease receivables, for cash proceeds. There were no material client financing receivables transferred for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 Receivables uncollected at end of period (1) 

The transfer of these receivables qualified as true sales and therefore reduced financing receivables. The cash proceeds from the sales are included in cash flows from operating activities. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the net loss, including fees, associated with the transfer of commercial financing receivables was million and million, respectively, and is included in other (income) and expense in the Consolidated Income Statement.

 Credit Quality Indicators 
 The company s credit quality indicators, which are based on rating agency data, publicly available information and information provided by customers, are reviewed periodically based on the relative level of risk. The resulting indicators are a numerical rating system that maps to Moody s Investors Service credit ratings as shown below. The company uses information provided by Moody s, where available, as one of many inputs in its determination of customer credit ratings. The credit quality of the customer is evaluated based on these indicators and is assigned the same risk rating whether the receivable is a lease or a loan.

The credit facilities also include a covenant on the company s consolidated net interest expense ratio, which cannot be less than to 1.0, as well as a cross default provision with respect to other defaulted indebtedness of at least million. 
 The company is in compliance with its debt covenants and provides periodic certifications to its lenders. The failure to comply with its debt covenants could constitute an event of default with respect to the debt to which such provisions apply.

These notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the company. 
 
 IIC is a 100 percent owned finance subsidiary of IBM, as described by the SEC in Rule 13-01(a)(4)(vi) of Regulation S-X, the primary purpose of which is to borrow money to be made available for the benefit of IBM and its affiliates.

 billion and billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. A portion of these amounts was available to the company s business partners to support their working capital needs. In addition, the company has committed to provide future financing to its clients in connection with client purchase agreements for billion and billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The allowance for these commitments is recorded in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and was not material at September 30, 2024. 
 The following is a description of arrangements in which the company is the guarantor. 
 The company is a party to a variety of agreements pursuant to which it may be obligated to indemnify the other party with respect to certain matters. Typically, these obligations arise in the context of contracts entered into by the company, under which the company customarily agrees to hold the party harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations and covenants related to such matters as title to the assets sold, certain intellectual property rights, specified environmental matters, third-party performance of nonfinancial contractual obligations and certain income taxes. In each of these circumstances, payment by the company is conditioned on the other party making a claim pursuant to the procedures specified in the particular contract, the procedures of which typically allow the company to challenge the other party s claims. While indemnification provisions typically do not include a contractual maximum on the company s payment, the company s obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of time and/or nature of claim, and in some instances, the company may have recourse against third parties for certain payments made by the company. 
 It is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under these or similar agreements due to the conditional nature of the company s obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Historically, payments made by the company under these agreements have not had a material effect on the company s business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 In addition, the company guarantees certain loans and financial commitments. The maximum potential future payment under these financial guarantees and the fair value of these guarantees recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was not material.

 countries, IBM is involved, either as plaintiff or defendant, in a variety of ongoing claims, demands, suits, investigations, tax matters and proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of its business. The company is a leader in the information technology industry and, as such, has been and will continue to be subject to claims challenging its IP rights and associated products and offerings, including claims of copyright and patent infringement and violations of trade secrets and other IP rights. In addition, the company enforces its own IP against infringement, through license negotiations, lawsuits or otherwise. Further, given the rapidly evolving external landscape of cybersecurity, AI, privacy and data protection laws, regulations and threat actors, the company and its clients have been and will continue to be subject to actions or proceedings in various jurisdictions. Also, as is typical for companies of IBM s scope and scale, the company is party to actions and proceedings in various jurisdictions involving a wide range of labor and employment issues (including matters related to contested employment decisions, country-specific labor and employment laws, and the company s pension, retirement and other benefit plans), as well as actions with respect to contracts, product liability, cybersecurity, data privacy, securities, foreign operations, competition law and environmental matters. These actions may be commenced by a number of different parties, including competitors, clients, current or former employees, government and regulatory agencies, stockholders and representatives of the locations in which the company does business. Some of the actions to which the company is party may involve particularly complex technical issues, and some actions may raise novel questions under the laws of the various jurisdictions in which these matters arise.

 Whether any losses, damages or remedies finally determined in any claim, suit, investigation or proceeding could reasonably have a material effect on the company s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows will depend on a number of variables, including: the timing and amount of such losses or damages; the structure and type of any such remedies; the significance of the impact any such losses, damages or remedies may have in the Consolidated Financial Statements; and the unique facts and circumstances of the particular matter that may give rise to additional factors. While the company will continue to defend itself vigorously, it is possible that the company s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be affected in any particular period by the resolution of one or more of these matters. 
 The following is a summary of the more significant legal matters involving the company. 
 On June 8, 2021, IBM sued GlobalFoundries U.S. Inc. (GF) in New York State Supreme Court for claims including fraud and breach of contract relating to a long-term strategic relationship between IBM and GF for researching, developing, and manufacturing advanced semiconductor chips for IBM. GF walked away from its obligations and IBM is now suing to recover amounts paid to GF, and other compensatory and punitive damages, totaling more than billion. On September 14, 2021, the court ruled on GF s motion to dismiss. On April 7, 2022, the Appellate Division unanimously reversed the lower court s dismissal of IBM s fraud claim. IBM s claims for breaches of contract, promissory estoppel, and fraud are proceeding. 
 On June 2, 2022, a putative class action lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging that the IBM Pension Plan miscalculated certain joint and survivor annuity pension benefits by using outdated actuarial tables in violation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. IBM, the Plan Administrator Committee, and the IBM Pension Plan are named as defendants. On April 4, 2024, the court dismissed the lawsuit with prejudice. On May 6, 2024, the plaintiffs appealed. 
 As disclosed in the Kyndryl Form 10 and subsequent Kyndryl public filings, in 2017 BMC Software, Inc. (BMC) filed suit against IBM in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas in a dispute involving IBM s former managed infrastructure services business. On May 30, 2022, the trial court awarded BMC million in direct damages and million in punitive damages, plus interest and fees. On April 30, 2024, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed and rendered the district court s judgment in IBM s favor. IBM does not believe it has any material exposure relating to this litigation. No material liability or related indemnification asset has been recorded by IBM. 
 The company is party to, or otherwise involved in, proceedings brought by U.S. federal or state environmental agencies under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), known as Superfund, or laws similar to CERCLA. Such statutes require potentially responsible parties to participate in remediation activities regardless of fault or ownership of sites. The company is also conducting environmental investigations, assessments or remediations at or in the vicinity of several current or former operating sites globally pursuant to permits, administrative orders or agreements with country, state or local environmental agencies, and is involved in lawsuits and claims concerning certain current or former operating sites. 
 The company is also subject to ongoing tax examinations and governmental assessments in various jurisdictions. Along with many other U.S. companies doing business in Brazil, the company is involved in various challenges with Brazilian tax authorities regarding non-income tax assessments and non-income tax litigation matters. The total potential amount related to all these matters for all applicable years is approximately million. The company believes it will prevail on these matters and that this amount is not a meaningful indicator of liability.

 As discussed in note 5, Acquisitions Divestitures, the company completed the acquisition of StreamSets and webMethods from Software AG on July 1, 2024. In December 2023, in connection with the announcement of the acquisition, the company entered into foreign exchange call option contracts (the call options) with a total notional amount of billion billion) and a total premium paid of million. The call options were accounted for as non-hedge derivatives and expired on June 18, 2024 with economic value. From June 18, 2024 to June 28, 2024, the company replaced the majority of the options with foreign currency forward contracts with notional values of billion to cover the economic exposure. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the company recorded a realized loss of million in other (income) and expense in the Consolidated Income Statement. At December 31, 2023, the fair value of the call options was million, and was included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. There were associated derivatives outstanding at September 30, 2024. 
 In its hedging programs, the company may use forward contracts, futures contracts, interest-rate swaps, cross-currency swaps, equity swaps, and options depending upon the underlying exposure. The company is not a party to leveraged derivative instruments. 
 A brief description of the major hedging programs, categorized by underlying risk, follows.

 billion. The weighted-average remaining maturity of these instruments at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was approximately years and years, respectively. These interest-rate contracts were accounted for as fair value hedges. The company did have any cash flow hedges relating to this program outstanding at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 Forecasted Debt Issuance 
 The company is exposed to interest rate volatility on future debt issuances. To manage this risk, the company may use instruments such as forward starting interest-rate swaps to lock in the rate on the interest payments related to the forecasted debt issuances. There were instruments outstanding at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 In connection with cash flow hedges of forecasted interest payments related to the company's borrowings, the company recorded net losses (before taxes) of million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, in AOCI. The company estimates that million of the deferred net losses (before taxes) on derivatives in AOCI at September 30, 2024 will be reclassified to net income within the next 12 months, providing an offsetting economic impact against the underlying interest payments. 
 Foreign Exchange Risk 
 Long-Term Investments in Foreign Subsidiaries (Net Investment) 
 A large portion of the company s foreign currency denominated debt portfolio is designated as a hedge of net investment in major foreign subsidiaries to reduce the volatility in stockholders equity caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates in the subsidiaries' functional currency with respect to the U.S. dollar. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the carrying value of debt designated as hedging instruments was billion and billion, respectively. The company also uses foreign currency derivatives, such as forward contracts and long-term cross currency swaps, for this risk management purpose. In the third quarter of 2024, the company entered into long-term cross currency swaps designated as hedge of net investment instruments with a billion notional value that the company also relates to its U.S. dollar denominated debt. The interim net interest cash settlements of these swaps will be included as cash flows from operating activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. There were no net interest settlements during the three months ended September 30, 2024. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the total notional amount of derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges was billion and billion, respectively. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the weighted-average remaining maturity of these instruments was approximately years and years, respectively. 
 
 Anticipated Royalties and Cost Transactions 
 The company s operations generate significant nonfunctional currency, third-party vendor payments and intercompany payments for royalties and goods and services among the company s non-U.S. subsidiaries and with the company. In anticipation of these foreign currency cash flows and in view of the volatility of the currency markets, the company selectively employs foreign exchange forward contracts to manage its currency risk. These forward contracts are accounted for as cash flow hedges. At September 30, 2024, the maximum remaining length of time over which the company hedged its exposure is approximately . At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the total notional amount of

 billion and billion, respectively. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the weighted-average remaining maturity of these instruments was approximately years and years, respectively. 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, in connection with cash flow hedges of anticipated royalties and cost transactions, the company recorded net losses (before taxes) of million and net gains (before taxes) of million, respectively, in AOCI. The company estimates that million of deferred net losses (before taxes) on derivatives in AOCI at September 30, 2024 will be reclassified to net income within the next 12 months, providing an offsetting economic impact against the underlying anticipated transactions. 
 Foreign Currency Denominated Borrowings 
 The company is exposed to exchange rate volatility on foreign currency denominated debt. To manage this risk, the company may employ forward contracts or cross-currency swaps to convert the principal, or principal and interest payments of foreign currency denominated debt, to debt denominated in the functional currency of the borrowing entity. These derivatives are accounted for as cash flow hedges. At September 30, 2024, the maximum length of time remaining over which the company hedged its exposure was approximately . At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the total notional amount of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges of foreign-currency denominated debt was billion and billion respectively. 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, in connection with previously terminated cross-currency swaps, the company recorded net losses (before taxes) of million and million, respectively, in AOCI, of which million of deferred net losses (before taxes) is estimated to be reclassified to net income within the next 12 months. 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, in connection with forward contracts, the company has recorded net losses (before taxes) of million and net gains (before taxes) of million, respectively, in AOCI. Approximately million of losses (before taxes) related to the initial forward points excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness is expected to be amortized to other (income) and expense within the next 12 months. 
 Subsidiary Cash and Foreign Currency Asset/Liability Management 
 The company uses its Global Treasury Centers to manage the cash of its subsidiaries. These centers principally use currency swaps to convert cash flows in a cost-effective manner. In addition, the company uses forward contracts to economically hedge, on a net basis, the foreign currency exposure of a portion of the company s nonfunctional currency assets and liabilities. The terms of these forward and swap contracts are generally less than . The changes in the fair values of these contracts and of the underlying hedged exposures are generally offsetting and are recorded in other (income) and expense in the Consolidated Income Statement. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the total notional amount of derivative instruments in economic hedges of foreign currency exposure was billion and billion, respectively. 
 Equity Risk Management 
 The company is exposed to market price changes in certain broad market indices and in the company s own stock primarily related to certain obligations to employees. Changes in the overall value of these employee compensation obligations are recorded in SG A expense in the Consolidated Income Statement. Although not designated as accounting hedges, the company utilizes derivatives, including equity swaps and futures, to economically hedge the exposures related to its employee compensation obligations. The derivatives are linked to the total return on certain broad market indices or the total return on the company s common stock, and are recorded at fair value with gains or losses also reported in SG A expense in the Consolidated Income Statement. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the total notional amount of derivative instruments in economic hedges of these compensation obligations was billion and billion, respectively.

 of service will participate in the RBA. Each eligible employee's RBA is credited monthly with an amount equal to percent of their eligible pay with no employee contribution required. Under the RBA, eligible employees earn percent interest through 2026 and starting in 2027, will earn interest equal to the 10-year U.S. Treasury Yield, subject to a percent minimum per year through 2033. Eligible employees also received a salary increase effective January 1, 2024 for the difference between the IBM 401(k) Plus contribution percent they were previously entitled to receive and the percent RBA pay credit. Since the RBA is a component of the Qualified PPP, it is funded by the trust for the Qualified PPP along with all other benefits in the Qualified PPP. 
 As a result of this change, inactive pension plan participants no longer represent substantially all of the participants in the Qualified PPP. As required by U.S. GAAP, this changed the amortization period of unrecognized actuarial losses from the average remaining life expectancy of inactive plan participants to the average remaining service period of active plan

 million and million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the prior-year periods, primarily driven by the change in amortization period. There was no impact to funded status, retiree benefit payments or funding requirements of the Qualified PPP due to the change in amortization period. 
 Over the past several years, the company has taken actions to reduce the risk profile of its worldwide retirement-related plans, while at the same time increasing the funded status of the plans. As described in note 1, "Basis of Presentation," in September 2024, the Qualified PPP irrevocably transferred to the Insurer approximately billion of the Qualified PPP's defined benefit pension obligations and related plan assets, thereby reducing the company's pension obligations and assets by the same amount. This transaction further de-risks the company's retirement-related plans by eliminating the potential for the company to make future cash contributions to fund this portion of pension obligations being transferred to the Insurer. After the transaction, the Qualified PPP remained in an overfunded position as of September 30, 2024. 
 Upon issuance of the group annuity contract, the Qualified PPP's benefit obligations and administration for approximately of the company's Plan participants and beneficiaries (the "Transferred Participants") were transferred to the Insurer. Under the group annuity contract, the Insurer has made an irrevocable commitment, and will be solely responsible, to pay the pension benefits of each Transferred Participant that are due on or after January 1, 2025. The transaction resulted in no changes to the amount of benefits payable to the Transferred Participants. The company recognized a one-time, non-cash, pre-tax pension settlement charge of billion billion net of tax) in the third quarter of 2024 primarily related to the accelerated recognition of actuarial losses included within AOCI in the Consolidated Statement of Equity. As a result of this transaction, the company was required to remeasure the benefit obligations and plan assets of the Qualified PPP. The remeasurement reflects the use of the current discount rate and actual return on plan assets as of August 31, 2024, applying the practical expedient to remeasure plan assets and obligations as of the nearest calendar month-end date.

 In the fourth quarter of 2024, IBM Canada Ltd.

The purchase of the group annuity contracts was completed October 29, 2024 and was funded directly by assets of the Plan and required no cash contribution from IBM. As a result of the transaction, the company expects to recognize a one-time, non-cash, pre-tax, pension settlement charge of approximately billion in the fourth quarter of 2024. The actual charge will depend on finalization of the actuarial and other assumptions.

 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS 
 OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION 
 FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 
 
 Snapshot 
 
 Organization of Information: 
 In the first quarter of 2024, we made changes to our organizational structure and management system to better align our portfolio to the market, increase transparency and improve segment comparability to peers. These changes did not impact our Consolidated Financial Statements, but did impact our reportable segments. The segments are reported on a comparable basis for all periods. In addition, due to the removal of certain components of segment profitability we also updated the title of our segment performance metric from pre-tax income from continuing operations to segment profit. Refer to note 4, "Segments," for additional information on our reportable segments. 
 In September 2024, the IBM Qualified Personal Pension Plan (Qualified PPP) purchased a nonparticipating single premium group annuity contract from The Prudential Insurance Company of America (the Insurer) and irrevocably transferred to the Insurer approximately 6 billion of the Qualified PPP s defined benefit pension obligations and related plan assets, thereby reducing our pension obligations and assets by the same amount. The group annuity contract was purchased using assets of the Qualified PPP and no additional funding contribution was required from the company. As a result of this transaction we recognized a one-time, non-operating, non-cash, pre-tax pension settlement charge of 2.7 billion 2.0 billion net of tax) in the third quarter of 2024, primarily related to the accelerated recognition of accumulated actuarial losses of the Qualified PPP. As the charge was non-operating and non-cash, it did not impact our operating (non-GAAP) earnings or cash flow results. Refer to note 18, Retirement-Related Benefits, for additional information. 
 Within the tables presented, certain columns and rows may not add due to the use of rounded numbers for disclosure purposes. Percentages presented are calculated from the underlying whole-dollar amounts. Certain prior-period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. This is annotated where applicable. 
 
 Currency : 
 The references to adjusted for currency or at constant currency in the Management Discussion do not include operational impacts that could result from fluctuations in foreign currency rates. When we refer to growth rates at constant currency or adjust such growth rates for currency, it is done so that certain financial results can be viewed without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of its business performance. Financial results adjusted for currency are calculated by translating current period activity in local currency using the comparable prior-year period s currency conversion rate. This approach is used for countries where the functional currency is the local currency. Generally, when the dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies, the growth at constant currency rates or adjusting for currency will be higher or lower than growth reported at actual exchange rates. Refer to Currency Rate Fluctuations for additional information. 
 
 Operating (non-GAAP) Earnings: 
 In an effort to provide better transparency into the operational results of the business, supplementally, management separates business results into operating and non-operating categories. Operating earnings from continuing operations is a non-GAAP measure that excludes the effects of certain acquisition-related charges, intangible asset amortization, expense resulting from basis differences on equity method investments, retirement-related costs and their related tax impacts. Due to the unique, non-recurring nature of the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (U.S. tax reform), management characterizes the one-time provisional charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 and adjustments to that charge as non-operating. Adjustments primarily include true-ups, accounting elections and any changes to regulations, laws or audit adjustments that affect the recorded one-time charge. For acquisitions, operating (non-GAAP) earnings exclude the amortization of purchased intangible assets and acquisition-related charges such as in-process research and development, transaction costs, applicable retention, restructuring and related expenses, tax charges related to acquisition integration and pre-closing charges, such as financing costs. These charges are excluded as they may be inconsistent in amount and timing from period to period and are significantly impacted by the size, type and frequency of our acquisitions. Given its unique and temporary nature, management has also characterized as non-operating expense, the mark-to-market impact on the

 foreign exchange derivative contracts entered into prior to the acquisition of StreamSets and webMethods from SoftwareAG to economically hedge the foreign currency exposure related to the purchase price of this acquisition. These derivative contracts expired by June 28, 2024. This impact was recorded in other (income) and expense in the Consolidated Income Statement and reflects the realized loss from the changes in fair value of these derivative contracts. All other spending for acquired companies is included in both earnings from continuing operations and in operating (non-GAAP) earnings. For retirement-related costs, management characterizes certain items as operating and others as non-operating, consistent with GAAP. We include defined benefit plan and nonpension postretirement benefit plan service costs, multi-employer plan costs and the cost of defined contribution plans in operating earnings. Non-operating retirement-related costs include defined benefit plan and nonpension postretirement benefit plan amortization of prior service costs, interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortized actuarial gains/losses, the impacts of any plan curtailments/settlements including the impact of a one-time, non-cash, pre-tax settlement charge of 2.7 billion 2.0 billion net of tax) resulting from the transfer to the Insurer of a portion of the Qualified PPP s defined benefit pension obligations and related plan assets in the third quarter of 2024 and pension insolvency costs and other costs. Non-operating retirement-related costs are primarily related to changes in pension plan assets and liabilities which are tied to financial market performance, and we consider these costs to be outside of the operational performance of the business. 
 Overall, management believes that supplementally providing investors with a view of operating earnings as described above provides increased transparency and clarity into both the operational results of the business and the performance of our pension plans; improves visibility to management decisions and their impacts on operational performance; enables better comparison to peer companies; and allows us to provide a long-term strategic view of the business going forward. In addition, these non-GAAP measures provide a perspective consistent with areas of interest we routinely receive from investors and analysts. Our reportable segment financial results reflect pre-tax operating earnings from continuing operations, consistent with our management and measurement system.

 Macroeconomic Environment: 
 Our business portfolio positions us well to capture market opportunities in challenging macroeconomic times. Our diversification across geographies, industries, clients and business mix and our recurring revenue base provides some stability in revenue, profit and cash generation. Clients and partners continue to leverage technology to allow businesses to scale, drive efficiencies, fuel growth and gain competitive advantage. The economic uncertainty caused by temporary factors including geopolitical issues, upcoming elections, and the changing landscape of interest rates and inflation is leading clients to manage their discretionary spending, which has impacted certain areas of our Consulting business. The consulting market remains dynamic, with significant opportunity as clients and partners prepare for AI. 
 In the first nine months of 2024, movements in global currencies continued to impact our reported year-to-year revenue and profit. We execute hedging programs which defer, but do not eliminate, the impact of currency. The (gains)/losses from these hedging programs are reflected primarily in other income and expense. Refer to Currency Rate Fluctuations, for additional information. 
 
 Financial Performance Summary Three Months Ended September 30: 
 In the third quarter of 2024, we reported 15.0 billion in revenue and a net loss from continuing operations of 0.3 billion, which includes the impact of a one-time, non cash, pre-tax pension settlement charge of 2.7 billion 2.0 billion net of tax). The pension settlement charge was the result of the transfer to the Insurer of a portion of the Qualified PPP s defined benefit pension obligations and related plan assets, an action we took to further reduce the risk profile of our worldwide retirement-related plans. Our operating (non-GAAP) earnings for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 2.2 billion. Diluted loss per share from continuing operations was 0.34 as reported, including an impact of 2.18 from the pension settlement charge, and diluted earnings per share was 2.30 on an operating (non-GAAP) basis. We generated 2.9 billion in cash from operations and 2.1 billion in free cash flow, and delivered shareholder returns of 1.5 billion in dividends. Our third-quarter performance reflects accelerated Software revenue growth, expanded gross profit margin, and strong cash generation, demonstrating the continued success of our hybrid cloud and AI strategy, and the strength of our diversified business model. We continued to focus on the fundamentals of our business which, combined with our cash generation, position us to continue investing in innovation and expertise across the portfolio while continuing to return value to shareholders through dividends. 
 
 Total revenue grew 1.5 percent as reported and 2 percent adjusted for currency compared to the prior-year period, led by Software. Software delivered revenue growth of 9.7 percent as reported and 9.6 percent adjusted for currency, driven by both Hybrid Platform Solutions and Transaction Processing, and reflecting the repositioning of our software portfolio around Hybrid Cloud, Automation, Data and Transaction Processing. Hybrid Platform Solutions revenue was up 9.8 percent as reported and 9.7 percent adjusted for currency, led by growth in Red Hat, Automation and Data AI. Transaction Processing grew 9.4 percent as reported and adjusted for currency, reflecting growing capacity, solid renewal

 rates, and continued customer interest in our AI solutions. Consulting revenue decreased 0.5 percent as reported but was flat adjusted for currency, as it continued to be impacted by a dynamic market environment as clients reprioritize spending given macroeconomic uncertainty. Infrastructure revenue decreased 7.0 percent year to year as reported and 6.7 percent adjusted for currency, reflecting product cycle dynamics. 
 From a geographic perspective, Americas revenue decreased 3.0 percent as reported (2.4 percent adjusted for currency). Europe/Middle East/Africa (EMEA) increased 8.5 percent as reported (6.8 percent adjusted for currency). Asia Pacific increased 3.1 percent as reported (4.5 percent adjusted for currency). 
 Gross margin of 56.3 percent increased 1.9 points year to year with continued margin expansion driven by revenue growth, portfolio mix and ongoing productivity actions. Operating (non-GAAP) gross margin of 57.5 percent increased 2.1 points compared to the prior-year period due to the same dynamics. 
 Total expense and other (income) increased 50.0 percent in the third quarter of 2024 versus the prior-year period primarily driven by the pension settlement charge of 2.7 billion described above, higher workforce rebalancing charges and higher spending reflecting our continued investment in portfolio innovation to drive our strategy. This was partially offset by a gain from the sale of certain QRadar SaaS assets and the benefits from productivity and the actions we have taken to transform our operations. Total operating (non-GAAP) expense and other (income) increased 4.1 percent year to year, driven primarily by the factors described above, excluding the pension settlement charge. 
 
 Pre-tax loss from continuing operations was 0.8 billion in the third quarter of 2024 compared with pre-tax income of 1.9 billion in the prior-year period, and pre-tax margin was down 18.1 points year to year to (5.4) percent. The continuing operations benefit from income taxes in the third quarter of 2024 was 0.5 billion, compared to a provision for income taxes of 0.2 billion in the third quarter of 2023. Net loss from continuing operations was 0.3 billion compared with net income of 1.7 billion in the prior-year period and the net income/(loss) from continuing operations margin of (2.1) percent was down 13.7 points year to year. This year-to-year performance was primarily driven by the transfer to the Insurer of a portion of the Qualified PPP s defined benefit pension obligations and related plan assets which resulted in a pension settlement charge of 2.7 billion 2.0 billion net of tax) in the third quarter of 2024 as described above. 
 Operating (non-GAAP) pre-tax income from continuing operations of 2.5 billion increased 8.2 percent compared to the third quarter of 2023 and the operating (non-GAAP) pre-tax margin from continuing operations increased 1.0 point to 16.6 percent primarily driven by our revenue growth and gross margin performance and the benefits from productivity and the actions taken to transform our operations, partially offset by our continued investments to drive innovation. The operating (non-GAAP) provision for income taxes was 0.3 billion in both the third quarter of 2024 and the third quarter of 2023. Operating (non-GAAP) net income from continuing operations of 2.2 billion increased 6.1 percent and the operating (non-GAAP) net income margin from continuing operations of 14.4 percent was up 0.6 points year to year. 
 Diluted loss per share from continuing operations was 0.34 in the third quarter of 2024, including an impact of 2.18 from the pension settlement charge, compared to diluted earnings per share of 1.86 in the prior-year period. Operating (non-GAAP) diluted earnings per share of 2.30 increased 4.5 percent compared to the third quarter of 2023. Operating (non-GAAP) earnings per share was calculated using 938.4 million shares, which includes 14.9 million dilutive potential shares under our stock-based compensation plans and contingently issuable shares. Due to the GAAP net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024, these dilutive potential shares were excluded from the GAAP loss per share calculation as the effect would have been antidilutive. Refer to note 7, Earnings Per Share of Common Stock, for additional information. 
 
 Cash provided by operating activities was 2.9 billion in the third quarter of 2024, a decrease of 0.2 billion compared to the third quarter of 2023 and free cash flow was 2.1 billion, an increase of 0.4 billion versus the prior-year period. Net cash used in investing activities of 1.6 billion decreased 0.4 billion and net cash used in financing activities of 2.8 billion decreased 0.4 billion compared to the third quarter of 2023.

Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was 3.30 as reported, including an impact of 2.18 from the pension settlement charge, and diluted earnings per share was 6.41 on an operating (non-GAAP) basis. We generated 9.1 billion in cash from operations and 6.6 billion in free cash flow, and delivered shareholder returns of 4.6 billion in dividends.

The continuing operations benefit from income taxes for the first nine months of 2024 was 0.6 billion, compared to a provision for income taxes of 0.7 billion for the first nine months of 2023. The current-year tax benefit was primarily driven by the resolution of certain tax audit matters in the first quarter and the pension settlement charge in the third quarter.

 Results of Continuing Operations 
 
 Segment Details 
 As discussed in the "Organization of Information" section, we made changes to our organizational structure and management system in the first quarter of 2024. With these changes, we revised our reportable segments and updated the title of our segment performance metric from pre-tax income from continuing operations to segment profit. 
 The following tables present each reportable segment s revenue and gross margin results, followed by an analysis of the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 versus the third quarter and first nine months of 2023 reportable segments results.

 Software revenue of 6,524 million increased 9.7 percent as reported (9.6 percent adjusted for currency) in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the prior-year period, reflecting accelerated revenue growth in total Software and in Hybrid Platform Solutions as compared to the quarterly year-to-year growth rates in the first-half 2024. This performance reflects the repositioning of Software around our key growth platforms, including Hybrid Cloud, Automation, Data and Transaction Processing, where we deliver a differentiated value proposition to our clients to help address their most pressing needs. We delivered strong growth in our recurring revenue base and have momentum from innovation across our Software portfolio. Red Hat revenue growth accelerated in the third quarter and contributed approximately 3.5 points of growth to total Software. The combination of innovation and recurring revenue also contributed approximately 3.5 points to total Software revenue growth. In addition, our focused acquisition strategy contributed approximately 3 points to our total Software revenue growth. 
 Hybrid Platform Solutions revenue of 4,600 million increased 9.8 percent as reported (9.7 percent adjusted for currency) in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the prior-year period, driven primarily by strong growth in Red Hat, Automation and Data AI. Red Hat revenue increased 13.7 percent as reported (13.8 percent adjusted for currency) in the third quarter of 2024. We gained market share across each of our key solutions, as OpenShift and Ansible each continued to grow year-to-year revenue greater than 20 percent in the third quarter, and RHEL had double-digit, year-to-year growth in the quarter. This revenue growth within Red Hat reflects the demand for our hybrid cloud solutions as clients continue to prioritize application modernization on OpenShift containers and Ansible automation to optimize their IT spend and reduce operational complexity. We had strong acceleration in Red Hat's subscription business this quarter compared to the second-quarter 2024 and the consumption-based services business returned to growth in the third quarter compared to the prior-year period. Automation revenue increased 13.2 percent as reported (12.9 percent adjusted for currency) in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the prior-year period driven by our Software-as-a-Service subscription offerings such as AI Ops and Management, which includes the revenue contribution from Apptio. The Apptio acquisition closed in August last year and continues to build strong synergies with our automation capabilities and broader software portfolio, driving continued growth in signings and annual recurring revenue. Data AI revenue increased 5.3 percent as reported (5.1 percent adjusted for currency) driven by continued growth in watsonx including our AI Assistant for Customer Care. 
 Across Hybrid Platform Solutions, our annual recurring revenue (ARR) was 14.9 billion. ARR is a key performance metric management uses to assess the health and growth trajectory of our Hybrid Platform Solutions business within the Software segment. The metric was updated in the first quarter of 2024 to reflect the organizational changes described in note 4, Segments, and to simplify the calculation. ARR is calculated by using the current quarter s recurring revenue and then multiplying that value by four. This value includes the following consumption models: (1) software subscription agreements, including committed term licenses, (2) as-a-service arrangements such as SaaS and PaaS, and (3) maintenance and support contracts. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue as this performance metric and its inputs may not represent revenue that will be recognized in future periods. 
 Transaction Processing revenue of 1,925 million increased 9.4 percent as reported and adjusted for currency in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the prior-year period, reflecting the growing client demand for workload capacity, solid renewal rates, and continued customer interest in our new generative AI product, watsonx Code Assistant for Z.

 For the first nine months of 2024, Software revenue of 19,162 million increased 7.5 percent as reported (8.0 percent adjusted for currency) compared to the same period in 2023, driven by solid growth in Hybrid Platform Solutions, led by Automation and Red Hat, and Transaction Processing. This performance reflects the continued demand for the high-value capabilities within our Hybrid Platform Solutions offerings and the value of our mission-critical software portfolio within Transaction Processing which supports growing workloads on our hardware platforms. This revenue performance also reflects the investments we have been making in Software, both organically and in acquisitions.

Segment profit of 1,969 million increased 14.4 percent and segment profit margin of 30.2 percent increased 1.2 points compared to the prior-year period. The segment profit growth reflects our operating leverage driven by our revenue performance and portfolio mix and the benefits of our continued productivity actions, partially offset by key investments in software innovation. 
 
 For the first nine months of 2024, gross profit margin increased 0.8 points to 83.1 percent, compared to the first nine months of 2023. Segment profit of 5,582 million increased 15.1 percent and segment profit margin of 29.1 percent increased 1.9 points compared to the prior-year period. The segment profit growth for the first nine months of 2024 was driven by the same factors described for the third quarter.

Consulting revenue of 5,152 million decreased 0.5 percent as reported (0.2 percent adjusted for currency) in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the prior-year period, reflecting a challenging macroeconomic environment which is impacting client buying behavior. At the same time, clients are reprioritizing their IT budgets to prepare for generative AI. We continued to build a solid generative AI business as we partner with our clients to design and scale AI solutions and develop new ways of working. This early momentum in engaging with clients as they architect their AI strategies is establishing IBM Consulting as a strategic partner of choice. In the third quarter, our Red Hat consulting practice, which helps clients optimize how they build, deploy, and manage applications for a hybrid cloud environment continued to grow revenue at a double-digit rate on a year-to-year basis in the third quarter, with the highest level of single-quarter signings since the acquisition of Red Hat. In addition, Consulting revenue generated through our strategic partnerships continued to contribute strong revenue growth. 
 In the third quarter of 2024, Business Transformation revenue of 2,327 million increased 1.6 percent as reported (1.7 percent adjusted for currency) compared to the prior-year period driven by strength in transformation projects for data, finance and supply chain. 
 Technology Consulting revenue of 905 million decreased 4.0 percent as reported (3.6 percent adjusted for currency) in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the prior-year period, driven by a decline in our application development offerings, partially offset by solid growth in our cloud-based application services across modernization development and management services. 
 Application Operations revenue of 1,921 million decreased 1.2 percent as reported (0.8 percent adjusted for currency) compared to the prior-year period, reflecting a reprioritization of spending by clients for on-premise customized services. 
 
 For the first nine months of 2024, Consulting revenue of 15,517 million decreased 0.5 percent as reported, but grew 1.1 percent adjusted for currency, led by strength in our Business Transformation offerings with revenue growth year to year driven by transformation projects for data, finance and supply chain. We had double-digit revenue growth in both our Red Hat and strategic partner driven practices in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the prior-year period. Throughout 2024, the uncertainty of the macroeconomic environment has delayed client spending on smaller, discretionary projects, however, we had solid demand for larger digital transformation projects.

In the third quarter of 2024, Consulting gross profit margin of 28.4 percent increased 0.9 points on a year-to-year basis. Segment profit of 559 million decreased 1.2 percent and segment profit margin of 10.9 percent decreased 0.1 points year to year. The gross profit margin expansion reflects the savings from productivity actions we have taken. Our segment profit margin improved 2.0 points compared to the second-quarter 2024 reflecting the benefits from our productivity actions, but was essentially flat year to year. 
 
 For the first nine months of 2024, Consulting gross profit margin of 26.7 percent increased 0.4 points compared to the prior-year period. Segment profit of 1,447 million decreased 1.9 percent and segment profit margin of 9.3 percent decreased 0.1 points in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the prior-year period. The nine-month margin performance was driven primarily by the same factors as described above for the third quarter.

 In the third quarter of 2024, Consulting signings decreased 8.7 percent as reported and 9.3 percent adjusted for currency. Clients are reprioritizing their IT budgets to prepare for investments in generative AI, while the challenging macroeconomic environment is impacting client spending, particularly on more discretionary projects. We continued to have solid demand for large digital transformations that contributed to the 5.4 billion in signings in the quarter. Our book-to-bill ratio for the trailing twelve-months was 1.14. Book-to-bill represents the ratio of IBM Consulting signings to its revenue over the same period. The metric is a useful indicator of the demand of our business over time.

 Management Discussion (continued) 

 Signings are management s initial estimate of the value of a client s commitment under a services contract within IBM Consulting. There are no third-party standards or requirements governing the calculation of signings. The calculation used by management involves estimates and judgments to gauge the extent of a client s commitment, including the type and duration of the agreement, and the presence of termination charges or wind-down costs. 
 Contract extensions and increases in scope are treated as signings only to the extent of the incremental new value. Total signings can vary over time due to a variety of factors including, but not limited to, the timing of signing a small number of larger contracts. Signings associated with an acquisition will be recognized on a prospective basis. 
 Management believes the estimated values of signings disclosed provide an indication of our forward-looking revenue. Signings are used to monitor the performance of the business and viewed as useful information for management and shareholders. The conversion of signings into revenue may vary based on the types of services and solutions, contract duration, customer decisions, and other factors, which may include, but are not limited to, the macroeconomic environment.

Infrastructure revenue of 3,042 million decreased 7.0 percent as reported and 6.7 percent adjusted for currency in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the prior-year period, reflecting the impact of product cycle dynamics in both Hybrid Infrastructure and Infrastructure Support. 
 Hybrid Infrastructure revenue of 1,765 million decreased 9.1 percent as reported and 9.2 percent adjusted for currency in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the prior-year period. Within Hybrid Infrastructure, IBM Z decreased 18.7 percent as reported (18.6 percent adjusted for currency) reflecting the z16 program cycle dynamics. Ten quarters into the program, z16 continued to exceed the total revenue generated by each prior cycle and resulted in a greater than 30 percent increase in program-to-date installed MIPs. Our clients continue to face increased demands for workloads given rapid business expansion, complex regulatory environments, and increased cybersecurity threats and attacks. IBM Z remains uniquely positioned to address these demands with the technologies that our latest program offers, which includes embedded AI at scale, quantum-safe security, and cloud-native development for hybrid cloud. Distributed Infrastructure revenue decreased 2.8 percent as reported and 3.0 percent adjusted for currency, driven primarily by declines in Cloud platform revenue, as well as a decrease in Power systems revenue reflecting product cycle dynamics, partially offset by solid growth in our Storage business as we continued to take market share in storage technology.

 Infrastructure Support revenue of 1,277 million decreased 3.9 percent as reported (3.1 percent adjusted for currency) in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the prior-year period, driven by product cycle dynamics and volume decline in support of non-IBM equipment. 
 
 For the first nine months of 2024, Infrastructure revenue of 9,764 million decreased 2.3 percent as reported (1.2 percent adjusted for currency) compared to the prior-year period, driven by declines in Infrastructure Support partially offset by growth in Hybrid Infrastructure. Within Hybrid Infrastructure, Distributed Infrastructure revenue increased in the first nine months of 2024 driven primarily by growth in Storage and Power systems, partially offset by a revenue decline in IBM Z reflecting the program cycle. Infrastructure Support revenue declined in the first nine months of 2024 driven by volume declines in support of non-IBM equipment and IBM product cycle dynamics.

 (1) Recast to reflect January 2024 segment changes. 

Infrastructure gross profit margin of 55.0 percent increased 1.2 points in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the prior-year period, with margin expansion in Infrastructure Support and Hybrid Infrastructure. The increase in margin within Infrastructure Support was driven by product mix. The increase in margin within Hybrid Infrastructure was driven primarily by margin expansion in both IBM Z and Distributed Infrastructure, partially offset by portfolio mix. In the third quarter of 2024, Infrastructure segment profit of 422 million decreased 13.8 percent and segment profit margin of 13.9 percent decreased 1.1 points compared to the prior-year period. The year-to-year decrease in segment profit and margin reflects the revenue decline due to product cycle dynamics in IBM Z and Distributed Infrastructure and continued investments in innovation for our next generation of products. This performance was partially offset by higher IP and custom development income year to year and savings from productivity actions. 
 
 For the first nine months of 2024, gross profit margin of 55.3 percent increased 1.3 points compared to the prior-year period, driven by margin expansion in Hybrid Infrastructure and Infrastructure Support. Within Hybrid Infrastructure, we had margin improvement across our hardware platforms. The gross profit margin improvement in Infrastructure Support reflects the benefits from productivity and cost management. Infrastructure segment profit of 1,387 million decreased 9.3 percent and segment profit margin of 14.2 percent decreased 1.1 points in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the prior-year period. This performance reflects the same factors described for the third quarter, and also included approximately a half of a point of impact from currency.

 Total pre-tax retirement-related plan cost increased by 2,771 million compared to the third quarter of 2023, primarily driven by an increase in curtailments/settlements driven by the impact of a one-time, non-cash pension settlement charge 2,725 million), an increase in recognized actuarial losses 118 million) and higher service cost 97 million), partially offset by lower cost of defined contribution plans 134 million) and lower interest costs 69 million). Total cost for the first nine months of 2024 increased by 2,869 million compared to the first nine months of 2023, primarily driven by the impact of a one-time, non-cash pension settlement charge 2,725 million), increase in recognized actuarial losses 375 million) and higher service cost 289 million), partially offset by lower cost of defined contribution plans 426 million) and lower interest costs 159 million). 
 As described in the Operating (non-GAAP) Earnings section, management characterizes certain retirement-related costs as operating and others as non-operating. Utilizing this characterization, operating retirement-related costs in the third quarter of 2024 were 257 million, a decrease of 38 million compared to the third quarter of 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by lower cost of defined contribution plans 134 million), partially offset by higher service cost 97 million) due to the U.S. retirement plan changes effective January 1, 2024. For the first nine months of 2024, operating retirement-related costs were 767 million, a decrease of 138 million compared to the prior-year period, primarily driven by lower cost of defined contribution plans 426 million), partially offset by higher service cost 289 million) due to U.S. retirement plan changes effective January 1, 2024. Including the related employee salary increase effective January 1, 2024, the net impact to our operating costs from the U.S. retirement plan changes was immaterial for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Refer to note 18, "Retirement-Related Benefits," for additional information. Non-operating costs/(income) was 2,797 million of cost in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 12 million of income in the prior-year period and for the first nine months of 2024 non-operating costs/(income) was 2,991 million of cost compared to 16 million of income in the prior-year period. The year-to-year changes were primarily driven by an increase in curtailments/settlements including the impact of a one-time, non-cash pension settlement charge resulting from the transfer to the Insurer of a portion of the Qualified PPP in the current quarter and an increase in recognized actuarial losses due to the change in amortization period of the Qualified PPP effective January 1, 2024 as described in note 18, "Retirement-Related Benefits," partially offset by lower interest cost s. 
 
 Taxes 
 The continuing operations benefit from income taxes in the third quarter of 2024 was 485 million, compared to a provision for income taxes of 159 million in the third quarter of 2023. The current-year tax benefit was primarily driven by the transfer to the Insurer of a portion of the Qualified PPP s defined benefit pension obligations and related plan assets.

 Management Discussion (continued) 

 The operating (non-GAAP) provision for income taxes in the third quarter of 2024 was 332 million, compared to 268 million in the third quarter of 2023. 
 The continuing operations benefit from income taxes in the first nine months of 2024 was 597 million, compared to a provision for income taxes of 702 million in the first nine months of 2023. The current-year tax benefit was primarily driven by the resolution of certain tax audit matters in the first quarter and the transfer to the Insurer of a portion of the Qualified PPP s defined benefit pension obligations and related plan assets in the third quarter. The operating (non-GAAP) provision for income taxes in the first nine months of 2024 was 942 million, compared to 861 million in the first nine months of 2023. 
 IBM s tax provision and effective tax rate are impacted by recurring factors including the geographical mix of income before taxes, incentives, specific transactions, changes in unrecognized tax benefits and discrete tax events, such as the settlement of income tax audits and changes in or new interpretations of tax laws. The GAAP tax provision and effective tax rate could also be affected by adjustments to the previously recorded charges for U.S. tax reform attributable to any changes in law, new regulations and guidance, and audit adjustments, among others. 
 During the fourth quarter of 2020, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) concluded its examination of the company s U.S. income tax returns for 2013 and 2014 and issued a final Revenue Agent s Report (RAR) proposing adjustments related to certain cross-border transactions that occurred in 2013. The company filed its IRS Appeals protest in the first quarter of 2021, and in October of 2023, the IRS issued a revised RAR. These adjustments, if sustained, would increase the company s income subject to tax by approximately 4.2 billion, with tax calculated at the relevant federal income tax rate. The company continues to strongly disagree with the IRS position and will pursue resolution at IRS Appeals and then court, if necessary. In the first quarter of 2024, the IRS concluded its examination of the company's U.S. income tax returns for 2015 and 2016 and issued a final RAR proposing adjustments related to certain cross-border transactions that occurred in 2015. The proposed adjustments, if sustained, would increase the company s income subject to tax by approximately 1.2 billion, with tax calculated at the relevant federal income tax rate. The company strongly disagrees with the IRS position and filed its IRS Appeals protest in the second quarter of 2024. In the fourth quarter of 2021, the IRS commenced its audit of the company s U.S. tax returns for 2017 and 2018. The company anticipates that this audit will be completed in 2024. With respect to major U.S. state and foreign taxing jurisdictions, the company is generally no longer subject to tax examinations for years prior to 2016. The company is no longer subject to income tax examination of its U.S. federal tax return for years prior to 2013. The open years contain matters that could be subject to differing interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations as it relates to the amount and/or timing of income, deductions, and tax credits. Although the outcome of tax audits is always uncertain, the company believes that adequate amounts of tax, interest and penalties have been provided for any adjustments that are expected to result for these years. 
 The company is involved in a number of income tax-related matters in India challenging tax assessments issued by the India Tax Authorities. As of September 30, 2024, the company had recorded 589 million as prepaid income taxes in India. A significant portion of this balance represents cash tax deposits paid over time to protect the company s right to appeal various income tax assessments made by the India Tax Authorities. Although the outcome of tax audits is always uncertain, the company believes that adequate amounts of tax, interest and penalties have been provided for any adjustments that are expected to result for these years. 
 The amount of unrecognized tax benefits at September 30, 2024 is 8,615 million which can be reduced by 613 million associated with timing adjustments, potential transfer pricing adjustments, and state income taxes. The net amount of 8,002 million, if recognized, would favorably affect the company s effective tax rate. 
 
 Financial Position 
 
 Dynamics 
 Our balance sheet at September 30, 2024 continues to provide us with financial flexibility to support and invest in the business. 
 Cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities at September 30, 2024 were 13,719 million, an increase of 257 million compared to December 31, 2023. Total debt of 56,579 million at September 30, 2024 was flat compared to December 31, 2023. We continue to manage our debt levels while being acquisitive and without sacrificing investments in our business.

 In the first nine months of 2024, we generated 9,115 million in cash from operating activities, a decrease of 353 million compared to the first nine months of 2023 due to a decrease in cash provided by financing receivables; partially offset by performance-related improvements within net income. Our free cash flow for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 6,586 million, an increase of 1,463 million versus the prior year. Refer to pages 80 through 81 for additional information on free cash flow. Our cash generation enables us to continue investing in innovation and expertise across the portfolio, while returning value to shareholders through dividends. We invested 2,748 million in acquisitions and we returned 4,601 million to shareholders through dividends in the first nine months of 2024. 
 
 Our pension plans were well funded at the end of 2023, with worldwide qualified plans funded at 111 percent. Overall pension funded status as of the end of September 2024 was fairly consistent with year-end 2023, as the transfer to the Insurer of approximately 6 billion of the Qualified PPP s defined benefit pension obligations and related plan assets, reduced the company s pension obligations and assets by the same amount. After the settlement and remeasurement, the Qualified PPP remained in an overfunded position at September 30, 2024. Refer to note 18, "Retirement-Related Benefits," for additional information.

 Excluding receivables classified as held for sale, the total IBM receivables provision coverage was 1.7 percent at September 30, 2024, a decrease of 50 basis points compared to December 31, 2023. The decrease in coverage is due to declines in reserves primarily driven by write-offs; partially offset by the overall decrease in total receivables. The majority of the write-offs during the year were related to receivables which had been previously reserved and were considered uncollectible as the related customer is no longer in operation, and/or there was no reasonable expectation of repossession or additional collections primarily due to their aging. In addition, it includes about 60 million of previously reserved receivables from discontinued operations that were written off in the current year.

 The increase in noncurrent assets of 1,463 million 1,516 million adjusted for currency) was primarily due to an increase in goodwill and intangible assets from the StreamSets and webMethods acquisition; partially offset by a decrease in long-term financing receivables as a result of declines from seasonally higher year-end balances. 
 Long-term debt increased 2,859 million 2,738 million adjusted for currency) primarily driven by our first-quarter 2023 debt issuances; partially offset by reclassifications to short-term debt to reflect upcoming maturities. 
 Noncurrent liabilities (excluding debt) decreased 409 million 419 million adjusted for currency) primarily driven by a decrease in retirement and nonpension postretirement benefit obligations.

 Total debt of 56,579 million increased 32 million (decreased 74 million adjusted for currency) from December 31, 2023, primarily driven by maturities of 6,491 million; partially offset by proceeds from issuances of 5,705 million and currency impacts. 
 Non-Financing debt of 46,224 million increased 1,557 million 1,395 million adjusted for currency) from December 31, 2023, primarily due to the first-quarter debt issuances; partially offset by maturities. 
 
 Financing segment debt of 10,355 million decreased 1,525 million 1,469 million adjusted for currency) from December 31, 2023, primarily due to lower funding requirements associated with financing receivables. 
 Financing provides financing solutions predominantly for IBM s external client assets, and the debt used to fund Financing assets is primarily comprised of intercompany loans. Total debt changes generally correspond with the level of client and commercial financing receivables, the level of cash and cash equivalents, the change in intercompany and external payables and the change in intercompany investment from IBM. The terms of the intercompany loans are set by the company to substantially match the term, currency and interest rate variability underlying the financing receivable. The Financing debt-to-equity ratio remained at 9.0 to 1 at September 30, 2024. 
 I nterest expense relating to debt supporting Financing s external client and internal business is included in the Financing Results of Operations and in note 4, Segments. In the Consolidated Income Statement, the external debt-related interest expense supporting Financing s internal financing to the company is classified as interest expense. 
 
 Equity 
 Total equity increased 1,917 million from December 31, 2023, primarily driven by an increase from net income of 3,109 million which includes the impact of a one-time, non-cash pension settlement charge of 2,039 million net of tax, a

 decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss of 2,343 million driven by retirement-related benefit plans primarily due to the pension settlement charge, and common stock issuances of 1,370 million; partially offset by dividends paid of 4,601 million. 
 
 Cash Flow 
 Our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows on page 7 , are summarized in the table below. These amounts also include the cash flows associated with the Financing business.

 Net cash provided by operating activities decreased 353 million as compared to the first nine months of 2023. This was due to a decrease in cash provided by financing receivables; partially offset by performance-related improvements within net income. Changes in operating assets and liabilities, net of acquisitions/divestitures in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows also includes the tax effect related to the pension settlement charge in the third quarter of 2024, which represents a non-cash adjustment to reconcile net income/(loss) to cash from operating activities. 
 Net cash used in investing activities decreased 6,348 million primarily driven by lower net purchases of marketable securities and other investments, a decrease in cash used in acquisitions mainly driven by the Apptio acquisition in the previous year, partially offset by the StreamSets and webMethods acquisition in the current quarter, an increase in cash provided by divestitures from the sale of The Weather Company assets in the first quarter of 2024 and an increase in cash from disposition of property, plant and equipment/other mainly driven by proceeds from the sale of certain QRadar SaaS assets in the current quarter. 
 Net cash used in Financing activities increased by 5,249 million primarily driven by a higher level of net debt issuances in the prior - year period. 
 
 Looking Forward 
 Technology has proven to be a fundamental source of competitive advantage. Continued demand for technology will serve as a major driving force behind global economic and business growth as businesses look to scale, offer better services, drive efficiencies and seize new market opportunities. AI-driven productivity, in particular, continues to be a top priority for businesses for both cost reductions and new revenue opportunities. 
 Enterprise AI continues to gain traction. The AI portfolio we have built is designed to give clients a comprehensive set of tools and we believe we are well positioned to help clients scale AI. We have infused AI across the business, from the tools clients use to manage and optimize their hybrid cloud environments, to the tools to deploy AI within their enterprise, to Infrastructure and Consulting, there is AI innovation within all of our segments. For example, in Software, our broad suite of automation products such as Apptio and watsonx Orchestrate are leveraging AI. Red Hat is bringing AI to the platform with innovation such as OpenShift AI and RHEL AI. In Transaction Processing we are experiencing continued customer interest in our new generative AI product, watsonx Code Assistant for Z. In Infrastructure, IBM Z is equipped with real time AI inferencing capabilities. We continue to see Infrastructure play a larger role as clients bring AI to their data. In Consulting, our experts are helping clients design and execute AI strategies and are also leveraging AI technologies in the delivery of those services. 
 We are committed to an open innovation ecosystem around AI, to help our clients maximize flexibility and leverage skills, and IBM with Red Hat can be a key driver of open-source AI. Earlier this year, we open-sourced IBM s Granite family of large language models and we see parallels to how Linux became dominant in the enterprise server space as a

 result of the speed and innovation offered by open source. Red Hat and IBM also launched InstructLab to evolve and improve AI models. Our partner ecosystem remains essential to both AI and hybrid cloud growth and we continue to progress strategic partnerships with industry leaders. In August, we completed the previously announced sale of certain IBM QRadar SaaS assets, which is part of a partnership to deliver AI-powered security solutions using watsonx with Palo Alto. The sale of these assets resulted in a benefit to cash from operating activities, cash from investing activities and to free cash flow in the third quarter. However, for full-year 2024 we expect only a nominal benefit to cash flows due to payments for structural actions we have taken and foregone profit from the QRadar business. 
 We continue to invest in emerging technologies, bringing new innovations to market. In early October 2024, we opened Europe s first IBM Quantum Data Center. This is the second IBM quantum data center deployed globally which will greatly advance our goal of expanding access to the world s most performant quantum computers. As we remain focused on portfolio optimization, we closed the divestiture of The Weather Company assets in January. To complement our portfolio, we completed eight acquisitions in the first nine months of 2024, including the acquisition of the StreamSets and webMethods assets from Software AG in July. This acquisition brings together leading capabilities in integration, API management and data ingestion. 
 On April 24, 2024, we announced our intent to acquire all of the outstanding shares of HashiCorp. The combination of IBM s and HashiCorp s combined portfolios will help clients manage growing application and infrastructure complexity and create a comprehensive end-to-end hybrid cloud platform designed for the AI era. Under the terms of the definitive agreement, HashiCorp shareholders on record immediately prior to the effective time on the closing date will receive 35 per share in cash, representing a total enterprise value of approximately 6.4 billion. On July 15, 2024, HashiCorp stockholders voted to approve the merger with IBM. The transaction is expected to close by the end of 2024, subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. Upon closing, HashiCorp will be integrated into the Software segment. 
 In the first nine months of 2024, we continued to invest organically and inorganically, bring new products and innovation to market, expand our ecosystem and drive productivity across our business. Our performance over the first nine months of 2024 is a proof point of this progress. We have made solid progress in transitioning our portfolio to a higher growth, more focused business that has delivered sustained revenue growth and strong cash generation a business well positioned for the future. 
 
 Retirement-Related Plans 
 In the fourth quarter of 2024, IBM Canada Ltd. IBMC purchased two separate nonparticipating single premium group annuity contracts from RBC Life Insurance Company ("RBC Insurance") and Brookfield Annuity Company ("Brookfield") (collectively the "Insurers") that will transfer to the Insurers approximately 1.2 billion of the IBMC IBM Retirement Plan s (the Plan defined benefit pension obligations for approximately 6,000 Plan participants and beneficiaries whose last province of employment was in British Columbia, Ontario or Quebec and who were receiving a payment under the Plan on July 1, 2024 (the Transferred Participants ). The purchase of the group annuity contracts was completed October 29, 2024 and was funded directly by assets of the Plan and required no cash contribution from IBM. 
 Under the group annuity contracts, each insurer has made an irrevocable commitment, and will be solely responsible to pay the pension benefits of each Transferred Participant that are due on and after May 1, 2025 as follows: RBC Insurance will be responsible for 25 percent of the pension benefit and Brookfield will be responsible for 75 percent of the pension benefit. RBC Insurance will be the lead administrator. The transaction will result in no changes to the amount of benefits payable to the Transferred Participants. 
 As a result of the transaction, the company expects to recognize a one-time, non-cash, pre-tax, non-operating pension settlement charge of approximately 0.4 billion in the fourth quarter of 2024. The actual charge will depend on finalization of the actuarial and other assumptions. This charge will not impact the company s fourth-quarter or full-year 2024 operating (non-GAAP) profit or free cash flow. 
 Our pension plans are well funded. Contributions for all retirement-related plans are expected to be approximately 1.4 billion in 2024, of which 0.1 billion generally relates to legally required contributions to non-U.S. defined benefit and multi-employer plans. The expected decrease of 0.4 billion in total contributions for 2024 is primarily driven by ongoing dynamics of our retirement-related plans, including the change in U.S. retirement-related benefits effective January 1, 2024 described in note 18, "Retirement-Related Benefits." We expect 2024 pre-tax retirement-related plan cost to be 
 78 

Table of Contents 
 Management Discussion (continued) 

 approximately 4.6 billion, an increase of approximately 3.4 billion compared to 2023, primarily driven by an increase in curtailments/settlements including the impact of a one-time, non-cash pension settlement charge in the third quarter of 2024 and the expected settlement charge associated with the transfer of a portion of IBM Canada's defined benefit pension obligations as described above, which was completed on October 29, 2024. Within total retirement-related plan cost, operating retirement-related plan cost is expected to be approximately 1.0 billion, a decrease of approximately 0.2 billion compared to 2023. Non-operating retirement-related plan cost is expected to be approximately 3.6 billion, an increase of approximately 3.6 billion compared to 2023, due to the pension charges described above and an increase in recognized actuarial losses, partially offset by lower interest costs. 
 
 Currency Rate Fluctuations 
 Changes in the relative values of non-U.S. currencies to the USD affect our financial results and financial position. At September 30, 2024, currency changes resulted in assets and liabilities denominated in most local currencies being translated into fewer dollars than at year-end 2023. We use financial hedging instruments to limit specific currency risks related to foreign currency-based transactions. 
 Movements in currency, and the fact that we do not hedge 100 percent of our currency exposures, will result in a currency impact to our revenues, profit and cash flows throughout 2024. We execute a hedging program which defers, versus eliminates, the volatility of currency impacts on our financial results. During periods of sustained movements in currency, the marketplace and competition adjust to the changing rates over time. 
 We translate revenue, cost and expense in our non-U.S. operations at current exchange rates in the reported period. References to adjusted for currency or constant currency reflect adjustments based upon a simple mathematical formula. However, this constant currency methodology that we utilize to disclose this information does not incorporate any operational actions that management could take to mitigate fluctuating currency rates. 
 Based on the currency rate movements in the third quarter of 2024, revenue from continuing operations increased 1.5 percent as reported and 2 percent at constant currency compared to the prior year. In the first nine months of 2024, revenue from continuing operations increased 1.6 percent as reported and 3 percent at constant currency, compared to the same period in 2023. In the third quarter of 2024, the impact from currency translation and hedging to year-to-year pre-tax income growth and operating (non-GAAP) pre-tax income growth was immaterial. In the first nine months of 2024, currency translation and hedging negatively impacted year-to-year pre-tax income growth and operating (non-GAAP) pre-tax income growth by approximately 200 million. From a segment perspective, in the third quarter of 2024, the impact from currency translation and hedging to our segments profit margin year-to-year growth was immaterial. In the first nine months of 2024, currency translation and hedging impacted our Infrastructure segment profit margin year-to-year growth by about half a point. We view these amounts as a theoretical maximum impact to our as-reported financial results. Hedging and certain underlying foreign currency transaction gains and losses are allocated to our segment results. Considering the operational responses mentioned above, movements of exchange rates, and the nature and timing of hedging instruments, it is difficult to predict future currency impacts on any particular period. 
 For non-U.S. subsidiaries and branches that operate in U.S. dollars or whose economic environment is highly inflationary, translation adjustments are reflected in results of operations. Generally, we manage currency risk in these entities by linking prices and contracts to U.S. dollars.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 In our 2023 Annual Report, on pages 30 to 32, there is a discussion of our liquidity including two tables that present three years of data. The table presented on page 30 includes net cash from operating activities, cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term marketable securities, and the size of our global credit facilities for each of the past three years. For the nine months ended, or at, as applicable, September 30, 2024, those amounts are 9.1 billion of net cash from operating activities, 13.7 billion of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term marketable securities and 10.0 billion in global credit facilities, respectively. While we have no current plans to draw on these credit facilities, they are available as back-up liquidity. 
 The major rating agencies' ratings on our debt securities at September 30, 2024 appear in the following table and remain unchanged from June 30, 2024. 
 IBM Ratings: Standard and Poor's Moody s Investors Service Fitch Ratings Senior long-term debt A- A3 A- Commercial paper A-2 Prime-2 F1 
 We have financial flexibility, supported by our strong liquidity position and cash flows, to operate at a single A credit rating. At September 30, 2024, our debt level was flat from December 31, 2023 driven by maturities; partially offset by proceeds from issuances and currency impacts. 
 We do not have ratings trigger provisions in our debt covenants or documentation, which would allow the holders to declare an event of default and seek to accelerate payments thereunder in the event of a change in credit rating. Our debt covenants are well within the required levels. Our contractual agreements governing derivative instruments contain standard market clauses which can trigger the termination of the agreement if our credit rating were to fall below investment grade. At September 30, 2024, the fair value of those instruments that were in a liability position was 500 million, before any applicable netting, and this position is subject to fluctuations in fair value period to period based on the level of our outstanding instruments and market conditions. We have no other contractual arrangements that, in the event of a change in credit rating, would result in a material adverse effect on our financial position or liquidity. 
 We prepare our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows in accordance with applicable accounting standards for cash flow presentation on page 7 of this Form 10-Q and highlight causes and events underlying sources and uses of cash in that format on page 77 . For the purpose of running its business, IBM manages, monitors and analyzes cash flows in a different manner. 
 Management uses free cash flow as a measure to evaluate its operating results, plan shareholder return levels, strategic investments and assess its ability and need to incur and service debt. The entire free cash flow amount is not necessarily available for discretionary expenditures. We define free cash flow as net cash from operating activities less the change in Financing receivables and net capital expenditures, including the investment in software and other asset sales (e.g., certain QRadar SaaS assets). A key objective of the Financing business is to generate strong returns on equity, and our Financing receivables are the basis for that growth. Accordingly, management considers Financing receivables as a profit-generating investment, not as working capital that should be minimized for efficiency. Therefore, management includes presentations of both free cash flow and net cash from operating activities that exclude the effect of Financing receivables.

 Management Discussion (continued) 

 The following is management s view of cash flows for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023 prepared in a manner consistent with the description above. 
 (Dollars in millions) For the nine months ended September 30: 2024 2023 Net cash from operating activities per GAAP 9,115 9,468 Less: change in Financing receivables 1,824 3,119 Net cash from operating activities, excluding Financing receivables 7,292 6,349 Capital expenditures, net (705) (1,226) Free cash flow 6,586 5,123 Acquisitions (2,748) (4,945) Divestitures 705 (4) Dividends (4,601) (4,522) Non-Financing debt 693 7,572 Other (includes Financing net receivables and Financing debt) (379) (1,068) Change in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term marketable securities 257 2,156 
 In the first nine months of 2024, we generated 6.6 billion in free cash flow, an increase of 1.5 billion versus the prior-year period. The increase was primarily driven by performance-related improvements within net income and lower net capital expenditures driven by the cash proceeds from the sale of certain QRadar SaaS assets in the current quarter. Proceeds of 0.4 billion from the sale were included within capital expenditures, net and the remaining 0.1 billion were included within net cash from operating activities in the table above. Refer to note 5, Acquisitions Divestitures, for additional information. 
 
 Events that could temporarily change the historical cash flow dynamics discussed previously and in our 2023 Annual Report include significant changes in operating results, material changes in geographic sources of cash, unexpected adverse impacts from litigation, future pension funding requirements, periods of severe downturn in the capital markets or the timing of tax payments. Whether any litigation has such an adverse impact will depend on a number of variables, which are more completely described in note 14, Contingencies, in this Form 10-Q. With respect to pension funding, we expect to make legally mandated pension plan contributions to certain non-U.S. defined benefit plans of approximately 100 million in 2024. Contributions related to all retirement-related plans are expected to be approximately 1.4 billion in 2024. Refer to "Retirement-Related Plans" for additional information. Financial market performance could increase the legally mandated minimum contributions in certain non-U.S. countries that require more frequent remeasurement of the funded status. We are not quantifying any further impact from pension funding because it is not possible to predict future movements in the capital markets or changes in pension plan funding regulations. In 2024, we are not legally required to make any contributions to the U.S. defined benefit pension plans. 
 Our cash flows are sufficient to fund our current operations and obligations, including investing and financing activities such as dividends and debt service. When additional requirements arise, we have several liquidity options available. These options may include the ability to borrow additional funds at reasonable interest rates and utilizing our committed global credit facilities. Our overall shareholder payout remains at a comfortable level and we remain fully committed to our long-standing dividend policy.

 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, financing revenue decreased 2.5 percent as reported (1.3 percent adjusted for currency) compared to the prior-year period. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, financing revenue decreased 4.1 percent as reported (3.1 percent adjusted for currency) compared to the prior-year period. These declines were primarily driven by a reduction in used equipment sales. 
 Financing segment profit decreased 5.9 percent to 86 million and 0.5 percent to 254 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared to the prior-year period. The decreases in segment profit for both periods were primarily due to a reduction in used equipment sales. Financing segment profit margin decreased 1.7 points to 47.5 percent and increased 1.7 points to 46.9 percent in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, compared to the prior-year period.

 The percentage of Financing segment receivables reserved was 1.3 percent at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 We continue to apply our rigorous credit policies. Approximately 75 percent of the total external portfolio was with investment grade clients, an increase of 3 points as compared to December 31, 2023. This investment grade percentage is based on the credit ratings of the companies in the portfolio and reflects certain mitigation actions taken to reduce the risk to IBM.

 (3) Average of the ending equity for Financing for the last two quarters and four quarters, for the three months ended September 30 and for the nine months ended September 30, respectively. 
 Return on equity was 23.5 percent compared to 27.7 percent for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. The decrease was driven by a decrease in net income. Return on equity was 23.0 percent compared to 23.4 percent for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in net income partially offset by a lower average equity balance. 
 Residual Value 
 The following table presents the recorded amount of unguaranteed residual value for sales-type and direct financing leases at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. In addition, the table presents the run out of when the unguaranteed residual value assigned to equipment on leases at September 30, 2024 is expected to be returned to the company. The unguaranteed residual value for operating leases at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was not material.

Due to the GAAP net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2024, these dilutive potential shares were excluded from the GAAP loss per share calculation as the effect would have been antidilutive. The difference in share count resulted in an additional (0.04) reconciling item.

Exhibit 10.1 International Business Machines Corporation Annual Incentive Program Effective January 1, 2023, as amended effective January 1, 2024 1. Purpose IBM s Annual Incentive Program AIP is sponsored by International Business Machines Corporation to motivate and reward executives whose performance, leadership, teamwork, and contribution drive IBM s business. This plan document for AIP replaces any other AIP documentation, effective for the performance year beginning January 1, 2023. 2. Definitions For purposes of this plan document, the following terms have the given meanings unless the context requires otherwise, as determined by the Administrator: (a) Administrator means the Company s chief human resources officer or such other person(s) identified as having such administrator responsibility by the Board or the Compensation Committee. (b) Award means the incentive compensation awarded by IBM under Section 4. An Award may be payable or paid in cash and/or in equity-based awards issued under a Company long-term performance plan. (c) Board means the Board of Directors of the Company. (d) CEO means the Chief Executive Officer of the Company. (e) Code means the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. (f) Company means the International Business Machines Corporation. (g) Compensation Committee means the Compensation Committee of the Board. (h) Eligible Executive means a banded executive or other employee, but in each case only to the extent identified and communicated to as eligible for an Award for the particular performance year. (i) IBM means the Company together with its subsidiaries and affiliates, including subsidiaries of subsidiaries and partnerships and other business ventures in which IBM has an equity interest. (j) Performance Period means the calendar year or such other period identified by the Company over which performance is measured. (k) Section 409A means Section 409A of the Code. 

IBM Annual Incentive Program 2 3. Eligibility The Company will select and designate as Eligible Executives those employees of IBM eligible to participate in AIP for a specified Performance Period. Eligibility for AIP or a payment made under AIP in one year is not a guarantee of eligibility or payment in a subsequent year. 4. Award and Performance Conditions For each Performance Period, the Company may determine incentive goals, formulas and factors for any Awards granted to Eligible Executives. Awards may have an established target, where the amount of an Eligible Executive s target Award is based on that Eligible Executive s salary as of a particular date, a fixed dollar amount, or as otherwise determined by the Company. The incentive goals, formulas and factors may be based on a combination of the Company s business results, business unit results (as applicable) and individual performance. The performance goals may differ from Eligible Executive to Eligible Executive and from award to award. The incentive goals, formulas and factors, and any other terms and conditions, applicable to the Award may include quantitative and/or qualitative metrics and may be subject to modifiers based on other factors, which may be set forth in documentation outside this plan document that (a) is not inconsistent with the terms and conditions of this plan document, and (b) references AIP. The goals and performance factors with respect to an Award are subject to change at any time during the performance year. 5. Determination of Performance and Payment of Award The Company will determine performance and overall bonus payouts at the end of the Performance Period. After the Company announces its annual earnings, final scores for the Company and each relevant business unit pool are established. Except as otherwise provided by the Compensation Committee, the CEO has discretion to adjust business unit AIP funding up or down based on qualitative metrics Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this plan document, IBM may, in its sole discretion and at any time up to the date of payment, increase, reduce or eliminate an Eligible Executive s Award. 6. Timing of Payment of Award An amount payable pursuant to an Award will be paid at such time or times following the end of the Performance Period as determined by the Company. Effective beginning with respect to the Performance Period coinciding with the 2023 calendar year, except as otherwise determined by the Company, payment to Eligible Executives compensated on the Company s U.S. payroll will be made during the month of April following the end of the Performance Period. For eligible executives not compensated on the Company s U.S. payroll, AIP payments generally are made in April following the end of the Performance Period or else are made at such other times as determined by IBM for each local jurisdiction. 7. Employment Conditions, Offset, and Other Terms Additional terms and conditions for receipt and retention of AIP may be set forth in documentation outside this plan document that (a) is not inconsistent with the terms and conditions of this plan document, and (b) references AIP. Except as otherwise provided in such documentation: 

IBM Annual Incentive Program 3 (a) Eligible Executives compensated on the Company s U.S. payroll must be in active employment at the end of the Performance Period to be eligible for an AIP payment for that performance year. (b) Eligible Executives not compensated on the Company s U.S. payroll generally must be in active employment on the date of disbursement in order to receive an AIP payment. (c) To the extent an Eligible Executive is in active employment for the full calendar year, but in an eligible position for only a portion of the Performance Period, an AIP payment if any will be prorated to reflect such shorter period of participation. (d) If an Eligible Executive is entitled to compensation for the performance of a local IBM entity by reason of legislative, regulatory or similar requirements, that Eligible Executive s AIP payment may be adjusted by IBM to take such additional payment into consideration. Such an adjustment could occur in an AIP cycle other than the year of the required compensation. 8. Forfeiture and Clawback (a) IBM may cancel, rescind, suspend, withhold or otherwise limit or restrict any AIP payments at any time if the Eligible Executive engages in any Detrimental Activity, either during employment or after termination of employment for any reason, but prior to receipt of any AIP payment, as permitted under applicable law. (b) For purposes of this Section 8, Detrimental Activity includes: (i) the rendering of services for any organization or engaging directly or indirectly in any business which is or becomes competitive with IBM, or which organization or business, or the rendering of services to such organization or business, is or becomes otherwise prejudicial to or in conflict with the interests of IBM; (ii) the disclosure to anyone outside IBM, or the use in other than IBM s business, without prior written authorization from IBM, of any confidential information or material, as defined in IBM s Agreement Regarding Confidential Information and Intellectual Property, relating to the business of IBM, acquired by the executive either during or after employment with IBM; (iii) the failure or refusal to disclose promptly and to assign to IBM, pursuant to IBM s Agreement Regarding Confidential Information and Intellectual Property, all right, title and interest in any invention or idea, patentable or not, made or conceived by the executive during employment by IBM, relating in any manner to the actual or anticipated business, research or development work of IBM or the failure or refusal to do anything reasonably necessary to enable IBM to secure a patent where appropriate in the United States and in other countries; (iv) activity that results in termination of the participant s employment for cause; 

IBM Annual Incentive Program 4 (v) a violation of any rules, policies, procedures or guidelines of IBM, including but not limited to the Company s Business Conduct Guidelines; (vi) any attempt directly or indirectly to induce any employee of IBM to be employed or perform services elsewhere or any attempt directly or indirectly to solicit the trade or business of any current or prospective customer, supplier or partner of IBM; (vii) the participant being convicted of, or entering a guilty plea with respect to, a crime, whether or not connected with IBM; or (viii) any other conduct or act determined to be injurious, detrimental or prejudicial to any interest of IBM. (c) In addition to, and notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 8, any amounts payable under AIP will be incentive compensation under the terms of and subject to any applicable IBM recovery policy as in effect from time to time. 9. Taxes and Withholding, Section 409A AIP payments are subject to applicable income and employment taxes, as determined by IBM. It is intended that amounts paid or payable under AIP comply with, or be exempt from the application of, Section 409A, and all provisions of AIP will be construed and interpreted in a manner consistent with the requirements for avoiding taxes or penalties under Section 409A. For purposes of Section 409A, each of the payments that may be made under AIP is designated as a separate payment. To the extent required by Section 409A, amounts paid under AIP to a 409A Key Employee upon such individual s 409A Separation from Service will be no earlier than the first business day that is six months after the date of the individual s 409A Separation from Service (with such terms 409A Key Employee and 409A Separation from Service having the meaning provided to them in the IBM Section 409A Umbrella Document, which is currently Appendix B to the IBM Excess 401(k) Plus Plan). 10. Plan Administration AIP is administered by the Administrator. The Administrator has all powers and discretionary authority that are necessary or appropriate to administer AIP, including, without limitation, the discretionary authority to interpret the plan document and the Awards; adopt rules for the administration, interpretation and application of AIP; and interpret, amend or revoke any such rules. Notwithstanding any other provision of this plan document or other AIP provision to the contrary, the Board or its Compensation Committee has sole authority to grant any Award to any Eligible Executive who is an officer of the Company subject to Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or such other Eligible Executive as the Committee determines. All determinations and decisions made by the Board, the Compensation Committee, the CEO, the Administrator, and any of their delegates pursuant to the provisions of this plan document or other AIP provisions will be final, conclusive, and binding on all persons, and will be given the maximum deference permitted by law. 

IBM Annual Incentive Program 5 11. Plan Document This plan document is the formal plan document for AIP. Relevant terms and conditions and rules and procedures for AIP may be set forth in documentation outside this plan document that (a) is not inconsistent with the terms and conditions of this plan document, and (b) references AIP. To the extent there is any discrepancy between the provisions of this plan document, documentation outside this plan document, or other communications regarding the terms of AIP, the Administrator has the discretionary authority to resolve such discrepancy. 12. Right to Modify or Terminate AIP IBM may cancel or change the terms of AIP at any time. This includes, without limitation, the right to suspend, replace or terminate AIP or to make changes or amendments to any of its provisions at any time and without prior notice. Such changes or amendments to AIP may be made by the Board, the Compensation Committee, or either of their respective designees. 13. Miscellaneous (a) Unfunded Bonus Program. AIP is intended to be a bonus program as defined under U.S. Department of Labor Regulation 2510.3-2(c) and will be construed and administered in accordance with such intention. AIP is an unfunded plan. Participants are and will be general creditors of the Company with respect to any Awards granted, if payable. (b) Governing Law. AIP, including this plan document, will be construed, regulated and administered under the laws of the State of New York. (c) Jurisdiction and Dispute Resolution. Except as specifically provided otherwise by IBM, any Eligible Executive or other employee claiming benefits under AIP is deemed to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the federal or state courts sitting in New York Country or Westchester Country, New York, and irrevocably waives any objection to the venue of such action, including any objection that the action has been brought in an inconvenient forum, to resolve any and all issues that may arise out of or relate to AIP or any related Award. In the event that an Eligible Employee or other employee or IBM brings an action to enforce the terms of AIP or any Award and IBM prevails, the employee shall pay all costs and expenses incurred by IBM in connection with that action, including reasonable attorneys fees, and all further costs and fees, including reasonable attorneys fees incurred by IBM in connection with collection. (d) No Employment Rights or Contract. AIP and any communication regarding AIP does not confer employment rights upon any person. No person is entitled, by virtue of AIP or any communication regarding AIP, to remain in the employ of IBM, and nothing in AIP or any communication regarding AIP restricts IBM s right to terminate the employment of any person at any time. (e) No Assignment of Benefits. AIP payments are not subject to anticipation, alienation, pledge, sale, transfer, or assignment, and any attempt to cause such amounts to be so subjected will not be recognized, other than by will or by the laws of descent and distribution. 

IBM Annual Incentive Program 6 (f) Successors. All obligations of the Company under AIP, with respect to Awards granted hereunder, will be binding on any successor to the Company, whether the existence of such successor is the result of a direct or indirect purchase, merger, consolidation, or otherwise, of all or substantially all of the business or assets of the Company. (g) Severability. In the event any provision of AIP is held to be illegal or invalid for any reason, such illegality or invalidity will not affect the remaining parts of AIP, and AIP will be construed and enforced as if such illegal or invalid provisions had never been included in AIP.
