Our cost of revenues include employee labor, excluding fringe benefit costs, and subcontractors directly associated with satisfying customer performance obligations, and the associated cost of products and third-party software that we resell to our end customers. Cost of revenues also includes depreciation and amortization of capitalized software related to delivering our solutions. Cost of revenues for the three month period ended September 30, 2024 were 29.9 million (or 86 of revenues), which is consistent as a percentage of revenues of 21.8 million (or 85 of revenues) in 2023. Included in cost of revenues is carrier costs paid on behalf of our federal government customers of approximately 22.4 million and 14.6 million for the three month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 25 Table of Contents Gross Profit. Gross profit for the three month period ended September 30, 2024 increased by 0.8 million to 4.7 million (or 14 of revenues), compared to 3.9 million (or 15 of revenues) in 2023. The slight decline in gross profit as a percentage of revenues in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period last year was related to increased Reselling and other services, which have lower gross margins and to a lesser extent increased amortization expenses as our delivery platforms are placed into service. Gross profit as a percentage of revenue excluding carrier services for the three month period ended September 30, 2024 was 38.4 compared to 35.1 in the same period last year. Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses include employee labor, excluding fringe benefit costs, and sales commissions associated with our sales force, commission fees paid non-employee sales agents and partners, and costs associated with travel and trade shows . Sales and marketing expense for the three month period ended September 30, 2024 was 0.5 million and remained relatively constant at 2 of revenues, as compared to 0.5 million to 2023. General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses include employees in finance, human resources, information technology, and other administrative support functions; employee labor not associated with any single revenue producing activity, all company fringe benefits, including paid time off, employee health and medical insurance, 401k matching contributions, and payroll taxes. General and administrative expenses also include professional services to include audit, consulting, outside legal, and outsourcing services. Certain of these expenses, including those associated with the operation of our technical infrastructure as well as components of our operating expenses, are generally less variable in nature and may not correlate to the changes in revenue. General and administrative expenses for the three month period ended September 30, 2024 were 4.3 million (or 12 of revenues), as compared to 3.9 million (or 16 of revenues) in 2023. The dollar increase during 2024 primarily relates to general inflationary pressures, which were partially offset by 120,000 less share based compensation expense in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense for the three month period ended September 30, 2024 was 260,000 as compared to 259,800 in 2023. Other Income (Expense). Other income, net for the three month period ended September 30, 2024 was 7,100 compared to other expense, net of 75,100 in 2023. The increase in other income is due to higher interest earned on cash balances and a lower level of borrowing in 2024 compared to the same period last year. Income Taxes. Income tax benefit for the three month period ended September 30, 2024 was 18,700 as compared to income tax provision of 13,300 in 2023. Income taxes were accrued at an estimated effective tax rate of 4.2 for the three month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to (1.5) for the three month period ended September 30, 2023. Net Loss. As a result of the cumulative factors described above, net loss for the three month period ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 495,900 to 425,200 compared to net loss of 921,100 for the three month period ended September 30, 2023. 26 Table of Contents Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 Revenues. Revenues for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024 were 104.9 million, an increase of 27.1 million (or 35 ), as compared to approximately 77.7 million in 2023. Our mix of revenues for the periods presented is set forth below: NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, Dollar 2024 2023 Change Carrier Services 62,198,919 42,487,299 19,711,620 Managed Services: Managed Service Fees 26,375,256 21,865,158 4,510,098 Billable Service Fees 4,101,724 4,666,084 (564,360 Reselling and Other Services 12,192,584 8,751,654 3,440,930 Total Managed Services: 42,669,564 35,282,896 7,386,668 104,868,483 77,770,195 27,098,288 Our carrier services revenue was 62.2 million, an increase of 19.7 million, compared with the same period in 2023. The increase in carrier services revenues over the same period last year is a result of the recognition of revenue from new federal government contracts signed at the end of 2023. Our managed service fees were 26.4 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024 an increase of 4.5 million, compared with the same period in 2023, primarily due to new federal customers signed in the fourth quarter of 2023. Billable service fees were 4.1 million, a decrease of 564,400 from the same period last year. The decrease is primarily due to less project work a one of our federal government customers, and lower fees in Europe. Reselling and other services increased by 3.4 million from the same period last year primarily due to increased demand and activity for items we resell to our customers. Reselling and other services are transactional in nature, and the amount and timing of revenue will vary significantly from period to period. Cost of Revenues. Our cost of revenues include employee labor, excluding fringe benefit costs, and subcontractors directly associated with satisfying customer performance obligations, and the associated cost of products and third-party software that we resell to our end customers. Cost of revenues also includes amortization of capitalized software related to delivering our solutions. Cost of revenues for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024 were 90.6 million (or 86 of revenues), as compared to 66.2 million (or 85 of revenues) in 2023. The dollar increase in cost of revenues was a result of the corresponding costs related to the resale of the new capabilities provided by a third-party partner for two large federal contracts and labor associated with the new contracts awarded in the fourth quarter of 2023. Gross Profit. Gross profit for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 14.3 million (or 14 of revenues), as compared to approximately 11.6 million (or 15 of revenues) in 2023. The Gross Profit percentage excluding carrier services was 33 for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Our gross profit percentage will vary from period to period due to our revenue mix. Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses include employee labor, excluding fringe benefit costs, and sales commissions associated with our sales force, commission fees paid non-employee sales agents and partners, and costs associated with travel and trade shows . Sales and marketing expense for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024 remained constant at 1.7 million (or 2 of revenues), compared to 1.5 million (or 2 of revenues) in 2023. General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses include employees in finance, human resources, information technology, and other administrative support functions; employee labor not associated with any single revenue producing activity, all company fringe benefits, including paid time off, employee health and medical insurance, 401k matching contributions, and payroll taxes. General and administrative expenses also include professional services to include audit, consulting, outside legal, and outsourcing services. Certain of these expenses, including those associated with the operation of our technical infrastructure as well as components of our operating expenses, are generally less variable in nature and may not correlate to the changes in revenue. General and administrative expenses for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024 were 13.3 million (or 13 of revenues), as compared to 11.7 million (or 15 of revenues) in 2023. The dollar increase during 2024 primarily relates to an increased compensation expense compared to the same period last year. We expect General and administrative expenses to increase as our business grows, but to remain constant or lower as a percentage of revenues. 27 Table of Contents Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024 was 768,600 compared to 789,300 in 2023. Other Income (Expense). Other income (expense) for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024 was an expense of (59,200) compared to expense of (198,400) in 2023. The difference relates to lower interest income from cash accounts in 2023 compared to 2024. Income Taxes. Income tax benefit for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024 was 45,000 compared to income tax provision of 68,400 in 2023. Income taxes were accrued at an estimated effective tax rate of 2.8 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024 compared to (2.6) for the nine month period ended September 30, 2023. Net Loss. As a result of the cumulative factors described above, net loss for the nine month period ended September 30, 2024 improved by 1.1 million to 1.6 million compared to a net loss of 2.7 million in the same period last year. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our immediate sources of liquidity include cash, accounts receivable, unbilled receivables and access to our credit agreement with Old Dominion National Bank. At September 30, 2024, our net working capital was approximately 2.6 million compared to 1.4 million at December 31, 2023. The increase in net working capital was primarily driven by a decrease in investments in computer hardware and software purchases and capitalized internally developed software costs during the first nine months of 2024 compared to the prior period. We believe that our existing cash on hand, our anticipated cash flows from operations, funds available under the Old Dominion Credit Facility, through its maturity on February 28, 2025, and our access to alternative financing sources will be sufficient to meet our working capital, expenditure, and contractual obligation requirements for the next 12 months. The Company is currently in compliance with its covenants although the covenants do not become effective until December 31, 2024. Cash Flows from Operating Activities For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in operations was approximately 0.8 million driven by delayed billing and collections of accounts receivables with predominately four (4) federal government customers and is partially offset by temporary payable timing differences. The delays on billing and collections relate to administrative contract actions that the Company expects to resolve in the next three to six months. In the same period in 2023, 1.8 million net cash was provided by operations. Our single largest cash operating expense is the cost of labor and the Company sponsored healthcare benefit programs. Our second largest cash operating expense is our facility costs and related technology communication costs to support delivery of our services to our customers. We lease most of our facilities under non-cancellable long term contracts that may limit our ability to reduce fixed infrastructure expenditures in the short term. Any changes to our fixed labor and/or infrastructure costs may require a significant amount of time to take effect depending on the nature of the change made. We also may experience temporary collection timing differences from time to time due to customer invoice processing delays that are often beyond our control. New customers often take more time to implement our billing processes. Further, changes within existing customers deployment of our services can cause temporary delays in billings. While we have historically been able to resolve these administrative matters timely, given the scale of several new customer implementations, failure to resolve these matters on a timely basis could negatively impact our cashflows from operations. 28 Table of Contents Cash Flows from Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities provides an indication of our long term infrastructure investments. We maintain our own technology infrastructure and may need to make additional purchases of computer hardware, software and other fixed infrastructure assets to ensure our Information Technology environment is properly maintained and can support our customer obligations. We typically fund purchases of long term infrastructure assets with available cash or capital lease financing agreements. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash provided by investing activities was approximately 0.2 million and consisted of receipt of deferred portion of proceeds from factoring arrangement offset by purchases of property and equipment. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, cash used in investing activities was approximately 0.5 million and consisted of computer hardware and software purchases and capitalized internally developed software costs, primarily associated with upgrading our ITMS platform, secure identity management technology and network operations center. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Cash provided by (used in) financing activities provides an indication of our debt financing and stock option exercises. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash used in financing activities was approximately 0.7 million and reflects line of credit advances and payments of 4.6 million, finance lease principal repayments of approximately 456,800, and withholding taxes paid on behalf of employees on net settled restricted stock awards of approximately 258,400. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, cash used in financing activities was approximately 0.4 million and reflects line of credit advances and payments of approximately 6.4 million, finance lease principal repayments of approximately 420,100, and withholding taxes paid on behalf of employees on net settled restricted stock awards of approximately 3,600. Net Effect of Exchange Rate on Cash and Equivalents For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, minor fluctuations in the Euro and U.S. dollar exchange rate increased the translated value of our foreign cash balances by approximately 4,700 as compared to last year. 29 Table of Contents Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company has no existing off-balance sheet arrangements as defined under SEC regulations.
