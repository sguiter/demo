All statements other than historical factual information are forward-looking statements, including without limitation statements regarding: projections of revenue, expenses, profit, profit margins, tax rates, tax provisions, cash flows, pension and benefit obligations and funding requirements, our liquidity position or other projected financial measures; management s plans and strategies for future operations, including statements relating to anticipated operating performance, cost reductions, restructuring activities, new product and service developments, competitive strengths or market position, acquisitions, divestitures, spin-offs or other distributions, strategic opportunities, financing activities, stock repurchases, dividends and executive compensation; growth, declines and other trends in markets we sell into; new or modified laws, regulations and accounting pronouncements; outstanding claims, legal proceedings, or the potential outcomes thereof, tax audits and assessments and other contingent liabilities; foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates; general economic and capital markets conditions; the timing of any of the foregoing; assumptions underlying any of the foregoing; and any other statements that address events or developments that we intend or believe will or may occur in the future. In some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by terminology such as believes, expects, may, will, should, anticipates or intends or the negative of such terms or other comparable terminology, or by discussions of strategy.

 All forward-looking statements, including without limitation any projections derived from management s examination of historical operating trends, are based upon our current expectations and various assumptions. Our expectations, beliefs and projections are expressed in good faith and we believe there is a reasonable basis for them, but there can be no assurance that management s expectations, beliefs and projections will be achieved. All forward-looking statements apply only as of the date made. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise forward-looking statements whether because of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by securities and other applicable law.

million, which was repaid in full in the second quarter of 2024 using available funds at HPS. During the third quarter of 2024, we received approximately million of cash from SLIC, of which million was a dividend and million was an interim liquidating distribution. Upon the full liquidation of the joint venture, all remaining cash of SLIC, primarily resulting from the proceeds received by SLIC, will be distributed back to the joint venture partners. We currently anticipate that full liquidation will be completed in 2025. 
 
 The acquisition has been integrated into our Polyurethanes segment. Transaction costs related to this acquisition were not material for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 . 
 
 We have accounted for the acquisition using the acquisition method. As such, we analyzed the fair value of net assets acquired. The allocation of acquisition cost to the assets acquired is summarized as follows (dollars in millions): 

Inventories 
 Property, plant and equipment 
 Other long-term assets 
 Deferred income taxes 
 Operating lease right-of-use assets 
 Noncurrent operating lease liabilities 
 Total 

The total fair value of the net assets acquired is in excess of the acquisition cost resulting in a net bargain purchase gain of approximately million. Concurrent with the acquisition of net assets, we wrote off certain prepaid assets of approximately million related to operating agreements with SLIC and other joint venture partners. 
 
 According to the operating agreement of the joint venture, SLIC sold all of its output to the joint venture partners with no external sales. After the separation and acquisition of assets, we use all of the output of the acquired assets for internal use. As such, the acquired business has no external revenues or net income.

Additionally, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , we recorded total net charges of approximately million, primarily related to contingencies, for which we remain liable, and certain post-closing indemnification obligations of approximately million and the release of foreign currency translation adjustments of approximately million related to the liquidation of legal entities of the Textile Effects Business. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , we paid cash taxes of approximately million, and we expect to pay additional cash taxes of approximately million in future periods related to the sale of our Textile Effects Business.

R estructuring A ctivities 
 
 Beginning in the first quarter of 2024, our Advanced Materials segment implemented a restructuring program to optimize the segment s manufacturing processes and cost structure in the U.S. to better align with future market opportunities. In connection with this restructuring program, we recorded net restructuring expense of approximately million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , primarily related to workforce reductions and accelerated depreciation. We expect to record further restructuring expenses of approximately million through 2026, primarily related to accelerated depreciation. 
 
 Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2022, we implemented a restructuring program to further realign our cost structure with additional restructuring in Europe. This program is associated with all of our segments and includes exiting and consolidating certain facilities, workforce relocation to lower cost locations and further personnel rationalization. In connection with this restructuring program, we recorded net restructuring expense of approximately million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , primarily related to site closures. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023 , we recorded a net restructuring expense of approximately million, primarily related to workforce reductions and accelerated depreciation, partially offset by adjustments to restructuring reserves that were no longer required for certain workforce reductions. We expect to record further restructuring expenses of approximately million through the first half of 2025. 
 
 Beginning in the first quarter of 2021, our Corporate function implemented a restructuring program to optimize our global approach to leveraging shared services capabilities. During the second quarter of 2022, this program was further expanded to include additional geographies. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023 , we evaluated the then current developments of this program and related anticipated cash costs, and we recorded a net restructuring credit of approximately million, primarily to adjust restructuring reserves that were no longer required for certain workforce reductions. We do not expect to record any further significant restructuring expenses. 
 
 Beginning in the second quarter of 2020, our Advanced Materials segment implemented restructuring programs in connection with our 2020 acquisition of CVC Thermoset Specialties, the alignment of the segment s commercial organization and optimization of the segment s manufacturing processes. In connection with these restructuring programs, we recorded net restructuring expense of approximately million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 , primarily related to a site closure and accelerated depreciation. 
 
 Beginning in the third quarter of 2020, our Polyurethanes segment implemented a restructuring program to optimize its downstream footprint. During the second quarter of 2022, this optimization program was further expanded to include the entire Polyurethanes business. In connection with this restructuring program, we recorded net restructuring expense of approximately million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 , primarily related to workforce reductions.

 Certain of our subsidiaries have third -party debt agreements that contain certain restrictions with regard to dividends, distributions, loans or advances. In certain circumstances, the consent of a third party would be required prior to the transfer of any cash or assets from these subsidiaries to us. 
 
 Revolving Credit Facility 
 
 On May 20, 2022, Huntsman International entered into a billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the 2022 Revolving Credit Facility ). Borrowings bear interest at the rates specified in the 2022 Revolving Credit Facility, which vary based on the type of loan and Huntsman International s debt ratings. Under the 2022 Revolving Credit Facility, the interest rate margin and the commitment fee rates are also subject to adjustments based on the Company s performance on specified sustainability target thresholds with respect to annual percentage reduction in operational greenhouse gas emissions intensity and annual percentage reduction in water consumption intensity. Unless previously terminated in accordance with its terms, the 2022 Revolving Credit Facility will mature in May 2027. Huntsman International may increase the 2022 Revolving Credit Facility commitments up to an additional million, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. 
 
 The following table presents certain amounts under our 2022 Revolving Credit Facility as of September 30, 2024 (monetary amounts in millions):

A/R Programs 
 
 Our U.S. accounts receivable securitization program U.S. A/R Program and our European accounts receivable securitization program EU A/R Program and collectively with the U.S. A/R Program, A/R Programs are structured so that we transfer certain of our trade receivables to the U.S. special purpose entity U.S. SPE and the European special purpose entity EU SPE in transactions intended to be true sales or true contributions. The receivables collateralize debt incurred by the U.S. SPE and the EU SPE. 
 
 On January 22, 2024, we entered into an amendment to our U.S. A/R Program that extended the scheduled maturity date of our U.S. A/R Program from July 2024 to January 2027. In addition, on January 31, 2024, we entered into an amendment to our EU A/R Program, effective as of February 15, 2024, that extended the scheduled maturity date of our EU A/R Program from July 2024 to July 2027. Aside from the extended maturity dates, these amendments to our A/R Programs secured substantially similar terms as those in the prior agreements. 
 
 Information regarding our A/R Programs as of September 30, 2024 was as follows (monetary amounts in millions): 
 
 (3) Applicable rate plus 0.95 
 EU A/R Program July 2027 Applicable rate plus 1.45 
 (or approximately 112) 

1 The amount of actual availability under our A/R Programs may be lower based on the level of eligible receivables sold, changes in the credit ratings of our customers, customer concentration levels and certain characteristics of the accounts receivable being transferred, as defined in the applicable agreements. 

2 The applicable rate for our U.S. A/R Program is defined by the lender as Term SOFR. The applicable rate for our EU A/R Program is either Term SOFR, EURIBOR or SONIA (Sterling Overnight Interbank Average Rate). 

3 As of September 30, 2024 , we had approximately million (U.S. dollar equivalent) of letters of credit issued and outstanding under our U.S. A/R Program. 

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , million and million, respectively, of accounts receivable were pledged as collateral under our A/R Programs. 

Variable Interest Entity Debt 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 , AAC, our consolidated -owned joint venture, had million outstanding under its loan commitments and debt financing arrangements. As of September 30, 2024 , we have million classified as current debt and million as long-term debt on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. We do not guarantee these loan commitments, and AAC is not a guarantor of any of our other debt obligations. 
 
 Note Payable 
 
 During the second quarter of 2024, HPS repaid the remainder of its outstanding note payable to SLIC denominated in Chinese renminbi, the equivalent of million, related to the separation and acquisition of assets of SLIC. For more information, see Note 3. Business Combinations and Acquisitions Separation and Acquisition of Assets of SLIC Joint Venture. 
 
 Debt Issuance Costs 
 
 We record debt issuance costs related to a debt liability on the balance sheets as a reduction to the face amount of that debt liability. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , the amount of debt issuance costs directly reducing the debt liability was million and million, respectively. We amortize debt issuance costs using either a straight line or effective interest method, depending on the debt agreement, and record them as interest expense. 
 
 C ompliance w ith C ovenants 
 
 Our 2022 Revolving Credit Facility contains a financial covenant regarding the leverage ratio of Huntsman International and its subsidiaries. The 2022 Revolving Credit Facility also contains other customary covenants and events of default for credit facilities of this type. Upon an event of default that is not cured or waived within any applicable cure periods, in addition to other remedies that may be available to the lenders, the obligations under the 2022 Revolving Credit Facility may be accelerated. 
 
 The agreements governing our A/R Programs also contain certain receivable performance metrics. Any material failure to meet the applicable A/R Programs metrics could lead to an early termination event under the A/R Programs, which could require us to cease our use of such facilities, prohibiting us from additional borrowings against our receivables or, at the discretion of the lenders, requiring that we repay the A/R Programs in full. An early termination event under the A/R Programs would also constitute an event of default under our 2022 Revolving Credit Facility, which could require us to pay off the balance of the 2022 Revolving Credit Facility in full and could result in the loss of our 2022 Revolving Credit Facility. 
 
 We believe that we are in compliance with the covenants contained in the agreements governing our material debt instruments, including our 2022 Revolving Credit Facility, our A/R Programs and our senior notes. 

million and million, respectively, of notional amount (in U.S. dollar equivalents) outstanding in forward foreign currency contracts related to continuing operations. 
 
 From time to time, we may purchase interest rate swaps and/or other derivative instruments to reduce the impact of changes in interest rates on our floating-rate exposures. Under interest rate swaps, we agree with other parties to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed-rate and floating-rate interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed notional principal amount. 
 
 We review our non-U.S. dollar denominated debt and derivative instruments to determine the appropriate amounts designated as hedges. As of September 30, 2024 , we have designated approximately 20 million (approximately million) of euro-denominated debt as a hedge of our net investment. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , the amounts recognized on the hedge of our net investment were gains of approximately million and nil, respectively, and were recorded in other comprehensive (loss) income in our condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income. 
 
 During the third quarter of 2024, we entered into three -year, cross-currency interest rate contracts to swap an aggregate notional amount million for an approximate aggregate notional 315 million. These cross-currency swaps are designated as net investment hedges and designed to hedge the foreign currency exposure of our net investment in certain European operations. Changes in fair value are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income to offset the foreign currency translation adjustments related to these investments. As of September 30, 2024, the fair value of these swaps was immaterial. 

Long-term debt (including current portion) 

The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheets of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair value because of the immediate or short-term maturity of these financial instruments. The fair values of non-qualified employee benefit plan investments are obtained through market observable pricing using prevailing market prices (Level 1 ). The fair values of our senior notes are based on quoted market prices for the identical liability when traded in an active market (Level 1 ), and the fair values of all our other outstanding debt are based on observable inputs other than quoted prices (Level 2 ). The fair value estimates presented herein are based on pertinent information available to management as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 . Although we are not aware of any factors that would significantly affect the estimated fair value amounts, such amounts have not been comprehensively revalued for purposes of these financial statements since September 30, 2024 , and current estimates of fair value may differ significantly from the amounts presented herein. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , we held instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 ), and there were gains or losses (realized and unrealized) included in our earnings for instruments categorized as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy.

4 Amounts include approximately nil of actuarial losses and prior service credits related to discontinued operations for both of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 . Amounts include approximately nil and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. 
 
 5 In connection with the sale of our Textile Effects Business, we recognized million of pension settlement losses and million of pension curtailment gains for the nine months September 30, 2023 . 

million jury verdict and district court judgment in our favor in our long-running court battle against Praxair/Linde, one of the industrial gas suppliers to our Geismar, Louisiana MDI manufacturing site. The case was filed after Praxair refused to maintain properly its own Geismar facility and then repeatedly failed to supply our requirements for industrial gases needed to manufacture MDI under long-term supply contracts that expired in 2013. After adding mandatory pre-judgment and post-judgment interest to the award, we expect damages to exceed million before deducting for taxes and legal contingency fees. The award is presently subject to review by the Louisiana Supreme Court but, if affirmed, we would expect to receive net proceeds of approximately million to million. We have not yet recognized the award in our condensed consolidated statements of operations and the timing of the resolution of this matter is uncertain. 
 
 We are a party to various other proceedings instituted by private plaintiffs, governmental authorities and others arising under provisions of applicable laws, including various environmental, products liability and other laws. We do not believe that the outcome of any of these matters will have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. 

million and million, respectively. Because capital expenditures for these matters are subject to evolving regulatory requirements and depend, in part, on the timing, promulgation and enforcement of specific requirements, our capital expenditures for EHS matters have varied significantly from year to year and we cannot provide assurance that our recent expenditures are indicative of future amounts we may spend related to EHS and other applicable laws. 
 
 E nvironmental R eserves 
 
 We have accrued liabilities relating to anticipated environmental cleanup obligations, site reclamation and closure costs and known penalties. Liabilities are recorded when potential liabilities are either known or considered probable and can be reasonably estimated. Our liability estimates are calculated using present value techniques as appropriate and are based upon requirements placed upon us by regulators, available facts, existing technology and past experience. The environmental liabilities do not include amounts recorded as asset retirement obligations. We had accrued million and million for environmental liabilities as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively. Of these amounts, million and million were classified as accrued liabilities as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively, and million and million were classified as other noncurrent liabilities as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively. In certain cases, our remediation liabilities may be payable over periods of up to years. We may incur losses for environmental remediation in excess of the amounts accrued; however, we are not able to estimate the amount or range of such potential excess. 
 
 E nvironmental M atters 
 
 Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act CERCLA and similar state laws, a current or former owner or operator of real property in the U.S. may be liable for remediation costs regardless of whether the release or disposal of hazardous substances was in compliance with law at the time it occurred, and a current owner or operator may be liable regardless of whether it owned or operated the facility at the time of the release. Outside the U.S., analogous contaminated property laws can hold past owners and/or operators liable for remediation at former facilities. Currently, there are approximately six former facilities or third -party sites in the U.S. for which we have been notified of potential claims against us for cleanup liabilities, including, but not limited to, sites listed under CERCLA. Based on current information and past experiences at other CERCLA sites, we do not expect these third -party claims to have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act RCRA in the U.S. and similar state laws, we may be required to remediate contamination originating from our properties. Similar laws exist in a number of non-U.S. locations in which we currently operate, or previously operated, manufacturing facilities. Some of our manufacturing sites have an extended history of industrial chemical manufacturing and use, including on-site waste disposal. We are aware of soil, groundwater or surface contamination from past operations at some of our sites, and we may find contamination at other sites in the future. For example, our Geismar, Louisiana facility is the subject of ongoing remediation requirements imposed under RCRA. 

million shares remaining under the stock-based compensation plans available for grant. Option awards have a maximum contractual term of years and generally must have an exercise price at least equal to the market price of our common stock on the date the option award is granted. Outstanding stock-based awards generally vest annually over a three -year period or in total at the end of a three -year period. 
 
 The compensation cost from continuing operations under the stock-based compensation plans for our Company and Huntsman International were as follows (dollars in millions): 

Huntsman International compensation cost 

The total income tax benefit recognized in the condensed consolidated statements of operations for us and Huntsman International for stock-based compensation arrangements was million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. 
 
 S tock O ptions 
 
 The fair value of each stock option award was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes valuation model. Expected volatilities were based on the historical volatility of our common stock through the grant date. The expected term of options granted was estimated based on the contractual term of the instruments and employees expected exercise and post-vesting employment termination behavior. The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option was based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. 
 
 During each of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , stock options were granted. 
 
 A summary of stock option activity under the stock-based compensation plans as of September 30, 2024 and changes during the nine months then ended is presented below: 

Exercised 
 Forfeited 
 Outstanding and exercisable at September 30, 2024 

As of September 30, 2024 , there was unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock option arrangements granted under the stock-based compensation plans. 
 
 The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was approximately million and million, respectively. Cash received from stock options exercised during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was approximately nil and million, respectively. The cash tax benefit from stock options exercised during both of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was approximately nil. 
 
 N onvested S hares 
 
 Nonvested shares granted under the stock-based compensation plans consist of restricted stock and performance share unit awards, which are accounted for as equity awards, and phantom stock, which is accounted for as a liability award because it can be settled in either stock or cash. The fair value of each restricted stock and phantom stock award is estimated to be the closing stock price of Huntsman s stock on the date of grant. 
 
 For our performance share unit awards, the performance criteria are total stockholder return of our common stock relative to the total stockholder return of a specified industry peer group for the three -year performance periods. The fair value of each performance share unit award is estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation model that uses various assumptions, including an expected volatility rate and a risk-free interest rate. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , the weighted-average expected volatility rate was and , respectively, and the weighted average risk-free interest rate was and , respectively. For the performance share unit awards granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , the number of shares earned varies based upon the Company achieving certain performance criteria over a three -year performance period. 
 
 A summary of the status of our nonvested shares as of September 30, 2024 and changes during the nine months then ended is presented below: 

Granted 
 Vested (1) 
 Forfeited (2) 
 Nonvested at September 30, 2024 

1 As of September 30, 2024 , a total of restricted stock units were vested but not yet issued, of which vested during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 . These shares have not been reflected as vested shares in this table because, in accordance with the restricted stock unit agreements, shares of common stock are not issued for vested restricted stock units until termination of employment. 

2 A total of performance share unit awards with a grant date fair value of that were included in the December 31, 2023 nonvested balance did not meet the minimum performance criteria of these awards and were effectively forfeited during the first quarter of 2024. 

As of September 30, 2024 , there was approximately million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share compensation arrangements granted under the stock-based compensation plans. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately years. The value of share awards that vested during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was approximately million and million, respectively. 

million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. During the first quarter of 2024, we recorded a discrete tax benefit of million resulting from the write-off of certain prepaid assets related to operating agreements with SLIC and other joint venture partners concurrent with the separation and acquisition of assets of SLIC. Our tax expense is significantly affected by the mix of income and losses in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate, as impacted by the presence of valuation allowances in certain tax jurisdictions. 
 
 Huntsman International 
 
 Huntsman International recorded income tax expense from continuing operations of million and million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. During the first quarter of 2024, we recorded a discrete tax benefit of million resulting from the write-off of certain prepaid assets related to operating agreements with SLIC and other joint venture partners concurrent with the separation and acquisition of assets of SLIC. Our tax expense is significantly affected by the mix of income and losses in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate, as impacted by the presence of valuation allowances in certain tax jurisdictions.

 Total weighted average shares outstanding, including dilutive shares 

Additional stock-based awards of approximately million and million weighted average equivalent shares of stock were outstanding during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively, and approximately million and million weighted average equivalent shares of stock were outstanding during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively. However, these stock-based awards were not included in the computation of diluted income per share for the respective periods mentioned above because the effect would be anti-dilutive. There were million and million weighted average equivalent shares of stock included in the total anti-dilutive weighted average equivalent shares of stock outstanding during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 noted above, respectively, as a result of the reported loss from continuing operations attributable to Huntsman Corporation for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 .

1 We use segment adjusted EBITDA as the measure of each segment s profit or loss. We believe that segment adjusted EBITDA more accurately reflects what the chief operating decision maker uses to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segments and assess their financial performance. Segment adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income of Huntsman Corporation or Huntsman International, as appropriate, before interest, income tax, depreciation and amortization, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and certain Corporate and other items, as well as eliminating the following adjustments: (a) business acquisition and integration expenses and purchase accounting inventory adjustments, net; (b) fair value adjustments to Venator investment, net and other tax matter adjustments; (c) certain legal and other settlements and related expenses; (d) (loss) gain on sale of business/assets; (e) certain nonrecurring information technology project implementation costs; (f) amortization of pension and postretirement actuarial losses; (g) restructuring, impairment and plant closing and transition costs; and (h) (loss) income from discontinued operations, net of tax. 

2 Corporate and other costs, net includes unallocated corporate overhead, unallocated foreign currency exchange gains and losses, LIFO inventory valuation reserve adjustments, nonoperating income and expense and gains and losses on the disposition of corporate assets. 

3 Certain legal and other settlements and related expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 includes approximately million related to the settlement of a claim in connection with a commercial dispute. 

4 Includes costs associated with transition activities related primarily to our Corporate program to optimize our global approach to managed services in various information technology functions and our program to realign our cost structure in Europe.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 
 Our condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP, which we supplement with certain non-GAAP financial information. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures, and other companies may define such measures differently. We encourage investors to review our financial statements and the reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. These non-GAAP measures exclude the impact of certain income and expenses that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating results. 
 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 
 Our management uses adjusted EBITDA to assess financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income of Huntsman Corporation or Huntsman International, as appropriate, before interest, income tax, depreciation and amortization, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and certain Corporate and other items, as well as eliminating the following adjustments: (a) business acquisition and integration expenses and purchase accounting inventory adjustments, net; (b) EBITDA from discontinued operations; (c) fair value adjustments to Venator investment, net and other tax matter adjustments; (d) certain legal and other settlements and related expenses; (e) loss (gain) on sale of business/assets; (f) certain nonrecurring information technology project implementation costs; (g) amortization of pension and postretirement actuarial losses; and (h) restructuring, impairment and plant closing and transition costs. We believe that net income of Huntsman Corporation or Huntsman International, as appropriate, is the performance measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP that is most directly comparable to adjusted EBITDA. 
 
 We believe adjusted EBITDA is useful to investors in assessing the businesses ongoing financial performance and provides improved comparability between periods through the exclusion of certain items that management believes are not indicative of the businesses operational profitability and that may obscure underlying business results and trends. However, this measure should not be considered in isolation or viewed as a substitute for net income of Huntsman Corporation or Huntsman International, as appropriate, or other measures of performance determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Moreover, adjusted EBITDA as used herein is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential inconsistencies in the methods of calculation. Our management believes this measure is useful to compare general operating performance from period to period and to make certain related management decisions. Adjusted EBITDA is also used by securities analysts, lenders and others in their evaluation of different companies because it excludes certain items that can vary widely across different industries or among companies within the same industry. For example, interest expense can be highly dependent on a company s capital structure, debt levels and credit ratings. Therefore, the impact of interest expense on earnings can vary significantly among companies. In addition, the tax positions of companies can vary because of their differing abilities to take advantage of tax benefits and because of the tax policies of the various jurisdictions in which they operate. As a result, effective tax rates and tax expense can vary considerably among companies. Finally, companies employ productive assets of different ages and utilize different methods of acquiring and depreciating such assets. This can result in considerable variability in the relative costs of productive assets and the depreciation and amortization expense among companies. 
 
 Nevertheless, our management recognizes that there are material limitations associated with the use of adjusted EBITDA in the evaluation of our Company as compared to net income of Huntsman Corporation or Huntsman International, as appropriate, which reflects overall financial performance. For example, we have borrowed money in order to finance our operations and interest expense is a necessary element of our costs and ability to generate revenue. Our management compensates for the limitations of using adjusted EBITDA by using this measure to supplement U.S. GAAP results to provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting the business rather than U.S. GAAP results alone. 
 
 Adjusted Net Income 
 
 Adjusted net income is computed by eliminating the after-tax amounts related to the following from net income attributable to Huntsman Corporation: (a) business acquisition and integration expenses and purchase accounting inventory adjustments, net; (b) loss (income) from discontinued operations; (c) fair value adjustments to Venator investment, net and other tax matter adjustments; (d) certain legal and other settlements and related expenses; (e) loss (gain) on sale of business/assets; (f) certain nonrecurring information technology project implementation costs; (g) amortization of pension and postretirement actuarial losses; (h) income tax settlement related to U.S. Tax Reform Act; and (i) restructuring, impairment and plant closing and transition costs. Basic adjusted net income per share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing adjusted net income by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period. Adjusted diluted net income per share reflects all potential dilutive common shares outstanding during the period and is computed by dividing adjusted net income by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period increased by the number of additional shares that would have been outstanding as dilutive securities. Adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share amounts are presented solely as supplemental information. 
 
 We believe adjusted net income is useful to investors in assessing the businesses ongoing financial performance and provides improved comparability between periods through the exclusion of certain items that management believes are not indicative of the businesses operational profitability and that may obscure underlying business results and trends. 
 
 Free Cash Flow 
 
 We believe free cash flow is an important indicator of our liquidity as it measures the amount of cash we generate. Management internally uses a free cash flow measure: (a) to evaluate our liquidity, (b) evaluate strategic investments, (c) plan stock buyback and dividend levels and (d) evaluate our ability to incur and service debt.

Adjusted Effective Tax Rate 
 
 We believe that the effective tax rate of Huntsman Corporation or Huntsman International, as appropriate, is the performance measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP that is most directly comparable to adjusted effective tax rate. We believe our adjusted effective tax rate provides improved comparability between periods through the exclusion of certain items, such as, business acquisition and integration expenses and purchase accounting inventory adjustments, certain legal and other settlements and related expenses, gains on sale of businesses/assets and certain tax only items, including tax law changes not yet enacted, that we believe are not indicative of the businesses operational profitability and that may obscure underlying business results and trends. 
 
 Our forward-looking adjusted effective tax rate is calculated based on our forecast effective tax rate, and the range of our forward-looking adjusted effective tax rate equals the range of our forecast effective tax rate. We disclose forward-looking adjusted effective tax rate because we cannot adequately forecast certain items and events that may or may not impact us in the near future, such as business acquisition and integration expenses and purchase accounting inventory adjustments, certain legal and other settlements and related expenses, gains on sale of businesses/assets and certain tax only items, including tax law changes not yet enacted. Each of such adjustment has not yet occurred, is out of our control and/or cannot be reasonably predicted. In our view, our forward-looking adjusted effective tax rate represents the forecast effective tax rate on our underlying business operations but does not reflect any adjustments related to the items noted above that may occur and can cause our effective tax rate to differ. 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared with Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, loss from continuing operations attributable to Huntsman Corporation was 21 million, a decrease of 21 million from income of nil in the 2023 period. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, loss from continuing operations attributable to Huntsman International was 20 million a decrease of 21 million from income of 1 million in the 2023 period. The decreases noted above were the result of the following items: 

Revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 34 million, or 2 , as compared with the 2023 period. The increase was primarily due to higher sales volumes in all our segments, partially offset by lower average selling prices in all our segments. See Segment Analysis below. 

Gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 3 million, or 1 , as compared with the 2023 period. The increase resulted from higher gross profits in our Polyurethanes and Performance Products segments. See Segment Analysis below. 

Operating expenses, net for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 11 million, or 6 , as compared with the 2023 period primarily related to decreases in selling, general and administrative expenses and research and development costs as well as the positive impact of translating foreign currency amounts to the U.S. dollar, partially offset by an increase in other operating expenses. 

Interest expense, net for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 6 million, or 40 , as compared with the 2023 period. The increase resulted primarily from higher borrowings under our 2022 Revolving Credit Facility. 

Equity in income of investment in unconsolidated affiliates for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased to 5 million from 30 million in the 2023 period primarily related to a decrease in income at our PO/MTBE joint venture in China, in which we hold at 49 interest. 

Other income (expense), net was income of 8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared with nil in the 2023 period. The increase in income was primarily due to income recognized during the third quarter of 2024 for the resolution of certain matters related to the 2017 separation of our titanium dioxide and performance additives business. 

Our income tax expense and the income tax expense of Huntsman International for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased to 39 million as compared with 27 million in the 2023 period. The increase in income tax expense was primarily due to our mix of income and losses in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate, including decreased income (more losses) in jurisdictions in which we have tax benefits that are subject to valuation allowances, and therefore, we do not record a tax benefit for those losses. The cumulative effect of these valuation allowances is an increase to our estimated annual effective tax rate applied to the year-to-date income. For further information, see Note 18. Income Taxes to our condensed consolidated financial statements.

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared with Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, loss from continuing operations attributable to Huntsman Corporation was 36 million, a decrease of 88 million from income of 52 million in the 2023 period. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, loss from continuing operations attributable to Huntsman International was 33 million, a decrease of 88 million from income of 55 million in the 2023 period. The decreases noted above were the result of the following items: 

Revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 124 million, or 3 , as compared with the 2023 period. The decrease was primarily due to lower average selling prices in all our segments, partially offset by higher sales volumes in all our segments. See Segment Analysis below. 

Gross profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by 76 million, or 10 , as compared with the 2023 period. The decrease resulted from lower gross profits in our Polyurethanes and Performance Products segments. See Segment Analysis below. 

Restructuring, impairment and plant closing costs were 20 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared with 7 million in the 2023 period. For further information, see Note 7. Restructuring, Impairment and Plant Closing Costs to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 

Gain on acquisition of assets, net was approximately 51 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 related to a net bargain purchase gain related to the separation and acquisition of assets of SLIC. For further information, see Note 3. Business Combinations and Acquisitions Separation and Acquisition of Assets of SLIC Joint Venture to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 

Prepaid asset write-off was approximately 71 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Concurrent with the acquisition of assets of SLIC, we wrote off certain prepaid assets related to operating agreements with SLIC and other joint venture partners. For further information, see Note 3. Business Combinations and Acquisitions Separation and Acquisition of Assets of SLIC Joint Venture to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 

Interest expense, net for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 12 million, or 25 , as compared with the 2023 period. The increase resulted primarily from higher borrowings under our 2022 Revolving Credit Facility. 

Equity in income of investment in unconsolidated affiliates for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased to 42 million from 70 million in the 2023 period primarily related to a decrease in income at our PO/MTBE joint venture in China, in which we hold a 49 interest. 

Other income (expense), net was income of 22 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared with expense of 2 million in the 2023 period. The increase in income was primarily due to a decrease in losses related to the fair value adjustments to our investment in Venator as well as income recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 for the resolution of certain matters related to the 2017 separation of our titanium dioxide and performance additives business. 

Our income tax expense and the income tax expense of Huntsman International for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 32 million as compared with 66 million in the 2023 period. The decrease in income tax expense was primarily due to the decrease in income from continuing operations before income taxes as well as a discrete tax benefit of 18 million resulting from the write-off of certain prepaid assets related to operating agreements with SLIC and other joint venture partners concurrent with the separation and acquisition of assets of SLIC. For further information, see Note 3. Business Combinations and Acquisitions Separation and Acquisition of Assets of SLIC Joint Venture to our condensed consolidated financial statements. Our income tax expense is significantly affected by the mix of income and losses in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate along with the impact of valuation allowances in certain tax jurisdictions. For further information, see Note 18. Income Taxes to our condensed consolidated financial statements.

 The following is a discussion of our liquidity and capital resources and generally does not include separate information with respect to Huntsman International in accordance with General Instructions H(1)(a) and (b) of Form 10-Q. 
 
 Cash Flows for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared with the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 
 Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was 126 million and 85 million, respectively. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was primarily attributable to an increase in dividends received from unconsolidated subsidiaries and a net cash inflow of 22 million related to changes in operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by decreased operating income as described in Results of Operations above for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared with the same period of 2023. 
 
 Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities from continuing operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was (87) million and 395 million, respectively.

The decrease in cash and cash equivalents of 210 million resulted from the matters identified on our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. See also Cash Flows for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared with the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023. 

Accounts and notes receivable, net increased by 76 million primarily due to higher revenues in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. 

Inventories increased by 137 million primarily due to seasonally higher inventory volumes. 

Other current assets decreased by 24 million primarily due to decreases in certain prepaid expenses. 

Accounts payable increased by 26 million primarily due to higher inventory purchases. 

Accrued liabilities increased by 19 million primarily due to increases in accrued taxes, accrued interest, accrued rebates and accrued environmental liabilities, partially offset by a decrease in accrued restructuring costs. 

Current portion of debt increased by 334 million primarily due to the outstanding balance on our 4.25 senior notes due April 2025 2025 Senior Notes that are now classified as current debt.

Liquidity 
 
 We depend upon our cash, our 2022 Revolving Credit Facility, A/R Programs and other debt instruments to provide liquidity for our operations and working capital needs. As of September 30, 2024, we had 1,733 million of combined cash and unused borrowing capacity, consisting of 330 million in cash, 1,194 million in availability under our 2022 Revolving Credit Facility and 209 million in availability under our A/R Programs. Our liquidity can be significantly impacted by various factors. The following matters are expected to have a significant impact on our liquidity: 
 
 Short-Term Liquidity 

During 2024, we expect to spend between approximately 180 million to 190 million on capital expenditures. Our future expenditures include certain environmental, health and safety upgrades; expansions and upgrades of our existing manufacturing and other facilities; construction of new facilities; certain cost reduction projects, including those described below; and certain information technology expenditures. We expect to fund capital expenditures with cash provided by operations. 

During the remainder of 2024, we expect to make additional contributions to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans of approximately 8 million. 

On January 31, 2024, we completed the planned separation and acquisition of assets of SLIC, our joint venture with BASF and three Chinese chemical companies. The final purchase price of the acquired assets has been determined based on an asset valuation, which was completed in the second quarter of 2024. The acquisition of the assets was funded in part with HPS issuing a U.S. dollar equivalent note payable at closing of approximately 218 million, which has been repaid in full as of September 30, 2024 using available funds at HPS. During the third quarter of 2024, we received approximately 64 million of cash from SLIC, of which 34 million was a dividend and 30 million was an interim liquidating distribution. Upon the full liquidation of the joint venture, all remaining cash of SLIC, primarily resulting from the proceeds received by SLIC, will be distributed back to the joint venture partners. We currently anticipate that approximately RMB 300 million will be distributed as a liquidating distribution and return of investment upon full liquidation, which we anticipate will be completed in 2025. 

On February 28, 2023, we completed the sale of our Textile Effects Business to Archroma, and during the first quarter of 2024, we finalized the purchase price valued at 597 million, which includes adjustments to the purchase price for working capital, plus the assumption of underfunded pension liabilities. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we paid cash taxes of approximately 10 million, and we expect to pay additional cash taxes of approximately 3 million and expect to pay cash for contingencies and post-closing indemnifications in future periods related to the sale of our Textile Effects Business. See Note 4. Discontinued Operations Sale of Textile Effects Business to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 

During 2020 and 2021, management implemented cost realignment and synergy plans and, in November 2022, committed to further plans to realign our cost structure with additional restructuring in Europe, including exiting and consolidating certain facilities, workforce relocation to lower cost locations and further personnel rationalization. In connection with these plans, we have achieved combined annualized cost savings and synergy benefits in excess of 280 million. Associated with these plans, we expect total cash costs of approximately 302 million (including approximately 59 million of capital expenditures) through 2026, of which we have spent approximately 272 million through the third quarter of 2024 (including approximately 43 million of capital expenditures). Of the remaining cash costs, the majority will be payments related to our restructuring in Europe, primarily for personnel who have exited as of the end of 2023 as well as capital expenditures related to our research and development footprint, which is included in our overall future capital expenditures projections. 

As of September 30, 2024, we have approximately 547 million remaining under the authorization of our existing share repurchase program. Repurchases may be commenced or suspended from time to time without prior notice.

Long-Term Liquidity 

On September 26, 2024, Huntsman International completed a 350 million offering of its 2034 Senior Notes. Huntsman International used the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, including repayment of debt. The 2034 Senior Notes bear interest at 5.70 per year, payable semi-annually on April 15 and October 15 of each year, and will mature on October 15, 2034. For more information, see Note 8. Debt Direct and Subsidiary Debt Senior Notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 

On January 22, 2024, we entered into an amendment to our U.S. A/R Program that extended the scheduled maturity date of our U.S. A/R Program from July 2024 to January 2027. In addition, on January 31, 2024, we entered into an amendment to our EU A/R Program, effective as of February 15, 2024, that extended the scheduled maturity date of our EU A/R Program from July 2024 to July 2027. Aside from the extended maturity dates, these amendments to our A/R Programs secured substantially similar terms as those in the prior agreements. 

On April 19, 2024, the Louisiana Fourth Circuit Court of Appeal affirmed the 93.1 million jury verdict and district court judgment in our favor in our long-running court battle against Praxair/Linde, one of the industrial gas suppliers to our Geismar, Louisiana MDI manufacturing site. The case was filed after Praxair refused to maintain properly its own Geismar facility and then repeatedly failed to supply our requirements for industrial gases needed to manufacture MDI under long-term supply contracts that expired in 2013. After adding mandatory pre-judgment and post-judgment interest to the award, we expect damages to exceed 135 million before deducting for taxes and legal contingency fees. The award is presently subject to review by the Louisiana Supreme Court but, if affirmed, we would expect to receive net proceeds of approximately 50 million to 60 million. We have not yet recognized the award in our condensed consolidated statements of operations and the timing of the resolution of this matter is uncertain. 

As of September 30, 2024, we had 346 million classified as current portion of debt, including 334 million outstanding under our 2025 Senior Notes, debt at our variable interest entities of 9 million and certain other short-term facilities and scheduled amortization payments totaling 3 million. We intend to renew, repay or extend the majority of these short-term facilities in the next twelve months. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 305 million of cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries, including our variable interest entities. With the exception of certain amounts that we expect to repatriate in the foreseeable future, we intend to use cash held in our foreign subsidiaries to fund our local operations. Nevertheless, we could repatriate additional cash as dividends, and the repatriation of cash as a dividend would generally not be subject to U.S. taxation. However, such repatriation may potentially be subject to limited foreign withholding taxes. 
 
 For more information regarding our debt, see Note 8. Debt to our condensed consolidated financial statements.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 We are exposed to market risks, such as changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and commodity prices. From time to time, we enter into transactions, including transactions involving derivative instruments, to manage certain of these exposures. We also hedge our net investment in certain European operations. See Note 9. Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2024. Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective, in that they ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 No changes to our internal control over financial reporting occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act). However, we can only give reasonable assurance that our internal controls over financial reporting will prevent or detect material misstatements on a timely basis.

 On October 26, 2021, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program of 1 billion. On March 25, 2022, our Board of Directors increased the authorization of our share repurchase program from 1 billion to 2 billion. The share repurchase program is supported by our free cash flow generation. Repurchases may be made in the open market, including through accelerated share repurchase programs, or in privately negotiated transactions, and repurchases may be commenced or suspended from time to time without prior notice. Shares of common stock acquired through the repurchase program are held in treasury at cost. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock under this program.
