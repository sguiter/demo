 Overview We were formed as a Maryland corporation on November 15, 2021. We are an externally managed, non-diversified, closed-end management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a BDC under the Investment Company Act of 1940 Act, as amended (the 1940 Act ). In addition, for US federal income tax purposes, we have elected to be treated, and to comply with the requirements to qualify annually, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. We are managed by Brightwood Capital Advisors, LLC, an investment adviser (the Investment Adviser that is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended. The Investment Adviser will provide portfolio management services to us pursuant to an investment advisory agreement (the Investment Advisory Agreement ), including investigating, analyzing, structuring, and negotiating potential investments, monitoring the performance of portfolio companies, and determining when to dispose of our investments. Our investment committee will evaluate and approve all of our investments, subject to the oversight of our Board of Directors (the Board ). The Board consists of five directors, three of whom are independent. Our investment objective is to achieve risk-adjusted returns via current income and, to a lesser extent, capital appreciation. We will focus on lending to middle market companies and will primarily invest in portfolio companies in the form of first lien senior secured loans (including any related warrants or other equity securities of such portfolio companies). These senior secured loans typically provide for cash interest and amortization payments throughout the life of the loan. We generally obtain security interests in the assets of the portfolio companies in which we invest that serve as collateral in support of the repayment of these loans. The Investment Adviser also serves as our administrator (in such capacity, the Administrator pursuant to the terms of an administration agreement (the Administration Agreement ). We conducted a private offering of our common stock, par value 0.01 per share Common Stock to investors in reliance on exemptions from the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Under the terms of the subscription agreements, investors are required to fund drawdowns to purchase shares of Common Stock up to the amount of their respective capital commitments on an as-needed basis each time we deliver a drawdown notice to them.

 Revenues We generate revenues in the form of interest income from the debt securities we hold and dividends and capital appreciation on either direct equity investments or equity interests obtained in connection with originating loans, such as options, warrants or conversion rights. The debt we invest in is typically not rated by any rating agency, but if it were, it is likely that such debt would be below investment grade. In addition, we (but, for the avoidance of doubt, not our Investment Adviser or Administrator) may also generate revenue in the form of commitment, loan origination, structuring or diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance to our portfolio companies, and possibly consulting fees. Certain of these fees may be capitalized and amortized as additional interest income over the life of the related loan. It is not expected that our Investment Adviser will generate revenue from our participation in such activities. Our Investment Adviser, however, may generate revenue in respect of arrangements with other clients, if any. Expenses We currently do not have any employees and do not expect to have any employees. Services necessary for our business will be provided through the Administration Agreement and the Investment Advisory Agreement.

 Investment-related expenses with respect to investments in which we invest together with one or more parallel funds (or co-investment vehicles) will generally be allocated among all such entities on the basis of capital invested by each such entity into the relevant investment; provided that if the Investment Adviser reasonably believes that such allocation method would produce an inequitable result to any such entity, the Investment Adviser may allocate such expenses among such entities in any other manner that the Investment Adviser believes in good faith to be fair and equitable. If our assets are treated as plan assets for purposes of ERISA, the Investment Adviser will bear responsibility for the fidelity bond required under Section 412 of ERISA. We are permitted to enter into credit facilities. In connection with borrowings, our lenders may require us to pledge assets, capital commitments and/or the right to draw down on capital commitments.

Table of Contents 
 The Investment Adviser has a number of methods of evaluating and monitoring the performance and fair value of our investments, which may include the following: assessment of success of the portfolio company in adhering to its business plan and compliance with covenants; review of monthly and quarterly financial statements and financial projections for portfolio companies; contact with portfolio company management and, if appropriate, the financial or strategic sponsor, to discuss financial position, requirements and accomplishments; comparisons to other companies in the industry; and attendance and participation in board meetings. 
 As part of the monitoring process, the Investment Adviser regularly assesses the risk profile of each of our investments and, on a quarterly basis, grades each investment on a risk scale of 1 to 10. Risk assessment is not standardized in our industry and our risk assessment may not be comparable to the ones used by our competitors. Our assessment is based on the following categories: 1. Performing - Superior: Borrower is performing significantly above Management Case. 2. Performing - High: Borrower is performing at or near the Management Case (i.e., in a range slightly below to slightly above). 3. Performing - Low Risk: Borrower is operating well ahead of the Brightwood Base Case to slightly below the Management Case. 4. Performing - Stable Risk: Borrower is operating at or near the Brightwood Base Case (i.e., in a range slightly below to slightly above). This is the initial rating assigned to all new borrowers. 5. Performing - Management Notice: Borrower is operating below the Brightwood Base Case. Adverse trends in business conditions and/or industry outlook are viewed as temporary. There is no immediate risk of payment default and only a low to moderate risk of covenant default. 6. Performing - Low Maintenance: Borrower is operating below the Brightwood Base Case, with declining margin of protection. Adverse trends in business conditions and/or industry outlook are viewed as lasting for more than a year. Payment default is still considered unlikely, but there is a moderate to high risk of covenant default. 7. Watch List - Medium Maintenance: Borrower is operating well below the Brightwood Base Case, but has adequate liquidity. Adverse trends are more pronounced than in Internal Risk Rating of 6 and above. There is a high risk of covenant default, or it may have already occurred. Payments are current, although subject to greater uncertainty, and there is a moderate to high risk of payment default. 8. Watch List - High Maintenance: Borrower is operating well below the Brightwood Base Case. Liquidity may be strained. Covenant default is imminent or it may have already occurred. Payments are current, but there is high risk of payment default. Negotiations to restructure or refinance debt on normal terms may have begun. Further significant deterioration appears unlikely and no loss of principal is currently anticipated. 9. Watch List - Possible Loss: At the current level of operations and financial condition, the borrower does not have the ability to service and ultimately repay or refinance all outstanding debt on current terms. Liquidity is strained. Payment default is very likely in the short term unless creditors grant some relief. Loss of principal is possible. 10. Watch List - Probable Loss: At the current level of operations and financial condition, the borrower does not have the ability to service and ultimately repay or refinance all outstanding debt on current terms. Liquidity is extremely limited. The prospects for improvement in the borrower s situation are sufficiently negative, that loss of some or all principal is probable.

For Nine Months ended September 30, 2024 2023 Interest income 65,992 28,397 Dividend income 805 141 Other Income 16 5 Total investment income 66,813 28,543 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we generated investment income of 23,511 and 66,813, respectively, consisting primarily of interest income on investments in senior secured first lien term loan, senior secured term loan, delayed draw term loan and revolver of 50 portfolio companies held during the period. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we generated investment income of 11,839 and 28,543, respectively, consisting primarily of interest income on investments in senior secured first lien term loan, senior secured term loan, delayed draw term loan and revolver of 23 portfolio companies held during the period. The increase in investment income was primarily due to the increased number of portfolio holdings as well as higher SOFR and LIBOR rates during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Expenses Operating expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, were as follows: 

For Three Months ended September 30, 2024 2023 Interest expense on line of credit 7,293 3,216 Management fees 1,534 870 Amortization of deferred financing costs 265 146 Overhead expenses 249 168 Professional fees 208 159 Other general and administrative expenses (1) 167 166 Administration fees 147 50 Directors fees 75 75 Custody fees 20 11 Facility expenses (1) 11 Total expenses 9,958 4,872

Table of Contents 
 The increase in interest expense during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily the result of the new borrowings under the credit agreement with SPV-1 credit facility on March 30, 2023 and the upsizes on this facility during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we incurred management fees of 4,306. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we incurred management fees of 2,397. The increase in management fees was driven by growing gross assets under management. Net Realized and Unrealized Gains and Losses Net realized gains (losses) and net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on our investment portfolio for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, were as follows: 

For Three Months ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on non-controlled/non-affiliate company investments (92) 642 Total net realized and unrealized gain (loss) on investments (92) 642 

For Nine Months ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on non-controlled/non-affiliate company investments (1,654) 3,316 Total net realized and unrealized gain (loss) on investments (1,654) 3,316 We value our portfolio investments quarterly and any changes in fair value are recorded as unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments. There were no realized gains (losses) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The change in unrealized gain (loss) on investments was primarily due to the increased number of holdings during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The valuation mark down on a few portfolio holdings such as B2B Industrial Products, LLC, Contract Datascan, LP, and YNWA Finco LLC contributed to the increase in unrealized loss during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Our investment portfolio may contain investments that are in the form of lines of credit or unfunded commitments which require us to provide funding when requested by portfolio companies in accordance with the terms of the underlying agreements. Unfunded commitments to provide funds to portfolio companies are not reflected on our Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities. These commitments are subject to the same underwriting and ongoing portfolio maintenance as are the on-balance sheet financial instruments that we hold. Since these commitments may expire without being drawn, the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future cash requirements. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had aggregate unfunded commitments totaling 42.1 million and 39.9 million, respectively. RIC Tax Treatment and Distributions Following our election to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act, we elected to be treated as a RIC and will file our tax return for the year ending December 31, 2023, as a RIC. So long as we maintain our status as a RIC, we generally will not pay corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any ordinary income or capital gains that we distribute at least annually to our shareholders as distributions. Rather, any tax liability related to income distributed by us represents obligations of our shareholders and will not be reflected on our Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities. Dividends and distributions to stockholders are recorded on the record date. The amount to be paid out as a dividend is determined by the Board each quarter and is generally based upon the earnings estimated by the Investment Adviser. Net realized capital gains, if any, are distributed at least annually, although we may decide to retain such capital gains for investment. 

 44 

Table of Contents 
 We have adopted a dividend reinvestment plan that provides for reinvestment of any distributions we declare in cash on behalf of our stockholders, unless a stockholder elects to receive cash. As a result, if our Board authorizes, and we declare, a cash distribution, then our stockholders who have not opted out of the dividend reinvestment plan will have their cash distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares of the common stock, rather than receiving the cash distribution. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Management has utilized available information, including our past history, industry standards and the current economic environment, among other factors, in forming the estimates and judgments, giving due consideration to materiality. Actual results may differ from these estimates. In addition, other companies may utilize different estimates, which may impact the comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses. Understanding our accounting policies and the extent to which we use management judgment and estimates in applying these policies is integral to understanding our financial statements. We describe our most significant accounting policies in Note 2 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements included herein. Critical accounting policies are those that require the application of management s most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often because of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods. We evaluate our critical accounting estimates and judgments required by our policies on an ongoing basis and update them as necessary based on changing conditions. We have identified one of our accounting policies, valuation of portfolio investments, as critical because it involves significant judgments and assumptions about highly complex and inherently uncertain matters, and the use of reasonably different estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on our reported results of operations or financial condition. As we execute our operating plans, we will describe additional critical accounting policies in the notes to our future financial statements in addition to those discussed below. Investment Valuation Our investments will be valued at fair value. The Investment Adviser, designated by the Board as a valuation designee, will determine the fair value of the assets on at least a quarterly basis in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure, or ASC 820. In accordance with Rule 2a-5 of the 1940 Act, the Company s Board has designated the Investment Adviser as the Company s valuation designee. The Company s Board and the audit committee of the Board, which is comprised solely of independent directors, oversees the activities, methodology and processes of the valuation designee. We define fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and sets out a fair value hierarchy. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). Inputs are broadly defined as assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. Investments measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories: Level 1 : Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical investments as of the reporting date. The types of investments in Level 1 include listed equities and listed derivatives. The Company does not adjust the quoted price for these investments, even in situations where the Company may hold a large position and a sale could reasonably impact the quoted price. Level 2 : Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets of comparable instruments, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date, and fair value is determined through the use of models or other valuation methodologies. Investments in this category generally include corporate bonds and loans, less liquid and restricted equity securities, and certain over-the-counter derivatives. Level 3 : Pricing inputs are unobservable for the investment and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the investment. The inputs into the determination of fair value are based upon the best information in the circumstances and may require significant management judgment or estimation. Investments in this category generally include equity and debt positions in private companies. 

 45 

Table of Contents 
 In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, an investment s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The Company s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the investment. The Company assesses the levels of the investments at each measurement date in accordance with the Company s accounting policy. Investments for which prices are not observable are generally private investments in the equity and debt securities of operating companies. Fair value of private investments is based on Level 3 inputs and determined by reference to public market or private transactions or valuations for comparable companies or assets in the relevant asset class when such amounts are available. Enterprise values of the underlying portfolio companies are completed to compute the fair value for each class of security owned by the Company. Generally, these enterprise valuations are derived by multiplying a key performance metric of the investee company s asset (e.g., EBITDA) by the relevant valuation multiple observed for comparable companies or transactions, adjusted by management for differences between the investment and the referenced comparable. If the enterprise value of private investments held cannot be valued by reference to observable valuation measures for comparable companies, then the primary analytical method used to estimate the fair value of such private investments is the discounted cash flow method. A sensitivity analysis is applied to the estimated future cash flows using various factors depending on investment, including assumed growth rate (in cash flows), capitalization rates (for determining terminal values) and appropriate discount rates to determine a range of reasonable values. The valuation based on the inputs determined to be the most probable is used as the fair value of the investment. The fair value of the Company s investments in debt securities is further estimated using recently executed transactions, market price quotations and traded yields of corporate transactions (all when observable). When observable data is not available, fair value is estimated based on analysis of the collateral, cash flow models with yield curve analysis, seniority of the debt, enterprise value relative to debt levels, projected financial condition and operating results, payment history and ability to generate sufficient cash flows to make payments when due, and prepayment penalties. Investments in the equity and debt securities of portfolio companies may also be valued at cost for a period of time after acquisition as the best indicator of fair value. The determination of fair value using these methodologies takes into account consideration of a range of factors, including but not limited to the price at which the investment was acquired, the nature of the investment, local market conditions, trading values on public exchanges for comparable securities, current and projected operating performance, and financing transactions subsequent to the acquisition of the investment. These valuation methodologies involve a significant degree of judgment by the Board. Because the Company is under no compulsion to dispose of its investments, which are made with a view to a holding period of two years or more, the estimated values, as determined above, may not reflect amounts that could be realized upon immediate sale nor amounts that ultimately may be realized. Because of the inherent uncertainty of the valuation, those estimated values may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the securities existed, and the differences could be material. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. We are subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates. We have invested, and plan to continue to invest primarily in illiquid debt securities of private companies. As of September 30, 2024, our debt portfolio consisted of 100 variable-rate investments. The variable-rate loans are usually based on a Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR (or an alternative risk-free floating interest rate index) rate and typically have durations of three months, after which they reset to current market interest rates. Variable-rate investments subject to a floor generally reset by reference to the current market index after one to nine months only if the index exceeds the floor. In regard to variable-rate instruments with a floor, we do not benefit from increases in interest rates until such rates exceed the floor and thereafter benefit from market rates above any such floor. In contrast, our cost of funds, to the extent it is not fixed, will fluctuate with changes in interest rates since it has no floor. 

 46 

Table of Contents 
 Assuming that the most recent Consolidated Statements of Assets and Liabilities was to remain constant, and no actions were taken to alter the existing interest rate sensitivity, the following table shows the annualized impact of hypothetical base rate changes in interest rates: 

Interest Interest Basis Point Change Income Expense Net Income -25 Basis Points (1,391) (1,391) Base Interest Rate +100 Basis Points 5,563 5,563 +200 Basis Points 11,127 11,127 +300 Basis Points 16,690 16,690 Most of our investments will not have a readily available market price, and we (or through an unaffiliated third-party firm, to the extent that our assets are treated as plan assets for purposes of ERISA) will value these investments at fair value as determined in good faith by the Board in accordance with our valuation policy. There is no single standard for determining fair value in good faith. As a result, determining fair value requires that judgment be applied to the specific facts and circumstances of each portfolio investment while employing a consistently applied valuation process for the types of investments we make. See footnote 2 to our consolidated financial statements for more details on estimates and judgments made by us in connection with the valuation of our investments. Item 4. Controls and Procedures. Disclosure Controls and Procedures In accordance with Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) of the 1934 Act, we, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that, at the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective and provided reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our periodic SEC filings is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that it will detect or uncover failures within the Company to disclose material information otherwise required to be set forth in the Company s periodic reports. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting No change occurred in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
