In addition, following certain events that occur prior to the maturity date or if the Company delivers a notice of redemption, the Company will increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert its Convertible Notes in connection with such corporate event or a notice of redemption, as the case may be, in certain circumstances as provided in the Indenture. Prior to March 15, 2026, the Convertible Notes are convertible only under the following circumstances: during any calendar quarter, if the last reported sale price of the Company s common stock for at least trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; 

 during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per principal amount of the Convertible Notes for each such trading day was less than of the product of the last reported sale price of the Company s common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; 

 if the Company calls any or all of the Convertible Notes for redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the redemption date; or 

 upon the occurrence of corporate events specified in the Indenture. 

 On or after March 15, 2026 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date of the Convertible Notes, holders may convert the Convertible Notes at any time regardless of the foregoing circumstances. Upon conversion of the Convertible Notes, the Company will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of the Company s common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, at the Company s election. On or after , the Company may redeem for cash all or a portion of the Convertible Notes, at its option, if the last reported sale price of the Company s common stock has been at least of the conversion price then in effect for at least trading days (whether or not consecutive), including the trading day immediately preceding the date on which the Company provides a notice of redemption, during any consecutive trading day period ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which the Company provides notice of redemption. The redemption price will be equal to of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. If the Company calls any Convertible Notes for redemption, it will constitute a make-whole fundamental change with respect to such Convertible Notes, in which case the conversion rate applicable to the conversion of such Notes, if converted in connection with the redemption, will be increased in certain circumstances. The Company has not called for redemption or redeemed any of the Convertible Notes as of September 30, 2024. If the Company undergoes a fundamental change, as defined in the Indenture, prior to maturity, subject to certain conditions, holders may require the Company to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their Convertible Notes at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. In January 2021, July 2021 and July 2022, the Company entered into separate, privately negotiated exchange agreements to modify the conversion terms with certain holders of its 2019 Convertible Notes and 2020 Convertible Notes. Under the terms of these exchange agreements, in January 2021, July 2021 and July 2022, the holders exchanged approximately million of 2019 Convertible Notes, million of 2019 Convertible Notes and 2020 Convertible Notes, and million of 2020 Convertible Notes, respectively, in

In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 470-20, Debt Debt with Conversion and Other Options, ASC 470-20 the Company accounted for the exchange as an induced conversion based on the short period of time the conversion offer was open and the substantive conversion feature offer. The Company accounted for the conversion of the debt as an inducement by expensing the fair value of the shares that were issued in excess of the original terms of the Convertible Notes. The conditional conversion feature of the Convertible Notes was triggered as of December 31, 2023, and as a result the Convertible Notes were convertible at the option of the holders until March 31, 2024. No Convertible Notes were converted during this period. The conditional conversion feature of the Convertible Notes was triggered as of March 31, 2024, and as a result the Convertible Notes were convertible at the option of the holders until June 30, 2024. No Convertible Notes were converted during this period. The conditional conversion feature of the Convertible Notes was not triggered as of June 30, 2024, and as a result the Convertible Notes are not convertible during the quarter ending September 30, 2024.

Capped Call Transactions On September 11, 2019 and May 6, 2020, concurrently with the pricings of the Convertible Notes, the Company entered into capped call transactions with counterparties. The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution to the Company s common stock upon any conversion of Convertible Notes and/or offset any cash payments the Company is required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted Convertible Notes, as the case may be, in the event that the market price per share of the Company s common stock, as measured under the terms of the capped call transactions, is greater than the strike price of the capped call transactions, which is initially (the conversion price of the Convertible Notes) and is subject to anti-dilution adjustments substantially similar to those applicable to the conversion rate of such Convertible Notes. If, however, the market price per share of the Company s common stock, as measured under the terms of the capped call transactions, exceeds the cap price of the capped call transactions, which is initially per share, there would nevertheless be dilution and/or there would not be an offset of such potential cash payments, in each case, to the extent that such market price exceeds the cap price of the capped call transactions. On February 27, 2024, the Company unwound a portion of the capped call transactions with the capped call counterparties, which resulted in cash proceeds to the Company of million. The unwind transactions were settled at a volume-weighted average price per share of on March 8, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the Company holds remaining capped call transactions in a notional amount corresponding to million principal amount of Convertible Notes.

 million (the Credit Facility ), consisting of an initial draw of million at closing and a potential additional million draw at the Company s option upon satisfaction of a million minimum cash requirement and a requirement that the Company s trailing three-month sales of SYFOVRE is at least million prior to the million draw. The Company can exercise the option for the million draw through September 30, 2025, assuming such requirements are met. The Credit Facility matures on (the Maturity Date and bears interest at (i) in the case of SOFR Loans, an annual rate equal to 3-month Term SOFR (subject to floor), plus , and (ii) in the case of Base Rate Loans, an annual rate equal to the base rate as defined in the agreement (subject to floor), plus . Certain additional commitment and undrawn amount fees are also payable in connection with the Credit Facility. The net proceeds from the initial draw of the Credit Facility were approximately million, net of million of issuance costs. The Company used million of the proceeds from the initial draw of the Credit Facility to buy out its remaining obligations to SFJ. The buyout of the SFJ development liability eliminated million in payments to SFJ between 2024 and 2027, including approximately million payable through 2025 (See Note 6). The Credit Facility does not provide for scheduled amortization payments during the term. All principal will be due on the Maturity Date. The Company will have the right to prepay loans under the Credit Facility at any time. The Company is required to repay loans under the Credit Facility with proceeds from certain asset sales, condemnation events and extraordinary receipts, subject, in some cases, to reinvestment rights. Repayments are subject to a prepayment premium. Repayments may be made after the first year of the loan and are subject to a prepayment premium up to depending on timing.

 million and million of income tax expense, respectively, primarily pertaining to state and foreign income taxes. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company recorded million and million of income tax expense, respectively, primarily pertaining to state and foreign income taxes. The income tax provision during interim periods is computed by applying an estimated annual effective tax rate to year-to-date pre-tax income, plus adjustments for significant unusual or infrequently occurring items, in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 740-270, Income Taxes Interim Reporting . The income tax provision differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of primarily due to the effect of valuation allowance against the Company s net deferred tax assets, which reduces the Company s net tax benefit. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company has recorded a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

 million to these vendors. As a result of this termination, the Company incurred an expense of million, which is included in Other Liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. In addition, the Company has other non-cancelable purchase agreements as of September 30, 2024, under which it is obligat ed to pay up to an aggregate of million to vendors. The Company is a party to a master lease agreement under which the Company leases vehicles with initial terms of months from the date of delivery. If the Company were unable to take delivery of a previously ordered vehicle, the Company may incur nominal fees. Indemnifications In the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into agreements that may include indemnification provisions. Pursuant to such agreements, the Company may indemnify, hold harmless and defend indemnified parties for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party. Some of the provisions will limit losses to those arising from third-party actions. In some cases, the indemnification will continue after the termination of the agreement. The maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these provisions is not determinable. The Company has t incurred any cost to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification provisions. Legal During the normal course of business, the Company may be a party to legal claims that may not be covered by insurance. On August 2, 2023, Judith M. Soderberg filed a putative class action in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware against the Company and certain current and former executive officers of the Company (the Complaint ). The Complaint alleges, among other things, that the defendants violated Sections 10(b) and/or 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder by misrepresenting and/or omitting certain material facts related to the design of SYFOVRE s clinical trials and the risks associated with SYFOVRE s commercial adoption. The Complaint seeks, among other relief, compensatory damages and equitable relief in favor of the alleged class against all defendants, including interest, and reasonable costs and expenses incurred by plaintiffs, including attorneys and expert fees. On October 2, 2023, the defendants moved to transfer the action to the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. On October 23, 2023, the Court appointed Ray Peleckas and Michigan Laborers Pension Fund together as Co-Lead Plaintiffs and assigned the action the caption In Apellis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Securities Litigation, Case 1:23-cv-00834-MN. The Co-Lead Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on February 8, 2024 (the Amended Complaint ). The Amended Complaint is brought on behalf of a class of all persons and entities who purchased or otherwise acquired Apellis common stock between January 28, 2021 and July 28, 2023, inclusive, names the Company and Cedric Francois, our chief executive officer, as defendants, and makes similar allegations, asserts the same claims and seeks the same relief as the Complaint. On May 17, 2024, the United States District Court for the District of Delaware approved the motion to transfer to the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The defendants moved to dismiss the Complaint on June 12, 2024, and the Court has scheduled oral argument on this motion for November 14, 2024. The Company s businesses may also be subject at any time to other commercial disputes, product liability claims, personal injury claims, third-party subpoenas or various other lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of business, including intellectual property infringement, employment or investor matters, and the Company expects that this will continue to be the case in the future. For example, in August 2024, an individual filed a civil action against the Company in the United States District Court in the Northern District of Texas, alleging personal injury claims in connection with the use of SYFOVRE. We moved to dismiss this civil action in September 2024. The Court has not yet ruled on this motion to dismiss, as of the date of issuance of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. The outcome of the matters described above cannot be predicted with certainty and therefore any loss is neither probable nor reasonably estimable. However, the Company intends to vigorously defend against these matters.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our audited financial statements and related notes for the year ended December 31, 2023 included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 27, 2024, as amended by Amendment No. 1 thereto filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 29, 2024, which we refer to as the 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including statements regarding our strategy, future operations, future financial position, future revenue, projected costs, prospects, plans and objectives of management and expected market growth are forward-looking statements. The words anticipate, believe, continue, could, estimate, expect, intend, may, plan, potential, predict, project, should, target, would and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. 
 We may not actually achieve the plans, intentions or expectations disclosed in our forward-looking statements, and you should not place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements. Actual results or events could differ materially from the plans, intentions and expectations disclosed in the forward-looking statements we make. Please also refer to those factors described in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K for important factors that we believe could cause actual results to differ materially from those in our forward-looking statements. 
 Overview 
 We are a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of novel therapeutic compounds to treat diseases with high unmet needs through the inhibition of the complement system, which is an integral component of the immune system, at the level of C3, the central protein in the complement cascade. We believe that this approach can result in broad inhibition of the principal pathways of the complement system and has the potential to effectively control diseases with high unmet need and that are driven by excessive complement activation. 
 
 In February 2023, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, approved SYFOVRE (pegcetacoplan injection), the first approved treatment for geographic atrophy secondary to age-related macular degeneration, or GA. In June 2024, we announced additional results from the GALE long-term extension study which demonstrated that SYFOVRE injection preserved visual function in patients with GA at 36 months. We believe SYFOVRE has the potential to be a best-in-class treatment for patients with GA, a disease that affects approximately 1.5 million people in the United States and five million people worldwide. We launched SYFOVRE in the United States in March 2023. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we generated 152.0 million and 444.0 million, respectively, in U.S. net product revenue from sales of SYFOVRE. 
 
 We have pending marketing applications for SYFOVRE for the treatment of GA with regulatory authorities in various jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom and Switzerland, which are each under review by the applicable regulatory authorities. In September 2024, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, adopted a negative opinion following the re-examination of the marketing authorization application, or MAA, with the European Medicines Agency, or EMA. We have exclusive, worldwide commercialization rights for intravitreal pegcetacoplan. 
 
 In May 2021, the FDA approved EMPAVELI (systemic pegcetacoplan), the first targeted C3 therapy, for the treatment of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, or PNH, for use in adults who are either treatment-na ve or who are switching from C5 inhibitors eculizumab or ravulizumab. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we generated 24.6 million and 74.7 million, respectively, in U.S. net product revenue from sales of EMPAVELI and received 5.0 million and 13.9 million, respectively, in royalties from our collaboration partner, Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB (Publ), or Sobi, which has exclusive ex-U.S. commercialization rights for systemic pegcetacoplan outside of the United States. We have commercialization rights for systemic pegcetacoplan in the United States. 
 
 We believe that EMPAVELI has the potential to be a best-in-class treatment for additional high unmet need areas. We are leading the development of systemic pegcetacoplan in C3 glomerulopathy, or C3G, and primary immune complex membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, or primary IC-MPGN, in nephrology under our collaboration with Sobi. In August 2024, we reported top-line data from the Phase 3 VALIANT trial investigating systemic pegcetacoplan in adolescent and adult patients with naive and post-transplant recurrence IC-MPGN and C3G and provided further details at the annual meeting of the American Society of Nephrology in October 2024. The VALIANT study demonstrated a 68 reduction in proteinuria in C3G and IC-MPGN patients compared to placebo (p

 long-term extension study. We intend to submit a supplemental new drug application to the FDA in early 2025, and Sobi plans to submit an MAA to the EMA in 2025. 
 
 Sobi is leading the development of systemic pegcetacoplan for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation-associated thrombotic microangiopathy, or HSCT-TMA, in hematology. 
 
 We are developing additional product candidates with other routes of administration. These candidates include APL-3007, a small interfering RNA, or siRNA, which is in a Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy volunteers, as well as an oral complement inhibitor in preclinical development. Furthermore, we are collaborating with Beam Therapeutics, Inc., or Beam, on up to six research programs focused on C3 and other complement targets in the eye, liver and brain, using Beam s proprietary base editing technology to discover new treatments for complement-driven diseases. 
 
 Since our commencement of operations in May 2010, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to developing our proprietary technology, developing product candidates, undertaking preclinical studies and conducting clinical trials for pegcetacoplan, building our intellectual property portfolio, organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital, preparing for and executing the commercial launch of our products and providing general and administrative support for these operations. 
 
 To date, we have financed our operations primarily through approximately 2.6 billion in net proceeds from public and private offerings of our common stock and convertible securities, 392.0 million in payments and royalties from Sobi pursuant to our collaboration agreement, 532.5 million under various credit arrangements, including with Sixth Street Lending Partners, or Sixth Street, and SFJ Pharmaceuticals Group, or SFJ, and 98.8 million relating to the unwinding of certain capped call transactions in March 2024, as well as from the proceeds of our operations. To date, we have exchanged 425.4 million and converted 0.7 million of aggregate principal amount of our Convertible Notes for shares of our common stock. Our non-dilutive financing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which include the Sixth Street Financing Agreement (as defined below), the repayment of our remaining obligations to SFJ and the partial unwinding of our capped call transactions, increased the amount of cash available to us through 2025 by approximately 270.0 million, with the potential for us to access additional short-term liquidity through a second draw of 100.0 million under the Credit Facility (as defined below). 
 We have incurred significant annual net operating losses in every year since our inception, and we expect to continue to incur net operating losses for at least this year. Our net losses were 57.4 million and 140.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of . 3.0 billion. 
 
 Our operating results may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year. We anticipate that we will continue to incur significant commercialization expenses related to sales, marketing, medical affairs, manufacturing, distribution and other commercial infrastructure associated with the commercialization of EMPAVELI for the treatment of PNH and other indications and the commercialization of SYFOVRE for the treatment of GA. In addition, we expect to continue to incur these expenses if and as we continue to develop and conduct our ongoing and planned clinical trials of pegcetacoplan and our other product candidates; initiate and continue research and preclinical and clinical development efforts for any future product candidates; seek to identify and develop additional product candidates for complement-dependent diseases; seek regulatory and marketing approvals for our product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials, if any; establish sales, marketing, distribution and other commercial infrastructure to commercialize any additional products for which we may obtain marketing approval; require the manufacture of larger quantities of product candidates for clinical development and, potentially, commercialization; maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio; hire and retain additional personnel, such as clinical, quality control, regulatory and scientific personnel; add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our product development and add equipment and physical infrastructure to support our research and development programs and commercialization. 
 
 Financing Agreement and Credit Facility 
 
 On May 13, 2024, we entered into a financing agreement, or the Sixth Street Financing Agreement, with certain of our material subsidiaries as guarantors party thereto, the lenders party thereto, or the Lenders, and Sixth Street Lending Partners, as the administrative agent and collateral agent for the Lenders. 
 
 The Sixth Street Financing Agreement provides for a senior secured term loan facility of up to 475.0 million, or the Credit Facility, consisting of an initial draw of 375.0 million at closing and a potential additional 100.0 million draw at our option upon satisfaction of a 50.0 million minimum cash requirement and a requirement that our trailing three-month sales of SYFOVRE is at least 180.0 million prior to the 100.0 million draw. We can exercise the option for the additional 100.0 million draw through September 30, 2025, assuming such requirements are met. 
 
 The Credit Facility matures on May 13, 2030 (the Maturity Date and bears interest at (i) in the case of SOFR Loans, an annual rate equal to 3-month Term SOFR (subject to 1.00 floor), plus 5.75 , and (ii) in the case of Base Rate Loans, an annual rate equal to the

 base rate as defined in the agreement (subject to 2.00 floor), plus 4.75 . Certain additional commitment and undrawn amount fees are also payable in connection with the Credit Facility. 
 
 The net proceeds from the initial draw of the Credit Facility were approximately 358.2 million, net of 16.8 million of issuance costs. We used the majority of the proceeds of the 375.0 million draw at closing to buy out our remaining obligations to SFJ, in the amount of approximately 326.5 million. 
 
 The Credit Facility does not provide for scheduled amortization payments during the term. All principal will be due on the Maturity Date. We have the right to prepay loans under the Credit Facility at any time. We are required to repay loans under the Credit Facility with proceeds from certain asset sales, condemnation events and extraordinary receipts, subject, in some cases, to reinvestment rights. Repayments are subject to a prepayment premium. Repayments may be made after the first year of the loan and are subject to a prepayment premium up to 3 depending on timing. 
 
 All obligations under the Sixth Street Financing Agreement are secured on a first-priority basis, subject to certain exceptions, by security interests in substantially all of our assets and assets of our material subsidiaries, including our intellectual property, and are guaranteed by our material subsidiaries, including foreign subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions. 
 
 The Sixth Street Financing Agreement contains customary covenants, including, without limitation, a financial covenant to maintain liquidity of at least 50.0 million if our market capitalization is below 3.0 billion, and negative covenants that, subject to certain exceptions, restrict indebtedness, liens, investments (including acquisitions), fundamental changes, asset sales and licensing transactions, dividends, modifications to material agreements, payment of subordinated indebtedness, and other matters customarily restricted in such agreements. Among other permissions, we are permitted, on terms and conditions set forth on the Sixth Street Financing Agreement, to enter into a separate asset-based financing arrangement with a third party in an amount of up to 100.0 million, which amount is increased to 200.0 million upon certain sales or market capitalization thresholds, and to have outstanding convertible unsecured notes in an amount equal to the greater of 400.0 million and 10 of our market capitalization, but not to exceed 600.0 million. We are subject to restrictions on sales and licensing transactions with respect to our core intellectual property, defined to include SYFOVRE, EMPAVELI, and other pegcetacoplan product assets, subject to certain exceptions, including certain transactions related to areas outside the United States and Europe. 
 
 The Sixth Street Financing Agreement also contains certain events of default after which loans under the Credit Facility may be due and payable immediately, including payment defaults, material inaccuracy of representations and warranties, covenant defaults, bankruptcy and insolvency proceedings, cross-defaults to certain other agreements, judgments against us and our subsidiaries, and change of control. 
 
 SFJ Agreement 
 
 In 2019, we entered into a development funding agreement (as amended, the SFJ agreement with SFJ Pharmaceuticals Group SFJ ), under which SFJ agreed to provide funding to us to support the development of pegcetacoplan for the treatment of patients with PNH. Under the SFJ agreement, SFJ paid us an aggregate of 140.0 million between June 2019 and January 2020. 
 
 Following regulatory approval for the use of systemic pegcetacoplan as a treatment for PNH by the FDA in May 2021 and by the EMA in December 2021, we became obligated to pay SFJ an aggregate of 460.0 million in payments between 2021 and 2027. We paid SFJ an aggregate of 94.0 million through March 31, 2024. 
 
 On May 13, 2024, we used proceeds from the Sixth Street Financing Agreement to buy out our remaining obligations owed to SFJ, in the amount of approximately 326.5 million. The buyout of the SFJ development liability eliminated the remaining 366.0 million in payments to SFJ, including a total of approximately 200.0 million payable in 2024 and 2025. 
 
 Convertible Notes 
 
 On September 16, 2019, we completed a private offering of convertible notes, or the 2019 Convertible Notes, with an aggregate principal amount of 220.0 million issued pursuant to an indenture, or the Indenture, with U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee. 
 The net proceeds from the sale of the 2019 Convertible Notes were approximately 212.9 million after deducting the initial purchasers discounts and commissions of 6.6 million and offering expenses of 0.5 million. We used 28.4 million of the net proceeds from the sale of the 2019 Convertible Notes to pay the cost of the capped call transactions in September 2019 described below. 
 
 On May 12, 2020, we issued convertible notes, or the 2020 Convertible Notes, with an aggregate principal amount of 300.0 million. The net proceeds from the sale of the 2020 Convertible Notes were approximately 322.9 million after deducting the purchasers discounts and commission of 5.7 million and offering expenses of 0.3 million. We used 43.1 million of the net proceeds from the sale to pay the cost of the additional capped call transactions in May 2020 described below. 
 
 25 

Table of Contents 

 The 2019 Convertible Notes and the 2020 Convertible Notes are referred to together as the Convertible Notes. The Convertible Notes are our senior unsecured obligations and bear interest at a rate of 3.5 per year payable semiannually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning on March 15, 2020. The Convertible Notes will mature on September 15, 2026, unless converted earlier, redeemed or repurchased in accordance with their terms. 
 
 The Convertible Notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at an initial conversion rate of 25.3405 shares per 1,000 principal amount of notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately 39.4625 per share of common stock). The conversion rate is subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments. In addition, following certain events that occur prior to the maturity date or if we deliver a notice of redemption, we will increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert its Convertible Notes in connection with such corporate event or a notice of redemption, as the case may be, in certain circumstances as provided in the Indenture. 
 
 Prior to March 15, 2026, the Convertible Notes are convertible only under the following circumstances: 
 
 during any calendar quarter, if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130 of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; 

during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per 1,000 principal amount of the Convertible Notes for each such trading day was less than 98 of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; 

if we call any or all of the Convertible Notes for redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the redemption date; or upon the occurrence of corporate events specified in the Indenture. 

On, or after, March 15, 2026 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date of the Convertible Notes, holders may convert the Convertible Notes at any time regardless of the foregoing circumstances. Upon conversion of the Convertible Notes, we will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, at our election. 
 
 As of September 20, 2023, we may redeem for cash all or a portion of the Convertible Notes, at our option, if the last reported sale price of our common stock has been at least 130 of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive), including the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provide a notice of redemption, during any 30 consecutive trading day period ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provide notice of redemption. The redemption price will be equal to 100 of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. If we call any Convertible Notes for redemption, it will constitute a make-whole fundamental change with respect to such Convertible Notes, in which case the conversion rate applicable to the conversion of such Notes, if converted in connection with the redemption, will be increased in certain circumstances. We have not called for redemption any of the Convertible Notes as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 If we undergo a fundamental change, as defined in the Indenture, prior to maturity, subject to certain conditions, holders may require us to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their Convertible Notes at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100 of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. 
 
 In January 2021, July 2021 and July 2022, we entered into separate, privately negotiated exchange agreements to modify the conversion terms with certain holders of our Convertible Notes. Under the terms of these exchange agreements, in January 2021, July 2021 and July 2022, the holders exchanged approximately 126.1 million of 2019 Convertible Notes, 201.1 million of 2019 Convertible Notes and 2020 Convertible Notes, and 98.1 million of 2020 Convertible Notes, respectively, in aggregate principal amount held by them for an aggregate of 3,906,869 shares, 5,992,217 shares and 3,027,018 shares, respectively, of common stock we issued. In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 470-20, Debt Debt with Conversion and Other Options, or ASC 470-20, we accounted for the exchange as an induced conversion based on the short period of time the conversion offer was open and the substantive conversion feature offer. We accounted for the conversion of the debt as an inducement by expensing the fair value of the shares that were issued in excess of the original terms of the Convertible Notes. 
 
 The conditional conversion feature of the Convertible Notes was triggered as of December 31, 2023, and as a result the Convertible Notes were convertible at the option of the holders until March 31, 2024. No Convertible Notes were converted during this period.

 As of September 30, 2024, we held in treasury Convertible Notes in principal amount of 425.4 million, which notes had not been cancelled. 
 Collaboration Agreement with Sobi 
 
 On October 27, 2020, we entered into the Sobi collaboration agreement, concerning the development and commercialization of pegcetacoplan and specified other structurally and functionally similar compstatin analogues or derivatives for use systemically or for local non-ophthalmological administration, collectively referred to as the licensed products. We granted Sobi an exclusive (subject to certain rights retained by us), sublicensable license of certain patent rights and know-how to develop and commercialize licensed products in all countries outside of the United States. We retained the right to commercialize licensed products in the United States, and, subject to specified limitations, to develop licensed products worldwide for commercialization in the United States. Under the Sobi collaboration agreement, Sobi made an upfront payment of 250.0 million in November 2020, and agreed to pay up to an aggregate of 915.0 million upon the achievement of specified one-time regulatory and commercial milestone events, including a 50.0 million milestone payable following the first regulatory and reimbursement approval of systemic pegcetacoplan in any major European country, and to reimburse us for up to 80.0 million in development costs. 
 
 In January 2021 we received a 25.0 million development reimbursement payment from Sobi and in January 2022 and 2023, we received a 20.0 million development reimbursement payment from Sobi. In January 2024, we waived the remaining reimbursement payment of 15.0 million in connection with the decision to discontinue the cold agglutinin disease program. 
 
 The European Commission approved systemic Aspaveli (pegcetacoplan) for the treatment of adults with PNH in December 2021. In March 2022, we earned a 50.0 million payment from Sobi related to the first regulatory and reimbursement milestone in Europe, which we received in April 2022. We are also entitled to receive tiered, double-digit royalties (ranging from high teens to high twenties) on sales of licensed products outside of the United States, subject to customary deductions and third-party payment obligations, until the latest to occur of: (i) expiration of the last-to-expire of specified licensed patent rights; (ii) expiration of regulatory exclusivity; and (iii) ten (10) years after the first commercial sale of the applicable licensed product, in each case on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis. We remain responsible for our license fee obligations (including royalty obligations) to the University of Pennsylvania. 
 Financial Operations Overview 
 Revenue 
 
 Our revenues consist of product sales of EMPAVELI and SYFOVRE, and revenues derived from our collaboration agreement with Sobi. 
 
 Revenue is recognized when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation by transferring a promised good or service to a customer. An asset is transferred when, or as, the customer obtains control of that asset. For performance obligations that are satisfied over time, we recognize revenue using an input or output measure of progress that best depicts the satisfaction of the relevant performance obligation. 
 Product Revenues 
 
 Product revenue is derived from our sales of our commercial products, EMPAVELI and SYFOVRE, in the United States. 
 
 Licensing and Other Revenue 
 
 Licensing and other revenue is derived from our collaboration agreement with Sobi concerning the development and commercialization of pegcetacoplan and specified other compstatin analogues or derivatives for use systemically or for local non-ophthalmic administration. 
 
 27 

Table of Contents 

 Cost of Sales 
 
 Cost of sales consists primarily of costs associated with the manufacturing of EMPAVELI and SYFOVRE, royalties owed to our licensor, costs associated with supply provided under the Sobi collaboration agreement, costs of products provided under our patient assistance programs, and certain period costs. 
 Research and Development Expenses 
 Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for our research activities, including our drug discovery efforts, and the development of our product candidates, which include: 
 employee-related expenses including salaries, bonuses, benefits and share-based compensation expense related to individuals performing research and development activities; 

expenses incurred under agreements with third parties, including contract research organizations, or CROs, that conduct clinical trials and research and development activities on our behalf, and contract manufacturing organizations that manufacture quantities of drug supplies for both our preclinical studies and clinical trials; 

the cost of consultants, including share-based compensation expense; and 

various other expenses incident to the management of our preclinical studies and clinical trials. 

Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be received in the future for use in research and development activities are deferred and capitalized. The capitalized amounts are expensed as the related goods are delivered or the services are performed. We have not provided program costs since inception because historically we have not tracked or recorded our research and development expenses on a program-by-program basis. 
 The successful development of our product candidates in clinical development is highly uncertain. Accordingly, at this time, we cannot reasonably estimate the nature, timing and costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the remainder of the clinical development of these product candidates. We are also unable to predict when, if ever, material net cash inflows will commence from pegcetacoplan in other jurisdictions and indications or any other potential product candidates. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing therapeutics, including the uncertainties of: 
 establishing an appropriate safety profile in preclinical studies; 

successful enrollment in, and completion of clinical trials; 

receipt of marketing approvals from applicable regulatory authorities; 

establishing commercial manufacturing capabilities or making arrangements with third-party manufacturers; 

obtaining and maintaining patent and trade secret protection and regulatory exclusivity for our product candidates; 

launching commercial sales of the products, if and when approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others; and 

an acceptable safety profile of the products following approval. 

A change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of any of our product candidates would significantly change the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. 
 
 Research and development activities are central to our business model. Product candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. We expect research and development costs to increase for the foreseeable future as our product candidate development programs progress. However, we do not believe that it is possible at this time to accurately project total program-specific expenses through commercialization. There are numerous factors associated with the successful commercialization of any of our product candidates, including future trial design and various regulatory requirements, many of which cannot be determined with accuracy at this time based on our stage of development. Additionally, future commercial and regulatory factors beyond our control will impact our clinical development programs and plans. 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of costs associated with the commercialization of approved products and general and administrative costs to support operations, including salaries, bonuses, benefits and share-based compensation. Selling expenses include product marketing, sales operations costs, and other costs incurred to support our sales efforts. General and administrative expenses include corporate support functions such as executive management, finance and accounting, business 
 28 

Table of Contents 

 development, legal, human resources, information technology, and associated external costs to support those functions. Other significant costs include facility costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses, legal fees relating to patent and corporate matters, and fees for accounting and consulting services. 
 
 We anticipate that our selling, general and administrative expenses will increase in the future to support continued commercial activities for our approved products, potential commercialization of our product candidates and costs of operating as a public company. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 
 This discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which we have prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of expenses during the reported periods. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to product revenue, licensing revenue, costs of research collaboration arrangements, inventory, accrued research and development expenses, convertible notes, capped call transactions and development liability, which we described in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 
 Our critical accounting policies are described in Note 2 of Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in Part I, Item 7, Critical Accounting Estimates in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. There have been no changes to our critical accounting estimates since our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, except as noted in Note 2.

Product Revenue, Net 
 Our product revenue, net is derived from EMPAVELI sales in the United States which was launched in May 2021 and SYFOVRE sales in the United States which was launched in March 2023. We recognized 176.6 million and 99.2 million of net product revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The net product revenue of 176.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, consists of 24.6 million in net product revenue from sales of EMPAVELI and 152.0 million in net product revenue from sales of SYFOVRE. The net product revenue of 99.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, consists of 
 29 

Table of Contents 

 23.9 million in net product revenue from sales of EMPAVELI and 75.3 million in net product revenue from sales of SYFOVRE. The increase in product revenue was primarily driven by an increase in volume of SYFOVRE sales in the second year of launch. 
 Licensing and Other Revenue 
 Licensing and other revenue of 20.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 consisted of 15.3 million in revenue from product supplied to Sobi and 5.0 million in royalty revenue from Sobi. Licensing and other revenue of 11.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 consisted of 3.5 million in revenue from product supplied to Sobi, 2.7 million in royalty revenue from Sobi and 5.0 million from collaboration milestones from Sobi. 
 
 Cost of Sales 
 
 Cost of sales was 33.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 22.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in cost of sales was primarily driven by a 9.0 million increase in expenses incurred related to excess, obsolete or scrapped inventory and a 6.4 million expense incurred in connection with the termination of the minimum purchase obligation of PEG in September 2024, which were partially offset by a 3.9 million decrease in royalty expense as sales-based milestones incurred in the prior year did not recur in the current period. 
 
 In addition, prior to receiving FDA approval for EMPAVELI and SYFOVRE, the costs associated with the manufacturing of EMPAVELI and SYFOVRE inventory were expensed as incurred as research and development expense. This did not materially impact cost of sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. As of September 30, 2024, the remaining pre-FDA approved inventory was 15.4 million, which primarily consisted of raw materials.

Research and development expenses increased by 9.1 million to 88.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 79.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 12 . The increase in research and development expenses was primarily attributable to a 9.6 million increase in program specific external costs, a 2.7 million increase in non-program specific external costs and a 3.2 million decrease in compensation and related personnel costs. 
 
 The increase in our program-specific external costs of 9.6 million was driven by an increase of 4.5 million in GA costs and an increase of 4.7 million in other development and discovery programs costs. The increases were partially offset by a decrease of 0.8 million in IC-MPGN and C3G costs and a decrease of 1.5 million in ALS due to the discontinuation of the Phase 2 MERIDIAN study in 2024. 
 
 30 

Table of Contents 

 The decrease in compensation and related personnel costs of 3.2 million was driven by a 3.8 million decrease in salaries and benefits due to lower headcount compared to the prior year and reclassification of certain employee costs to selling, general and administrative expenses, which was partially offset by a 0.6 million increase in stock compensation expense associated with the grant of stock options and restricted stock units to employees. 
 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by 23.6 million to 122.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 145.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 16 . The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in personnel related costs of 2.1 million, a decrease in general commercial activities of 20.1 million, lower office costs of 1.8 million and a 0.5 million reduction in professional and consulting fees. The decrease was partially offset by an increase of 0.2 million in travel and insurance expense and factoring fees of 0.7 million. The decrease in personnel related costs of 2.1 million was primarily attributable to a decrease in salaries expenses of 7.1 million, and a decrease of 0.3 million in recruiting expenses, partially offset by higher stock compensation expenses of 5.3 million associated with the grant of stock options and restricted stock units to employees. 
 Loss on extinguishment of development liability 
 
 We paid our remaining obligations under the SFJ agreement in full in May 2024. We concluded that the development liability was extinguished as of the payoff date. The difference of 1.9 million between the reacquisition price of 326.5 million and the net carrying value of the development liability of 324.6 million was recorded as a loss on the extinguishment of the development liability as of September 30, 2024. 
 Interest Income 
 Interest income was 2.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 2.1 million, compared to 5.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in interest income was primarily attributable to decreased investments during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense was 12.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 5.2 million, compared to 7.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is primarily due to the interest incurred under the Credit Facility and was partially offset by a decrease in the balance of the development liability. 
 Other (Expense)/Income, Net

Product Revenue, Net 
 Our product revenue, net is derived from EMPAVELI sales in the United States, which was launched in May 2021 and SYFOVRE sales in the United States which was launched in March 2023. We recognized 518.8 million and 227.6 million of net product revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The net product revenue of 518.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, consisted of 74.7 million in net product revenue from sales of EMPAVELI and 444.0 million in net product revenue from sales of SYFOVRE. The net product revenue of 227.6 million for three months ended September 30, 2023, consisted of 66.7 million in net product revenue from sales of EMPAVELI and 161.0 million in net product revenue from sales of SYFOVRE. The increase in product revenue was primarily driven by an increase in volume of SYFOVRE sales in the second year of launch. 
 Licensing and Other Revenue 
 
 Licensing and other revenue of 50.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted of 36.2 million in revenue for product supplied to Sobi and 13.9 million in royalty revenue from Sobi. Licensing and other revenue of 22.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 included 10.8 million in revenue for product supplied to Sobi, 6.8 million in royalty revenue from Sobi and 5.0 million from collaboration milestones from Sobi. 
 
 Cost of Sales 
 
 Cost of sales was 76.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 38.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in cost of sales was primarily driven by a 1.6 million increase due to higher volume from commercial sales and product provided under our patient assistance programs, a 8.4 million increase due to higher volume of product supplied to Sobi, a 4.0 million increase in royalty expense, a 17.9 million increase in expenses incurred related to excess, obsolete or scrapped inventory, and a 6.4 million expense incurred in connection with the termination of the minimum purchase obligation of PEG in September 2024. 
 
 In addition, prior to receiving FDA approval for EMPAVELI and SYFOVRE, the costs associated with the manufacturing of EMPAVELI and SYFOVRE inventory were expensed as incurred as research and development expense. This did not materially impact cost of sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. As of September 30, 2024, the remaining pre-FDA approved inventory was 15.4 million, which primarily consisted of raw materials.

Research and development expenses decreased by 33.9 million to 251.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 285.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 12 . The decrease in research and development expenses was primarily attributable to a 34.9 million decrease in compensation and related personnel costs and 2.2 million decrease in non-program specific external costs, which was partially offset by a 3.6 million increase in program specific external costs. 
 
 The increase in our program-specific external costs of 3.6 million was driven by an increase of 2.2 million related to IC-MPGN and C3G costs, and an increase of 15.0 million as a result of a one-time expense related to the discontinuation of the CAD program. These increases were partially offset by a 4.2 million decrease in GA costs which largely reflects the impact of the approval of SYFOVRE in February 2023, a 7.7 million decrease in ALS costs due to the discontinuation of the Phase 2 MERIDIAN study, and a 1.1 million decrease in other development and discovery program costs. 
 
 The decrease in compensation and related personnel costs of 34.9 million was driven by a 32.2 million decrease in salaries and benefits due to lower headcount compared to the prior year and reclassification of certain employee costs to selling, general and administrative expenses and a 2.7 million decrease in stock compensation expense associated with the grant of stock options and restricted stock units to employees. 
 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by 20.5 million to 379.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 359.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 6 . The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in personnel related costs of 7.1 million, an increase in general commercial activities of 11.5 million, higher office costs of 3.1 million, 0.7 million in factoring fees and an increase of 1.1 million in travel expenses, which were partially offset by a decrease of 2.5 million in professional and consulting fees and a decrease of 0.4 million in insurance expenses. The increase in personnel related costs of 7.1 million consisted of a 10.8 million increase related to stock compensation expense associated with the grant of stock options and restricted stock units to employees, partially offset by a decrease of 0.9 million in recruiting expenses and a 2.8 million decrease in salaries and benefits. 
 Loss on extinguishment of development liability 
 
 We paid our remaining obligations under the SFJ agreement in full in May 2024. We concluded that the development liability was extinguished as of the payoff date. The difference of 1.9 million between the reacquisition price of 326.5 million and the net carrying value of the development liability of 324.6 million was recorded as a loss on the extinguishment of the development liability as of September 30, 2024.

 Interest Income 
 Interest income was 9.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 7.0 million compared to 16.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in interest income was primarily attributable to decreased investments during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense was 28.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 6.7 million compared to 22.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is primarily due to the interest incurred under the Credit Facility and was partially offset by a decrease in the balance of the development liability. 
 Other (Expense)/Income, Net 
 Other expense was 0.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 0.5 million compared to 0.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to foreign currency revaluation losses. 
 Income Tax Expense 
 Income tax expense was 0.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 0.2 million compared to 0.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase primarily pertained to an increase in foreign and state taxes. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Sources of Liquidity 
 
 To date, we have financed our operations primarily through approximately 2.6 billion in net proceeds from public and private offerings of our common stock and convertible securities, 397.0 million in payments and royalties from Sobi pursuant to our collaboration agreement, 532.5 million under various credit arrangements, including with Sixth Street and SFJ, and 98.8 million relating to the unwinding of the capped call transactions in March 2024, as well as from the proceeds of our operations. 
 
 In May 2024, we entered into the Sixth Street Financing Agreement, which provides for the Credit Facility, consisting of an initial draw of 375.0 million at closing and a potential additional 100.0 million draw at our option upon satisfaction of a 50.0 million minimum cash requirement and a requirement that our trailing three-month sales of SYFOVRE is at least 180.0 million prior to the 100.0 million draw. The Credit Facility matures on May 13, 2030 and bears interest at an annual rate equal to the 3-month Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) + 5.75 (subject to 1.00 floor). Certain additional commitment and undrawn amount fees are also payable in connection with the Credit Facility. We used the majority of the proceeds of the 375.0 million draw at closing to buy out our remaining obligations owed to SFJ, in the amount of approximately 326.5 million. 
 
 We are permitted under the Sixth Street Financing Agreement to enter into a separate asset-based financing arrangement with a third party in an amount of up to 100.0 million, which amount is increased to 200.0 million upon certain sales or market capitalization thresholds, and to have outstanding convertible unsecured notes in an amount equal to the greater of 400.0 million and 10 of our market capitalization, but not to exceed 600.0 million. 
 
 In August 2024, the Company entered into the Factoring Agreement with Citi to sell certain accounts receivable to Citi at a discount to the face value of the accounts receivable. Under the Factoring Agreement, the maximum amount of outstanding accounts receivables sold at any time is 100.0 million. 
 
 In November 2023, we entered into a sales agreement, or the sales agreement, with Cowen and Company, LLC, or Cowen, as agent, pursuant to which we may offer and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering from of up to 300.0 million from time to time. Any sales made under the sales agreement will be made at market prices by any method that is deemed to be an at the market offering as defined in Rule 415(a)(4) promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933. Any sales under the sales agreement will be made pursuant to our registration statement on Form S-3, which became effective on February 22, 2023. We agreed to pay Cowen compensation of up to 3.0 of the gross proceeds of the sale of shares made under the sales agreement. We did not make any sales under the sales agreement during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 In February 2023, we issued and sold 4,007,936 shares of our common stock and, in lieu of common stock to investors who so chose, pre-funded warrants to purchase 2,380,956 shares of our common stock in a follow-on offering, including 833,333 shares sold pursuant to the underwriters exercise in full of their option to purchase additional shares of common stock. The price to the public of the shares of common stock was 63.00 per share and the price to the public of the pre-funded warrants was 62.9999 per pre-funded warrant. The 
 34 

Table of Contents 

 pre-funded warrants have an exercise price equal to 0.0001 per share and do not expire. The pre-funded warrants were accounted for as equity instruments. We received total net proceeds of 384.4 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of 18.8 million and offering cost of 0.3 million. 
 
 In February 2024, we entered into agreements with the capped call counterparties to unwind a portion of the capped call transactions. The unwind agreements applied to the portion of the capped call transactions in a notional amount corresponding to the 426.1 million principal amount of Convertible Notes that we held in treasury as of December 31, 2023 or have been previously converted. The unwind transactions were settled at volume-weighted average price per share of 64.11, which resulted in cash proceeds to us of 98.8 million. As of September 30, 2024, the remaining capped call transactions had a notional amount corresponding to 93.9 million principal amount of Convertible Notes.

 Funding Requirements 
 
 We expect to continue incur expenses to support our ongoing commercial activities related to product manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution of EMPAVELI for PNH and SYFOVRE for GA. In addition, we expect to continue to incur expenses as we prioritize the ongoing development of systemic pegcetacoplan and focus our research initiatives on high potential opportunities. 
 
 Together with the cash that we anticipate will be generated from sales of EMPAVELI and SYFOVRE, we expect that our current our current cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our projected operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months, as well as our anticipated longer-term cash requirements and obligations. Our expectations regarding our short-term and long-term funding requirements are based on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we may need additional capital resources to fund our operating plans and capital expenditure requirements. 
 
 We are devoting substantial resources to the commercial infrastructure for SYFOVRE for GA. We are also devoting substantial resources to the development of our product candidates. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the commercialization of EMPAVELI and SYFOVRE and development of other product candidates, and because the extent to which we may enter into collaborations with third parties for any of these activities is unknown, we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenses associated with the research, development and commercialization. Our future funding requirements and long-term capital requirements will depend on many factors, including : 
 our ability to continue to successfully commercialize and sell EMPAVELI and SYFOVRE in the United States; 

the cost of and our ability to obtain regulatory approvals of SYFOVRE outside of the United States and continue to build a commercial infrastructure for SYFOVRE for GA in the United States and worldwide; 

the cost of and our ability to effectively establish and maintain, the commercial infrastructure and manufacturing capabilities required to support the continued commercialization of EMPAVELI, SYFOVRE and any other products for which we receive marketing approval including product sales, medical affairs, marketing, manufacturing and distribution; 

the scope, progress, timing, costs and results of clinical trials of, and research and preclinical development efforts for systemic pegcetacoplan, SYFOVRE and our other product candidates; 

our ability to maintain a productive collaborative relationship with Sobi with respect to systemic pegcetacoplan, including our ability to achieve milestone payments under our agreement with Sobi; 

our ability to identify additional collaborators for any of our product candidates and the terms and timing of any collaboration agreement that we may establish for the development and any commercialization of such product candidates; 

the number and characteristics of future product candidates that we pursue and their development requirements; 

the outcome, timing and costs of clinical trials and of seeking regulatory approvals of pegcetacoplan in other jurisdictions and indications and other product candidates we may pursue; 

the costs of commercialization activities for any of our product candidates that receive marketing approval to the extent such costs are not the responsibility of any collaborators, including the costs and timing of establishing product sales, marketing, distribution and manufacturing capabilities; 

subject to receipt of marketing approval, revenue, if any, received from commercial sales of pegcetacoplan in other jurisdictions and indications and our other product candidates; 

our headcount growth and associated costs as we expand our research and development and establish a commercial infrastructure; 

the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and protecting our intellectual property rights and defending against intellectual property related claims; 

the effect of competing technological and market developments; 

the effect of public health crises, including pandemics and epidemics, on the healthcare system and the economy generally and on our clinical trials and other operations specifically; 

36 

Table of Contents 

 our ability to obtain adequate reimbursement for EMPAVELI and SYFOVRE in the United States or any other product we commercialize; and 

the costs of operating as a public company. 

If our cash and cash equivalents, and cash generated from sales of EMPAVELI and SYFOVRE are not sufficient to fund our planned expenditures, we will need to finance our cash needs through external sources of funds, which may include equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements. We currently do not have any committed external source of funds. 
 
 If we are unable to generate sufficient funds from sales of EMPAVELI and SYFOVRE, or raise additional funds when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves. 
 
 Contractual Obligations 
 
 The disclosure of our contractual obligations and commitments is set forth under the heading Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Contractual Obligations in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. See Note 13 Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item I of this Form 10-Q for a discussion of obligations and commitments. 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitati ve Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 
 We are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 396.9 million, consisting primarily of money market funds and U.S. Government obligations. Our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate sensitivity, which is affected by changes in the general level of U.S. interest rates. Due to the short-term duration of our investment portfolio and the low risk profile of our investments, an immediate 10 change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair market value of our investment portfolio. We have the ability to hold our marketable securities until maturity, and therefore we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a change in market interest rates on our investments. 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 
 
 The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act of 1934 as amended, or the Exchange Act, refers to controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Our disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 
 In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 
 37 

Table of Contents 

 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 
 No change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
