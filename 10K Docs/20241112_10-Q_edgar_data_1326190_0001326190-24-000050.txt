Overview Altimmune, Inc. is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing treatments for obesity and liver diseases. Our lead product candidate, pemvidutide (formerly known as ALT-801), is a novel, investigational, peptide-based GLP-1/glucagon dual receptor agonist in development for the treatment of obesity and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis MASH ), previously termed non-alcoholic steatohepatitis NASH ). Except where the context indicates otherwise, references to we, us, our, Altimmune , or the Company refer to the company and its subsidiaries. Recent Business Update Pemvidutide On November 7, 2024, we announced the successful completion of its End-of-Phase 2 Meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the FDA and agreement on the design of a Phase 3 registrational program for its product candidate, pemvidutide, in the treatment of obesity. The interaction with the FDA included an extensive review of the preclinical and clinical data generated to date, including data from six completed clinical trials of pemvidutide. The planned registrational program will include four Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trials, each evaluating treatment with pemvidutide over a 60-week period. The Phase 3 program is expected to enroll approximately 5,000 subjects across the four trials. The safety and efficacy of pemvidutide doses of 1.2 mg, 1.8 mg, and 2.4 mg will be evaluated with the intention of obtaining approval for all three doses.

Table of Contents 
 The Phase 3 program is designed to leverage the key attributes of pemvidutide, including the effects of balanced GLP-1/glucagon dual agonism in subjects with overweight and obesity. On September 30, 2024, we announced the completion of patient enrollment in IMPACT, our Phase 2b biopsy-driven trial evaluating Pemvidutide in MASH, and expect top-line efficacy data in the second quarter of 2025. On September 10, 2024, we presented results of MRI-based body composition sub-study from our 48-week MOMENTUM Phase 2 obesity trial of pemvidutide in subjects with overweight and obesity at the 60 th annual meeting of the European Association for the Study of Diabetes. In an MRI sub-study of 67 subjects from the MOMENTUM Phase 2 obesity trial, 50 of whom were treated with pemvidutide for 48 weeks, the lean loss ratio, defined as the change in lean mass compared to the change in total mass, was 21.9 . Lean mass preservation was greater in subjects aged 60 years and older, in whom the lean loss ratio was only 19.9 . In addition to lean mass preservation, there was a preferential reduction of visceral adipose tissue (VAT), the adipose tissue associated with cardiovascular risk. At the 2.4mg dose of pemvidutide, VAT was reduced by 28.3 at week 48 compared to a 19.5 loss in subcutaneous adipose tissue. On June 23, 2024, we presented the full results of the body composition analysis from our 48-week MOMENTUM Phase 2 obesity trial of pemvidutide at the American Diabetes Association s 84 th Annual Scientific Sessions. The body composition analysis showed that 78.1 of weight loss was derived from adipose tissue and only 21.9 from lean mass. Historically, lean mass loss has been shown to be approximately 25 from diet and exercise programs. As announced on November 30, 2023, the trial enrolled 391 subjects with obesity or overweight with at least one co-morbidity and without diabetes. Subjects were randomized 1:1:1:1 to 1.2 mg, 1.8 mg, 2.4 mg pemvidutide or placebo administered weekly for 48 weeks in conjunction with diet and exercise. The 1.2 mg and 1.8 mg doses were administered without dose titration, while a short 4-week titration period was employed for the 2.4 mg dose. At baseline, subjects had a mean age of approximately 50 years, mean body mass index (BMI) of approximately 37 kg/m 2 , and mean body weight of approximately 104 kg. Approximately 75 of subjects were female. HepTcell On March 27, 2024, we announced that the overall response in the Phase 2 trial was deemed to be insufficient to warrant further advancement in clinical trials. As a result, any further development related to HepTcell has been stopped. Results of Operations Comparison of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 The following table summarizes our results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands):

Three Months Ended September 30, Product candidates 2024 2023 Increase (Decrease) Pemvidutide 12,376 10,441 1,935 19 HepTcell 334 1,585 (1,251) (79) Non-project costs 7,093 6,362 731 11 Total research and development expenses 19,803 18,388 1,415 8 The increase in research and development expenses for pemvidutide was primarily due to a 5.9 million increase related to the ramp up of the IMPACT Phase 2b trial in MASH and a 0.7 million increase for other nonclinical studies. These increases were partially offset by a 2.7 million reduction in expense associated with the MOMENTUM Phase 2 trial in obesity, which was ongoing during the three months ended September 30, 2023 and wound down in the year ended December 31, 2023, and a 2.0 million decrease in net manufacturing expenses for production of Good Manufacturing Practice drug substance materials. The decrease in research and development expenses for HepTcell was primarily due to the winddown and completion of the in-life portion of the Phase 2 trial in 2023. The research and development expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were due to program winddown activities. In the coming months, we expect to have some additional wrap up costs as we finalize these activities. The increase in other non-project specific research and development expenses was primarily due to a 0.8 million initial cost for additional research and discovery projects. General and administrative expenses General and administrative expenses increased by 0.5 million, or 10 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a 0.4 million increase in professional fees. Total other income (expense), net Total other income (expense), net increased by 0.1 million, or 3 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The net increase is primarily due to a 0.1 million increase in interest income earned on our cash equivalents and short-term investments.

 Comparison of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 The following table summarizes our results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands): 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Increase (Decrease) Revenues 15 389 (374) 96 Operating expenses: Research and development 62,445 48,890 13,555 28 General and administrative 15,876 13,805 2,071 15 Total operating expenses 78,321 62,695 15,626 25 Loss from operations (78,306) (62,306) (16,000) 26 Other income (expense): Interest expense (8) (33) 25 (76) Interest income 6,505 5,387 1,118 21 Other income (expense), net (70) 146 (216) 148 Total other income (expense), net 6,427 5,500 927 17 Net loss (71,879) (56,806) (15,073) 27 Revenues We have not generated any revenues from the sale of any products to date. Our revenues in previous years consisted primarily of government and foundation grants and contracts that supported our efforts on specific research projects. We recently closed out one of the remaining such contracts, and the revenue reported during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily from the final indirect rate adjustments. Research and development expenses Research and development expenses consisted primarily of expenses related to product candidate development. Research and development expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are summarized as follows: 

Nine Months Ended September 30, Product candidates 2024 2023 Increase (Decrease) Pemvidutide 39,665 25,464 14,201 56 HepTcell 2,359 5,481 (3,122) (57) Non-project costs 20,421 17,945 2,476 14 Total research and development expenses 62,445 48,890 13,555 28 The increase in research and development expenses for pemvidutide was primarily due to a 22.7 million increase related to the ramp up of the IMPACT Phase 2b trial in MASH, a 1.3 million increase for other clinical analysis, and a 1.9 million increase in nonclinical studies. These increases were partially offset by a 9.0 million reduction in expense associated with the MOMENTUM Phase 2 trial in obesity, which was ongoing during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and wound down in the year ended December 31, 2023, and a 2.7 million reduction in expenses associated with Phase 1 safety trials, which was substantially completed in 2023. The decrease in research and development expenses for HepTcell was primarily due to the winddown and completion of the in-life portion of the Phase 2 trial in 2023. The research and development expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were due to program winddown activities. In the coming months, we expect to have some additional wrap up costs as we finalize these activities. The increase in other non-project specific research and development expenses was primarily due to a 1.2 million increase in stock compensation expense and a 1.3 million initial cost for additional research and discovery projects.

 General and administrative expenses General and administrative expenses increased by 2.1 million, or 15 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to a 2.1 million increase in stock compensation and other labor-related expense, including the 1.0 million incremental stock-based compensation expense because of modifications of stock awards (see Note 8). Total other income (expense), net Total other income (expense), net increased by 0.9 million, or 17 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The net increase is primarily due to a 1.1 million increase in interest income earned on our cash equivalents and short-term investments, partially offset by a 0.2 million increase in foreign currency exchange losses. Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview Our primary sources of cash during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were from equity transactions, interest and dividends from our money market funds and short-term investments, and proceeds from maturities of our short-term investments. Our cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and short-term investments were 139.4 million as of September 30, 2024. We believe, based on the operating cash requirements and capital expenditures expected for 2024 and 2025, our cash on hand as of September 30, 2024, together with expected cash receipts from our R D incentives, is sufficient to fund operations for at least a twelve-month period from the issuance date of our September 30, 2024 consolidated financial statements. We have not generated any revenues from the sale of any products to date, and there is no assurance of any future revenues from product sales. We have incurred significant losses since we commenced operations. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 538.2 million. In addition, we have not generated positive cash flows from operations. We have had to rely on a variety of financing sources, including the issuance of debt and equity securities. As capital resources are consumed to fund our research and development activities, we may require additional capital beyond our currently anticipated amounts. In order to address our capital needs, including our planned clinical trials, we must continue to actively pursue additional equity or debt financing, government funding, and monetization of our existing programs through partnership arrangements or sales to third parties. Sources of Liquidity Shelf Registrations On February 28, 2023, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3ASR, which was declared effective immediately. This shelf registration allows us to offer and sell any amount of our common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants, rights and units (the 2023 Shelf for a period of 3 years from effectiveness or until such determination that we no longer qualify as a well-known seasoned issuer. At-the-Market Offerings On February 28, 2023, we entered into the 2023 Agreement with Sales Agents with respect to an at-the-market offerings program under which we may offer and sell, from time to time at our sole discretion, the Shares through the Sales Agents from the 2023 Shelf. Since inception through September 30, 2024, we have sold 20,454,516 shares of common stock under the 2023 Agreement, resulting in approximately 86.6 million in net proceeds. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we did not sell any shares of common stock under the 2023 Agreement, and as of September 30, 2024, 60.6 million remained available to be sold under the 2023 Shelf.

 Cash Flows The following table provides information regarding our cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 

Nine Months Ended September 30, (in thousands) 2024 2023 Increase (Decrease) Net cash (used in) provided by: Operating activities (61,583) (59,277) (2,306) Investing activities (42,018) 21,691 (63,709) Financing activities (41) 13,351 (13,392) Net decrease in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash (103,642) (24,235) (79,407) Operating Activities Net cash used in operating activities was 61.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 59.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The primary uses of cash from our operating activities include payments for labor and labor-related costs, professional fees, research and development costs associated with our clinical trials, and other general corporate expenditures. The increase in cash used in operations of 2.3 million year over year is due to changes in working capital accounts of 11.1 million, offset by an increase in net loss as adjusted for non-cash items of 13.4 million. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities was 42.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 21.7 million net cash provided by during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The net cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to purchases of 102.5 million of short-term investments, partially offset by 60.5 million proceeds from sales and maturities of short-term investments. The net cash provided by investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to 76.5 million proceeds from sales and maturities of short-term investments, partially offset by 54.8 million purchases of short-term investments. Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was negligible compared to 13.4 million cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The net cash used in financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to 0.8 million net payments for tax withholding obligations related to share-based compensation, partially offset by 0.3 million in proceeds from the employee stock purchase plan, 0.3 million proceeds from exercises of stock options, and 0.2 million proceeds from exercises of stock warrants. The net cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily the result of the receipt of 13.7 million in net proceeds from the issuance of common stock from our at-the-market offerings program, partially offset by 0.5 million net payments for tax withholding obligations related to share-based compensation. Current Resources We have financed our operations to date principally through our equity offerings and proceeds from issuances of our preferred stock, common stock, and warrants. As of September 30, 2024, we had 31.5 million of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, and 107.9 million of short-term investments. Accordingly, management believes that we have sufficient capital to fund our plan of operations for at least a twelve-month period from the issuance date of our September 30, 2024 financial statements. However, in order to address our capital needs in the long-term, including our planned clinical trials, we must continue to actively pursue additional equity or debt financing, government funding, and monetization of our existing programs through partnership arrangements or sales to third parties.

 Critical Accounting Estimates Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based upon our unaudited consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and the rules and regulations of the SEC for interim financial reporting. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, knowledge of current conditions, and expectations of what could occur in the future given available information. There have been no changes in our critical accounting policies and significant judgment and estimates as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk As a smaller reporting company as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, we are not required to provide the information required by this Item. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and Rule 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 identified in connection with the evaluation thereof by our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. PART II. OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings On May 6, 2024, a class action complaint was filed in federal district court in the District of Maryland, Southern Division, naming as defendants us and three of our executive officers, which is now captioned In re Altimmune, Inc. Securities Litigation, No. 24-cv-01315 (D. Md.) (the Class Action ). The complaint alleges that the defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, by making false and misleading statements and omissions of material fact to the investing public including the plaintiff and class members, who purchased or otherwise acquired our common stock between December 1, 2023 and April 26, 2024. The plaintiff and class members seek to have the action maintained as a class action under Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and for the defendants to pay damages, interest, and an award of costs, including attorneys fees. A substantially similar

 complaint, captioned Campanile v. Altimmune, Inc., et al. , No. 8:24-cv-01918 (D. Md.), was also filed in the same court by another plaintiff on July 1, 2024 against the Company and three of its executive officers, based upon the same general set of allegations and class period. On October 2, 2024, the court consolidated the Campanile action with the Class Action for all purposes and appointed lead plaintiffs for the consolidated litigation. On October 18, 2024, the court entered a scheduling order for the filing of an amended complaint on or by December 16, 2024 and any response to that amended complaint, including motions to dismiss, to follow thereafter. We intend to vigorously defend against this class action litigation. On June 4, 2024, a shareholder derivative complaint was filed in federal district court in the District of Delaware, purportedly on behalf of us, naming as defendants three of our executive officers and eight of our board members, which is now captioned In re Altimmune, Inc. Stockholder Derivative Litigation , No. 1:24-cv-669 (D. Del.) (the Derivative Action ). The complaint is based upon allegations that are similar to those alleged in the Class Action and alleges claims for contribution, breaches of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, and waste of corporate assets based on the defendants purportedly making or causing to be made false and misleading statements and omissions of material fact between December 1, 2023 and April 26, 2024. The complaint seeks unspecified monetary relief, exemplary damages, restitution, contribution, and costs, as well as equitable relief. A similar shareholder derivative complaint, captioned Alaraidah v. Garg, et al., No. 1:24-cv-00772 (D. Del.), was filed in the same court by another plaintiff on July 1, 2024, based upon substantially similar allegations, and alleges claims for contribution, breach of fiduciary duties, unjust enrichment, abuse of control, gross mismanagement, and waste of corporate assets and seeks unspecified monetary relief, restitution, costs, and equitable relief. These actions were consolidated for all purposes on July 18, 2024 into the Derivative Action. On September 12, 2024, the court stayed the Derivative Action until the earlier of the following: (a) the Class Action is dismissed with prejudice, and all appeals related thereto have been exhausted; or (b) defendants file an answer to any complaint in the Class Action. We intend to vigorously defend against the Derivative Action. From time to time, we may be involved in various legal proceedings or investigations, which could be costly and impose a significant burden on management and employees. The results of any current or future litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, and regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources, and other factors. Item 1A. Risk Factors There have been no material changes from the risk factors disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 27, 2024. Item 2.
