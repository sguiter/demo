Explanatory Note 
 This report combines the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 of Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc., a Tennessee corporation, and Mid-America Apartments, L.P., a Tennessee limited partnership, of which Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. is the sole general partner. Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. and its 97.4 owned subsidiary, Mid-America Apartments, L.P., are both required to file quarterly reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. 
 Unless the context otherwise requires, all references in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to MAA refer only to Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc., and not any of its consolidated subsidiaries. Unless the context otherwise requires, all references in this report to we, us, our, or the Company refer collectively to Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc., together with its consolidated subsidiaries, including Mid-America Apartments, L.P. Unless the context otherwise requires, all references in this report to the Operating Partnership or MAALP refer to Mid-America Apartments, L.P. together with its consolidated subsidiaries. Common stock refers to the common stock of MAA, preferred stock refers to the preferred stock of MAA, and shareholders refers to the holders of shares of MAA s common stock or preferred stock, as applicable. The common units of limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership are referred to as OP Units and the holders of the OP Units are referred to as common unitholders. 
 As of September 30, 2024, MAA owned 116,880,291 OP Units (97.4 of the total number of OP Units). MAA conducts substantially all of its business and holds substantially all of its assets, directly or indirectly, through the Operating Partnership, and by virtue of its ownership of the OP Units and being the Operating Partnership s sole general partner, MAA has the ability to control all of the day-to-day operations of the Operating Partnership. 
 We believe combining the periodic reports of MAA and the Operating Partnership, including the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements, into this report results in the following benefits: 
 
 enhances investors understanding of MAA and the Operating Partnership by enabling investors to view the business as a whole in the same manner that management views and operates the business; 

eliminates duplicative disclosure and provides a more streamlined and readable presentation since a substantial portion of the disclosure in this report applies to both MAA and the Operating Partnership; and 

creates time and cost efficiencies through the preparation of one combined report instead of two separate reports. 

MAA, an S P 500 company, is a multifamily-focused, self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust, or REIT. Management operates MAA and the Operating Partnership as one business. The management of the Company is comprised of individuals who are officers of MAA and employees of the Operating Partnership. We believe it is important to understand the few differences between MAA and the Operating Partnership in the context of how MAA and the Operating Partnership operate as a consolidated company. MAA and the Operating Partnership are structured as an umbrella partnership REIT, or UPREIT. MAA s interest in the Operating Partnership entitles MAA to share in cash distributions from, and in the profits and losses of, the Operating Partnership in proportion to MAA s percentage interest therein and entitles MAA to vote on substantially all matters requiring a vote of the partners. MAA s only material asset is its ownership of limited partnership interests in the Operating Partnership (other than cash held by MAA from time to time); therefore, MAA s primary function is acting as the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, issuing public equity from time to time and guaranteeing certain debt of the Operating Partnership from time to time. The Operating Partnership holds, directly or indirectly, all of the real estate assets. Except for net proceeds from public equity issuances by MAA, which are contributed to the Operating Partnership in exchange for limited partnership interests, the Operating Partnership generates the capital required by the Company s business through the Operating Partnership s operations, direct or indirect incurrence of indebtedness and issuance of OP Units. 
 The presentation of MAA s shareholders equity and the Operating Partnership s capital are the principal areas of difference between the condensed consolidated financial statements of MAA and those of the Operating Partnership. MAA s shareholders equity may include shares of preferred stock, shares of common stock, additional paid-in capital, cumulative earnings, cumulative distributions, noncontrolling interests, treasury shares, accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and redeemable common stock. The Operating Partnership s capital may include common capital and preferred capital of the general partner (MAA), limited partners common capital and preferred capital, noncontrolling interests, accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and redeemable common units. Holders of OP Units (other than MAA) may require the Operating Partnership to redeem their OP Units from time to time, in which case the Operating Partnership may, at its option, pay the redemption price either in cash (in an amount per OP Unit equal, in general, to the average closing price of MAA s common stock on the New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE, over a specified period prior to the redemption date) or by delivering one share of MAA s common stock (subject to adjustment under specified circumstances) for each OP Unit so redeemed. 
 3 

In order to highlight the material differences between MAA and the Operating Partnership, this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes sections that separately present and discuss areas that are materially different between MAA and the Operating Partnership, including: 
 the condensed consolidated financial statements in Part 1, Item 1 of this report; 

certain accompanying notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements, including Note 2 - Earnings per Common Share of MAA and Note 3 - Earnings per OP Unit of MAALP; Note 4 - MAA Equity and Note 5 - MAALP Capital; and Note 8 - Shareholders Equity of MAA and Note 9 - Partners Capital of MAALP; 

the controls and procedures in Part 1, Item 4 of this report; and 

the certifications included as Exhibits 31 and 32 to this report. 

In the sections that combine disclosures for MAA and the Operating Partnership, this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q refers to actions or holdings as being actions or holdings of the Company. Although the Operating Partnership (directly or indirectly through one of its subsidiaries) is generally the entity that enters into contracts, holds assets and issues debt, management believes this presentation is appropriate for the reasons set forth above and because we operate the business through the Operating Partnership. MAA, the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries operate as one consolidated business, but MAA, the Operating Partnership and each of its subsidiaries are separate, distinct legal entities.

Except for net proceeds from public equity issuances by MAA, which are contributed to the Operating Partnership in exchange for limited partnership interests, the Operating Partnership generates the capital required by the business through the Operating Partnership s operations, direct or indirect incurrence of indebtedness and issuance of OP Units. The presentations of MAA s shareholders equity and the Operating Partnership s capital are the principal areas of difference between the condensed consolidated financial statements of MAA and those of the Operating Partnership. MAA s shareholders equity may include shares of preferred stock, shares of common stock, additional paid-in capital, cumulative earnings, cumulative distributions, noncontrolling interests, treasury shares, accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and redeemable common stock. The Operating Partnership s capital may include common capital and preferred capital of the general partner (MAA), limited partners common capital and preferred capital, noncontrolling interests, accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and redeemable common units. Holders of OP Units (other than MAA) may require the Operating Partnership to redeem their OP Units from time to time, in which case the Operating Partnership may, at its option, pay the redemption price either in cash (in an amount per OP Unit equal, in general, to the average closing price of MAA s common stock on the New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE, over a specified period prior to the redemption date) or by delivering one share of MAA s common stock (subject to adjustment under specified circumstances) for each OP Unit so redeemed.

apartment communities (which does not include development communities under construction) through the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries and had an ownership interest in apartment community through an unconsolidated real estate joint venture. As of September 30, 2024, the Company also had eight development communities under construction, totaling apartment units once complete, and development costs of million had been incurred through September 30, 2024 with respect to those development communities. The Company expects to complete developments in 2024, developments in 2025, developments in 2026 and development in 2027.

In management s opinion, all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the condensed consolidated financial statements have been included, and all such adjustments were of a normal recurring nature. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company invests in entities that may qualify as variable interest entities, or VIEs, and MAALP is considered a VIE. A VIE is a legal entity in which the equity investors lack sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support or, as a group, the holders of the equity investment at risk lack the power to direct the activities of a legal entity as well as the obligation to absorb its expected losses or the right to receive its expected residual returns. The Company consolidates all VIEs for which it is the primary beneficiary and uses the equity method to account for investments that qualify as VIEs but for which it is not the primary beneficiary. In determining whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, management considers both qualitative and quantitative factors, including, but not limited to, those activities that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance and which party controls such activities. MAALP is classified as a VIE because the limited partners lack substantive kick-out rights and substantive participating rights, and the Company has concluded it is the primary beneficiary of MAALP. The Company uses the equity method of accounting for its investments in entities for which the Company exercises significant influence, but does not have the ability to exercise control. The factors considered in determining whether the Company has the ability to e xercise significant influence or control include ownership of voting interests and participatory rights of investors (see Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates below).

 multifamily apartment communities (which does not include development communities under construction) in different states from which it derived all significant sources of earnings and operating cash flows. The Company views each consolidated apartment community as an operating segment. The Company s chief operating decision maker, which is the Company s Chief Executive Officer, evaluates performance and determines resource allocations of each of the apartment communities on a Same Store and Non-Same Store and Other basis, as well as an individual apartment community basis. The Company has aggregated its operating segments into two reportable segments as management believes the apartment communities in each reportable segment generally have similar economic characteristics, facilities, services and residents. The following reflects the reportable segments for the Company: Same Store includes communities that the Company has owned and have been stabilized for at least a full months as of the first day of the calendar year. 

 Non-Same Store and Other includes recently acquired communities, communities being developed or in lease-up, communities that have been disposed of or identified for disposition, communities that have experienced a significant casualty loss and stabilized communities that do not meet the requirements to be Same Store communities. Also included in Non-Same Store and Other are non-multifamily activities and storm related expenses related to severe weather events, including hurricanes and winter storms. 

 On the first day of each calendar year, the Company determines the composition of its Same Store and Non-Same Store and Other reportable segments for that year as well as adjusts the previous year, which allows the Company to evaluate full period-over-period operating comparisons. Communities previously in development or lease-up are added to the Same Store segment on the first day of the calendar year after the community has been owned and stabilized for at least a full s. Communities are considered stabilized when achieving average physical occupancy for . The chief operating decision maker utilizes net operating income, or NOI, in evaluating the performance of the operating segments. Total NOI represents total property revenues less total property operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization, for all properties held during the period regardless of their status as held for sale. Management believes that NOI is a helpful tool in evaluating the operating performance of the segments because it measures the core operations of property performance by excluding corporate level expenses and other items not directly related to property operating performance.

-unit multifamily apartment community located in Orlando, Florida for approximately million and a -unit multifamily apartment community located in Raleigh, North Carolina for approximately million, respectively. In August and April 2024, the Company also acquired a -acre land parcel in Richmond, Virginia for approximately million and a -acre land parcel in Phoenix, Arizona for approximately million, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company did not dispose of any multifamily apartment communities or land parcels. In October 2024, the Company closed on the acquisition of a -unit multifamily apartment community located in Dallas, Texas for approximately million.

-unit multifamily apartment community located in Charlotte, North Carolina was classified as held for sale. The criteria for classifying the community as held for sale were met during September 2024, and the property remained in the Company s portfolio as of September 30, 2024. As a result, the assets and liabilities associated with the community were presented as Assets held for sale in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2024. Subsequent to September 30, 2024, but prior to the filing date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the Company closed on the disposition of the community and received net proceeds of approximately million, resulting in an expected gain on the sale of depreciable real estate assets of approximately million that will be recorded in the fourth quarter of 2024. In February 2023, the Company acquired a -acre land parcel in Orlando, Florida for approximately million. In March 2023, the Company closed on the disposition of acres of land in Gulf Shores, Alabama for gross proceeds of approximately million, resulting in the recognition of a negligible gain on the sale of non-depreciable real estate assets. Certain long-lived assets are recorded at fair value when they are acquired or initially consolidated. The inputs associated with the valuation of long-lived assets are generally included in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 

 Item 2.	Management s Discussion and Analysis o f Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 The following discussion analyzes the financial condition and results of operations of both MAA and the Operating Partnership, of which MAA is the sole general partner and in which MAA owned a 97.4 interest as of September 30, 2024. MAA conducts all of its business through the Operating Partnership and its various subsidiaries. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 MAA, an S P 500 company, is a multifamily-focused, self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust, or REIT. We own, operate, acquire and selectively develop apartment communities primarily located in the Southeast, Southwest and Mid-Atlantic regions of the U.S. As of September 30, 2024, we owned and operated 293 apartment communities (which does not include development communities under construction) through the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries, and had an ownership interest in one apartment community through an unconsolidated real estate joint venture. In addition, as of September 30, 2024, we had eight development communities under construction, and 35 of our apartment communities included retail components. Our apartment communities, including development communities under construction, were located across 16 states and the District of Columbia as of September 30, 2024. 
 We report in two segments, Same Store and Non-Same Store and Other. Our Same Store segment represents those apartment communities that have been owned and stabilized for at least 12 months as of the first day of the calendar year. Our Non-Same Store and Other segment includes recently acquired communities, communities being developed or in lease-up, communities that have been disposed of or identified for disposition, communities that have incurred a significant casualty loss and stabilized communities that do not meet the requirements to be Same Store communities. Also included in our Non-Same Store and Other segment are non-multifamily activities and storm-related expenses related to severe weather events, including hurricanes and winter storms. Additional information regarding the composition of our segments is included in Note 11 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

 Overview of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, net income available for MAA common shareholders was 114.3 million as compared to 109.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Results for the three months ended September 30, 2024 included 18.3 million of non-cash loss related to the fair value adjustment of the embedded derivative in the MAA Series I preferred shares, 11.0 million of gain on the consolidation of a third-party development and 5.7 million of net casualty related recoveries. Results for the three months ended September 30, 2023 included 11.3 million of non-cash loss related to the embedded derivative in the MAA Series I preferred shares and 6.6 million of non-cash loss from investments. Revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 1.7 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Property operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 6.2 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The primary drivers of these changes are discussed in the Results of Operations section. 
 30 

Trends 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, change in revenue for our Same Store segment continued to be primarily driven by average effective rent per unit. The average effective rent per unit for our Same Store segment decreased from the prior year, down 0.4 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. Average effective rent per unit represents the average of gross rent amounts, after the effect of leasing concessions, for occupied apartment units plus prevalent market rates asked for unoccupied apartment units, divided by the total number of units. Leasing concessions represent discounts to the current market rate. We believe average effective rent per unit is a helpful measurement in evaluating average pricing; however, it does not represent actual rental revenue collected per unit. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, average physical occupancy for our Same Store segment was 95.7 , consistent with the three months ended September 30, 2023. Average physical occupancy is a measurement of the total number of our apartment units that are occupied by residents, and it represents the average of the daily physical occupancy for the period. 
 An important part of our portfolio strategy is to maintain diversity of markets, submarkets, product types and price points in the Southeast, Southwest and Mid-Atlantic regions of the U.S. We have multifamily assets in 39 defined markets, with a presence in approximately 150 submarkets and a mixture of garden-style, mid-rise and high-rise communities. This diversity helps to mitigate exposure to economic issues, including supply and demand factors, in any one geographic market or area. We believe that a well-balanced portfolio, including both urban and suburban locations, with a broad range of monthly rent price points, will provide higher performance and lower volatility throughout the full economic cycle. 
 Demand for apartments in our markets was strong during the third quarter of 2024, which is contributing to the steady absorption of the high volume of new supply delivered in the third quarter, which we believe has now peaked. The strong demand resulted in record low resident turnover, steady occupancy and strong renewal pricing and collections. We believe demand for apartments is primarily driven by general economic conditions in our markets and is particularly correlated to job growth, population growth, household formation and in-migration over the long term. We continue to monitor pressures surrounding housing supply, inflation trends and general economic conditions. A worsening of the current environment could contribute to uncertain rent collections going forward, suppress demand for apartments and could drive lower rent pricing on new leases and renewals than what we achieved in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. We continue to believe that in calendar year 2025 we will see a meaningful decline in the amount of new apartment deliveries impacting our portfolio, and we will enter a new multi-year cycle with demand outpacing supply. 
 Access to the financial markets remains available for high-credit rated borrowers, such as ourselves. Overall borrowing costs remain at elevated levels and we expect this trend to continue. As of September 30, 2024, we had 490.0 million of variable rate debt outstanding under our commercial paper program. Our continued exposure to elevated interest rates will be a result of additional variable rate borrowings or future financing and refinancing activities. 
 Results of Operations 
 Comparison of the three months ended September 30, 2024 to the three months ended September 30, 2023 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we achieved net income available for MAA common shareholders of 114.3 million, a 4.1 increase as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, and total revenue growth of 9.1 million, representing a 1.7 increase in property revenues as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The following discussion describes the primary drivers of the increase in net income available for MAA common shareholders for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023.

The increase in property operating expenses for our Same Store segment for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily driven by increases in personnel expense of 1.6 million, utilities expense of 1.3 million, office operations expense of 1.1 million, and marketing expense of 1.0 million. The increase in property operating expenses from the Non-Same Store and Other segment for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily the result of increased operating expenses from completed development communities and recently acquired communities. 
 Depreciation and Amortization 
 Depreciation and amortization expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 146.7 million, consistent with the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Other Income and Expenses 
 Property management expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 17.3 million, an increase of 1.0 million as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. General and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were 12.7 million, a decrease of 0.8 million as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 42.7 million, an increase of 6.1 million as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was due to an increase of 36 basis points in our effective interest rate and an increase in our average outstanding debt balance during the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Other non-operating expense (income) for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 1.7 million of expense as compared to 16.5 million of expense for the three months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 14.8 million. The expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by 18.3 million of non-cash loss related to the fair value adjustment of the embedded derivative in the MAA Series I preferred shares, partially offset by 11.0 million of gain on the consolidation of a third-party development and 5.7 million of net casualty related recoveries. The expense for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was driven by 11.3 million of non-cash loss related to the fair value adjustment of the embedded derivative in the MAA Series I preferred shares and 6.6 million of non-cash loss from investments, partially offset by 1.5 million of interest income on cash deposits. 
 Comparison of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we achieved net income available for MAA common shareholders of 358.1 million, a 8.1 decrease as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, and total revenue growth of 35.0 million, representing a 2.2 increase in property revenues as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

The increase in property operating expenses for our Same Store segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily driven by increases in personnel expense of 5.5 million, real estate tax expense of 4.1 million, office operations expense of 3.6 million, utilities expense of 3.3 million, insurance expense of 2.3 million, marketing expense of 1.9 million, and building repair and maintenance expense of 1.6 million. 
 Depreciation and Amortization 
 Depreciation and amortization expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 434.8 million, an increase of 10.6 million as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by the recognition of depreciation expense associated with our completed development communities, acquisitions and capital spend activities completed after September 30, 2023 in the normal course of business through September 30, 2024. 
 Other Income and Expenses 
 Property management expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 54.5 million, an increase of 4.1 million as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. General and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were 42.4 million, a decrease of 0.9 million as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 124.4 million, an increase of 13.7 million as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was due to an increase of 25 basis points in our effective interest rate and an increase in our average outstanding debt balance during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Other non-operating expense (income) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 2.6 million of income as compared to 4.0 million of income for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 1.4 million. The income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by 11.0 million of gain on the consolidation of a third-party development, 9.7 million of net casualty related recoveries and 3.7 million of non-cash gain from investments, partially offset by 14.5 million of non-cash loss related to the fair value adjustment of the embedded derivative in the MAA Series I preferred shares and 8.0 million of accrued legal defense costs. The income for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was driven by 3.0 million of interest income, 1.0 million of miscellaneous income, and 0.7 million of non-cash gain from investments, partially offset by 1.9 million of non-cash loss related to the fair value adjustment of the embedded derivative in the MAA Series I preferred shares. 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 Funds from Operations and Core Funds from Operations 
 Funds from operations, or FFO, a non-GAAP financial measure, represents net income available for MAA common shareholders (computed in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP) excluding gains or losses on disposition of operating properties, asset impairment and gain on consolidation of third-party development, plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and adjustments for joint ventures. Because net income attributable to noncontrolling interests is added back, FFO, when used in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, represents FFO attributable to common shareholders and unitholders. 
 FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income available for MAA common shareholders, or any other GAAP measurement, as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating, investing and financing activities as a measure of liquidity. Management believes that FFO is helpful to investors in understanding our operating performance, primarily because its calculation excludes depreciation and amortization expense on real estate assets and gain on sale of depreciable real estate assets. We believe that GAAP historical cost depreciation of real estate assets is generally not correlated with changes in the value of those assets, whose value does not diminish predictably over time, as historical cost depreciation implies. While our calculation of FFO is in accordance with the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts , or NAREIT s, definition, it may differ from the methodology for calculating FFO utilized by other REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs. 
 33 

Core FFO represents FFO as adjusted for items that are not considered part of our core business operations such as adjustments related to the fair value of the embedded derivative in the MAA Series I preferred shares; gain or loss on sale of non-depreciable assets; gain or loss on investments, net of tax; casualty related charges (recoveries), net; gain or loss on debt extinguishment; legal costs, settlements and (recoveries), net, and mark-to-market debt adjustments. Because net income attributable to noncontrolling interests is added back to FFO, Core FFO, when used in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, represents Core FFO attributable to common shareholders and unitholders. 
 Core FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income available for MAA common shareholders, or any other GAAP measurement, as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating, investing and financing activities as a measure of liquidity. Management believes that Core FFO is helpful in understanding our core operating performance between periods in that it removes certain items that by their nature are not comparable over periods and therefore tend to obscure actual operating performance from rental activities. While our definition of Core FFO may be similar to others in the industry, our methodology for calculating Core FFO may differ from that utilized by other REITs and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs. 
 The following table presents a reconciliation of net income available for MAA common shareholders to FFO attributable to common shareholders and unitholders and Core FFO attributable to common shareholders and unitholders for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, as we believe net income available for MAA common shareholders is the most directly comparable GAAP measure (dollars in thousands):

Core FFO attributable to common shareholders and unitholders for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 264.8 million, a decrease of 10.1 million as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of increases in property operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization, of 12.3 million and interest expense of 6.1 million, partially offset by an increase in property revenues of 9.1 million. 
 Core FFO attributable to common shareholders and unitholders for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 797.6 million, a decrease of 22.8 million as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily as a result of increases in property operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization, of 38.8 million, interest expense of 13.7 million and property management expenses of 4.1 million, partially offset by an increase in property revenues of 35.0 million. 
 Net Debt, EBITDA, EBITDAre, and Adjusted EBITDAre 
 Net debt, a non-GAAP financial measure, represents unsecured notes payable and secured notes payable less cash and cash equivalents and 1031(b) exchange proceeds included in restricted cash. Management considers net debt a helpful tool in evaluating our debt position. Net debt should not be considered as an alternative to any GAAP measurement as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating, investing and financing activities as a measure of liquidity. 
 34 

Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, represents net income (computed in accordance with GAAP) plus depreciation and amortization, interest expense, and income taxes. As an owner and operator of real estate, management considers EBITDA to be an important measure of performance from core operations because EBITDA excludes various expense items that are not indicative of operating performance. EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income, or any other GAAP measurement, as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating, investing and financing activities as a measure of liquidity. 
 EBITDA re is composed of EBITDA adjusted for the gain or loss on sale of depreciable assets, gain on consolidation of third-party development and adjustments to reflect our share of EBITDA re of an unconsolidated affiliate. As an owner and operator of real estate, management considers EBITDA re to be an important measure of performance from core operations because EBITDA re excludes various expense items that are not indicative of operating performance. While our definition of EBITDA re is in accordance with NAREIT s definition, it may differ from the methodology utilized by other REITs to calculate EBITDA re and, accordingly, may not be comparable to such other REITs. EBITDA re should not be considered as an alternative to net income, or any other GAAP measurement, as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating, investing and financing activities as a measure of liquidity. 
 Adjusted EBITDA re is comprised of EBITDA re further adjusted for items that are not considered part of our core operations such as adjustments related to the fair value of the embedded derivative in the MAA Series I preferred shares; gain or loss on sale of non-depreciable assets; gain or loss on investments; casualty related charges (recoveries), net; gain or loss on debt extinguishment; and legal costs, settlements and (recoveries), net. As an owner and operator of real estate, management considers Adjusted EBITDA re to be an important measure of performance from core operations because Adjusted EBITDA re excludes various income and expense items that are not indicative of operating performance. Our computation of Adjusted EBITDA re may differ from the methodology utilized by other REITs to calculate Adjusted EBITDA re . Adjusted EBITDA re should not be considered as an alternative to net income, or any other GAAP measurement, as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating, investing and financing activities as a measure of liquidity. 
 Management monitors its debt levels to a ratio of net debt to Adjusted EBITDA re in order to maintain our investment grade credit ratings. We believe this is an important factor in the management of our debt levels to maintain an optimal capital structure, and it is also considered in the assignment of our credit ratings. Adjusted EBITDA re is measured on a trailing twelve-month basis. 
 The following table presents a reconciliation of unsecured notes payable and secured notes payable to net debt as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, as we believe unsecured notes payable and secured notes payable, combined, is the most directly comparable GAAP measure (dollars in thousands):

(2) For the twelve months ended September 30, 2024, in accordance with our accounting policies, we recognized 8.5 million of accrued legal defense costs that are expected to be incurred through July 2027. 

Our net debt to Adjusted EBITDA re ratio as of September 30, 2024 was 3.9x, as compared to a ratio of 3.6x as of December 31, 2023. Adjusted EBITDA re decreased 10.2 million for the trailing twelve months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the trailing twelve months ended December 31, 2023, while net debt increased 326.8 million as of September 30, 2024 as compared to December 31, 2023. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA re was primarily due to increases in property operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization and property management expenses, partially offset by an increase in property revenues, while the increase in net debt was primarily due to an increase in unsecured notes payable, partially offset by an increase in cash and cash equivalents. The increase in unsecured notes payable was primarily driven by an increase in cash requirements to fund acquisition and development activities. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as well as general economic and market conditions, are the principal factors affecting our liquidity and capital resources. 
 We expect that our primary uses of cash will be to fund our ongoing operating needs, to fund our ongoing capital spending requirements, which relate primarily to our development, redevelopment and property repositioning activities, to repay maturing borrowings, to fund the future acquisition of assets and to pay shareholder dividends. We expect to meet our cash requirements through net cash flows from operating activities, existing unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, borrowings under our commercial paper program and our revolving credit facility, the future issuance of debt and equity and the future disposition of assets. 
 We historically have had positive net cash flows from operating activities. We believe that future net cash flows generated from operating activities, existing unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, borrowing capacity under our current commercial paper program and revolving credit facility, and our ability to issue debt and equity will provide sufficient liquidity to fund the cash requirements for our business over the next 12 months and the foreseeable future. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 805.7 million of combined unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and available capacity under our revolving credit facility. 
 Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 859.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 13.1 million as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in operating cash flows was primarily driven by an increase in property operating expenses. 
 36 

Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 651.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 223.0 million as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The primary drivers of the change were as follows (dollars in thousands):

The increase in cash outflows for purchases of real estate and other assets was driven by our acquisition activity during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. We acquired two apartment communities and two land parcels during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 while we acquired one land parcel during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in cash outflows for capital improvements and other was primarily driven by decreased capital spend relating to our property redevelopment and repositioning activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in cash outflows for development costs was primarily driven by increased development activity, including financing a third party s development of a 239-unit multifamily apartment community currently under construction located in Charlotte, North Carolina during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in cash outflows for contributions to affiliates was driven by a lesser amount of investments made in the technology-focused limited partnerships during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in cash inflows from proceeds from sale of marketable equity securities resulted from the sale of marketable equity securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to no marketable securities being sold during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in cash inflows from proceeds from real estate asset dispositions resulted from no dispositions during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the disposition of one land parcel during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in cash inflows from net proceeds from insurance recoveries was driven by increased insurance reimbursements received for property and storm-related casualty claims during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 37 

Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 198.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 130.8 million as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The primary drivers of the change were as follows (dollars in thousands):

The decrease in cash outflows related to net payments of commercial paper resulted from the decrease in net borrowings of 5.0 million on our commercial paper program during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the decrease in net borrowings of 20.0 million on our commercial paper program during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in cash inflows from proceeds from notes payable resulted from the issuance of 750.0 million of unsecured senior notes during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to no issuance of unsecured senior notes during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in cash outflows related to principal payments on notes payable resulted from the retirement of 400.0 million of unsecured senior notes during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the retirement of 3.0 million of a secured property mortgage prior to its maturity during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in cash outflows related to payment of deferred financing costs resulted from the closing costs of 7.2 million related to the issuance of 750.0 million of unsecured senior notes during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to no payments of deferred financing costs during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in cash outflows from dividends paid on common shares primarily resulted from the increase in the dividend rate to 4.4100 per share during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the dividend rate of 4.2000 per share during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in cash inflows related to the proceeds from issuances of common shares resulted from the proceeds from the settlement of two forward sale agreements with respect to a total of 1.1 million shares at a forward price per share of 185.23 during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in cash outflows from the net change in other financing activities was primarily driven by employees surrendering fewer shares of MAA common stock to satisfy their statutory minimum federal and state tax obligations associated with the vesting of restricted shares during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 For more information regarding our debt capital resources, see Note 6 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Equity 
 As of September 30, 2024, MAA owned 116,880,291 OP Units, comprising a 97.4 limited partnership interest in MAALP, while the remaining 3,075,552 outstanding OP Units were held by limited partners of MAALP other than MAA. Holders of OP Units (other than MAA) may require us to redeem their OP Units from time to time, in which case we may, at our option, pay the redemption price either in cash (in an amount per OP Unit equal, in general, to the average closing price of MAA s common stock on the NYSE over a specified period prior to the redemption date) or by delivering one share of MAA s common stock (subject to adjustment under specified circumstances) for each OP Unit so redeemed. MAA has registered under the Securities Act the 3,075,552 shares of its common stock that, as of September 30, 2024, were issuable upon redemption of OP Units, in order for those shares to be sold freely in the public markets. 
 In August 2021, we entered into two 18-month forward sale agreements with respect to a total of 1.1 million shares of our common stock at an initial forward sale price of 190.56 per share, which is net of issuance costs. In January 2023, we settled our two forward sale agreements with respect to all 1.1 million shares at a forward price per share of 185.23, which is inclusive of adjustments made to reflect the then-current federal funds rate, the amount of dividends paid to holders of MAA common stock and commissions paid to sales agents, for net proceeds of 203.7 million. We have used these proceeds primarily to fund our development and redevelopment activities. 
 In November 2021, we entered into an equity distribution agreement (as amended, the Distribution Agreement ), by and among MAA, MAALP, those certain managers named therein (collectively, the Managers and those certain forward-purchasers named therein (collectively, the Forward Purchasers ), for the purpose of establishing a new at-the-market equity offering program (the ATM Program ). Pursuant to the terms of the Distribution Agreement, we may, from time to time, issue and sell through or to the Managers, as sales agents and/or principals or as forward sellers, as agents for the Forward Purchasers, up to 4.0 million shares of our common stock. 
 In August 2024, we entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Distribution Agreement (the Amendment ), which was entered into in order to (i) reflect the filing by MAA and MAALP of a new shelf registration statement on Form S-3ASR (Registration No. 333-279076 and Registration No. 333-258271-01, respectively), which became effective upon filing with the SEC on May 2, 2024; (ii) include certain other parties as additional Managers; (iii) include certain other parties as additional Forward Purchasers; and (iv) modify certain defined terms in the Distribution Agreement, as well as certain other administrative matters. 
 We have no obligation to issue shares through the ATM program. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we did not sell any shares of common stock under our ATM program. As of September 30, 2024, 4.0 million shares remained issuable under the ATM program. 
 For more information regarding our equity capital resources, see Note 8 and Note 9 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 Material Cash Requirements 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 521.2 million of outstanding debt and debt service obligations payable in the year ending December 31, 2024, including the 490.0 million of commercial paper borrowings due October 2024, and 31.2 million of interest payments on fixed rate debt obligations in the year ending December 31, 2024. For a schedule of the maturity dates of our outstanding debt beyond 2024, see the Liquidity and Capital Resources - Debt section above. As of September 30, 2024, we also had obligations to make additional capital contributions to five technology-focused limited partnerships in which we hold equity interests. The capital contributions may be called by the general partners at any time after giving appropriate notice. As of September 30, 2024, we had committed to make additional capital contributions totaling up to 31.6 million if and when called by the general partners of the limited partnerships. 
 We have other material cash requirements that do not represent contractual obligations, but that we expect to incur in the ordinary course of our business. 
 40 

As of September 30, 2024, we had eight development communities under construction totaling 2,762 apartment units once complete. Total expected costs for the eight development projects are 978.3 million, of which 610.4 million had been incurred through September 30, 2024. In addition, our property redevelopment and repositioning activities are ongoing, and we incur expenditures relating to recurring capital replacements, which typically include scheduled carpet replacement, new roofs, HVAC units, plumbing, concrete, masonry and other paving, pools and various exterior building improvements. For the year ending December 31, 2024, we expect that our total capital expenditures relating to our development activities, our property redevelopment and repositioning activities and recurring capital replacements will be in line with our total capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2023. We expect to have additional development projects in the future. 
 We typically declare cash dividends on MAA s common stock on a quarterly basis, subject to approval by MAA s Board of Directors. We expect to pay quarterly dividends at an annual rate of 5.88 per share of MAA common stock during the year ending December 31, 2024. The timing and amount of future dividends will depend on actual cash flows from operations, our financial condition, capital requirements, the annual distribution requirements under the REIT provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and other factors as MAA s Board of Directors deems relevant. MAA s Board of Directors may modify our dividend policy from time to time. 
 For information regarding our material cash requirements as of December 31, 2023, see Item 7 of Part II of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 9, 2024. 
 Inflation 
 Our resident leases at our apartment communities allow for adjustments in the rental rate at the time of renewal, which may enable us to seek rent increases. The majority of our leases are for one year or less. The short-term nature of these leases generally serves to reduce our risk to adverse effects of inflation on our revenue. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Please refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 9, 2024, for discussions of our critical accounting estimates. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we used two additional trading data inputs (i.e., yields of relevant Company bond issuances and yields of relevant indices) to estimate the fair value of the bifurcated call option in the MAA Series I preferred stock.

 Market risk includes risks that arise from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, equity prices and other market changes that affect market sensitive instruments. Our primary market risk exposure is to changes in interest rates on our borrowings. As of September 30, 2024, 20.4 of our total market capitalization consisted of debt borrowings. Our interest rate risk objective is to limit the impact of interest rate fluctuations on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs. To achieve this objective, we manage our exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates for borrowings through the use of fixed rate debt instruments and, from time to time, interest rate swaps to effectively fix the interest rate on anticipated future debt transactions. We use our best efforts to have our debt instruments mature across multiple years, which we believe limits our exposure to interest rate changes in any one year. We do not enter into derivative instruments for trading or other speculative purposes. As of September 30, 2024, 90.0 of our outstanding debt was subject to fixed rates. We regularly review interest rate exposure on outstanding borrowings in an effort to minimize the risk of interest rate fluctuations. There have been no material changes in our market risk as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 9, 2024.
