 The results of operations for any interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the entire fiscal year or any other interim period. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been omitted in accordance with the rules and regulations o f the SEC for interim reporting. Going Concern The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates continuity of operations, realization of assets, and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. Under the rules of Accounting Standards Codification ASC Subtopic 205-40 Presentation of Financial Statements-Going Concern ASC 205-40 ), reporting companies are required to evaluate whether conditions and/or events raise substantial doubt about their ability to meet their future financial obligations as they become due within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. This evaluation takes into account a company s current available cash and projected cash needs over the one-year evaluation period but may not consider things beyond its control. The Company has of 2022 Notes maturing on January 31, 2025 Note 9 and based on the Company s current liquidity position would not be able to repay the 2022 Notes when due. In addition, Leafly has experienced revenue declines, incurred recurring operating losses, used cash from operations, and relied on the capital raised in the Business Combination to continue ongoing operations. These conditions, when considered in the aggregate, raise substantial doubt about Leafly s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date these financial statements are issued. In response to these conditions, Leafly management took the following actions: The Company implemented previous restructuring plans, most recently during the first quarter of 2023, which reduced its labor force and substantially decreased costs in fiscal year 2023 as compared to fiscal year 2022. The Company still expects to recognize the full-year impact of its 2023 restructuring in 2024. 

 During the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company began exploring opportunities to address the upcoming maturity of its 2022 Notes. In December 2023 and May 2024, the Company worked with its noteholders and converted and Note 9 ), respectively, of the outstanding principal to equity. In addition, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company sold common shares for net proceeds of under the ATM program Note 11 ).

 days after the closing of the Business Combination. The Public Warrants may not be exercisable for cash unless the Company has an effective and current registration statement covering the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants and a current prospectus relating to such shares of common stock. Notwithstanding the foregoing, during any period when the Company shall have failed to maintain an effective registration statement, warrant holders may exercise their Public Warrants on a cashless basis pursuant to the exemption provided by Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act, provided that such exemption is available. If that exemption, or another exemption, is not available, holders will not be able to exercise their Public Warrants on a cashless basis. The Public Warrants will expire after the Closing of the Business Combination or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. The Company may redeem the Public Warrants: in whole and not in part; 

 at a price of per warrant; 

 upon not less than days prior written notice of redemption; 

 if, and only if, the reported last sale price of the Company s common stock equals or exceeds per share for any trading days within a -trading day period commencing after the warrants became exercisable and ending on the third business day prior to the notice of redemption to the warrant holders; and 

 if, and only if, there is a current registration statement in effect with respect to the shares of common stock underlying the warrants. 

 If the Company calls the Public Warrants for redemption, management will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise the Public Warrants to do so on a cashless basis, as described in the warrant agreement.

The Private Warrants are identical to the Public Warrants, except that the Private Warrants and the shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of the Private Warrants were not transferable, assignable or salable until after the closing of the Business Combination, subject to certain limited exceptions. Additionally, the Private Warrants are exercisable for cash or on a cashless basis, at the holder s option, and are non-redeemable so long as they are held by the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees. If the Private Warrants are held by someone other than the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees, the Private Warrants are redeemable by the Company and exercisable by such holders on the same basis as the Public Warrants. The exercise price and number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the Private Warrants may be adjusted in certain circumstances including in the event of a stock dividend, or recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation. However, the Private Warrants will not be adjusted for issuance of common stock at a price below its exercise price. Additionally, in no event will the Company be required to net cash settle the Private Warrants. During the year ended December 31, 2023, Private Warrant holders converted Private Warrants to Public Warrants. such conversions were made during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company accounts for the Private Warrants as derivative liabilities, remeasured to fair value on a recurring basis, with changes in the fair value recorded to earnings.

 , all of the Company's federal NOLs will last indefinitely and the Company s foreign NOL will begin to expire in . The Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code ), imposes restrictions on the utilization of NOLs in the event of an ownership change of a corporation. Accordingly, a company s ability to use NOLs may be limited as prescribed under Code Section 382 IRC Section 382 ). Events which may cause limitations in the amount of the NOLs that the Company may use in any one year include, but are not limited to, a cumulative ownership change of more than over a three-year period. Utilization of the federal and state NOLs may be subject to substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the IRC Section 382 and similar state provisions. The annual limitation may result in the expiration of the net operating loss before utilization. The Company has not performed an IRC Section 382 study as of December 31, 2023 due to its full valuation allowance. ASC 740 prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. There were unrecognized tax benefits and amounts accrued for interest and penalties as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The Company is currently not aware of any issues under review that could result in significant payments, accruals, or material deviation from its position. The Company is subject to income tax examinations by major taxing authorities since inception. Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, research and development costs are no longer fully deductible and are required to be capitalized and amortized for U.S. tax purposes effective January 1, 2022. The mandatory capitalization requirement had no material impact to the Company during the year ended December 31, 2023 and the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. Management believes all the income tax returns filed since inception remain open to examination by the major domestic and foreign taxing jurisdictions to which the Company is subject due to NOLs.

 Business Overview 
 Leafly is a leading online cannabis discovery marketplace and resource for cannabis consumers. Leafly provides an information resource platform with a deep library of content, including detailed information about cannabis strains, retailers and cannabis products. We are a trusted destination to discover legal cannabis products and order them from licensed retailers with offerings that include subscription-based products and digital advertising. Legacy Leafly was founded in 2010 and is headquartered in Seattle with 119 total employees, including 116 in the U.S. and 3 in Canada as of September 30, 2024. 
 Leafly is one of the cannabis industry s leading marketplaces for brands and retailers to reach one of the largest audiences of consumers interested in cannabis. Our platform includes educational information, strains data, and lifestyle content, enabling consumers to use Leafly s content library to have an informed shopping experience. Leafly reduces the friction caused by fragmented regulation of cannabis across North America by offering a compliant digital marketplace that connects cannabis consumers with legal and licensed retailers and brands nearest them. 
 Leafly allows each shopper to tailor their journey, by selecting the store, brand, and cannabis form-factor that appeals to them. Once that shopper builds a basket and is ready to order, our non-plant-touching business model sends that order reservation to the store for payment and fulfillment. By matching stores and shoppers, we deliver value to all constituencies. We monetize our platform primarily through the sale of subscription packages, bundling e-commerce software and advertising solutions, as well as non-subscription-based advertising to retailers and brands. 
 Key Metrics 
 In addition to the measures presented in our consolidated financial statements, our management regularly monitors certain metrics in the operation of our business: 
 Ending Retail Accounts 
 Ending retail accounts is the number of paying retailer accounts with Leafly as of the last month of the respective period. Retail accounts can include more than one retailer. We believe this metric is helpful for investors because it represents a portion of the volume element of our revenue and provides an indication of our market share. Management believes this metric offers useful information in understanding consumer behavior, trends in our business, and our overall operating results. 
 Retailer Average Revenue Per Account ARPA 
 Retailer ARPA is calculated as monthly retail revenue, on an account basis, divided by the number of retail accounts that were active during that same month. An active account is one that had an active paying subscription with Leafly in the month. We believe this metric is helpful for investors because it represents the price element of our revenue. Management believes

There was a 20 decline in year-over-year ending retail accounts for each of the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same periods in 2023 primarily related to customer budget constraints and Leafly s ongoing removal of non-paying customers from the platform over the last 12 months. In addition, sequentially, ending retail accounts declined 1 from 3,595 at June 30, 2024. 
 The 8 increase in ARPA for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in 2023 was primarily the result of the removal of lower ARPA accounts from the platform, coupled with targeted price increases on Leafly products over the last twelve months. Sequentially, ARPA increased 2 from 684 at June 30, 2024 due to the reduction of lower ARPA accounts in 2024. 
 Revenue 
 We generate our revenue through the sale of online advertising and online order reservation enablement on the Leafly platform for suppliers in our Retail and Brands segments. Within our Retail segment, we monetize our multi-sided retail marketplace through monthly subscriptions that enable retailers to advertise to and acquire potential shoppers. Our solutions allow retailers, where legally permissible, to accept online orders from shoppers who visit Leafly.com or use a Leafly-powered online order reservation solution, including our iOS app. Within our Brands segment, our revenue is derived by creating custom advertising campaigns for both small and large brands that target Leafly s broad and diverse audience and offering brands profile listings on our platform, which are sold on a monthly recurring subscription or annual basis. Advertising opportunities include on-site digital display, native placements, email, branded content, and off-site audience

Retail 
 Retail revenues decreased 1,888 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to a 870 decrease in subscriptions revenue, a 979 decrease in digital display ads, and a decrease in other revenues of 39 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. The net 20 decrease was driven by the reduction in ending retail accounts discussed above. 
 Retail revenues decreased 4,986 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023 primarily due to a 2,045 decrease in subscriptions revenue and a 3,030 decrease in digital display ads. These decreases were slightly offset by an increase in other revenues of 89 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. The net 18 decrease was driven by the reduction in ending retail accounts discussed above.

 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, Brands revenue decreased 342, due to a reduction in display ads of 200, a decrease in other revenues of 26, a branded content decrease of 89 and a direct-to-consumer marketing revenue decrease of 27. The decrease in brands revenue was driven primarily by reduced spend by our brand customers due primarily to changes in the macro environment and customer budget constraints. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, Brands revenue decreased 1,398, due to a reduction in display ads of 950, a decrease in other revenues of 164, a branded content decrease of 88 and a direct-to-consumer marketing revenue decrease of 196. The decrease in brands revenue was driven primarily by reduced spend by our brand customers due primarily to changes in the macro environment and customer budget constraints.

Retail 
 Retail cost of sales reductions were driven by increased efficiency and lower platform costs, driving an improvement in gross margin of 89.3 versus 89.3 and 89.2 versus 88.5 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2023 as described below. 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, retail cost of revenue decreased 197 due to decreased business platform and merchant processing costs of 145 and decreased website infrastructure costs of 44 and decreased labor allocation costs of 8. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, retail cost of revenue decreased 724 due to decreased business platform and merchant processing costs of 531, decreased labor allocation costs of 65 and decreased website infrastructure costs of 128. 
 
 Brands 
 Brands cost of sales reductions were a consequence of declining revenues and, to a lesser extent, increased efficiency as described below with a slight improvement in gross margin of 88.6 versus 86.9 and 88.6 versus 88.1 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods in 2023. 
 Brands cost of revenue decreased 62 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, of which 40 corresponds to decreased associated revenue. Brands cost of revenue also decreased 22 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, due to reduced labor allocation costs. 
 Brands cost of revenue decreased 184 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, of which 139 corresponds to decreased associated revenue. Brands cost of revenue also decreased 45 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, due to reduced labor allocation costs.

 Other income (expense), net increased by 52 and decreased by 274 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the same periods in 2023 due primarily to a 0 and 253 reduction, respectively, in the change in fair value of derivatives. 
 Net Loss 
 Net loss was 1,139 and 4,801 for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to net loss of 2,210 and 9,043 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The reductions in net loss were primarily due to the realization of cost savings from the 2023 reduction in force and cost cutting measures, as discussed above. 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 Earnings Before Interest, Taxes and Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) and Adjusted EBITDA 
 To provide investors with additional information regarding our financial results, we have disclosed EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, both of which are non-GAAP financial measures that we calculate as net loss before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization expense in the case of EBITDA and further adjusted to exclude non-cash, unusual and/or infrequent costs in the case of Adjusted EBITDA. Below we have provided a reconciliation of net loss (the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure) to EBITDA and from EBITDA to Adjusted EBITDA. 
 We present EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA because these metrics are key measures used by our management to evaluate our operating performance, generate future operating plans, and make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of investment capacity. Accordingly, we believe that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management. 
 34 

Table of Contents 

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider these in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are as follows: 
 although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and both EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements; 

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; and 

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect interest or tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us. 

Because of these limitations, you should consider EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA alongside other financial performance measures, including net loss and our other GAAP results. 
 A reconciliation of net loss to non-GAAP EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA follows:

The favorable changes in EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 versus the same periods in 2023 are primarily due to cost savings resulting from Leafly s reductions in force and cost cutting measures described above. 
 Financial Condition 
 Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash 
 Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash totaled 13,815 and 15,544 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Explanations of our cash flows for the periods presented follow. 
 Cash Flows 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we utilized a total of 1,729 of cash to fund cash operating losses of approximately 1,291 partially offset by favorable changes in current assets and liabilities of 975, investing activities (primarily capitalized software costs) of 1,078, and financing activities of 335 (primarily the 1,109 repayment of the short-term financing partially offset by 908 of funds raised in the ATM Offering net of offering costs). The changes in current assets and liabilities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 included reductions in accounts payable and accrued expenses of 451 as well as a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets of 1,162.

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 As compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, cash used in operations decreased by 9,322 to 316 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, mainly due to decreased net loss from operations as a result of the reductions in force, the cost cutting measures employed in 2023 and the payment of 2022 bonuses in early 2023. Cash used in investing activities increased 63 to 1,078 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily due to higher software capitalization in the current year period. Cash and restricted cash used by financing activities increased 504 from the 2023 period to a use of 335 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 (primarily the 1,109 repayment of the short-term financing partially offset by 908 of funds raised in the ATM Offering net of offering costs in 2024). 
 Deferred Revenue 
 Deferred revenue is primarily related to software subscriptions and display ads. The revenue deferred at September 30, 2024 is expected to be recognized in the near term. See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements within this Quarterly Report for further discussion. 
 Contractual Obligations and Other Planned Uses of Capital 
 We are obligated to repay the operating liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, such as accrued liabilities. In addition, we are obligated to pay any 2022 Notes when they come due on January 31, 2025 that do not ultimately convert to equity. See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements within this Quarterly Report for more information. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We primarily fund our operations and capital expenditures through cash flows generated by operations and our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash on hand. Our principal liquidity needs in the near-term (within the next twelve months) include the direct costs associated with revenues earned, operating expenses, payment of principal and interest on the 2022 Notes and tax payments. The 2022 Notes bear interest at 8 annually, paid in cash semi-annually in arrears on July 31 and January 31 of each year, and mature on January 31, 2025. 
 To the extent existing sources of liquidity are not sufficient to fund future activities, meet our payment obligations under the 2022 Notes or pursue strategic opportunities, we may need to raise additional funds, which we may seek to do through equity or debt financings, or seek to refinance the 2022 Notes. Any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include equity conversion rights, covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, expending capital, or pursuing certain business opportunities. There can be no assurance that, if needed, we will be able to obtain additional or adequate financing or to refinance or restructure our indebtedness on terms favorable to us, if at all. See, Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors in our 2023 Annual Report under the headings We may need to raise additional capital, which may not be available on favorable terms, if at all, causing dilution to our stockholders, restricting our operations or adversely affecting our ability to operate our business. and Risks Relating to our Indebtedness. In addition, if our securities are delisted, our ability to raise additional equity financing will be limited, and we may no longer have access to our ATM Program. See Section 1A. Risk Factors Our failure to regain compliance with the continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market could result in a delisting of our common stock. 
 Going Concern 
 Under the rules of ASC Subtopic 205-40 Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern ASC 205-40 ), reporting companies are required to evaluate whether conditions and/or events raise substantial doubt about their ability to meet their future financial obligations as they become due within one year after the date that the financial statements are

issued. This evaluation takes into account a company s current available cash and projected cash needs over the one-year evaluation period but may not consider things beyond its control. 
 We have 29,425 of 2022 Notes maturing on January 31, 2025 and based on our current liquidity position would not be able to repay the 2022 Notes when due. Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements within this Quarterly Report provides additional information regarding the 2022 Notes. In addition, as noted above, we have experienced revenue declines, incurred recurring operating losses, used cash from operations, and relied on the capital raised in the Business Combination to continue ongoing operations. We have incurred operating losses since our inception and had an accumulated deficit of 78,999 and 74,198 at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. These conditions, when considered in the aggregate, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date the financial statements included in this Quarterly Report are issued. In response to these conditions, we took the following actions: 
 We implemented previous restructuring plans, most recently in the first quarter of 2023, which reduced our labor force and substantially decreased costs in fiscal year 2023 as compared to fiscal year 2022. We still expect to recognize the full-year impact of our 2023 restructuring in 2024. 

During the fourth quarter of 2023, we began exploring opportunities to address the upcoming maturity of our 2022 Notes. In December 2023 and May 2024, we worked with our noteholders and converted 300 and 275, respectively, of the outstanding principal to equity Note 9 ). In addition, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we sold 470,000 common shares for net proceeds of 908 under our ATM program Note 11 ). 

In early 2024, we began an initiative that we believe will improve revenues by hiring additional sales professionals and implementing improved selling strategies. In addition, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, total employees declined by 12 persons from 131 to 119. 

We continue to work with the advisors we engaged during the second quarter of 2024 to explore financing and strategic opportunities to maximize stakeholder value. 

The restructuring plans above have been implemented and are expected to continue contributing to the cash savings of the Company. We are closely monitoring and reducing operating expenses where we are able to, while intending to ensure the trajectory and viability of the business remains intact. However, we cannot meet our debt maturity obligations without a significant capital infusion or a lender s commitment to refinance our debt. After considering all available evidence, Leafly determined that the combined impact of our cost reduction measures outlined in both actions above and planned operations will be not sufficient to meet our capital requirements for a period of at least twelve months from the date that our September 30, 2024 financial statements are issued. We believe substantial doubt exists about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date these financial statements are issued. Management will continue to evaluate our liquidity and capital resources. 
 We believe that our capital resources are not sufficient to fund our operations for at least the following 12 months, because we do not currently have the ability to repay our 2022 Notes due in January 2025. 
 ATM Offering 
 On June 27, 2024, we entered into the Equity Distribution Agreement with the Agent pursuant to which we could sell, at our option, up to an aggregate of 2,519 in shares of our common stock through the Agent under the ATM Offering. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we raised net proceeds totaling 908 under the ATM Offering Note 11 ). 
 Noncompliance with Nasdaq Continued Listing Standards 
 
From January 1, 2024 until March 25, 2024, we were out of compliance with the Audit Committee Rule, which requires our Board s Audit Committee to be composed of at least three independent members. On January 3, 2024, we received a letter from the Staff confirming our noncompliance with the Audit Committee Rule and providing us with a cure period to regain compliance (i) until the earlier of our next annual meeting of stockholders or January 2, 2025; or (ii) if the next annual meeting of stockholders was held before July 1, 2024, then we had to evidence compliance no later than July 1, 2024. As a 
 37 

Table of Contents 

result of the Board s appointment on March 25, 2024 of two new independent directors, Messrs. Monat and Nannetti, to the Board and to the Board's Audit Committee, on April 1, 2024, we received written notice from the Staff confirming that we regained compliance with the Audit Committee Rule and this matter is now closed. 
 On April 9, 2024, we received the Notice from the Staff notifying us that we no longer comply with Nasdaq's requirements contained in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550 for companies traded on the Capital Market. Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550 requires a company listed on the Capital Market to continuously meet at least one of the Continued Listing Standards set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b), as follows: 

Continued Listing Standard 
 
 Requirement 

Stockholders Equity 
 
 Minimum 2.5 million 

Market Value of Listed Securities 
 
 Minimum 35 million 

Net Income 
 
 Minimum 500 thousand from continuing operations most recent fiscal year or in two of three of last three fiscal years 

As confirmed by the Notice, we do not currently meet any of the Continued Listing Standards. The Notice has no immediate effect on the listing of the Company's common stock or warrants, and its common stock and warrants will continue to trade on the Capital Market under the symbols LFLY and LFLYW, respectively. As set forth in the Notice, within 45 calendar days from the date of the Notice, we had the right to submit to Nasdaq a plan to regain compliance with Nasdaq's Stockholders' Equity and/or Market Value of Listed Securities standards, and the Staff may grant an extension of up to 180 calendar days from the date of the Notice to evidence compliance. On May 24, 2024, we submitted a proposed plan of compliance to Nasdaq showing how we intend to regain compliance with the Stockholders Equity standard, and subsequently, upon request by Nasdaq, we provided updates on our progress under the proposed plan. On October 4, 2024, the Company received a plan denial and delisting determination letter from the Staff. The Company requested a hearing before a Nasdaq Hearing Panel Panel ). Any suspension or delisting of the Company s common stock and warrants on the Capital Market has been stayed, pending the scheduled hearing and a final written decision from the Panel. The Panel hearing is scheduled for December 5, 2024. If the Panel denies the Company s appeal, then the Company's common stock and warrants will be delisted from the Capital Market. There can be no assurance that the Panel will grant the Company an extension period or that the Company will ultimately meet all applicable criteria for continued listing on the Capital Market. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2024. 
 Contractual Obligations 
 Other than our 2022 Notes (see Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements), we do not have any long-term debt, lease obligations or other long-term liabilities. We have entered into several multi-year licensing and administration agreements in the ordinary course of business, the cost of which are reflected within general and administrative expense within our statements of operations as costs are incurred. 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. 
 We believe there have been no material changes to the items that we disclosed as our critical accounting estimates under Part II, Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in our 2023 Annual

Item 3 . QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 Leafly is a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and is not required to provide the information otherwise required with respect to market risk. 
 Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 The term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act refers to controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Because there are inherent limitations in all control systems, a control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, as opposed to absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective, at the reasonable assurance level, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2024.

Part II - Other Information 
 Item 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS . 
 We are involved in legal and administrative proceedings and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. We believe that the potential liability, if any, in excess of amounts already accrued from all proceedings, claims and litigation will not have a material effect on our financial position, cash flows or results of operations when resolved in a future period. In addition, based upon information available to us and our review of lawsuits and claims filed or pending against us to date, we believe there are no material pending legal proceedings to which we or any of our subsidiaries is a party or of which any of our or our subsidiaries property is the subject. 
 Item 1A. RISK FACTORS . 
 Risk factors that affect our business and financial results are discussed in Part I, Item 1A of our 2023 Annual Report. As of the date of this report, other than as set forth below, we are not aware of any material changes in the risk factors disclosed in our 2023 Annual Report. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described herein and in our 2023 Annual Report, which have the potential to affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects in a material and adverse manner. The risks described herein and in our 2023 Annual Report are not the only risks we face, as there are additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial which may in the future adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. 
 
 Our failure to regain compliance with the continued listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market could result in a delisting of our common stock . 
 
 On April 9, 2024, we received a notification from Nasdaq s Listing Qualifications Staff Staff notifying us that we no longer comply with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b) (the Continued Listing Standards ). On May 24, 2024, we timely submitted a proposed plan of compliance to Nasdaq showing how we intend to regain compliance with the Stockholders Equity standard, and subsequently, upon request by Nasdaq, we provided updates on our progress under the proposed plan. On October 4, 2024, the Company received a plan denial and delisting determination letter from the Staff. The Company requested a hearing before a Nasdaq Hearing Panel Panel ). Any suspension or delisting of the Company s common stock and warrants on the Capital Market has been stayed, pending the scheduled hearing and a final written decision from the Panel, and our common stock and warrants continue to trade on the Nasdaq Capital Market (the Capital Market under the symbols LFLY and LFLYW, respectively. The Panel hearing is scheduled for December 5, 2024. If the Panel denies the Company s appeal, then the Company's common stock and warrants will be delisted from the Capital Market. There can be no assurance that the Panel will grant the Company an extension period or that the Company will ultimately meet all applicable criteria for continued listing on the Capital Market. 
 If we are delisted from the Capital Market, it is unlikely we would qualify for listing on another national securities exchange in the United States and trading of our common stock and warrants may take place on an over-the-counter market established for unlisted securities, such as the OTCQX, the OTCQB or the Pink Market maintained by OTC Markets Group Inc. We cannot assure you that our common stock and/or warrants, if delisted from Nasdaq, will ever be listed on another securities exchange or quoted on an over-the counter quotation system. An investor would likely find it less convenient to sell, or to obtain accurate quotations in seeking to buy, our common stock and warrants on an over-the-counter market, and many investors would likely not buy or sell our common stock and warrants due to difficulty in accessing over-the-counter markets, policies preventing them from trading in securities not listed on a national exchange or other reasons. Accordingly, delisting from the Capital Market could make trading our securities more difficult for investors, likely leading to declines in our share price, trading volume and liquidity. Delisting from Nasdaq could also result in negative publicity and make it more difficult for us to raise additional capital. The absence of such a listing may adversely affect the acceptance of our common stock as transaction consideration or the value accorded our common stock by other parties. Further, if we are delisted, we would also incur additional costs under state blue sky laws in connection with any sales of our securities. These requirements could severely limit the market liquidity of our securities and the ability of holders to sell our securities in the secondary market.

If our common stock is delisted, it may come within the definition of penny stock as defined in the Exchange Act and would be covered by Rule 15g-9 of the Exchange Act. Rule 15g-9 imposes additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors which may further limit the market liquidity of our common stock and the ability of our stockholders to sell our common stock in the secondary market. The regulations relating to penny stocks, coupled with the typically higher cost per trade to the investor of penny stocks due to factors such as broker commissions generally representing a higher percentage of the price of a penny stock than of a higher-priced stock, would further limit the ability of investors to trade in our common stock. 
 Furthermore, we are party to a number of agreements pursuant to which we have contractual covenants that we remain listed on the Capital Market or another national securities exchange, including pursuant to the 2022 Notes. In the event our securities are delisted from the Capital Market, we will be in breach of such covenants. Such breach, if not cured or waived by holders of such securities, could result in litigation and, with respect to the 2022 Notes, would result in an acceleration of principal amount of the 2022 Notes. Any of the foregoing would materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 Item 5. OTHER INFORMATION. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024 , no director or officer of the Company or a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement, as each term is defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K.
