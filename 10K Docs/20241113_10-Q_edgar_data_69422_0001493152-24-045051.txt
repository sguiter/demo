 NOTES
TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 

 (UNAUDITED) 

owned subsidiary, Santa Fe Financial Corporation Santa Fe ), a public company
(OTCBB: SFEF), was liquidated and all of its assets including its interest in Portsmouth Square Inc. Portsmouth ),
a public company (OTCBB: PRSI) was distributed to its shareholders in exchange for their Santa Fe common stock. As of September 30, 2024,
InterGroup owns approximately of the outstanding common shares of Portsmouth and the Company s President, Chairman of the
Board and Chief Executive Officer, John Winfield, owns approximately of the outstanding common shares of Portsmouth. Mr. Winfield
also serves as the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Portsmouth. 

Portsmouth s
primary business was conducted through its general and limited partnership interest in Justice Investors Limited Partnership, a California
limited partnership Justice or the Partnership ). Effective July 15, 2021, Portsmouth completed the purchase
of of the limited partnership interest of Justice through the acquisition of the remaining non-controlling interest. Effective
December 23, 2021, the Partnership was dissolved. The financial statements of Justice were consolidated with those of Portsmouth. 

Prior
to its dissolution effective December 23, 2021, Justice owned and operated a 544-room hotel property located at 750 Kearny Street, San
Francisco California, known as the Hilton San Francisco Financial District (the Hotel and related facilities including
a five-level underground parking garage through its subsidiaries Justice Operating Company, LLC Operating and Justice
Mezzanine Company, LLC Mezzanine ). Mezzanine was a wholly owned subsidiary of the Partnership; Operating is a wholly owned
subsidiary of Mezzanine. Effective December 23, 2021, Portsmouth replaced Justice as the single member of Mezzanine. Mezzanine is the
borrower under certain mezzanine indebtedness of Justice, and in December 2013, the Partnership conveyed ownership of the Hotel to Operating.
The Hotel is a full-service Hilton brand hotel pursuant to a Franchise License Agreement with HLT Franchise Holding LLC Hilton through January 31, 2030. 

Aimbridge
Hospitality Aimbridge manages the Hotel, along with its five-level parking garage, under certain Hotel management agreement HMA with Operating. The term of the management agreement is for an initial period of ten years commencing on February
3, 2017 and automatically renews for successive one (1) year periods, to not exceed five years in the aggregate, subject to certain conditions.
Under the terms on the HMA, base management fee payable to Aimbridge shall be one and seven-tenths percent (1.70 of total Hotel revenue.
In addition to the Basic Fee, Aimbridge shall be entitled to an annual incentive fee for each fiscal year equal to ten percent (10 of the amount by which Gross Operating Profit in the current fiscal year exceeds the previous fiscal year s Gross Operating Profit. 

However,
the Company after discussions with Aimbridge regarding a dispute in connection with the validity of the incentive fees as they relate
directly to the Covid pandemic, the Company and Aimbridge agreed that there was no incentive fees due to Aimbridge as the year-over-year
improvement resulted of the recovery from the pandemic. Therefore, Aimbridge agreed to waive that was previously recorded
and agreed to establish a performance threshold of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization EBITDA that would be otherwise payable with respect to fiscal years 2019 through 2023. The waive reduction was made as of September 30, 2024. 

In
addition to the operations of the Hotel, the Company also generates income from the ownership of real estate. Properties include apartment
complexes, commercial real estate, and three single-family houses as strategic investments. The properties are located throughout the
United States but are concentrated in Texas and Southern California. The Company also has investments in unimproved real property. All
of the Company s residential rental properties and its commercial rental property are managed in-house. 

There
have been no material changes to the Company s significant accounting policies during the three months ended September 30, 2024.
Please refer to the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2024 for a summary of the significant accounting
policies. 

net of debt issuance costs .
Both loans matured on January 1, 2024, in addition, the Hotel has recurring losses and has an accumulated deficit of 
which includes a 
increase adjustment made in December 2013 as a result of the partnership redemption. 

Due
to these factors and the uncertainty around the Hotel s ability to successfully refinance the debt on favorable terms in the current
lending environment gives rise to substantial doubt about the Hotel s ability to continue as a going concern for one year after
the financial statement issuance date. 

On
January 4, 2024, the Company was made aware of a notice of default (the Notice issued by its senior loan special servicer
LNR Partners, LLC to Justice Operating Company, LLC which is the wholly owned subsidiary of Portsmouth. The Notice states that the lender
has rights as a result of such defaults, including, but not limited to, acceleration of the loans, foreclosure on collateral and other
rights and remedies under the loan documents and otherwise available under the law. On January 10, 2024, the Company filed the required
Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission. During the entire life of the outstanding debt, the Company has made all mortgage
payments timely as of the date of maturity and as of September 30, 2024, there were no delinquent amounts due to the senior or mezzanine
lenders. On April 29, 2024, the Company entered into forbearance agreements with its senior and mezzanine lenders which establishes,
among other customary terms, the new maturity date of January 1, 2025. While the Company successfully entered into the aforementioned
forbearance agreements, we continue our efforts to place a longer-term refinancing solution to its current senior mortgage and mezzanine
debt with potential lenders. As such, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain additional liquidity when needed
or under acceptable terms, if at all. The Company is also in communications with its current lenders to explore the possibility of a
term extension from its maturity date of January 1, 2025. 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Hotel has completed its full guest-rooms renovation over the last 2 years along with public space, fitness
center, corridors, and meeting space. The Hotel has begun to feel the impact of the renovation when it comes to average rate and calculated by multiplying the hotel s average daily room rate by its occupancy percentage) RevPAR growth since its completion. The Hotel continues to improve with the relocation of the business center into a meeting room and the space
being converted to a lounge area for guests in the lobby. On September 5, 2024, the Hotel received its annual Quality Assurance inspection
from Hilton and received the highest score at least in the Hotel s last decade at 94.45 which is an Outstanding 
ranking by Hilton. 

For
the quarter ending September 30, 2024, The renovation has allowed the Hotel to be more competitive in a recovering market and push rates when demand allows it. The
Financial District hotels continue to outperform the market with the area showing positive year-over-year RevPAR growth compared to the
rest of the greater San Francisco market showing declines. 

The
condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets, liabilities, and
reported expenses that may be necessary if the Hotel were unable to continue as a going concern. 

. We have taken several steps to preserve capital and increase liquidity at our Hotel, including implementing strict cost management
measures to eliminate non-essential expenses, renegotiating certain reoccurring expenses, and temporarily closing certain hotel services
and outlets. As the hospitality and travel environment continues to recover, Portsmouth will continue to evaluate what services we bring
back. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, Portsmouth continued to make capital improvements to the hotel in the amount
of . During the three months ended September 30, 2024 the Company made capital improvements in the amount of to its
multi-family and commercial real estate. 

The
Company had cash and cash equivalents of and as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively. The Company
had restricted cash of and as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively. The Company had marketable
securities, net of margin due to securities brokers, of and as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively.
These marketable securities are short-term investments and liquid in nature. 

On
July 2, 2014, the Partnership obtained from InterGroup an unsecured loan in the principal amount of at per year fixed
interest, with a term of years, payable interest only each month. InterGroup received a loan fee. The loan may be prepaid at any
time without penalty. . On December 16, 2020, the Partnership and InterGroup entered into a loan
modification agreement which increased the Partnership s borrowing from InterGroup as needed up to . On December 31,
2021, Portsmouth and InterGroup entered into a loan modification agreement which increased Portsmouth s borrowing from InterGroup
as needed up to . Upon the dissolution of the Partnership in December 2021, Portsmouth assumed the Partnership s note
payable to InterGroup in the amount of . In July 2023, and the borrowing
amount available was increased to . The Company agreed to a loan extension and modification fee payable to InterGroup.
In March 2024, Portsmouth and InterGroup entered into a loan modification agreement which increased Portsmouth s borrowing amount
to . Portsmouth agreed to a loan modification fee for the increased borrowing of payable to InterGroup. As
of June 30, 2024 the balance of the loan was net of loan amortization costs of . As of September 30, 2024 the balance
of the loan was and Portsmouth has not made any paid-downs to its note payable to InterGroup. 

The
Company s known short-term liquidity requirements primarily consist of funds necessary to pay for operating and other expenditures,
including management and franchise fees, corporate expenses, payroll and related costs, taxes, interest and principal payments on our
outstanding indebtedness, and repairs and maintenance at all of our properties. 

Our
long-term liquidity requirements primarily consist of funds necessary to pay for scheduled debt maturities and capital improvements of
the Hotel and our real estate properties. We will continue to finance our business activities primarily with existing cash, including
from the activities described above, and cash generated from our operations. The objectives of our cash management policy are to maintain
existing leverage levels and the availability of liquidity, while minimizing operational costs. However, there can be no guarantee that
management will be successful with its plan.

Performance
Obligations 

We
identified the following performance obligations for which revenue is recognized as the respective performance obligations are satisfied,
which results in recognizing the amount we expect to be entitled to for providing the goods or services: 

Cancelable
 room reservations or ancillary services are typically satisfied as the good or service is transferred to the hotel guest, which
 is generally when the room stay occurs. 

Non-cancelable
 room reservations and banquet or conference reservations represent a series of distinct goods or services provided over time
 and satisfied as each distinct good or service is provided, which is reflected by the duration of the room reservation. 

Other
 ancillary goods and services are purchased independently of the room reservation at standalone selling prices and are considered
 separate performance obligations, which are satisfied when the related good or service is provided to the hotel guest. 

Components
 of package reservations for which each component could be sold separately to other hotel guests are considered separate performance
 obligations and are satisfied as set forth above. 

Hotel
revenue primarily consists of hotel room rentals, revenue from accommodations sold in conjunction with other services (e.g., package
reservations), food and beverage sales and other ancillary goods and services (e.g., parking). Revenue is recognized when rooms are occupied
or goods and services have been delivered or rendered, respectively. Payment terms typically align with when the goods and services are
provided. For package reservations, the transaction price is allocated to the performance obligations within the package based on the
estimated standalone selling prices of each component. 

We
do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts with an expected length of one year or less. Due to the
nature of our business, our revenue is not significantly impacted by refunds. Cash payments received in advance of guests staying at
our hotel are refunded to hotel guests if the guest cancels within the specified time period, before any services are rendered. Refunds
related to service are generally recognized as an adjustment to the transaction price at the time the hotel stay occurs or services are
rendered. 

Revenue
recognition from apartment rental commences when an apartment unit is placed in service and occupied by a rent-paying tenant. Apartment
units are leased on a short-term basis, with no lease extending beyond one year. 

Contract Assets and Liabilities 

The
Company does not have any material contract assets as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, other than trade and other receivables,
net on our consolidated balance sheets. Our receivables are primarily the result of contracts with customers, which are reduced by an
allowance for doubtful accounts that reflects our estimate of amounts that will not be collected. 

The
Company records contract liabilities when cash payments are received or due in advance of guests staying at our hotel, which are presented
within accounts payable and other liabilities Hotel on our consolidated balance sheets and had a balance of at July
1, 2024. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased to as contract liabilities as advance for guests. The decrease
was driven by advance for services performed after June 30, 2024. Contract liabilities increased to as of September 30, 2023
from as of June 30, 2023. 

Contract
Costs 

We
consider sales commissions earned to be incremental costs of obtaining a contract with our customers. As a practical expedient, we expense
these costs as incurred as our contracts with customers are less than one year.

Common Stock as reported on NASDAQ closing on October 12, 2023. The options expire in from the date of grant. Pursuant to the
time vesting requirements, the options vest over a period of , with options vesting upon each on year anniversary of
the date of grant. 

On
December 21, 2023, the Company extended the expiration date of the stock options originally issued to John V. Winfield, CEO on
December 26, 2013 with an exercise price of . The original expiration date was December 26, 2023 and is extended to December 26,
2029. As a result of extending Mr. Winfield s options, the Company recorded stock option compensation cost of in December
2023. The fair value of the modification was estimated using the Black Scholes pricing model, which takes into account immediately before
and after the modification date the exercise price per share and expected life of the stock option of and years, the market
price of the underlying stock on modification date and its expected volatility and , expected dividends on the stock and the
risk free interest rate and for the expected term of the stock option. 

Option-pricing
models require the input of various subjective assumptions, including the option s expected life, estimated forfeiture rates and
the price volatility of the underlying stock. The expected stock price volatility is based on analysis of the Company s stock price
history. The Company has selected to use the simplified method for estimating the expected term. The risk-free interest rate is based
on the U.S. Treasury interest rates whose term is consistent with the expected life of the stock options. No dividend yield is included
as the Company has not issued any dividends and does not anticipate issuing any dividends in the future. 

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded and 0 , respectively, related to stock option compensation

investment activity of Portsmouth. Effective June 2016, Mr. Winfield became the Managing Director of Justice and served in that position
until the dissolution of Justice in December 2021. Depending on certain market conditions and various risk factors, the Chief Executive
Officer and Portsmouth may, at times, invest in the same companies in which the Company invests. Such investments align the interests
of the Company with the interests of related parties because it places the personal resources of the Chief Executive Officer and the
resources of Portsmouth, at risk in substantially the same manner as the Company in connection with investment decisions made on behalf
of the Company.

real estate properties, and income received from investment of its cash and securities assets. 

Portsmouth s
primary asset is a 544-room hotel property located at 750 Kearny Street, San Francisco, California 94108, known as the Hilton
San Francisco Financial District (the Hotel or the Property and related facilities, including a five-level
underground parking garage. The financial statements of Portsmouth have been consolidated with those of the Company.

Three
Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 

The
Company had a net loss of 398,000 and 1,244,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively.
The decrease was primarily attributable to increased operating income from the Company s real estate operations and a lower loss
in the Company s investment transaction, offset by an increase in operating loss from its Hotel operations.

Company had net loss from Hotel operations of 725,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to net loss 639,000 for

senior and mezzanine lenders retroactive to January 1, 2024.

FINANCIAL
CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL SOURCES 

The
Company had cash and cash equivalents of 5,592,000 and 4,333,000 as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively. The Company
had restricted cash of 4,626,000 and 4,361,000 as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively. The Company had marketable
securities, net of margin due to securities brokers, of 6,648,000 and 7,266,000 as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively.
These marketable securities are short-term investments and liquid in nature. 

On
July 2, 2014, the Partnership obtained from InterGroup an unsecured loan in the principal amount of 4,250,000 at 12 per year fixed
interest, with a term of 2 years, payable interest only each month. InterGroup received a 3 loan fee. The loan may be prepaid at any
time without penalty. The loan was extended to July 31, 2023. On December 16, 2020, the Partnership and InterGroup entered into a loan
modification agreement which increased the Partnership s borrowing from InterGroup as needed up to 10,000,000. On December 31,
2021, Portsmouth and InterGroup entered into a loan modification agreement which increased Portsmouth s borrowing from InterGroup
as needed up to 16,000,000. Upon the dissolution of the Partnership in December 2021, Portsmouth assumed the Partnership s note
payable to InterGroup in the amount of 11,350,000. In July 2023, the note maturity date was extended to July 31, 2025 and the borrowing
amount available was increased to 20,000,000. The Company agreed to a 0.5 loan extension and modification fee payable to InterGroup.
In March 2024, Portsmouth and InterGroup entered into a loan modification agreement which increased Portsmouth s borrowing amount
to 30,000,000. Portsmouth agreed to a 0.5 loan modification fee for the increased borrowing of 10,000,000 payable to InterGroup. As
of June 30, 2024 the balance of the loan was 26,493,000 net of loan amortization costs of zero. As of September 30, 2024 the balance
of the loan was 26,493,000 and Portsmouth has not made any paid-downs to its note payable to InterGroup. 

Our
known short-term liquidity requirements primarily consist of funds necessary to pay for operating and other expenditures, including management
and franchise fees, corporate expenses, payroll and related costs, taxes, interest and principal payments on our outstanding indebtedness,
and repairs and maintenance at all our properties. 

Our
long-term liquidity requirements primarily consist of funds necessary to pay for scheduled debt maturities and capital improvements of
the Hotel and our real estate properties. We will continue to finance our business activities primarily with existing cash, including
from the activities described above, and cash generated from our operations. The objectives of our cash management policy are to maintain
existing leverage levels and the availability of liquidity, while minimizing operational costs. However, there can be no guarantee that
management will be successful with its plan. 

Going
Concern 

The
condensed consolidated financial statements of the Hotel have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the
realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. As discussed in Note 11 Related
Party and Other Financing Transactions, as of September 30, 2024, the outstanding balance consists of a senior mortgage loan and
mezzanine loan totaling 100,546,000 net of debt issuance costs 340,000. Both loans matured on January 1, 2024, in addition, the
Hotel has recurring losses and has an accumulated deficit of 118,974,000 which includes a 64,100,000 increase adjustment made in
December 2013 as a result of the partnership redemption. 

Due
to these factors and the uncertainty around the Hotel s ability to successfully refinance the debt on favorable terms in the current
lending environment gives rise to substantial doubt about the Hotel s ability to continue as a going concern for one year after
the financial statement issuance date. 

- 21 - 

On
January 4, 2024, the Company was made aware of a notice of default (the Notice issued by its senior loan special servicer
LNR Partners, LLC to Justice Operating Company, LLC which is the wholly owned subsidiary of Portsmouth. The Notice states that the lender
has rights as a result of such defaults, including, but not limited to, acceleration of the loans, foreclosure on collateral and other
rights and remedies under the loan documents and otherwise available under the law. On January 10, 2024, the Company filed the required
Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission. During the entire life of the outstanding debt, the Company has made all mortgage
payments timely as of the date of maturity and as of September 30, 2024, there were no delinquent amounts due to the senior or mezzanine
lenders. On April 29, 2024, the Company entered into forbearance agreements with its senior and mezzanine lenders which establishes,
among other customary terms, the new maturity date of January 1, 2025. While the Company successfully entered into the aforementioned
forbearance agreements, we continue our efforts to place a longer-term refinancing solution to its current senior mortgage and mezzanine
debt with potential lenders. As such, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain additional liquidity when needed
or under acceptable terms, if at all. 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Hotel has completed its full guest-rooms renovation over the last 2 years along with public space, fitness
center, corridors, and meeting space. The Hotel has begun to feel the impact of the renovation when it comes to average rate and RevPAR
growth since its completion. The Hotel continues to improve with the relocation of the business center into a meeting room and the space
being converted to a lounge area for guests in the lobby. On September 5, 2024, the Hotel received its annual Quality Assurance inspection
from Hilton and received the highest score at least in the Hotel s last decade at 94.45 which is an Outstanding 
ranking by Hilton. 

For
the quarter ending September 30, 2024, the Hotel achieved a RevPAR index of 145 while increasing the ADR index to 90 . The Hotel s year-to-date
RevPAR index is 118 . For the quarter ending September 30, 2024, the Hotel gained RevPAR year over year by 5.7 while its Comp Set was
-18.5 . The renovation has allowed the Hotel to be more competitive in a recovering market and push rates when demand allows it. The
Financial District hotels continue to outperform the market with the area showing positive year-over-year RevPAR growth compared to the
rest of the greater San Francisco market showing declines. 

The
condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to the carrying amounts of assets, liabilities, and
reported expenses that may be necessary if the Hotel were unable to continue as a going concern.

IMPACT
OF INFLATION 

Hotel
room rates are typically impacted by supply and demand factors, not inflation, since rental of a hotel room is usually for a limited
number of nights. Room rates can be, and usually are, adjusted to account for inflationary cost increases. Since Aimbridge has the power
and ability under the terms of its management agreement to adjust Hotel room rates on an ongoing basis, there should be minimal impact
on partnership revenues due to inflation. For the two most recent fiscal years, the impact of inflation on the Company s income
is not viewed by management as material. 

The
Company s residential rental properties provide income from short-term operating leases and no lease extends beyond one year. Rental
increases are expected to offset anticipated increased property operating expenses.

CRITICAL
ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND USE OF ESTIMATES 

Critical
accounting policies are those that are most significant to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require
judgments by management in order to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. The preparation of these
financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements.
We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis, including those related to the consolidation of our subsidiaries, to our revenues, allowances
for bad debts, accruals, asset impairments, other investments, income taxes and commitments and contingencies. We base our estimates
on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which
form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. The actual results may differ from these estimates
or our estimates may be affected by different assumptions or conditions. There have been no material changes to the Company s critical
accounting policies during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 

INCOME
TAXES 

Judgment
is required in addressing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or
tax returns (e.g., realization of deferred tax assets, changes in tax laws, or interpretations thereof). In addition, we are subject
to examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities. A change in the assessment of the outcomes of such matters
could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. We evaluate tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return
to determine whether they are more likely than not of being sustained, assuming that the tax reporting positions will be examined by
taxing authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information, prior to recording the related tax benefit in our consolidated financial
statements. If a position does not meet the more likely than not standard, the benefit cannot be recognized. Assumptions, judgment, and
the use of estimates are required in determining if the more likely than not standard has been met when developing the
provision for income taxes. A change in the assessment of the more likely than not standard with respect to a position
could materially impact our condensed consolidated financial statements. 

DEFERRED
INCOME TAXES VALUATION ALLOWANCE 

We
assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets quarterly and recognize a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that
some or all of our deferred tax assets are not realizable. This assessment is completed by tax jurisdiction and relies on the weight
of both positive and negative evidence available, with significant weight placed on recent financial results. Cumulative pre-tax losses
for the three-year period are considered significant objective negative evidence that some or all of our deferred tax assets may not
be realizable. Cumulative reported pre-tax income is considered objectively verifiable positive evidence of our ability to generate positive
pre-tax income in the future. In accordance with GAAP, when there is a recent history of pre-tax losses, there is little or no weight
placed on forecasts for purposes of assessing the recoverability of our deferred tax assets. When necessary, we use systematic and logical
methods to estimate when deferred tax liabilities will reverse and generate taxable income and when deferred tax assets will reverse
and generate tax deductions. Assumptions, judgment, and the use of estimates are required when scheduling the reversal of deferred tax
assets and liabilities, and the exercise is inherently complex and subjective. However, significant judgment will be required to determine
the timing and amount of any reversal of the valuation allowance in future periods. 

HOTEL
ASSETS AND DEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS 

We
evaluate property and equipment, and definite-lived intangible assets for impairment quarterly, and when events or circumstances indicate
the carrying value may not be recoverable, we evaluate the net book value of the assets by comparing to the projected undiscounted cash
flows of the assets. We use judgment to determine whether indications of impairment exist and consider our knowledge of the hospitality
industry, historical experience, location of the property, market conditions, and property-specific information available at the time
of the assessment. The results of our analysis could vary from period to period depending on how our judgment is applied and the facts
and circumstances available at the time of the analysis. When an indicator of impairment exists, judgment is also required in determining
the assumptions and estimates to use within the recoverability analysis and when calculating the fair value of the asset or asset group,
if applicable. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting the judgments used could result in impairments to our long-lived
assets in future periods. Historically, changes in estimates used in the property and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets
impairment assessment process have not resulted in material impairment charges in subsequent periods as a result of changes made to those
estimates. There were no indicators of impairment on its hotel investments or intangible assets and accordingly no impairment losses
recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

- 23 - 

STOCK-BASED
COMPENSATION 

We
account for stock-based compensation by measuring and recognizing as compensation expense the fair value of all share-based payment awards
made to employees, including employee stock options, restricted stock awards and employee stock purchases related to the Employee Stock
Purchase Plan, or ESPP, based on estimated grant date fair values. The determination of fair value involves a number of significant estimates.
We use the Black Scholes option pricing model to estimate the value of employee stock options which requires a number of assumptions
to determine the model inputs. These include the expected volatility of our stock and employee exercise behavior which are based on historical
data as well as expectations of future developments over the term of the options. 

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

We
are a smaller reporting company and therefore, we are not required to provide information required by this Item of Form 10-Q. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures. 

EVALUATION
OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

The
Company s management, with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, has
evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under
the Exchange Act) as of the end of the quarterly period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based upon their evaluation, our
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were not effective because of a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting.
A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there
is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented
or detected on a timely basis. Specifically, the Company s management has concluded that our control around the interpretation
and accounting for the stock-based compensation was not effectively designed or maintained. In light of this material weakness, we performed
additional analysis as deemed necessary to ensure that our financial statements were prepared in accordance with GAAP. Accordingly, management
believes that the financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q present fairly in all material respects our financial
position, results of operations and cash flows for the period presented. 

CHANGES
IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 

There
have been no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the last quarterly period covered by this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal
control over financial reporting.

 OTHER
INFORMATION 

Item
1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

Portsmouth
Square, Inc., through its operating company Justice Investors Operating Company, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the Company ),
is the owner of the real property located at 750 Kearny Street in San Francisco, currently improved with a 27 story building
which houses a Hilton Hotel (the Property ). The Property was purchased and improved pursuant to a series of agreements
with the City and County of San Francisco (the City in the early 1970 s. The terms of the agreements and subsequent
approvals and permits included a condition by which the Company was required to construct an ornamental overhead pedestrian bridge across
Kearny Street, connecting the Property to a nearby City park and underground parking garage known as Portsmouth Square (the Bridge ).
Included in the approval process was the City s issuance of a Major Encroachment Permit Permit allowing the Bridge
to span over Kearney Street. As of May 24, 2022, the City has purported to revoke the Permit and on June 13, 2022, directed the Company
to submit a general bridge removal and restoration plan (the Plan at the Company s expense. The Company disputes
the legality of the purported revocation of the Permit. The Company further disputes the existence of any legal or contractual obligation
to remove the Bridge at its expense. In particular, representatives of the Company participated in meetings with the City on and at various
times after August 1, 2019, to discuss a collaborative process for the possible removal of the Bridge. Until the purported revocation
of the Permit in 2022, the City representatives repeatedly and consistently promised and agreed that the City will pay for the associated
costs of any Bridge removal. Nevertheless, without waiving any rights, in an effort to understand all of the available options, and to
provide a response to the City s directives, the Company has engaged a Project Manager, a structural engineering firm and an architect
to advise on the development of a Plan for the Bridge removal, as well as the reconstruction of the front of the Hilton Hotel. In that
regard, the Company has been working cooperatively with the City on the process for removal of the Bridge and its related physical encroachments,
including obtaining regulatory approvals and necessary permits. The Company is currently in discussion with the City regarding both the
process and financial responsibility for the implementation of the Plan and reconstruction of the impacted portions of the Hotel. Those
discussions are expected to continue at least through the end of 2024. A final Plan is currently not expected to be completed until late
2024, and permits are unlikely to be obtained until early 2025 at the earliest. 

The
Company may be subject to legal proceedings, claims, and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. The Company will defend
itself vigorously against any such claims. Management does not believe that the impact of such matters will have a material effect on
the financial conditions or result of operations when resolved.
