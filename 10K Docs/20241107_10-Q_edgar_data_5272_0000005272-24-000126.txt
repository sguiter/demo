 SEGMENT RESULTS 
 We evaluate segment performance based on adjusted revenues and adjusted pre-tax income (loss). Adjusted revenues and adjusted pre-tax income (loss) are derived by excluding certain items from total revenues and income (loss) from continuing operations before income tax expense (pre-tax income (loss)), respectively. These items generally fall into one or more of the following broad categories: legacy matters having no relevance to our current businesses or operating performance; adjustments to enhance transparency to the underlying economics of transactions; and measures that we believe to be common to the industry. Legal entities are attributed to each segment based upon the predominance of activity in that legal entity. For the items excluded from adjusted revenues and adjusted pre-tax income (loss), see the table below.

 Transfers of Level 3 Assets 
 There were no transfers into Level 3 assets during the three months ended September 30, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, transfers into Level 3 assets primarily included certain investments in private placement corporate debt, commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS), residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS), collateralized loan obligations (CLO)/asset-backed securities (ABS) and equity securities. Transfers of private placement corporate debt and certain ABS into Level 3 assets were primarily the result of limited market pricing information that required us to determine fair value for these securities based on inputs that are adjusted to better reflect our own assumptions regarding the characteristics of a specific security or associated market liquidity. The transfers of investments in CMBS, RMBS, CLO and certain ABS into Level 3 assets were due to diminished market transparency and liquidity for individual security types. 
 There were no transfers out of Level 3 assets during the three months ended September 30, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, transfers out of Level 3 assets primarily included certain investments in private placement corporate debt, CMBS, RMBS, CLO/ABS, municipal bonds and equity securities. Transfers of private placement corporate debt out of Level 3 assets were based on consideration of market liquidity as well as related transparency of pricing and associated observable inputs for these investments. Transfers of certain investments in private placement corporate debt out of Level 3 assets were primarily the result of using observable pricing information that reflects the fair value of those securities without the need for adjustment based on our own assumptions regarding the characteristics of a specific security or the current liquidity in the market. 
 Transfers of Level 3 Liabilities 
 There were no significant transfers of derivative or other liabilities into or out of Level 3 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

 (a) Information received from third-party valuation service providers. The ranges of the unobservable inputs for constant prepayment rate, loss severity and constant default rate relate to each of the individual underlying mortgage loans that comprise the entire portfolio of securities in the RMBS and CLO securitization vehicles and not necessarily to the securitization vehicle bonds (tranches) purchased by us. The ranges of these inputs do not directly correlate to changes in the fair values of the tranches purchased by us, because there are other factors relevant to the fair values of specific tranches owned by us including, but not limited to, purchase price, position in the waterfall, senior versus subordinated position and attachment points. 
 (b) Represents discount rates, estimates and assumptions that we believe would be used by market participants when valuing these assets and liabilities. 
 
 The ranges of reported inputs for Obligations of states, municipalities and political subdivisions, Corporate debt, RMBS, CLO/ABS, and CMBS valued using a discounted cash flow technique consist of one standard deviation in either direction from the value weighted average. The preceding table does not give effect to our risk management practices that might offset risks inherent in these Level 3 assets and liabilities. 
 Interrelationships Between Unobservable Inputs 
 We consider unobservable inputs to be those for which market data is not available and that are developed using the best information available to us about the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. Relevant inputs vary depending on the nature of the instrument being measured at fair value. The following paragraphs provide a general description of significant unobservable inputs along with interrelationships between and among the significant unobservable inputs and their impact on the fair value measurements. In practice, simultaneous changes in assumptions may not always have a linear effect on the inputs discussed below. Interrelationships may also exist between observable and unobservable inputs. Such relationships have not been included in the discussion below. For each of the individual relationships described below, the inverse relationship would also generally apply. 
 Fixed Maturity Securities 
 The significant unobservable input used in the fair value measurement of fixed maturity securities is yield. The yield is affected by the market movements in credit spreads and U.S. Treasury yields. The yield may be affected by other factors including constant prepayment rates, loss severity, and constant default rates. In general, increases in the yield would decrease the fair value of investments, and conversely, decreases in the yield would increase the fair value of investments.

 At September 30, 2024, we held individual fixed maturity securities that were in an unrealized loss position and for which no allowance for credit losses has been recorded (including individual fixed maturity securities that were in a continuous unrealized loss position for 12 months or more). At December 31, 2023, we held individual fixed maturity securities that were in an unrealized loss position and for which no allowance for credit losses has been recorded (including individual fixed maturity securities that were in a continuous unrealized loss position for 12 months or more). We did not recognize the unrealized losses in earnings on these fixed maturity securities at September 30, 2024 because it was determined that such losses were due to non-credit factors. Additionally, we neither intend to sell the securities nor do we believe that it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell these securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis. For fixed maturity securities with significant declines, we performed fundamental credit analyses on a security-by-security basis, which included consideration of credit enhancements, liquidity position, expected defaults, industry and sector analysis, forecasts and available market data.

 Interest income is not accrued when payment of contractual principal and interest is not expected. Any cash received on impaired loans is generally recorded as a reduction of the current carrying amount of the loan. Accrual of interest income is generally resumed when delinquent contractual principal and interest is repaid or when a portion of the delinquent contractual payments are made and the ongoing required contractual payments have been made for an appropriate period. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, million and million, respectively, of commercial mortgage loans were placed on nonaccrual status. 
 Accrued interest is presented separately and is included in Accrued investment income on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, accrued interest receivable was million and million, respectively, associated with commercial mortgage loans. 
 A significant majority of commercial mortgages in the portfolio are non-recourse loans and, accordingly, the only guarantees are for specific items that are exceptions to the non-recourse provisions. It is therefore extremely rare for us to have cause to enforce the provisions of a guarantee on a commercial real estate or mortgage loan. 
 Nonperforming loans are generally those loans where payment of contractual principal or interest is more than 90 days past due. Nonperforming loans were not significant for any of the periods presented.

 COLLATERAL 
 We engage in derivative transactions that are not subject to a clearing requirement directly with unaffiliated third parties, in most cases, under International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (ISDA) Master Agreements. Many of the ISDA Master Agreements also include Credit Support Annex provisions, which provide for collateral postings that may vary at various ratings and threshold levels. We attempt to reduce our risk with certain counterparties by entering into agreements that enable collateral to be obtained from a counterparty on an upfront or contingent basis. We minimize the risk that counterparties might be unable to fulfill their contractual obligations by monitoring counterparty credit exposure and collateral value and generally requiring additional collateral to be posted upon the occurrence of certain events or circumstances. In addition, certain derivative transactions have provisions that require collateral to be posted by us upon a downgrade of our long-term debt ratings or give the counterparty the right to terminate the

million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. In the case of collateral posted under derivative transactions that are not subject to clearing, this collateral can generally be repledged or resold by the counterparties. Collateral provided to us from third parties for derivative transactions was million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. In the case of collateral provided to us under derivative transactions that are not subject to clearing, we generally can repledge or resell collateral. 
 OFFSETTING 
 We have elected to present all derivative receivables and derivative payables, and the related cash collateral received and paid, on a net basis on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets when a legally enforceable ISDA Master Agreement exists between us and our derivative counterparty. An ISDA Master Agreement is an agreement governing multiple derivative transactions between two counterparties. The ISDA Master Agreement generally provides for the net settlement of all, or a specified group, of these derivative transactions, as well as transferred collateral, through a single payment, and in a single currency, as applicable. The net settlement provisions apply in the event of a default on, or affecting any, one derivative transaction or a termination event affecting all, or a specified group of, derivative transactions governed by the ISDA Master Agreement. 
 HEDGE ACCOUNTING 
 We designated certain derivatives entered into with third parties as fair value hedges of available for sale investment securities held by our insurance subsidiaries. The fair value hedges include foreign currency forwards and cross currency swaps designated as hedges of the change in fair value of foreign currency denominated available for sale securities attributable to changes in foreign exchange rates. 
 We use foreign currency denominated debt and cross-currency swaps as hedging instruments in net investment hedge relationships to mitigate the foreign exchange risk associated with our non-U.S. dollar functional currency foreign subsidiaries. For net investment hedge relationships where issued debt is used as a hedging instrument, we assess the hedge effectiveness and measure the amount of ineffectiveness based on changes in spot rates. For net investment hedge relationships that use derivatives as hedging instruments, we assess hedge effectiveness and measure hedge ineffectiveness using changes in forward rates. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized gains (losses) of ) million and ) million, respectively, and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized gains (losses) of million and million, respectively, included in Change in foreign currency translation adjustments in OCI related to the net investment hedge relationships.

 CREDIT RISK-RELATED CONTINGENT FEATURES 
 We estimate that at September 30, 2024, based on our outstanding financial derivative transactions, a downgrade of our long-term senior debt ratings to BBB or BBB by Standard Poor s Financial Services LLC, a subsidiary of S P Global Inc., and/or a downgrade to Baa2 or Baa3 by Moody s Investors Service, Inc. would permit counterparties to make additional collateral calls and permit certain counterparties to elect early termination of contracts, resulting in corresponding collateral postings and termination payments in the total amount of up to approximately million. The aggregate fair value of our derivatives that were in a net liability position and that contain such credit risk-related contingencies which can be triggered below our long-term senior debt ratings of BBB+ or Baa1 was approximately million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The aggregate fair value of assets posted as collateral under these contracts at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, was approximately million and million, respectively. 
 HYBRID SECURITIES WITH EMBEDDED CREDIT DERIVATIVES 
 We invest in hybrid securities (such as credit-linked notes) with the intent of generating income and not specifically to acquire exposure to embedded derivative risk. As is the case with our other investments in RMBS, CMBS, CLO and ABS, our investments in these hybrid securities are exposed to losses only up to the amount of our initial investment in the hybrid security. Other than our initial investment in the hybrid securities, we have no further obligation to make payments on the embedded credit derivatives in the related hybrid securities.

Our gross loss reserves before reinsurance and discount are net of contractual deductible recoverable amounts due from policyholders of approximately billion and billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. These recoverable amounts are related to certain policies with high deductibles (in excess of high dollar amounts retained by the insured through self-insured retentions, deductibles, retrospective programs, or captive arrangements, each referred to generically as deductibles ), primarily for U.S. Commercial casualty business. With respect to the deductible portion of the claim, we manage and pay the entire claim on behalf of the insured and are reimbursed by the insured for the deductible portion of the claim. Thus, these recoverable amounts represent a credit exposure to us. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 we held collateral of approximately billion and billion, respectively, for these deductible recoverable amounts, consisting primarily of letters of credit and funded trust agreements. Allowance for credit losses for the unsecured portion of these recoverable amounts was million at both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

At NICO s percent share, NICO s limit of liability under the contract is billion. We account for this transaction as retroactive reinsurance. We paid total consideration, including interest, of billion. The consideration was placed into a collateral trust account as security for NICO s claim payment obligations, and Berkshire has provided a parental guarantee to secure the obligations of NICO under the agreement. 
 Prior Year Development 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized unfavorable prior year loss reserve development of million which does not reflect the benefit of recoveries under a retroactive adverse development cover, and excludes discount and amortization of deferred gain. The development in this period was largely driven by adverse development in U.S. Excess Casualty and UK/Europe Casualty and Financial Lines, offset by favorable development in Global Specialty and U.S. Property and Special Risks. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized unfavorable prior year loss reserve development of million excluding discount and amortization of deferred gain. The development in this period was largely driven by adverse development in U.S. Excess Casualty and UK/Europe Casualty and Financial Lines, offset by favorable development in Global Specialty, U.S. Property and Special Risks and on our loss sensitive U.S. Workers' Compensation business. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized favorable prior year loss reserve development of million excluding discount and amortization of deferred gain. The development in this period was largely driven by favorable development on our U.S. Workers' Compensation business, International Financial Lines in all regions except UK, which was adverse, and Japan Personal Insurance partially offset by unfavorable development on UK/Europe Casualty. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized favorable prior year loss reserve development of million excluding discount and amortization of deferred gain. The development in this period was largely driven by favorable development on our U.S. Workers' Compensation business, U.S. Other Casualty and Other Product Lines, partially offset by unfavorable development on UK/Europe Casualty and UK Financial Lines. 
 Discounting of Loss Reserves 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the loss reserves reflect a net loss reserve discount of billion and billion, respectively, including tabular and non-tabular calculations based upon the following assumptions: 
 The non-tabular workers compensation discount is calculated separately for companies domiciled in New York, Pennsylvania and Delaware, and follows the statutory regulations (prescribed or permitted) for each state. 
 For New York companies, the discount is based on a percent interest rate and the companies own payout patterns. 
 The Pennsylvania and Delaware regulators approved use of a consistent benchmark discount rate and spread (U.S. Treasury rate plus a liquidity premium) to all of our workers compensation reserves in our Pennsylvania domiciled and Delaware domiciled companies, as well as our use of updated payout patterns specific to our primary and excess workers compensation portfolios. In 2020, the regulators also approved that the discount rate will be updated on an annual basis. 
 The tabular workers compensation discount is calculated based on the mortality rate used in the 2007 U.S. Life table and interest rates prescribed or permitted by each state (i.e. New York is based on percent interest rate and Pennsylvania and Delaware are based on U.S. Treasury rate plus a liquidity premium). In the case that applying this tabular discount factor to our nominal reserves produces a tabular discount that is greater than the indemnity portion of our case reserves, the tabular discount is capped at our estimate of the indemnity portion of our cases reserves percent). 
 The discount for asbestos reserves has been fully accreted. 
 At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the discount consists of million and million of tabular discount, respectively, and million and million of non-tabular discount for workers compensation, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the benefit / (charge) from changes in discount of ) million and ) million, respectively, were recorded as part of Policyholder benefits and losses incurred in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss).

 GUARANTEES 
 Subsidiaries 
 We have issued unconditional guarantees with respect to the prompt payment, when due, of all present and future payment obligations and liabilities of AIGFP and certain of its subsidiaries. We have also issued guarantees of all present and future payment obligations and liabilities of AIG Markets, Inc. 
 Due to the deconsolidation of AIGFP and its subsidiaries, as of September 30, 2024, a million guarantee related to the obligations of AIGFP and certain of its subsidiaries was recognized, and is reported in Other liabilities. 
 We continue to guarantee certain policyholder contracts issued by Corebridge subsidiaries as well as certain debt issued by Corebridge Life Holdings, Inc. (CRBGLH). Pursuant to the Separation Agreement entered in by AIG and Corebridge on September 14, 2022, Corebridge must indemnify, defend and hold us harmless from and against any liability related to these guarantees. Also, under a collateral agreement, in the event of: (i) a ratings downgrade of Corebridge or the guaranteed debt below specified levels or (ii) the failure by CRBGLH to pay principal and interest on the guaranteed debt when due, Corebridge must collateralize an amount equal to

percent of the principal amount outstanding, (ii) accrued and unpaid interest and (iii) percent of the net present value of scheduled interest payments through the maturity dates of the debt. 
 Business and Asset Dispositions 
 We are subject to financial guarantees and indemnity arrangements in connection with the completed sales of businesses and assets. The various arrangements may be triggered by, among other things, declines in asset values, the occurrence of specified business contingencies, the realization of contingent liabilities, developments in litigation or breaches of representations, warranties or covenants provided by us. These arrangements are typically subject to various time limitations, defined by the contract or by operation of law, such as statutes of limitation. In some cases, the maximum potential obligation is subject to contractual limitations, while in other cases such limitations are not specified or are not applicable. 
 We are unable to develop a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential payout under certain of these arrangements. Overall, we believe the likelihood that we will have to make any material payments related to completed sales under these arrangements is remote, and no material liabilities related to these arrangements have been recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

After factoring in multiple data points and assessing the relative weight of all positive and negative evidence, we concluded that a valuation allowance of million should remain on a portion of AIG's U.S. federal consolidated income tax group tax attribute carryforwards that are not more likely than not to be realized. Accordingly, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded no change in valuation allowance. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, recent changes in market conditions, including changes in interest rates, impacted the unrealized tax gains and losses in the available for sale securities portfolios of our general insurance and non-insurance companies, resulting in a decrease to deferred tax assets related to net unrealized tax capital losses. The deferred tax assets relate to the unrealized tax capital losses for which the carryforward period has not yet begun. As of September 30, 2024, based on all available evidence, we concluded that a valuation allowance of million is necessary on a portion of the deferred tax assets related to unrealized tax capital losses that are not more-likely-than-not to be realized. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded a decrease in valuation allowance of million and million, respectively, associated with the unrealized tax capital losses in AIG's available for sale securities portfolio. The valuation allowance decrease was allocated to other comprehensive income. 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recognized a net million decrease in deferred tax asset valuation allowance associated with certain foreign jurisdictions. 
 
 billion. At both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the amounts of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would favorably affect the effective tax rate were billion. Unrecognized tax benefits that would not affect the effective tax rate generally relate to such factors as the timing, rather than the permissibility of the deduction. 
 Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized in income tax expense. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had accrued liabilities of million and million, respectively, for the payment of interest (net of the federal benefit) and penalties. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, we accrued expense of million and benefit of million, respectively, for the payment of interest and penalties.

 ITEM 2 | Use of Non-GAAP Measures 

Use of Non-GAAP Measures 
 Throughout this MD A, we present our financial condition and results of operations in the way we believe will be most meaningful and representative of our business results. Some of the measurements we use are non-GAAP financial measures under SEC rules and regulations. GAAP is the acronym for generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The non-GAAP financial measures we present may not be comparable to similarly-named measures reported by other companies. 
 We use the following operating performance measures because we believe they enhance the understanding of the underlying profitability of continuing operations and trends of our business segments. We believe they also allow for more meaningful comparisons with our insurance competitors. When we use these measures, reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measure are provided on a consolidated basis in the Consolidated Results of Operations section of this MD A. 
 Book value per share, excluding investments related cumulative unrealized gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI) adjusted for the cumulative unrealized gains and losses related to Fortitude Re funds withheld assets (collectively, Investments AOCI) (Adjusted book value per share) is used to show the amount of our net worth on a per share basis after eliminating the fair value of investments that can fluctuate significantly from period to period due to changes in market conditions. In addition, we adjusted for the cumulative unrealized gains and losses related to Fortitude Re funds withheld assets held by AIG in support of Fortitude Re s reinsurance obligations to AIG (Fortitude Re funds withheld assets) since these fair value movements are economically transferred to Fortitude Re. Adjusted book value per share is derived by dividing total AIG common shareholders equity, excluding Investments AOCI (AIG adjusted common equity) by total common shares outstanding. 
 Book Value per share, excluding Goodwill, Value of business acquired (VOBA), Value of distribution channel acquired (VODA) and Other intangible assets (Tangible book value per share) is used to provide a useful measure of the realizable shareholder value on a per share basis. Tangible book value per share is derived by dividing Total AIG common shareholders equity, excluding intangible assets (AIG tangible common shareholders equity) by total common shares outstanding. 
 Book value per share, excluding Investments AOCI, deferred tax assets (DTA) and AIG s ownership interest in Corebridge (Core operating book value per share) is used to show the amount of our net worth on a per share basis after eliminating Investments AOCI, DTA and AIG s ownership interest in Corebridge. We believe this measure is useful to investors because it eliminates fair value of investments that can fluctuate significantly from period to period due to changes in market conditions. We also exclude only the portion of DTA representing U.S. tax attributes related to net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs) and corporate alternative minimum tax credits (CAMTCs) and foreign tax credits (FTCs) that have not yet been utilized. Amounts for interim periods are estimates based on projections of full-year attribute utilization. As NOLs, CAMTCs and FTCs are utilized, the portion of the DTA utilized is included. We exclude AIG s ownership interest in Corebridge since it is not a core long-term investment for AIG. Core operating book value per share is derived by dividing total AIG common shareholders equity, excluding Investments AOCI, DTA and AIG s ownership interest in Corebridge (AIG core operating shareholders equity) by total common shares outstanding. 
 Return on equity Adjusted after-tax income excluding Investments AOCI (Adjusted return on equity) is used to show the rate of return on common shareholders equity excluding Investments AOCI. We believe this measure is useful to investors because it eliminates fair value of investments which can fluctuate significantly from period to period due to changes in market conditions. Adjusted return on equity is derived by dividing actual or, for interim periods, annualized adjusted after-tax income attributable to AIG common shareholders by average AIG adjusted common shareholders equity. 
 Return on Equity Adjusted After-tax Income, Excluding Goodwill, VOBA, VODA and Other Intangible assets (Return on tangible equity) is used to show the return on AIG tangible common shareholder s equity, which we believe is a useful measure of realizable shareholder value. We exclude Goodwill, VOBA, VODA and Other intangible assets from AIG common shareholders equity to derive AIG tangible common shareholders equity. Return on AIG tangible common equity is derived by dividing actual or, for interim periods, annualized adjusted after-tax income attributable to AIG common shareholders by average AIG tangible common equity. 
 Return on equity Adjusted after-tax income excluding Investments AOCI, DTA and AIG s ownership interest in Corebridge (Core operating return on equity) is used to show the rate of return on common shareholders equity excluding Investments AOCI, DTA and AIG s ownership interest in Corebridge. We believe this measure is useful to investors because it eliminates fair value of investments that can fluctuate significantly from period to period due to changes in market conditions. We also exclude only the portion of DTA representing U.S. tax attributes related to NOLs and CAMTCs and FTCs that have not yet been utilized. Amounts for interim periods are estimates based on projections of full-year attribute utilization. As NOLs, CAMTCs and FTCs are utilized, the portion of the DTA utilized is included. We exclude AIG s ownership interest in Corebridge since it is not a core long-term investment for AIG. This metric will provide greater insight as to the underlying profitability of our property and casualty business. Core operating return on equity is derived by dividing actual or, for interim periods, annualized adjusted after-tax income attributable to AIG common shareholders by average AIG core operating shareholders equity.

 ITEM 2 | Use of Non-GAAP Measures 

Adjusted revenues exclude Net realized gains (losses), income from non-operating litigation settlements (included in Other income for GAAP purposes) and income from elimination of the international reporting lag. Adjusted revenues is a GAAP measure for our segments. 
 Adjusted pre-tax income is derived by excluding the items set forth below from income from continuing operations before income tax. This definition is consistent across our segments. These items generally fall into one or more of the following broad categories: legacy matters having no relevance to our current businesses or operating performance; adjustments to enhance transparency to the underlying economics of transactions; and measures that we believe to be common to the industry. APTI is a GAAP measure for our segments. Excluded items include the following: 
 changes in the fair values of equity securities and AIG's ownership interest in Corebridge; 
 net investment income on Fortitude Re funds withheld assets; 
 net realized gains and losses on Fortitude Re funds withheld assets; 
 loss (gain) on extinguishment of debt; 
 all net realized gains and losses except earned income (periodic settlements and changes in settlement accruals) on derivative instruments used for non-qualifying (economic) hedging or for asset replication. Earned income on such economic hedges is reclassified from net realized gains and losses to specific APTI line items based on the economic risk being hedged (e.g. net investment income); 
 income or loss from discontinued operations; 
 net loss reserve discount benefit (charge); 
 pension expense related to lump sum payments to former employees; 

net gain or loss on divestitures and other; 
 non-operating litigation reserves and settlements; 
 restructuring and other costs related to initiatives designed to reduce operating expenses, improve efficiency and simplify our organization; 
 the portion of favorable or unfavorable prior year reserve development for which we have ceded the risk under retroactive reinsurance agreements and related changes in amortization of the deferred gain; 
 integration and transaction costs associated with acquiring or divesting businesses; 
 losses from the impairment of goodwill; 
 non-recurring costs associated with the implementation of non-ordinary course legal or regulatory changes or changes to accounting principles; and 
 income from elimination of the international reporting lag. 

Adjusted after-tax income attributable to AIG common shareholders is derived by excluding the tax effected adjusted pre-tax income (APTI) adjustments described above, dividends on preferred stock and preferred stock redemption premiums, noncontrolling interest on net realized gains (losses), other non-operating expenses and the following tax items from net income attributable to AIG: 
 deferred income tax valuation allowance releases and charges; 
 changes in uncertain tax positions and other tax items related to legacy matters having no relevance to our current businesses or operating performance; and 
 net tax charge related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. 
 Ratios: We, along with most property and casualty insurance companies, use the loss ratio, the expense ratio and the combined ratio as measures of underwriting performance. These ratios are relative measurements that describe, for every 100 of net premiums earned, the amount of losses and loss adjustment expenses (which for General Insurance excludes net loss reserve discount), and the amount of other underwriting expenses that would be incurred. A combined ratio of less than 100 indicates underwriting income and a combined ratio of over 100 indicates an underwriting loss. Our ratios are calculated using the relevant segment information calculated under GAAP, and thus may not be comparable to similar ratios calculated for regulatory reporting purposes. The underwriting environment varies across countries and products, as does the degree of litigation activity, all of which affect such ratios. In addition, investment returns, local taxes, cost of capital, regulation, product type and competition can have an effect on pricing and consequently on profitability as reflected in underwriting income and associated ratios. 
 Accident year loss and accident year combined ratios, as adjusted (Accident year loss ratio, ex-CATs and Accident year combined ratio, ex-CATs): both the accident year loss and accident year combined ratios, as adjusted, exclude catastrophe losses and related reinstatement premiums, prior year development, net of premium adjustments, and the impact of reserve discounting. Natural catastrophe losses are generally weather or seismic events, in each case, having a net impact on AIG in excess of 10 million and man-made catastrophe losses, such as terrorism and civil disorders that exceed the 10 million threshold. We believe that as adjusted ratios are meaningful measures of our underwriting results on an ongoing basis as they exclude catastrophes and the impact of reserve discounting which are outside of management s control. We also exclude prior year development to provide transparency related to current accident year results. 
 Results from discontinued operations, including Corebridge, are excluded from all of these measures.

 ITEM 2 | Critical Accounting Estimates 

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the application of accounting policies that often involve a significant degree of judgment. 
 The accounting policies that we believe are most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions, which are critical accounting estimates, are related to the determination of: 
 loss reserves; 
 reinsurance assets, including the allowance for credit losses and disputes; 
 goodwill impairment; 
 allowance for credit losses on certain investments, primarily on loans and available for sale fixed maturity securities; 
 fair value measurements of certain financial assets and financial liabilities; and 
 income taxes, in particular the recoverability of our deferred tax asset and establishment of provisions for uncertain tax positions. 
 
 These accounting estimates require the use of assumptions about matters, some of which are highly uncertain at the time of estimation. To the extent actual experience differs from the assumptions used, our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially affected. 
 Certain critical accounting estimates were eliminated as a result of the Corebridge deconsolidation. There were no changes to the remaining critical accounting estimates. For further details, see Note 4 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 For a detailed discussion of our critical accounting estimates, see Part II, Item 7. MD A Critical Accounting Estimates in the 2023 Annual Report. 

Executive Summary 
 
 OVERVIEW 
 This overview of the MD A highlights selected information and may not contain all of the information that is important to current or potential investors in our securities. You should read this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, together with the 2023 Annual Report, in their entirety for a more detailed description of events, trends, uncertainties, risks and critical accounting estimates affecting us. 
 
 OPERATING STRUCTURE 
 
 In September 2022, AIG closed on the initial public offering of Corebridge. Since September 2022 and through June 9, 2024, AIG sold portions of its interests in Corebridge through secondary public offerings. On June 9, 2024, AIG held 48.4 percent of Corebridge common stock, waived its right to majority representation on the Corebridge Board of Directors and one of AIG's designees resigned from the Corebridge Board of Directors as of June 9, 2024 (the Deconsolidation Date). As a result, AIG met the requirements for the deconsolidation of Corebridge. The historical financial results of Corebridge, for all periods presented, are reflected in these Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as discontinued operations. 
 Due to share repurchases by Corebridge and sale of shares by AIG after the Deconsolidation Date, as of September 30, 2024, AIG held 48.6 percent of the outstanding common stock of Corebridge. 
 As a result of the Corebridge deconsolidation, we no longer present a Life and Retirement segment and no longer include asset management and Corebridge Life Holdings, Inc. interest and general expenses within the Other Operations segment. Historical results of Other Operations have been revised to reflect these changes. Previously reported results for the General Insurance segment were not impacted by the deconsolidation of Corebridge. As of September 30, 2024, AIG reports the results of its businesses through two segments General Insurance and Other Operations. General Insurance consists of two operating segments North America and International. Other Operations is primarily comprised of corporate and consolidation and eliminations.

REGULATORY, INDUSTRY AND ECONOMIC FACTORS 
 Regulatory Environment 
 Our operations around the world are subject to regulation by many different types of regulatory authorities, including insurance and securities in the United States and abroad. The insurance and financial services industries are generally subject to close regulatory scrutiny and supervision. 
 For example, on March 6, 2024, the SEC adopted its climate-related disclosure rules, which require registrants to provide detailed climate-related disclosures in registration statements and periodic reports, but the rules have been stayed pending the completion of judicial review. Other jurisdictions in which we operate, including the European Union, have adopted or are considering similar (and in some cases more stringent) climate- and sustainability-related reporting requirements, including through the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive. In addition, the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive imposes due diligence requirements for identifying and mitigating potential environmental and human rights impacts of covered entities and their value chains, along with requirements to adopt and disclose a climate transition plan. 
 In the European Union, the EU Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) will require covered entities, including insurance intermediaries, reinsurance intermediaries and ancillary insurance intermediaries, other than micro-, small, or medium enterprises, to comply with a wide range of organizational and technical requirements to identify, manage and mitigate operational risk arising from use of network and information systems and, in particular, the use of third party information and communication technology service providers. Covered entities will be required to comply with DORA by January 2025. 
 Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation and supervision by the states and jurisdictions in which they do business. We expect that the domestic and international regulations applicable to us and our regulated entities will continue to evolve for the foreseeable future. 
 For information regarding our regulation and supervision by different regulatory authorities in the United States and abroad, see Part I, Item 1. Business Regulation and Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors Regulation in the 2023 Annual Report and Note 16 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

 ITEM 2 | Executive Summary 

Impact of Changes in the Interest Rate E nvironment 
 Certain U.S. benchmark rates continued to fluctuate in 2024 as markets reacted to change in inflation trends, geopolitical risk and the decisions of the Board of Federal Reserve System. Our Net investment income is impacted by market interest rates as well as the deployment of asset allocation strategies to enhance yield, manage duration and interest rate risk. The change in interest rates and credit spreads impact our ability to reinvest future cash flows at rates equal or greater than the rates on sales and maturities. For additional information on our investment and asset-liability management strategies, see Investments. 
 Impact of Currency Volatility 
 Currency volatility remains acute. Strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Euro, British pound and the Japanese yen (the Major Currencies) impacts income for our businesses with substantial international operations. In particular, growth trends in net premiums written reported in U.S. dollars can differ significantly from those measured in original currencies. The net effect on underwriting results, however, is significantly mitigated, as both revenues and expenses are similarly affected. 
 These currencies may continue to fluctuate, especially as a result of central bank responses to inflation, concerns regarding future economic growth and other macroeconomic factors, and such fluctuations will affect net premiums written growth trends reported in U.S. dollars, as well as financial statement line item comparability. 
 General Insurance businesses are transacted in most major foreign currencies. The following table presents the average of the quarterly weighted average exchange rates of the Major Currencies, which have the most significant impact on our businesses: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Percentage Nine Months Ended September 30, Percentage Rate for 1 USD 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change Major Currency: GBP 0.78 0.79 (1) 0.79 0.81 (2) EUR 0.92 0.91 1 0.92 0.92 JPY 153.68 142.47 8 151.18 136.68 11

 NET INCOME (LOSS) ATTRIBUTABLE TO AIG COMMON SHAREHOLDERS 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 Comparison 
 Net income (loss) attributable to AIG common shareholders decreased 1.6 billion due to the following: 
 a decrease in Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes of 2.1 billion primarily as a result of the inclusion of Corebridge net income in 2023; and 
 a decrease in underwriting income driven by unfavorable prior year loss reserve development of 187 million which does not reflect the benefit of recoveries under a retroactive adverse development cover, as well as the sale of AIG Re and the impact of mix change, partially offset by portfolio growth. 
 The decrease in Net income (loss) attributable to AIG common shareholders was partially offset by the following, on a pre-tax basis: 
 an increase in Net realized gains excluding Fortitude Re funds withheld assets and embedded derivative of 197 million, primarily driven by a 95 million increase in foreign exchange gains and lower losses on sales of securities of 86 million and higher derivative and hedge activity gains of 27 million, partially offset by lower sales on alternative investments of 43 million; 
 an increase in Net investment income of 117 million primarily driven by dividends received from Corebridge of 65 million, an increase in the fair value of equity securities of 29 million, an increase in the fair value of fixed maturity securities where we elected the fair value option of 25 million as a result of the higher interest rate environment and higher returns on our alternative investments of 23 million, partially offset by changes in Corebridge stock price of (35) million; 
 a decrease in income attributable to noncontrolling interest of 722 million primarily driven by the deconsolidation of Corebridge; and 
 a decrease in income tax expense of 231 million as a result of lower income from continuing operations.

 ITEM 2 | Consolidated Results of Operations 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 Comparison 
 Net income (loss) attributable to AIG common shareholders decreased 5.9 billion due to the following: 
 a decrease in Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of income taxes of 6.1 billion primarily as a result of the loss on deconsolidation of Corebridge of 4.7 billion and Corebridge net income in 2023; 
 a decrease in underwriting income driven by unfavorable prior year reserve development of 79 million, which does not reflect the benefit of recoveries under a retroactive adverse development cover, as well as the sales of AIG Re and Crop Risk Services, partially offset by improved portfolio performance and growth; and 
 an increase in income tax expense of 62 million as a result of prior year discrete items. 
 The decrease in Net income (loss) attributable to AIG common shareholders was partially offset by the following, on a pre-tax basis: 
 an increase in Net investment income of 405 million primarily driven by dividends received from Corebridge of 133 million and changes in its stock price of 30 million, higher income on available for sale fixed maturity securities of 144 million and an increase in the fair value of equity securities of 51 million, partially offset by lower returns on our alternative investments of 30 million; 
 an increase in Net realized gains excluding Fortitude Re funds withheld assets and embedded derivative of 333 million, primarily driven by a 232 million decrease in losses from sales of securities, lower derivative and hedge activity losses of 71 million and a 51 million increase in foreign exchange gains, partially offset by lower sales on alternative investments of 30 million; and 
 a decrease in net income attributable to noncontrolling interest of 326 million primarily driven by the deconsolidation of Corebridge. 
 
 INCOME TAX EXPENSE ANALYSIS 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the effective tax rate on income (loss) from continuing operations was 25.9 percent and 36.3 percent, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the effective tax rate on income (loss) from continuing operations was 24.6 percent and 21.3 percent, respectively.

 ITEM 2 | Business Segment Operations | General Insurance 

General Insurance products in North America and International markets are distributed through various channels, including captive and independent agents, brokers, affinity partners, airlines and travel agents, and retailers. Our global platform enables writing multinational and cross-border risks in both Commercial Lines and Personal Insurance. 
 BUSINESS STRATEGY 
 
 Profitable Growth: Build on our high-quality portfolio by focusing on targeted growth through continued underwriting discipline, improved retentions and new business development. Deploy capital efficiently to act opportunistically and achieve growth in profitable lines, geographies and customer segments, while taking a disciplined underwriting approach to exposure management, terms and conditions and rate change to achieve our risk/return hurdles. Continue to be open to inorganic growth opportunities in profitable markets and segments to expand our capabilities and footprint. 
 Underwriting Excellence: Continue to enhance portfolio optimization through strength of underwriting framework and guidelines as well as clear communication of risk appetite and rate adequacy. Empower and increase accountability of the underwriter and continue to integrate underwriting, claims and actuarial to enable better decision making. Focus on enhancing risk selection, driving consistent underwriting best practices and building robust monitoring standards to improve underwriting results. 
 Reinsurance Optimization: Strategically partner with reinsurers to effectively manage exposure to losses arising from frequency of large catastrophic events and severity from individual risk losses. We strive to optimize our reinsurance program to manage volatility and protect the balance sheet from tail events and unpredictable net losses in support of our profitable growth objectives. 
 COMPETITION AND CHALLENGES 
 
 General Insurance operates in a highly competitive industry against global, national and local insurers and reinsurers and underwriting syndicates in specific market areas and product types. Insurance companies compete through a combination of risk acceptance criteria, product pricing, service levels and terms and conditions. We serve our business and individual customers on a global basis from the largest multinational corporations to local businesses and individuals. General Insurance seeks to differentiate itself in the markets where we participate by providing leading expertise and insight to clients, distribution partners and other stakeholders, delivering underwriting excellence and value-driven insurance solutions and providing high quality, tailored end-to-end support to stakeholders. In doing so, we leverage our world-class global franchise, multinational capabilities, balance sheet strength and financial flexibility. 
 Our challenges include: 
 ensuring adequate business pricing given passage of time to reporting and settlement for insurance business, particularly with respect to long-tail Commercial Lines exposures; 
 impact of social and economic inflation on claim frequency and severity; and 
 volatility in claims arising from natural and man-made catastrophes and other aggregations of risk exposure. 
 INDUSTRY AND ECONOMIC FACTORS 
 The results of General Insurance for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 reflect continued strong performance from our Commercial Lines portfolio and focused execution on our portfolio management strategies within Personal Insurance. Across our North America and International Commercial Lines of business we have seen increased demand for our insurance products and strong growth in new business. We continue to monitor the impact of inflation and other economic factors on rate adequacy and loss cost trends. Similarly, we are monitoring monetary policy actions taken or anticipated to be taken by central banks and the corresponding impact on market interest rates. 
 General Insurance North America 
 North America Commercial continues to pursue profitable growth. While market discipline continues to support price increases across most lines, we are seeing capacity move back into the market in certain segments given pricing levels which is putting pressure on rates. We have focused on retaining our best accounts which has led to strong retention across the portfolio. These retention rates are often coupled with an exposure limit management strategy to reduce volatility within the portfolio. We continue to proactively identify segment growth areas as market conditions warrant through effective portfolio management, while non-renewing unprofitable business.

 Business and Financial Highlights 
 Net Premiums Written Comparison for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Net premiums written decreased by 74 million due to a decline in Commercial Lines 99 million), primarily driven by the sale of AIG Re, partially offset by growth in Casualty driven by pricing levels and new business production. This decline in Commercial Lines was partially offset by higher production in Personal Insurance 25 million), particularly in PCS driven by positive rate change and new business production. 
 Net Premiums Written Comparison for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Net premiums written decreased by 3.0 billion due to a decline in Commercial Lines 3.1 billion), driven by the sales of AIG Re and CRS. 
 Underwriting Income (Loss) Comparison for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Underwriting income decreased by 198 million primarily due to: 
 lower net favorable prior year development (3.2 points or 128 million), with higher favorable development from Property and Financial Lines, while Casualty turned unfavorable driven by a large settlement of a legacy mass tort claim with most of the gross loss in accident years covered under the Adverse Development Cover; and 
 the sale of AIG Re. 
 This decrease was partially offset by portfolio growth. 
 Underwriting Income (Loss) Comparison for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Underwriting income decreased by 462 million primarily due to: 
 lower net favorable prior year development (2.4 points or 259 million), primarily from Casualty development which turned unfavorable driven by a large settlement of a legacy mass tort claim with most of the gross loss in accident years covered under the Adverse Development Cover; and 
 the sales of AIG Re and Crop Risk Services. 
 This decrease was partially offset b y improved portfolio performance and growth.

 This incre ase was partially offset by a higher expense ratio (1.3 points) reflecting a higher acquisition ratio (0.9 points) and general operating expense ratio (0.4 points) primarily driven by changes in business mix. 
 Underwriting Income (Loss) Comparison for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Underwriting income increased by 218 million primarily due to: 
 net favorable prior year reserve development of 112 million in 2024 compared to net unfavorable prior year reserve development in 2023 of 65 million (1.9 points or 177 million), primarily as a result of higher favorable development in Specialty, and Property which turned favorable, partially offset by Financial Lines development which turned unfavorable, and higher unfavorable development within Casualty driven by claim-specific emergence in European Excess Casualty on accident year 2016; and 
 lower catastrophe losses (0.5 points or 59 million).

 OVERVIEW 
 Our investment strategies are tailored to the specific business needs of each segment by targeting an asset allocation mix that supports estimated cash flow needs of our outstanding liabilities and provides diversification from an asset class, sector, issuer, and geographic perspective. The primary objectives are generation of investment income, preservation of capital, liquidity management and growth of surplus. The majority of assets backing our insurance liabilities consist of fixed maturity securities. 
 
 Our Investment Management Agreements with BlackRock, Inc. 
 Since April 2022, AIG insurance company subsidiaries have entered into separate investment management agreements with BlackRock, Inc. and its investment advisory affiliates (BlackRock). As of September 30, 2024, BlackRock manages 64 billion of our investment portfolio, consisting of liquid fixed income, certain private placements and private equity assets. In addition, liquid fixed income assets associated with the Fortitude Re funds withheld asset portfolio were separately transferred to BlackRock for management in 2022. 
 INVESTMENT HIGHLIGHTS IN THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2024 Blended investment yields on new investments are higher than blended rates on investments that were sold, matured or called during this period. We continued to make investments in structured securities and other fixed maturity securities with attractive risk-adjusted return characteristics to improve yields and increase net investment income. 
 Total Net investment income increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to dividend income from AIG's equity in Corebridge, higher income on available for sale fixed maturity securities and short term instruments, partially offset by lower income from alternative investments and mortgage loans. 

INVESTMENT STRATEGIES 
 Investment strategies are assessed at the segment level and involve considerations that include local and general market and economic conditions, duration and cash flow management, risk appetite and volatility constraints, rating agency and regulatory capital considerations, tax, regulatory and legal investment limitations, and, as applicable, environmental, social and governance considerations. 
 Some of our key investment strategies are as follows: 
 Our fundamental strategy across the portfolios is to seek investments with similar duration and cash flow characteristics to the associated insurance liabilities to the extent practicable. 
 We seek to purchase investments that offer enhanced yield through illiquidity premiums, such as private placements and commercial mortgage loans, which also add portfolio diversification. These assets typically afford credit protections through covenants, ability to customize structures that meet our insurance liability needs, and deeper due diligence given information access. 
 Given our global presence, we seek investments that provide diversification from investments available in local markets. To the extent we purchase these investments, we generally hedge any currency risk using derivatives, which could provide opportunities to earn higher risk adjusted returns compared to investments in the functional currency. 
 AIG Parent, included in Other Operations, actively manages its assets and liabilities, counterparties and duration. AIG Parent s liquidity sources are held primarily in the form of cash and short-term investments. This strategy allows us to both diversify our sources of liquidity and reduce the cost of maintaining sufficient liquidity. 
 Within the U.S., General Insurance investments are generally split between reserve backing and surplus portfolios. 
 Insurance reserves are backed mainly by investment grade fixed maturity securities that meet our duration, risk-return, capital, tax, liquidity, credit quality and diversification objectives. We assess asset classes based on their fundamental underlying risk factors, including credit (public and private), commercial real estate and residential real estate, regardless of whether such investments are bonds, loans, or structured products. 
 Surplus investments seek to enhance portfolio returns and are generally comprised of a mix of fixed maturity investment grade and below investment grade securities and various alternative asset classes, including private equity, real estate equity, and hedge funds. Over the past few years, hedge fund investments have been reduced.

 ITEM 2 | Investments 

Outside of the U.S., fixed maturity securities held by our insurance companies consist primarily of investment-grade securities generally denominated in the currencies of the countries in which we operate. 
 We also utilize derivatives to manage our asset and liability duration as well as currency exposures. 
 Asset-Liability Management 
 The investment strategy within the General Insurance companies focuses on growth of surplus, maintenance of sufficient liquidity for unanticipated insurance claims, and preservation of capital. General Insurance invests primarily in fixed maturity securities issued by corporations, municipalities and other governmental agencies; structured securities collateralized by, among other assets, residential and commercial real estate; and commercial mortgage loans. Fixed maturity securities of the General Insurance companies have an average duration of 3.7 years, with an average of 4.0 years for North America and 3.1 years for International. 
 While invested assets backing reserves of the General Insurance companies are primarily invested in conventional liquid fixed maturity securities, we have continued to allocate to asset classes that offer higher yields through structural and illiquidity premiums, particularly in our North America operations. In addition, we continue to invest in both fixed rate and floating rate asset-backed investments to manage our exposure to potential changes in interest rates and inflation. We seek to diversify the portfolio across asset classes, sectors and issuers to mitigate idiosyncratic portfolio risks. 
 In addition, a portion of the surplus of General Insurance companies is invested in a diversified portfolio of alternative investments that seek to balance liquidity, volatility and growth of surplus. Although these alternative investments are subject to periodic earnings fluctuations, they have historically achieved yields in excess of the fixed maturity portfolio yields and have provided added diversification to the broader portfolio. 
 National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) Designations of Fixed Maturity Securities 
 The Securities Valuation Office (SVO) of the NAIC evaluates the investments of U.S. insurers for statutory reporting purposes and assigns fixed maturity securities to one of six categories called NAIC Designations. In general, NAIC Designations of 1 highest quality, or 2 high quality, include fixed maturity securities considered investment grade, while NAIC Designations of 3 through 6 generally include fixed maturity securities referred to as below investment grade. NAIC Designations for non-agency Residential Mortgage Backed Securities (RMBS) and Commercial Mortgage Backed Securities (CMBS) are calculated using third party modeling results provided through the NAIC. These methodologies result in an improved NAIC Designation for such securities compared to the rating typically assigned by the three major rating agencies. The following tables summarize the ratings distribution of AIG subsidiaries fixed maturity security portfolio by NAIC Designation, and the distribution by composite AIG credit rating, which is generally based on ratings of the three major rating agencies. For fixed maturity securities where no NAIC Designation is assigned or able to be calculated using third-party data, the NAIC Designation category used in the first table below reflects an internal rating. 
 The NAIC Designations presented below do not reflect the added granularity to the designation categories adopted by the NAIC in 2020, which further subdivide each category of fixed maturity securities by appending letter modifiers to the numerical designations. 
 For a full description of the composite AIG credit ratings, see Credit Ratings below.

CREDIT RATINGS 
 At September 30, 2024, approximately 64 percent of our fixed maturity securities were held by our U.S. entities. Approximately 93 percent of these securities were rated investment grade by one or more of the principal rating agencies. 
 Moody s Investors Service Inc. (Moody s), Standard Poor s Financial Services LLC, a subsidiary of S P Global Inc. (S P), or similar foreign rating services rate a significant portion of our foreign entities fixed maturity securities portfolio. Rating services are not available for some foreign-issued securities. We closely monitor the credit quality of the foreign portfolio s non-rated fixed maturity securities. At September 30, 2024, approximately 83 percent of such investments were either rated investment grade or, on the basis of analysis of our investment managers, were equivalent from a credit standpoint to securities rated investment grade. Approximately 30 percent of the foreign entities fixed maturity securities portfolio is comprised of sovereign fixed maturity securities supporting policy liabilities in the country of issuance. 
 Composite AIG Credit Ratings 
 With respect to our fixed maturity securities, the credit ratings in the table below and in subsequent tables reflect: (i) a composite of the ratings of the three major rating agencies, or when agency ratings are not available, the NAIC Designation assigned by the NAIC SVO (99 percent of total fixed maturity securities), or (ii) our internal ratings when these investments have not been rated by any of the major rating agencies or the NAIC. The Non-rated category in those tables consists of fixed maturity securities that have not been rated by any of the major rating agencies, the NAIC or us.

 Higher Net realized gains excluding Fortitude Re funds withheld assets in the three months ended September 30, 2024 were primarily due to lower losses on sales of fixed maturity securities, higher gains on foreign exchange transactions and all other derivatives and hedge accounting compared to the prior year period. Lower Net realized losses excluding Fortitude Re funds withheld assets in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2023 were primarily due to lower losses on sales of fixed maturity securities and higher derivatives gains compared to the prior year period.

Net realized gains (losses) on Fortitude Re funds withheld assets primarily reflect changes in the valuation of the modified coinsurance and funds withheld assets. Increases in the valuation of these assets result in losses to AIG as the appreciation on the assets under those reinsurance arrangements must be transferred to Fortitude Re. Decreases in valuation of the assets result in gains to AIG as the depreciation on the assets under those reinsurance arrangements must be transferred to Fortitude Re. For additional information on the impact of the funds withheld arrangements with Fortitude Re, see Note 8 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 For additional information on our investment portfolio, see Note 6 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Change in Unrealized Gains and Losses on Investments 
 The change in net unrealized gains and losses on investments in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to a change in the fair value of fixed maturity securities. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, net unrealized gains related to fixed maturity securities were 1.6 billion due primarily to lower interest rates and narrowing of credit spreads. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net unrealized gains were 1.5 billion due to lower interest rates and narrowing of credit spreads. 
 The change in net unrealized gains and losses on investments in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily attributable to a change in the fair value of fixed maturity securities. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, net unrealized losses related to fixed maturity securities were 670 million due primarily to an increase in interest rates. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net unrealized gains were 159 million primarily due to widening of credit spreads.

We note that for certain categories of claims (e.g., construction defect claims and environmental claims) and for reinsurance recoverable, losses may sometimes be reclassified to an earlier or later accident year as more information about the date of occurrence becomes available to us. 
 Significant Reinsurance Agreements 
 In the first quarter of 2017, we entered into an adverse development reinsurance agreement with NICO, under which we transferred to NICO 80 percent of the reserve risk on substantially all of our U.S. Commercial long-tail exposures for accident years 2015 and prior. Under this agreement, we ceded to NICO 80 percent of the losses on subject business paid on or after January 1, 2016 in excess of 25 billion of net paid losses, up to an aggregate limit of 25 billion. We account for this transaction as retroactive reinsurance. This transaction resulted in a gain, which under GAAP retroactive reinsurance accounting is deferred and amortized into income over the settlement period. NICO created a collateral trust account as security for their claim payment obligations to us, into which they deposited the consideration paid under the agreement, and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. has provided a parental guarantee to secure NICO s obligations under the agreement. 
 For a description of AIG s catastrophe reinsurance protection for 2023, see Part II, Item 7. MD A Enterprise Risk Management Insurance Risks General Insurance Companies Key Risks Natural Catastrophe Risk in the 2023 Annual Report.

The lines of business subject to this agreement include those with longer tails, which carry a higher degree of uncertainty. Since inception, there have been periods of both favorable and unfavorable prior year development. This agreement will continue to reduce the impact of volatility in the development on our ultimate loss estimates over time. 
 Fortitude Re was established during the first quarter of 2018 in a series of reinsurance transactions related to our run-off operations. Those reinsurance transactions were designed to consolidate most of our insurance run-off lines into a single legal entity. As of September 30, 2024, 3.5 billion of reserves related to business written by multiple wholly-owned AIG subsidiaries, had been ceded to Fortitude Re under these reinsurance transactions. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 OVERVIEW 
 Liquidity refers to the ability to generate sufficient cash resources to meet the cash requirements of our business operations and payment obligations. 
 Capital refers to the long-term financial resources available to support the operation of our businesses, fund business growth and cover financial and operational needs that arise from adverse circumstances. Our primary source of ongoing capital generation is derived from the profitability of our insurance subsidiaries. We must comply with numerous constraints on our capital positions. These constraints drive the requirements for capital adequacy at AIG and the individual businesses and are based on internally defined risk tolerances, regulatory requirements, rating agency and creditor expectations and business needs. 
 For information regarding our liquidity risk framework, see Part II, Item 7. MD A Enterprise Risk Management Risk Appetite, Limits, Identification and Measurement and Part II, Item 7. MD A Enterprise Risk Management Liquidity Risk Management in the 2023 Annual Report. 
 We believe that we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to satisfy future requirements and meet our obligations to policyholders, customers, creditors and debt-holders, including those arising from reasonably foreseeable contingencies or events. Nevertheless, some circumstances may cause our cash or capital needs to exceed projected liquidity or readily deployable capital resources. 
 For information regarding risks associated with our liquidity and capital resources, see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors Liquidity, Capital and Credit in the 2023 Annual Report. 
 Depending on market conditions, regulatory and rating agency considerations and other factors, we may take various liability and capital management actions. Liability management actions may include, but are not limited to, repurchasing or redeeming outstanding debt, issuing new debt or engaging in debt exchange offers. Capital management actions may include, but are not limited to, issuing preferred stock, paying dividends to our shareholders on AIG Common Stock, par value 2.50 per share (AIG Common Stock) and repurchases of AIG Common Stock.

ANALYSIS OF SOURCES AND USES OF CASH 
 Operating Cash Flow Activities 
 Insurance companies generally receive most premiums in advance of the payment of claims or policy benefits. The ability of insurance companies to generate positive cash flow is affected by the frequency and severity of losses under their insurance policies, policy retention rates, effective management of our investment portfolio and operating expense discipline. 
 Interest payments totaled 581 million and 745 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Excluding interest payments, AIG had operating cash inflows of 3.7 billion, including 104 million outflow from discontinued operations, in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to operating cash inflows of 5.4 billion, including 119 million outflow from discontinued operations, in the prior year period. 
 Investing Cash Flow Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 1.0 billion, including 4.2 billion used in discontinued operations, compared to net cash used in investing activities of 4.1 billion, including 2.5 billion from discontinued operations, in the prior year period. 
 Financing Cash Flow Activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2024 totaled 2.1 billion , reflecting: 
 758 million to pay dividends of 0.40 per share in each of the three month periods ended September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, and 0.36 per share for the three months ended March 31, 2024 on AIG Common Stock; 
 22 million to pay a first quarter dividend of 365.625 per share on AIG s Series A Preferred Stock and redemption premiums; 
 4.8 billion to repurchase approximately 65 million shares of AIG Common Stock; 
 509 million in net outflows from the issuance and repayment of long-term debt; and 
 4.4 billion in net inflows from discontinued operations. 
 Net cash used in financing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 totaled 239 million reflecting: 
 748 million to pay dividends of 0.36 per share in the three months ended September 30, 2023 and June 30, 2023, and 0.32 per share for the three months ended March 31, 2023 on AIG Common Stock; 
 22 million to pay quarterly dividends of 365.625 per share on AIG s Series A Preferred Stock; 
 1.9 billion to repurchase approximately 35 million shares of AIG Common Stock; 
 67 million in net inflows from the issuance and repayment of long-term debt; 
 6 million in net outflows from the issuance and repayment of debt of consolidated investment entities; and 
 1.8 billion in net inflows from discontinued operations. 
 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES OF AIG PARENT AND SUBSIDIARIES 
 AIG Parent 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, AIG Parent and applicable intermediate holding companies had approximately 7.2 billion and 12.1 billion in liquidity sources held in the form of cash, short-term investments and AIG Parent's committed, revolving syndicated credit facility of 3.0 billion as of September 30, 2024 and 4.5 billion as of December 31, 2023. AIG Parent s primary sources of liquidity are dividends, distributions, loans and other payments from subsidiaries and credit facilities. AIG Parent s primary uses of liquidity are for debt service, capital and liability management, operating expenses and dividends on AIG Common Stock. 
 We expect to access the debt and preferred equity markets from time to time to meet funding requirements as needed. 
 We utilize our capital resources to support our businesses, with the majority of capital allocated to our insurance operations. Should we have or generate more capital than is needed to support our business strategies (including organic or inorganic growth opportunities) or mitigate risks inherent to our business, we may develop plans to distribute such capital to shareholders via dividends or AIG Common Stock repurchase authorizations or deploy such capital towards liability management. 
 Insurance Companies 
 We expect that our insurance companies will be able to continue to satisfy reasonably foreseeable future liquidity requirements and meet their obligations, including those arising from reasonably foreseeable contingencies or events, through cash from operations and, to the extent necessary, monetization of invested assets.

 ITEM 2 | Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Our insurance companies liquidity resources are primarily held in the form of cash, short-term investments and publicly traded, investment grade rated fixed maturity securities. Each of our material insurance companies liquidity is monitored through various internal liquidity risk measures. The primary sources of liquidity are premiums, fees, reinsurance recoverables and investment income and maturities. Certain of our insurance companies have access to Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) borrowings as an additional source of funding. The primary uses of liquidity are paid losses, reinsurance payments, interest payments, dividends, expenses, investment purchases and collateral requirements. 
 Our insurance companies may require additional funding to meet capital or liquidity needs under certain circumstances. For example, large catastrophes may require us to provide additional support to the affected operations of our insurance companies. 
 We are party to several letter of credit agreements with various financial institutions, which issue letters of credit from time to time in support of our insurance companies. These letters of credit are subject to reimbursement by us in the event of a drawdown of these letters of credit. Letters of credit issued in support of our insurance companies totaled approximately 2.3 billion at September 30, 2024. 
 
 CREDIT FACILITIES 
 We maintain a syndicated, multicurrency revolving credit facility as a potential source of liquidity for general corporate purposes. On September 27, 2024, we amended and restated the five-year syndicated credit facility that was entered into on November 19, 2021 (the Previous Facility). The amended and restated five-year syndicated credit facility (the Facility) provides for aggregate commitments by the bank syndicate to provide AIG Parent with unsecured revolving loans and/or standby letters of credit of up to 3.0 billion (the Previous Facility was up to 4.5 billion). The Facility is scheduled to expire in September 2029 (the Previous Facility was scheduled to expire in November 2026). 
 Our ability to utilize the Facility is conditioned on the satisfaction of certain legal, operating, administrative and financial covenants and other requirements contained in the Facility. These include covenants relating to our maintenance of a specified total consolidated net worth and total consolidated debt to total consolidated capitalization. Failure to satisfy these and other requirements contained in the Facility would restrict our access to the Facility and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. 
 As of September 30, 2024, a total of 3.0 billion remained available under the Facility. 
 
 CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS 
 As of September 30, 2024, other than obligations associated with Corebridge, which are no longer considered obligations of AIG as a result of deconsolidation, there have been no material changes in our contractual obligations from December 31, 2023, a description of which may be found in Part II, Item 7. MD A Liquidity and Capital Resources Contractual Obligations in the 2023 Annual Report. 
 
 OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS 
 As of September 30, 2024, other than off-balance sheet arrangements and commercial commitments associated with Corebridge, which are no longer considered obligations of AIG as a result of deconsolidation, there have been no material changes in our off-balance sheet arrangements and commercial commitments from December 31, 2023, a description of which may be found in Part II, Item 7. MD A Liquidity and Capital Resources Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Commercial Commitments in the 2023 Annual Report . 
 
 DEBT 
 We expect to service and repay general borrowings through maturing investments and dispositions of invested assets, future cash flows from operations, cash flows generated from invested assets, future debt or preferred stock issuances and other financing arrangements.

Enterprise Risk Management 
 Risk management includes the identification and measurement of various forms of risk, the establishment of risk thresholds and the creation of processes intended to maintain risks within these thresholds while optimizing returns. 
 
 OVERVIEW 
 Risk management is an integral part of our business strategy and a key element of our approach to corporate governance. We have an integrated process for managing risks throughout our organization in accordance with our firm-wide risk appetite. Our Board of Directors has oversight responsibility for the management of risk. Our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Department oversees and integrates the risk management functions in each of our business units, providing senior management with a consolidated view of AIG s major risk positions. ERM embeds risk management in our key day-to-day business processes. Nevertheless, our risk management efforts may not always be successful and material adverse effects on our business, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity or financial condition may occur. For further information regarding the risks associated with our business and operations, see Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 AIG employs a Three Lines of Defense model. AIG s business leaders assume full accountability for the risks and controls in their segments, and ERM performs a review, challenge and oversight function. The third line consists of our Internal Audit Group that provides independent assurance to AIG s Board of Directors. 
 For additional information on AIG s risk management program, see Part II, Item 7. MD A Enterprise Risk Management in the 2023 Annual Report. 
 The scope and magnitude of our market risk exposures is managed under a robust framework that contains defined risk limits and minimum standards for managing market risk in a manner consistent with our risk appetite statement. As of September 30, 2024, other than the elimination of market risk sensitive data as a result of the deconsolidation of Corebridge, there have been no material changes in our market risk exposures, which may be found in Part II, Item 7. MD A Enterprise Risk Management in the 2023 Annual Report. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in the 2023 Annual Report on how difficult conditions in the financial markets and the economy generally may materially adversely affect our business and results of our operations.

 Accident year loss ratio, as adjusted (Accident year loss ratio, ex-CAT) The loss ratio excluding catastrophe losses and related reinstatement premiums, prior year development, net of premium adjustments, and the impact of reserve discounting. 
 Acquisition ratio Acquisition costs divided by net premiums earned. Acquisition costs are those costs incurred to acquire new and renewal insurance contracts and also include the amortization of VOBA and DAC. Acquisition costs vary with sales and include, but are not limited to, commissions, premium taxes, direct marketing costs and certain costs of personnel engaged in sales support activities such as underwriting. 
 Adjusted revenues exclude Net realized gains (losses), income from non-operating litigation settlements (included in Other income for GAAP purposes), changes in fair value of securities used to hedge guaranteed living benefits (included in Net investment income for GAAP purposes) and income from elimination of the international reporting lag. Adjusted revenues is a GAAP measure for our segments. 
 Attritional losses are losses recorded in the current accident year, which are not catastrophe losses. 
 Book Value per share, excluding Goodwill, Value of business acquired (VOBA), Value of distribution channel acquired (VODA) and Other intangible assets (Tangible book value per share) is used to provide a useful measure of the realizable shareholder value on a per share basis. Tangible book value per share is derived by dividing Total AIG common shareholders equity, excluding intangible assets (AIG tangible common shareholders equity) by total common shares outstanding. 
 Book value per share, excluding Investments AOCI, deferred tax assets (DTA) and AIG s ownership interest in Corebridge (Core operating book value per share) is used to show the amount of our net worth on a per share basis after eliminating Investments AOCI, DTA and AIG s ownership interest in Corebridge. We believe this measure is useful to investors because it eliminates fair value of investments that can fluctuate significantly from period to period due to changes in market conditions. We also exclude only the portion of DTA representing U.S. tax attributes related to net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs) and corporate alternative minimum tax credits (CAMTCs) and foreign tax credits (FTCs) that have not yet been utilized. Amounts for interim periods are estimates based on projections of full-year attribute utilization. As NOLs, CAMTCs and FTCs are utilized, the portion of the DTA utilized is included. We exclude AIG s ownership interest in Corebridge since it is not a core long-term investment for AIG. Core operating book value per share is derived by dividing total AIG common shareholders equity, excluding Investments AOCI, DTA and AIG s ownership interest in Corebridge (AIG core operating shareholders equity) by total common shares outstanding. 
 Book value per share, excluding investments related cumulative unrealized gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI) adjusted for the cumulative unrealized gains and losses related to Fortitude Re funds withheld assets (collectively, Investments AOCI) (Adjusted book value per share) is used to show the amount of our net worth on a per share basis after eliminating the fair value of investments that can fluctuate significantly from period to period due to changes in market conditions. In addition, we adjusted for the cumulative unrealized gains and losses related to Fortitude Re funds withheld assets held by AIG in support of Fortitude Re s reinsurance obligations to AIG (Fortitude Re funds withheld assets) since these fair value movements are economically transferred to Fortitude Re. Adjusted book value per share is derived by dividing total AIG common shareholders equity, excluding Investments AOCI (AIG adjusted common equity) by total common shares outstanding. 
 Casualty insurance Insurance that is primarily associated with the losses caused by injuries to third persons, i.e., not the insured, and the legal liability imposed on the insured as a result.

 DAC Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs Deferred costs that are incremental and directly related to the successful acquisition of new business or renewal of existing business. 
 Deferred gain on retroactive reinsurance Retroactive reinsurance is a reinsurance contract in which an assuming entity agrees to reimburse a ceding entity for liabilities incurred as a result of past insurable events. If the amount of premium paid by the ceding reinsurer is less than the related ceded loss reserves, the resulting gain is deferred and amortized over the settlement period of the reserves. Any related development on the ceded loss reserves recoverable under the contract would increase the deferred gain if unfavorable, or decrease the deferred gain if favorable. 
 Expense ratio Sum of acquisition expenses and general operating expenses, divided by net premiums earned.

 IBNR Incurred But Not Reported Estimates of claims that have been incurred but not reported to us. 
 ISDA Master Agreement An agreement between two counterparties, which may have multiple derivative transactions with each other governed by such agreement, that generally provides for the net settlement of all or a specified group of these derivative transactions, as well as pledged collateral, through a single payment, in a single currency, in the event of a default on, or affecting any, one derivative transaction or a termination event affecting all, or a specified group of, derivative transactions. 
 Loan-to-value ratio Principal amount of loan amount divided by appraised value of collateral securing the loan. 
 Loss Adjustment Expenses The expenses directly attributed to settling and paying claims of insureds and include, but are not limited to, legal fees, adjuster s fees and the portion of general expenses allocated to claim settlement costs. 
 Loss ratio Losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred divided by net premiums earned. 
 Loss reserve development The increase or decrease in incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses related to prior years as a result of the re-estimation of loss reserves at successive valuation dates for a given group of claims. 
 Loss reserves Liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses. The estimated ultimate cost of settling claims relating to insured events that have occurred on or before the balance sheet date, whether or not reported to the insurer at that date. 
 Master netting agreement An agreement between two counterparties who have multiple derivative contracts with each other that provides for the net settlement of all contracts covered by such agreement, as well as pledged collateral, through a single payment, in a single currency, in the event of default on or upon termination of any one such contract. 
 Natural catastrophe losses are generally weather or seismic events having a net impact on AIG in excess of 10 million each and man-made catastrophe losses, such as terrorism and civil disorders that exceed the 10 million threshold. 
 Net premiums written represent the sales of an insurer, adjusted for reinsurance premiums assumed and ceded, during a given period. Net premiums earned are the revenue of an insurer for covering risk during a given period. Net premiums written are a measure of performance for a sales period, while net premiums earned are a measure of performance for a coverage period. 
 Noncontrolling interests The portion of equity ownership in a consolidated subsidiary not attributable to the controlling parent company. 
 Pool A reinsurance arrangement whereby all of the underwriting results of the pool members are combined and then shared by each member in accordance with its pool participation percentage.

 RBC Risk-Based Capital A formula designed to measure the adequacy of an insurer s statutory surplus compared to the risks inherent in its business. 
 Reinstatement premiums Premiums on an insurance policy over and above the initial premium imposed at the beginning of the policy payable to reinsurers or receivable from insurers to restore coverage limits that have been reduced or exhausted as a result of reinsured losses under certain excess of loss reinsurance contracts. 
 Reinsurance The practice whereby one insurer, the reinsurer, in consideration of a premium paid to that insurer, agrees to indemnify another insurer, the ceding company, for part or all of the liability of the ceding company under one or more policies or contracts of insurance which it has issued. 
 Reinsurance recoverables are comprised of paid losses recoverable, ceded loss reserves, ceded reserves for unearned premiums. 
 Retroactive reinsurance See Deferred gain on retroactive reinsurance . 
 Return on Equity Adjusted After-tax Income, Excluding Goodwill, VOBA, VODA and Other Intangible assets (Return on tangible equity) is used to show the return on AIG tangible common shareholder s equity, which we believe is a useful measure of realizable shareholder value. We exclude Goodwill, VOBA, VODA and Other intangible assets from AIG common shareholders equity to derive AIG tangible common shareholders equity. Return on AIG tangible common equity is derived by dividing actual or, for interim periods, annualized adjusted after-tax income attributable to AIG common shareholders by average AIG tangible common equity. 
 Return on equity Adjusted after-tax income excluding Investments AOCI (Adjusted return on equity) is used to show the rate of return on common shareholders equity excluding Investments AOCI. We believe this measure is useful to investors because it eliminates fair value of investments which can fluctuate significantly from period to period due to changes in market conditions. Adjusted return on equity is derived by dividing actual or, for interim periods, annualized adjusted after-tax income attributable to AIG common shareholders by average AIG adjusted common shareholders equity.

We also exclude only the portion of DTA representing U.S. tax attributes related to NOLs and CAMTCs and FTCs that have not yet been utilized. Amounts for interim periods are estimates based on projections of full-year attribute utilization. As NOLs, CAMTCs and FTCs are utilized, the portion of the DTA utilized is included. We exclude AIG s ownership interest in Corebridge since it is not a core long-term investment for AIG. This metric will provide greater insight as to the underlying profitability of our property and casualty business. Core operating return on equity is derived by dividing actual or, for interim periods, annualized adjusted after-tax income attributable to AIG common shareholders by average AIG core operating shareholders equity. 
 Subrogation The amount of recovery for claims we have paid our policyholders, generally from a negligent third party or such party s insurer. 
 Unearned premium reserve Liabilities established by insurers and reinsurers to reflect unearned premiums, which are usually refundable to policyholders if an insurance or reinsurance contract is canceled prior to expiration of the contract term. 
 VOBA Value of Business Acquired Present value of future pre-tax profits from in-force policies of acquired businesses discounted at yields applicable at the time of purchase. VOBA is reported in DAC in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

 2. This Agreement is a term and condition of the Employee s at-will employment with the Company. Employment with the Company is conditioned upon the Employee s execution of this Agreement. 
 3. This Agreement is necessary for the protection of the legitimate and protectable business interests of the Company and its affiliates (collectively, AIG in their customers, customer goodwill, accounts, prospects, employee training, and confidential and proprietary information. The Employee s employment requires exposure to and use of Confidential Information (as defined in Paragraph 5). Accordingly, the Employee agrees that during and after the Employee s employment with AIG, the Employee will not, directly or indirectly, on the Employee s own behalf or on behalf of any other person or any entity other than AIG solicit, contact, call upon, communicate or attempt to communicate with any customer or client or prospective customer or client of AIG, where to do so would require the use or disclosure of Confidential Information (for purposes of this Agreement, customer or client shall not include insurance brokers). The Employee further agrees that during the Employee s employment with AIG and for a period of one (1) year after employment terminates for any reason, the Employee will not, directly or indirectly, regardless of who initiates the communication, solicit, participate in the solicitation or recruitment of, or in any manner encourage or provide assistance to, any employee, consultant, registered representative, or agent of AIG to terminate his or her employment or other relationship with AIG or to leave its employ or other relationship with AIG for any engagement in any capacity or for any other person or entity. 
 4. During the term of employment, the Employee will have access to and become acquainted with Confidential Information. The Employee agrees that during the Employee s employment and any time thereafter, all Confidential Information will be treated by the Employee in the strictest confidence and will not be disclosed or used by the Employee in any manner other than in connection with the discharge of the Employee s job responsibilities without the prior written consent of AIG or unless required by law. The Employee further agrees that the Employee will not remove or destroy any Confidential Information either during the Employee s employment or at any time thereafter and will return to AIG any Confidential Information in the Employee s possession at the end of the Employee s employment (or earlier if so requested by the Company). The Employee also agrees that during and after the Employee s employment with AIG, the Employee will not make any disparaging comments about AIG or any of its officers, directors or employees to any person or entity not affiliated with AIG. AIG agrees that during and after the Employee s employment with AIG, AIG will instruct its officers and directors not to make any disparaging comments about the Employee. Nothing herein shall prevent the Employee from making or publishing any statement (a) when required by law, subpoena or court order or at the request of an administrative agency or legislature, (b) in the course of any legal, arbitral, administrative, legislative or regulatory proceeding, (c) to any governmental authority, regulatory agency or self-regulatory organization, (d) in connection with any investigation by AIG, or (e) where a prohibition or limitation on such communication is unlawful. 

For example, nothing in this Agreement or any AIG policy shall prohibit, prevent, limit or restrict the Employee from (i) exercising Employee s Section 7 rights under the National Labor Relations Act, including but not limited to, the right to participate in activities or communications related to wages or compensation or other terms, conditions or privileges of employment, or (ii) communicating with or responding to any inquiry by the Securities and Exchange Commission, law enforcement, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission or any state or local commission on human rights (e.g., for New York employees, the New York State Division of Human Rights or the New York City Commission on Civil Rights), any other local, state, or federal governmental or regulatory authority, any self-regulatory organization, or any attorney retained by the Employee, provided that AIG does not waive any attorney-client privilege over any information provided by the Employee that is appropriately covered by such privilege. 
 5. Confidential Information refers to an item of information or a compilation of information in any form (tangible or intangible), related to AIG s business that AIG has not made public or authorized public disclosure of, which became known to Employee as a result of Employee s employment with AIG, and that is not generally known to the public through proper means. Confidential Information includes, but is not limited to (a) business plans and analysis, customer and prospective customer lists, personnel, staffing and compensation information, marketing plans and strategies, research and development data, financial data, operational data, methods, techniques, technical data, know-how, innovations, computer programs, un-patented inventions, and trade secrets and (b) information about the business affairs of third parties (including, but not limited to, customers and prospective customers) that such third parties provide to AIG in confidence. The presence of non-confidential items of information within an otherwise confidential compilation of information will not remove the compilation itself (the information in its compiled form) from the protection of this Agreement. The Employee acknowledges that items of Confidential Information are AIG s valuable assets and have economic value, actual or potential, because they are not generally known by the public or others who could use them to their own economic benefit and or to the competitive disadvantage of AIG. 
 6. The covenants contained in Paragraphs 3 and 4 of this Agreement shall be enforced to the fullest extent permissible under the laws and public policies of each jurisdiction in which enforcement is sought.

The Employee further agrees that the Employee shall be liable for the attorneys fees and costs incurred by AIG as a result of the Employee s breach of Paragraph 3 or 4 of this Agreement. 
 7. Invention Assignment (a) the Employee hereby assigns all right, title and interest in any intellectual property, including but not limited to discoveries, ideas, inventions, works, reports, rules, processes, lists, data and other materials along with all improvements thereto (whether or not patentable or registerable under copyright or similar statutes) conceived, produced or developed by the Employee, either alone or in conjunction with others, pursuant to, or in furtherance of the Employee's employment with the Company (collectively Intellectual Property ).

The Employee further agrees that all original works of authorship which were made by the Employee (either alone or with others) within the scope of and during the period of the Employee's employment with the Company and which are protectable by copyright laws, are works made for hire as that term is defined in the United States Copyright Act. 
 (c) Notwithstanding the above, this Section does not apply to inventions that qualify under state law as inventions that cannot be required to be assigned. 
 8. This Agreement (together with the AIG Code of Conduct) sets forth the entire agreement regarding the subject matter contained in this Agreement, supersedes any and all prior agreements and understandings regarding this subject matter, and may be modified only by a written agreement signed by the Employee and the Company. To the extent that any provision of this Agreement is inconsistent with the Code of Conduct, this Agreement governs. If any term of this Agreement is rendered invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated. Should a court determine that any provision of this Agreement is unreasonable, whether in period of time, geographical area, or otherwise, the Employee agrees that such provision of the Agreement should be interpreted and enforced to the maximum extent that such court deems reasonable. 
 9. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, WITHOUT REGARD TO CONFLICT OF LAWS PROVISIONS (WHETHER OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK OR ANY OTHER JURISDICTION) THAT WOULD CAUSE THE APPLICATION OF ANY LAW OTHER THAN THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

 (b) Presumption by Administrative Agent . Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed time of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender s share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the applicable Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then each of the applicable Lender and the applicable Borrower severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to such Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent (the Compensation Period ), at (A) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the greater of (i) the Federal Funds Rate from time to time in effect and (ii) a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, and (B) in the case of a payment to be made by the applicable Borrower, the interest rate applicable to Base Rate Loans or, in the case of Alternative Currencies, in accordance with such market practice, in each case, as applicable. If the applicable Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to such Borrower the amount of such interest paid by such Borrower for such period. If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender s Loan included in such Borrowing. Nothing herein shall be deemed to relieve any Lender from its obligation to fulfill its Commitments or to prejudice any rights which the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Borrower may have against any other Lender as a result of any default by such Lender hereunder.

A certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section shall be delivered to the applicable Borrower and (if such Borrower is not the Company) the Company and shall be conclusive absent manifest error.

 (a) Withholding of Taxes Gross-Up . Each payment by any Loan Party under any Loan Document shall be made without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, unless such withholding is required by applicable Law (which, for purposes of this Section, shall include FATCA). If any Withholding Agent determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it is so required to deduct or withhold Taxes, then such Withholding Agent may so deduct or withhold and shall timely pay the full amount of deducted or withheld Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable Law. If such Taxes are Indemnified Taxes, then the amount payable by such Loan Party shall be increased as necessary so that, net of such deduction or withholding (including such deduction or withholding applicable to additional amounts payable under this Section), the applicable Recipient receives the amount it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made.

The indemnity under this Section 2.14(d) shall be paid within 10 days after the Recipient delivers to any Loan Party a certificate stating the amount of any Indemnified Taxes so payable by such Recipient and describing the basis for the indemnification claim. Such certificate shall be conclusive of the amount so payable absent manifest error. Such Recipient shall deliver a copy of such certificate to the Administrative Agent. In the case of any Lender making a claim under this Section 2.14(d) on behalf of any of its beneficial owners, an indemnity payment under this Section 2.14(d) shall be due only to the extent that such Lender is able to establish that, with respect to the applicable Indemnified Taxes, such beneficial owners supplied to the applicable Persons such properly completed and executed documentation necessary to claim any applicable exemption from, or reduction of, such Indemnified Taxes.

(e) Indemnification by Lenders .

In addition, any Lender, if requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by Law or reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent as will enable the applicable Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to any withholding (including backup withholding) or information reporting requirements.

All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent at the Administrative Agent s Office, except that payments pursuant to Sections 2.12, 2.13, 2.14 and 9.03 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof.

 (b) Application of Insufficient Payments . If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, Unreimbursed Amounts, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, to pay interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, to pay principal and Unreimbursed Amounts then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal and Unreimbursed Amounts then due to such parties.

(d) Presumptions of Payment . Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice (which notice shall be effective upon receipt) from the applicable Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for account of the Lenders hereunder that such Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders the amount due. In such event, if the applicable Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate. 
 (e) Certain Deductions by the Administrative Agent . If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.04(b), 2.15(d), 2.20(c) or 9.03(c), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion and notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, (i) apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender and for the benefit of the Administrative Agent to satisfy such Lender s obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid, and or (ii) hold any such amounts in a segregated account as cash collateral for, and application to, any future funding obligations of such Lender under such Sections, in the case of each of clauses (i) and (ii) above, in any order as determined by the Administrative Agent in its discretion.

 A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or the Borrower with respect to any amount owing under this clause (f) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error. 
 (g) Obligations of Lenders Several . The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Loans, to fund participations in Letters of Credit and to make payments pursuant to Section 9.03(c) are several and not joint. The failure of any Lender to make any Loan, to fund any such participation or to make any payment under Section 9.03(c) on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Loan, to purchase its participation or to make its payment under Section 9.03(c) .

A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Company to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply (including, in the case of clause (iii) above with respect to any Non-NAIC Approved Bank, if, prior thereto, such Lender complies with Section 2.22(a)).
