INVESTCORP AI ACQUISITION CORP. 

 NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 

 . The Company was formed for the purpose of effectuating a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses (the Business Combination ). The Company is an early stage and emerging growth company and, as such, the Company is subject to all of the risks associated with early stage and emerging growth companies. On January 11, 2022, the Company changed its name from Investcorp Acquisition Corp. to Investcorp India Acquisition Corp. On October 15, 2024, the Company changed its name from Investcorp India Acquisition Corp to Investcorp AI Acquisition Corp (see Note 10). 
 As of September 30, 2024, and for the period from February 19, 2021 (inception) through September 30, 2024 the Company had not yet commenced any operations. All activity for the period from February 19, 2021 (inception) through September 30, 2024, relates to the Company s formation and the initial public offering (the Initial Public Offering or IPO and identifying a target for a Business Combination. The Company will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of its initial Business Combination, at the earliest. The Company will generate non-operating
 income in the form of interest income from the proceeds derived from the Initial Public Offering. The Company has selected December 31 as its fiscal year end. 
 The registration statement for the Company s Initial Public Offering was declared effective on May 9, 2022. On May 12, 2022, the Company consummated the Initial Public Offering of unit (the Units and, with respect to the shares of Class A ordinary shares included in the Units sold, the Public Shares ), at per Unit, generating gross proceeds of . Additionally, the underwriter exercised their over-allotment option in full, resulting in an additional Units issued for an aggregate amount of , which is described in Note 3. 
 Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company consummated the sale of warrants (the Private Placement Warrants at a price of per Private Placement Warrant in a private placement to ICE I Holdings Pte. Ltd. (the Sponsor ), generating gross proceeds of . In connection with the underwriter s exercise of their over-allotment option, the Company also consummated the sale of an additional Private Placement Warrants at per Private Placement Warrant generating total proceeds of , which is described in Note 4. 
 The Company s management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating a Business Combination. NASDAQ rules provide that the Business Combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have a fair market value equal to at least of the balance in the Trust Account (as defined below) (less any taxes payable on interest earned on the Trust Account) at the time of the signing a definitive agreement to enter a Business Combination. The Company will only complete a Business Combination if the post-Business Combination company owns or acquires or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act ). There is no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully effect a Business Combination. Upon the closing of the Proposed Offering, management has agreed that per Unit sold in the Proposed Offering, including the proceeds from the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, will be held in a trust account (the Trust Account and invested in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act, with a maturity of days or less, or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund meeting the conditions of Rule 2a-7
 under the Investment Company Act, as determined by the Company, until the earlier of: (i) the consummation of a Business Combination or (ii) the distribution of the funds in the Trust Account to the Company s shareholders, as described below. 

either immediately prior to or upon such consummation of a Business Combination and, if the Company seeks shareholder approval, a majority of the outstanding shares voted are voted in favor of the Business Combination. 
 If the Company seeks shareholder approval of a Business Combination and it does not conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, the Company s Certificate of Incorporation provides that a public shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a group (as defined under Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to 15 or more of the Public Shares without the Company s prior written consent. 
 The public shareholders will be entitled to redeem their shares for a pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account (initially per share, plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay its tax obligations). There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of a Business Combination with respect to the Company s warrants. These Class A ordinary shares will be recorded at a redemption value and classified as temporary equity upon the completion of the Proposed Offering, in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ASC Topic 480 Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity. 
 If a shareholder vote is not required and the Company does not decide to hold a shareholder vote for business or other legal reasons, the Company will, pursuant to its Certificate of Incorporation, offer such redemption pursuant to the tender offer rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ), and file tender offer documents containing substantially the same information as would be included in a proxy statement with the SEC prior to completing a Business Combination. 
 The Company s Sponsor has agreed (a) to vote its Founder Shares (as defined in Note 5) and any Public Shares purchased during or after the Initial Public Offering in favor of a Business Combination, (b) not to propose an amendment to the Company s Certificate of Incorporation with respect to the Company s pre-Business
 Combination activities prior to the consummation of a Business Combination unless the Company provides dissenting public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their Public Shares in conjunction with any such amendment; (c) not to redeem any shares (including the Founder Shares) into the right to receive cash from the Trust Account in connection with a shareholder vote to approve a Business Combination (or to sell any shares in a tender offer in connection with a Business Combination if the Company does not seek shareholder approval in connection therewith) or a vote to amend the provisions of the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation relating to shareholders rights of pre-Business
 Combination activity and (d) that the Founder Shares shall not participate in any liquidating distributions upon winding up if a Business Combination is not consummated. However, the Sponsor will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to any Public Shares purchased during or after the Proposed Offering if the Company fails to complete its Business Combination. 
 On August 11, 2023 shareholders of the Company held an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders (the Extraordinary General Meeting ). At the Extraordinary General Meeting, the Company s shareholders approved the proposal to amend the Company s Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association to give the Company the right to extend the date by which it has to consummate a business combination from August 12, 2023 to August 12, 2024. 
 In connection with the Extension Amendment Proposal, the Sponsor has agreed to contribute (each such contribution, a Contribution into the Company s Trust Account the lessor or (x) an aggregate of or (y) per share for each Class A ordinary share included as a part of the units sold in the Company s initial public offering (including any shares issued in exchange thereof) that are not redeemed at the Extraordinary General Meeting for each monthly period (commencing on and ending on the th day of each subsequent month), or portion thereof, until the earlier of the completion of the initial business combination or . Additionally, the maximum aggregate Contributions to the Trust Account shall not exceed based on up to twelve monthly Contributions through August 12, 2024. 

shares of Class A ordinary shareholders exercised their right to redemption at a per share redemption price of approximately . On August 18, 2023, a total of in redemption payments were made in connection with this redemption. Following the redemption, the Company had a total of shares of Class A ordinary shares outstanding. 
 On August 12, 2024, the Company held an extraordinary general meeting (the Extraordinary General Meeting and approved a proposal, by special resolution, to amend the Company s amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association to extend the date by which the Company has to consummate a business combination for an additional nine months from August 12, 2024 to May 12, 2025. In connection with the vote to extend the date by which the Company has to consummate a business combination, the holders of Class A Ordinary shares properly exercised their rights to redeem their shares for cash at a redemption price of approximately per share, for an aggregate redemption amount of approximately . Following the redemption, the Company had a total of shares of Class A ordinary shares outstanding. Lastly, in connection with the Extraordinary Meeting, the Company agreed to waive its right under its amended and restated memorandum and articles of association to withdraw up to of the interest earned on the funds held in the trust account established in connection with the Company s IPO to pay dissolution expenses in the event of the liquidation of the trust account. 
 If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the combination period, the Company will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but no more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-
 share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay taxes (less up to of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholder s rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the remaining shareholders and the Company s board of directors, proceed to commence a voluntary liquidation and thereby a formal dissolution of the Company, subject in each case to its obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of applicable law. In the event the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period, and in such event, the funds held in the Trust Account that will be available to fund the redemption of the Public Shares. In the event of such distribution, it is possible that the per share value of the assets remaining available for distribution will be less than the Public Initial Offering price per Unit of . 
 The Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to the Company if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has entered into a written letter of intent, confidentiality or similar agreement or Business Combination agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below the lesser of (i) per Public Share and (ii) the actual amount per Public Share held in the Trust Account as of the day of liquidation of the Trust Account, if less than per share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, less taxes payable, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party or prospective target business who executed a waiver of any and all rights to monies held in the Trust Account (whether or not such waiver is enforceable) nor will it apply to any claims under the Company s indemnity of the underwriter of Proposed Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ). However, the Company has not asked the Sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor has the Company independently verified whether the Sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and believe that the Sponsor s only assets are securities of the Company. Therefore, the Company cannot assure its shareholders that the Sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. None of the Company s officers or directors will indemnify the Company for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses. The Company will seek to reduce the possibility that the Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which the Company does business, execute agreements with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account. 
 Liquidity, Capital Resources, and Going Concern Consideration 

 As of September 30, 2024, the Company had in cash and a working capital deficit of . 

outstanding under any Working Capital Loans. 
 Prior to the completion of the Initial Public Offering, the Company lacked the liquidity it needed to sustain operations for a reasonable period of time, which is considered to be one year from the issuance date of the financial statement. However, the Company completed its Initial Public Offering, as detailed in Note 3, which generated capital in excess of the funds deposited into a trust account. This excess capital may be used by the Company for general working capital purposes. 
 In connection with the Company s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with the authoritative guidance in Financial Accounting Standard Board FASB Accounting Standards Update ASU 2014-15,
 Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern. The Company originally had until August 12, 2023, 15 months from the closing of the IPO, to consummate a Business Combination. As approved by its shareholders, the Company extended the time to complete a Business Combination to May 12, 2025 (31 months from the closing of the IPO). It is uncertain that the Company will be able to consummate a Business Combination by the specified period. If a Business Combination is not consummated by May 12, 2025, there will be a mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution. The liquidity condition and date for mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern one year from the date that this financial statement is issued. This financial statement does not include any adjustments relating to the recovery of the recorded assets or the classification of the liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 
 Risks and Uncertainties 

 Management is currently evaluating the impact of rising interest rates, inflation, the Russia-Ukraine war and the conflict in Israel and Palestine on the industry and has concluded that while it is reasonably possible that any of these could have a negative effect on the Company s financial position, results of its operations and/or search for a target company, the specific impact is not readily determinable as of the date of these unaudited condensed financial statements. The unaudited condensed financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 
 Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 

 The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, enacted in August 2022, imposes a excise tax on the fair market value of stock repurchased by covered corporations beginning in 2023, with certain exceptions (the Excise Tax ). The Excise Tax is imposed on the repurchasing corporation itself, not its shareholders. Because we are a blank check Cayman Islands corporations with no subsidiaries or previous merger or acquisition activity, we are not currently a covered corporation for this purpose. The amount of the Excise Tax is generally equal to of the fair market value of the shares repurchased at the time of the repurchase. However, for purposes of calculating the Excise Tax, repurchasing corporations are permitted to net the fair market value of certain new stock issuances against the fair market value of stock repurchases during the same taxable year. In addition, there are certain other exceptions to the Excise Tax. The U.S. Department of the Treasury has been given authority to issue regulations or other guidance to carry out, and to prevent the avoidance of, the Excise Tax. The Treasury and the IRS recently have issued preliminary guidance regarding the application of this excise tax, but there can be no assurance that this guidance will be finally adopted in its current form. A repurchase that occurs in connection with a business combination with a U.S. target company might be subject to the Excise Tax, depending on the structure of the business combination and other transactions that might be engaged in during the relevant year.

 warrants issued in connection with the Initial Public Offering (the Private Warrants and the Public Warrants) in accordance with the guidance contained in ASC 480 and ASC 815-40,
 Derivatives and Hedging. Such guidance provides that because the warrants do not meet the criteria for equity treatment thereunder, each warrant must be recorded as a liability. Accordingly, the Company will classify each warrant as a liability at its fair value. This liability is subject to re-measurement
 at each balance sheet date. With each such remeasurement, the warrant liability will be adjusted to fair value, with the change in fair value recognized in the Company s statement of operations.

days after the consummation of a Business Combination. The Public Warrants will expire from the consummation of a Business Combination or earlier upon redemption or liquidation. 
 The Company will not be obligated to deliver any Class A ordinary shares pursuant to the exercise of a Public Warrant and will have no obligation to settle such Public Warrant exercise unless a registration statement under the Securities Act covering the issuance of the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants is then effective and a prospectus relating thereto is current, subject to the Company satisfying its obligations with respect to registration. No Public Warrant will be exercisable for cash or on a cashless basis, and the Company will not be obligated to issue any shares to holders seeking to exercise their Public Warrants, unless the issuance of the shares upon such exercise is registered or qualified under the securities laws of the state of the exercising holder, or an exemption from registration is available. 
 The Company has agreed that as soon as practicable, but in no event later than business days, after the closing of a Business Combination, it will use its best efforts to file with the SEC a registration statement registering the issuance, under the Securities Act, of the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants. The Company will use its best efforts to file with the SEC a registration statement covering the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants, to cause such registration statement to become effective and to maintain a current prospectus relating to those Class A ordinary shares until the warrants expire or are redeemed, as specified in the warrant agreement. If a registration statement covering the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants is not effective by the th business day after the closing of a Business Combination, warrant holders may, until such time as there is an effective registration statement and during any period when the Company will have failed to maintain an effective registration statement, exercise warrants on a cashless basis in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act or another exemption. 
 Redemption of warrants when the price per Class A ordinary share equals or exceeds . Once the warrants become exercisable, the Company may redeem the Warrants for redemption:

 day period ending three
 business days before the Company sends the notice of redemption to the warrant holders.
 The Company will not redeem the warrants as described above unless an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the issuance of the Class A ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants is then effective and a current prospectus relating to those Class A ordinary shares is available throughout the 30-day
 redemption period. If and when the warrants become redeemable by us, the Company may exercise its redemption right even if the Company is unable to register or qualify the underlying securities for sale under all applicable state securities laws.

Accordingly, the warrants may expire worthless. If the Company calls the Public Warrants for redemption, management will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise the Public Warrants to do so on a cashless basis, as described in the warrant agreement. The exercise price and number of ordinary shares issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants may be adjusted in certain circumstances including in the event of a stock dividend, extraordinary dividend or recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation. If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and the Company liquidates the funds held in the Trust Account, holders of warrants will not receive any of such funds with respect to their warrants, nor will they receive any distribution from the Company s assets held outside of the Trust Account with respect to such warrants. Accordingly, the warrants may expire worthless. 
 In addition, if (x) the Company issues additional Class A ordinary shares or equity-linked securities for capital raising purposes in connection with the closing of its initial Business Combination at an issue price or effective issue price of less than per Class A ordinary share (with such issue price or effective issue price to be determined in good faith by the Company s board of directors and, in the case of any such issuance to the Sponsor or its affiliates, without taking into account any Founder Shares held by the Sponsor or such affiliates, as applicable, prior to such issuance) (the Newly Issued Price ), (y) the aggregate gross proceeds from such issuances represent more than of the total equity proceeds, and interest thereon, available for the funding of the Company s initial Business Combination on the date of the consummation of such initial Business Combination (net of redemptions), and (z) the volume weighted average trading price of the Company s ordinary shares during the trading day period starting on the trading day prior to the day on which the Company consummates its initial Business Combination (such price, the Market Value is below per share, the exercise price of the warrants will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to of the higher of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price and the per share redemption trigger price described above will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to of the greater of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price.

 basis, subject to adjustment for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like. In the case that additional Class A ordinary shares, or equity linked securities, are issued or deemed issued in connection with the initial Business Combination, the ratio at which Class B ordinary shares shall convert into Class A ordinary shares will be adjusted (unless the holders of a majority of the outstanding Class B ordinary shares agree to waive such adjustment with respect to any such issuance or deemed issuance) so that the number of Class A ordinary shares issuable upon conversion of all Class B ordinary shares will equal, in the aggregate, on an as converted basis, of the sum of the total number of all ordinary shares outstanding as of the Initial Public Offering plus all Class A ordinary shares and equity linked securities issued or deemed issued in connection with a Business Combination (excluding any shares or equity linked securities issued, or to be issued, to any seller in a Business Combination, and any private placement-equivalent warrants issued to the Sponsor or its affiliates upon conversion of loans made to the Company).

 The Company established the initial fair value of the warrants on May 12, 2022, the date of the consummation of the Company s IPO. The Company used a Binomial Option Pricing model to value the warrants. The Company allocated the proceeds received from (i) the sale of the Units (which is inclusive of one share of Class A ordinary shares and one-half
 of one Public Warrant), (ii) the sale of Private Placement Warrants, and (iii) the issuance of Class B ordinary shares, first to the warrants based on their fair values as determined at initial measurement, with the remaining proceeds allocated to Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption (temporary equity), Class A ordinary shares (permanent equity) and Class B ordinary shares (permanent equity) based on their relative fair values at the initial measurement date.

 The Private Placement Warrants were initially and subsequently valued using a Binomial Option Pricing model, which is considered to be a Level 3 fair value measurement. The fair value of Public Warrants issued in connection with the Initial Public Offering were initially measured using a Binomial Option Pricing model and at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 are measured based on the listed market price of such warrants, a Level 1 measurement. 
 The Binomial Option Pricing model s primary unobservable input utilized in determining the fair value of the Warrants is the expected volatility as of the IPO date was derived from observable warrant pricing on comparable blank check companies without an identified target. The expected volatility as of subsequent valuation dates was implied from the Company s own public warrant pricing.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS References in this report (the Quarterly Report to we, us or the Company refer to Investcorp AI Acquisition Corp. References to our management or our management team refer to our officers and directors, and references to the Sponsor refer to ICE I Holdings Pte. Ltd. The following discussion and analysis of the Company s financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed financial statements and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. Certain information contained in the discussion and analysis set forth below includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Overview We are a blank check company incorporated on February 19, 2021, as a Cayman Islands exempted company and formed for the purpose of effectuating a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to throughout this Annual Report as our initial business combination . While we may pursue an initial business combination target in any industry, we intend to focus our search on companies within the Indian market. We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using remaining cash in the trust account from the proceeds of the offering and the private placement of the Private Placement Warrants (as defined below), the proceeds of the sale of our shares in connection with our initial business combination (pursuant to forward purchase agreements or backstop agreements we may enter into following the consummation of the Initial Public Offering or otherwise), shares issued to the owners of the target, debt issued to bank or other lenders or the owners of the target, or a combination of the foregoing. Recent Developments On October 1, 2024, Bigtincan Holdings Limited BTH issued a press release announcing a non-binding proposal submitted to BTH by the Company to consummate a business combination. On October 11, 2024, the Company issued a press release announcing the conclusion of its diligence work and negotiations with BTH in connection with an offer made by IVCA to consummate a business combination with BTH. On October 15, 2024, the Company held an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders (the Extraordinary General Meeting and approved the proposal to change the Company s name from Investcorp India Acquisition Corp to Investcorp AI Acquisition Corp. Subsequent to the approval for the name change proposal, the Company filed an amendment to the Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association with the Cayman Islands Registrar of Companies. On October 21, 2024, the Company issued a press release announcing the execution of a business combination agreement and a scheme implementation deed, each dated October 20, 2024 and each by and among the SPAC, Bigtincan Holdings Limited, an Australian public company listed on the Australian Securities Exchange with Australian Company Number 154 944 797. On October 28, 2024, the Company and Bigtincan Holdings Limited issued a joint press release announcing the release of a question and answer webcast in connection with the previously announced business combination and scheme implementation deed. If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination prior to May 12, 2025, the Company will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but no more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholder s rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the remaining shareholders and the Company s board 
 23 

of directors, proceed to commence a voluntary liquidation and thereby a formal dissolution of the Company, subject in each case to its obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of applicable law. In the event the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and, in such event, the funds held in the Trust Account that will be available to fund the redemption of the Public Shares. In the event of such distribution, it is possible that the per share value of the assets remaining available for distribution will be less than the Public Initial Offering price per Unit of 10.00. The Sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to the Company if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has entered into a written letter of intent, confidentiality or similar agreement or Business Combination agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below the lesser of (i) 10.30 per Public Share and (ii) the actual amount per Public Share held in the Trust Account as of the day of liquidation of the Trust Account, if less than 10.30 per share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, less taxes payable, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party or prospective target business who executed a waiver of any and all rights to monies held in the Trust Account (whether or not such waiver is enforceable) nor will it apply to any claims under the Company s indemnity of the underwriter of Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act ). However, the Company has not asked the Sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor has the Company independently verified whether the Sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and believe that the Sponsor s only assets are securities of the Company. Therefore, the Company cannot assure its shareholders that the Sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. None of the Company s officers or directors will indemnify the Company for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses. The Company will seek to reduce the possibility that the Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses or other entities with which the Company does business, execute agreements with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account. Results of Operations We have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenues to date. Our only activities for the period from February 19, 2021 (inception) through September 30, 2024, were organizational activities, those necessary to prepare for the Initial Public Offering, described below, and after our Initial Public Offering, identifying target companies for a business combination. We do not expect to generate any operating revenues until after the completion of our initial business combination. We generate non-operating income in the form of interest income on cash and cash equivalents held after the Initial Public Offering. We incur expenses as a result of being a public company (for legal, financial reporting, accounting and auditing compliance), as well as due diligence expenses. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had net loss of 229,238, which consists of operating costs of 614,608, offset by interest earned from marketable securities held in the Trust Account of 965,870 and a loss due to change in fair value of warrants of 580,500. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, we had net income of 1,210,015, which consists of operating costs of 461,510, loss due to change in fair value of warrants of 831,938, offset by interest earned from investments held in the Trust Account of 2,503,463. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had net income of 1,786,538, which consists of operating costs of 1,127,875, offset by interest earned from marketable securities held in the Trust Account of 3,785,163 and a loss due to change in fair value of warrants of 870,750. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we had net income of 6,755,292, which consists of operating costs of 1,307,228, loss due to change in fair value of warrants of 552,038, offset by interest earned from investments held in the Trust Account of 8,614,558. Liquidity, Capital Resources, and Going Concern Consideration As of September 30, 2024, the Company had 73,202 in cash and a working capital deficit of 3,122,377. 
 24 

On May 12, 2022, we consummated the Initial Public Offering of 22,500,000 Class A Public Shares at 10.00 per Public Share, generating gross proceeds of 225,000,000. Additionally, the underwriter exercised their over-allotment option, resulting in an additional 3,375,000 Units issued for an aggregate amount of 33,750,000. Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, we consummated the sale of 14,400,000 Private Placement Warrants at a price of 1.00 per Private Placement Warrant in a private placement to ICE I Holdings Pte, Ltd. (the Sponsor ), generating gross proceeds of 14,400,000. In connection with the underwriter s exercise of their over-allotment option, the Company also consummated the sale of an additional 1,687,500 Private Placement Warrants at 1.00 per Private Placement Warrant generating total proceeds of 1,687,500. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash used in operating activities was 683,575. Net income of 1,786,536 was affected by a gain on the change in the fair value of the warrant liability of 870,750 and interest income of 3,785,163. Changes in operating assets and liabilities used 444,302 of cash for operating activities. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, cash used in operating activities was 605,151. Net income of 6,755,292 was affected by a gain on the change in the fair value of the warrant liability of 552,038 and interest income of 8,614,558. Changes in operating assets and liabilities used 702,077 of cash for operating activities. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash held in the Trust Account of 17,169,326. Interest income on the balance in the Trust Account may be used by us to pay taxes. We intend to use substantially all of the funds held the Trust Account and the proceeds from the sale of the forward purchase shares to complete our Business Combination. To the extent that our share capital or debt is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to complete our Business Combination, the remaining proceeds held in the Trust Account will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses, make other acquisitions and pursue our growth strategies. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash of 73,202 held outside of the Trust Account. We intend to use the funds held outside the Trust Account primarily to identify and evaluate target businesses, perform business due diligence on prospective target businesses, travel to and from the offices, properties, or similar locations of prospective target businesses or their representatives or owners, review corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses, and structure, negotiate and complete a Business Combination. In order to finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Company s Sponsor, an affiliate of the Sponsor, or the Company s officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds as may be required (the Working Capital Loans ). Such Working Capital Loans would be evidenced by promissory notes. The notes would either be repaid upon consummation of a Business Combination, without interest, or, at the lender s discretion, up to 3,000,000 of notes may be converted upon consummation of a Business Combination into warrants at a price of 1.00 per warrant. The warrants will be identical to the Private Placement Warrants. In the event that a Business Combination does not close, the Company may use a portion of proceeds held outside the Trust Account to repay the Working Capital Loans but no proceeds held in the Trust Account would be used to repay the Working Capital Loans. In connection with the Company s assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with ASU 2014-15, Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, the Company has until May 12, 2025, 32 months from the closing of the IPO, to consummate a Business Combination unless an extension is granted. It is uncertain that the Company will be able to consummate an initial Business Combination within this time. If an initial Business Combination is not consummated within this time, there will be a mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution of the Company. Management has determined that the liquidity condition and mandatory liquidation, should an initial Business Combination not occur, and potential subsequent dissolution raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. No adjustments have been made to the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities should the Company be required to liquidate after May 12, 2025. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K and did not have any commitments or contractual obligations.

Contractual Obligations We do not have any long-term debt obligations, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations, purchase obligations or other long-term liabilities, other than described below: Registration Rights The holders of the Founder Shares, Private Placement Warrants and warrants that may be issued upon conversion of Working Capital Loans (and any Class A ordinary shares issuable upon the exercise of the Private Placement Warrants) will have registration rights to require the Company to register a sale of any of its securities held by them pursuant to a registration rights agreement. The holders of these securities are entitled to make up to three demands, excluding short form demands, that the Company register such securities. In addition, the holders have certain piggy-back registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to the completion of a business combination. The Company will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements. Working Capital Loans In order to finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Company s Sponsor, an affiliate of the Sponsor, or the Company s officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds as may be required (the Working Capital Loans ). Such Working Capital Loans would be evidenced by promissory notes. The notes would either be repaid upon consummation of a Business Combination, without interest, or, at the lender s discretion, up to 3,000,000 of notes may be converted upon consummation of a Business Combination into warrants at a price of 1.00 per warrant. The warrants will be identical to the Private Placement Warrants. In the event that a Business Combination does not close, the Company may use a portion of proceeds held outside the Trust Account to repay the Working Capital Loans but no proceeds held in the Trust Account would be used to repay the Working Capital Loans. On December 8, 2023, the Company entered into a non-interest bearing convertible unsecured loan in the principal amount of up to 3,000,000 from the Sponsor to provide the Company with additional working capital and to fund the Extension Contributions. The Loan constitutes a Working Capital Loan as defined above. The loan does not bear any interest and will be repayable by the Company to the Sponsor upon the earlier of: (i) promptly after the date the business combination is consummated and (ii) August 12, 2024. The portion of the Loan used to provide the Company with additional working capital will not be deposited into the Trust Account. If the Company does not consummate an initial business combination during the Extension Period, the Loan will be repaid only from funds held outside of the Trust Account or will be forfeited, eliminated or otherwise forgiven. The Loan is convertible into private placement warrants at a price of 1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. Such warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants in connection with the initial public offering. The conversion option represents an embedded derivative under ASC 815-15, Embedded Derivatives. The Company has determined that based on the valuation of its Private Placement Warrants and the fact that a Business Combination is not considered probable until such time as it is consummated, the value of this conversion option is de minimis. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there was 780,000 and 300,000 outstanding, respectively. Promissory Note Related Party On March 12, 2021, the Sponsor agreed to loan the Company an aggregate of up to 300,000 to cover expenses related to the Initial Public Offering pursuant to a promissory note (the Note ). The Note is non-interest bearing and is payable on the earlier of (i) December 31, 2021 (which was amended to September 30, 2022, on January 25, 2022), or (ii) the consummation of the Initial Public Offering. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were no amounts outstanding on the Note and it is no longer available to the Company. Convertible Promissory Note - Sponsor On August 9, 2023, the Sponsor agreed to loan the Company an aggregate of up to 1,200,000 to cover expenses related to the Contributions (the 2023 Note ). The note is non-interest bearing and is payable on the earlier of (i) May 12, 2024, or (ii) the consummation of a Business Combination. Upon receiving notice of the closing of a Business Combination, the Sponsor shall convert the unpaid principal balance of the 2023 Note into a number of non-transferable, non-redeemable ordinary shares of the Company equal to (x) the principal amount of the 2023 Note being converted, divided by (y) the conversion price of 10.00, rounded up to the nearest whole number of shares. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the outstanding principal balance was 1,300,000 and 500,000, respectively.

Underwriter s Agreement The Company granted the underwriter a 45-day option to purchase up to 3,375,000 additional Units to cover over-allotments at the Initial Public Offering price, less the underwriting discounts and commissions. Concurrently with the consummation of the IPO, the underwriters exercised the over- allotment option to purchase an additional 3,375,000 units. Critical Accounting Estimates This management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to fair value of financial instruments and accrued expenses. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The Company has identified the following as its critical accounting estimates: Class A Ordinary Shares Subject to Possible Redemption The Company accounts for its Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption in accordance with the guidance in ASC 480. Class A ordinary shares subject to mandatory redemption (if any) are classified as liability instruments and are measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable Class A ordinary shares (including Class A ordinary shares that feature redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within the Company s control) are classified as temporary equity. At all other times, Class A ordinary shares are classified as shareholders equity. The Company s Class A ordinary shares feature certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of the Company s control and subject to the occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, the Class A ordinary shares is subject to possible redemption and is presented as temporary equity, outside of the shareholders equity section of the Company s balance sheet. On August 11, 2023 shareholders of the Company held an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders (the Extraordinary General Meeting ). At the Extraordinary General Meeting, the Company s shareholders approved the proposal to amend the Company s Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association to give the Company the right to extend the date by which it has to consummate a business combination from August 12, 2023 to August 12, 2024. At the Extraordinary General Meeting, the shareholders of record were provided the opportunity to exercise their redemption rights (the Extension Amendment Proposal ). Holders of 16,085,554 shares of Class A ordinary shareholders exercised their right to redemption at a per share redemption price of approximately 10.74. On August 18, 2023, a total of 172,774,717 in redemption payments were made in connection with this redemption. Following the redemption, the Company had a total of 9,789,446 shares of Class A ordinary shares outstanding. On August 12, 2024, the Company held an extraordinary general meeting (the Extraordinary General Meeting and approved a proposal, by special resolution, to amend the Company s amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association to extend the date by which the Company has to consummate a business combination for an additional nine months from August 12, 2024 to May 12, 2025. In connection with the vote to extend the date by which the Company has to consummate a business combination, the holders of 8,314,066 Class A Ordinary shares properly exercised their rights to redeem their shares for cash at a redemption price of approximately 11.40 per share, for an aggregate redemption amount of approximately 95,447,584. Following the redemption, the Company had a total of 1,475,380 shares of Class A ordinary shares outstanding. 
 27 

The Company recognizes changes in redemption value immediately as they occur and adjusts the carrying value of redeemable ordinary shares to equal the redemption value at the end of each reporting period. Increases or decreases in the carrying amount of redeemable ordinary shares are affected by charges against additional paid in capital (to the extent available) and accumulated deficit. Warrants The Company accounts for the Warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the specific terms of the Warrants and the applicable authoritative guidance in ASC 480, and ASC 815. The assessment considers whether they are freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and meet all of the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the Warrants are indexed to the Company s own ordinary shares and whether the holders of the Warrants could potentially require net cash settlement in a circumstance outside of the Company s control, among other conditions for equity classification. This assessment, which requires the use of professional judgment, is conducted at the time of issuance of the Warrants and as of each subsequent quarterly period end date while the Warrants are outstanding. For issued or modified warrants that meet all of the criteria for equity classification, such warrants are required to be recorded as a component of additional paid-in capital at the time of issuance. For issued or modified warrants that do not meet all the criteria for equity classification, such warrants are required to be recorded at their initial fair value on the date of issuance, and each balance sheet date thereafter. Changes in the estimated fair value of liability-classified warrants are recognized as a non-cash gain or loss on the statements of operations. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06 Debt Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging Contracts in Entity s Own Equity (Subtopic 815 40) ASU 2020-06 ). ASU 2020-06 simplifies the accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity, including convertible instruments and contracts on an entity s own equity. The ASU is part of the FASB s simplification initiative, which aims to reduce unnecessary complexity in GAAP. The ASU s amendments are effective for smaller reporting companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted ASU 2020-06 on January 1, 2024. The adoption of ASU 2020-06 did not have a material impact on the Company s unaudited condensed financial statements and disclosures. In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. ASU 2023-09 requires additional quantitative and qualitative income tax disclosures to enable financial statements users better assess how an entity s operations and related tax risks and tax planning and operational opportunities affect its tax rate and prospects for future cash flows. For public business entities, ASU 2023-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, which will be fiscal 2025 for us. The Company expects the adoption to result in disclosure changes only. Management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the Company s financial statements. JOBS Act On April 5, 2012, the JOBS Act was signed into law. The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, relax certain reporting requirements for qualifying public companies. We will qualify as an emerging growth company and under the JOBS Act will be allowed to comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements based on the effective date for private (not publicly traded) companies. We are electing to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards, and as a result, we may not comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. As such, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates. 
 28 

Additionally, we are in the process of evaluating the benefits of relying on the other reduced reporting requirements provided by the JOBS Act. Subject to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, if, as an emerging growth company, we choose to rely on such exemptions we may not be required to, among other things, (i) provide an auditor s attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404, (ii) provide all of the compensation disclosure that may be required of non-emerging growth public companies under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, (iii) comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the PCAOB regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (auditor discussion and analysis) and (iv) disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the CEO s compensation to median employee compensation. These exemptions will apply for a period of five years following the completion of our Initial Public Offering or until we are no longer an emerging growth company, whichever is earlier. ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information otherwise required under this item. ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our current chief executive officer and chief financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d- 15(e) under the Exchange Act. Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that, during the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024, because of an identified material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. The material weakness identified relates to an ineffective review control to prevent or detect a material misstatement, which resulted in a material adjustment to accrued expenses in relation to the filing of its Form 8-K on May 26, 2022 and an overaccrual of legal fees in the year ended December 31, 2023. The Company, with the oversight of its Audit Committee, is actively undertaking remediation efforts to address the material weakness identified above and is developing measures and controls to prevent a re-occurrence of such a deficiency in the future. The Company is committed to maintaining an effective internal control environment, and although it has made progress in this area, additional steps need to be taken, as indicated above, and sufficient time needs to elapse before management can conclude that the newly implemented controls are operating effectively and that the material weakness has been adequately remediated. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 29 

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS None. ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those in this Quarterly Report are any of the risks described in (i) our final prospectus for our Initial Public Offering filed with the SEC on May 10, 2022, and (ii) our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on April 17, 2024. Any of these factors could result in a significant or material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Additional risk factors not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business or results of operations. As of the date of this Quarterly Report, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in (i) our final prospectus for our Initial Public Offering filed with the SEC on May 10, 2022 or (ii) our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on April 17, 2024, except we may disclose changes to such factors or disclose additional factors from time to time in our future filings with the SEC.

ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities In March 2021, our Sponsor purchased 7,187,500 Class B ordinary shares, par value 0.0001, for an aggregate price of 25,000. In March 2022, our sponsor surrendered, for no consideration, 718,750 founder shares, resulting in our sponsor holding 6,468,750 founder shares for an aggregate purchase price of 25,000 or approximately 0.0039 per share. On May 12, 2022, we consummated the Initial Public Offering of 22,500,000 unit, at 10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of 225,000,000. Additionally, the underwriter exercised their over-allotment option, resulting in an additional 3,375,000 Units issued for an aggregate amount of 33,750,000. Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, pursuant to the Private Placement Warrants Purchase Agreements, the Company completed the private sale of 16,087,500 warrants to the Sponsor at a purchase price of 1.00 per Private Placement Warrant, generating gross proceeds to the Company of 16,087,500. The Private Placement Warrants are identical to the Warrants included as part of the Units sold in the IPO. No underwriting discounts or commissions were paid with respect to such sale. The issuance of the Private Placement Warrants was made pursuant to the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Use of Proceeds In connection with the Initial Public Offering, we incurred offering costs of 6,037,027, consisting of 5,175,000 of underwriting fees, and 862,027 of other offering costs. After deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and the Initial Public Offering expenses, 266,512,500 of the net proceeds from our Initial Public Offering and from the Private Placement of the Private Placement Warrants was placed in the Trust Account. The net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and certain proceeds from the sale of the Private Placement Warrants are held in the Trust Account and invested as described in the initial public offering prospectus. There has been no material change in the planned use of the proceeds from the Initial Public Offering and Private Placement. Redemptions On August 12, 2024, a special meeting of the stockholders was held to extend the date by which the Company must consummate a business combination. In connection with this meeting, the stockholders of record were provided the opportunity to exercise their redemption rights. Holders of 8,314,066 Class A ordinary shares properly exercised their rights to redeem their shares for cash at a redemption price of approximately 11.40 per share, for an aggregate redemption amount of approximately 94,780,352. ITEM 3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES None. ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES Not applicable. ITEM 5. OTHER INFORMATION None.
