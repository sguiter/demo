Item 2. 

Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation

Overview of the Company s Activities and Risks

The Company s results of operations depend primarily on its net interest income, which is the difference between the income earned on the Company s loan and securities portfolios and its cost of funds, consisting of
 the interest paid on deposits and borrowings. Results of operations are also affected by the Company s provision for credit losses, noninterest income and noninterest expense. Noninterest income consists primarily of fees and service charges. The
 Company s noninterest expense consists principally of compensation and employee benefits, occupancy, equipment and data processing, and other operating expenses. Results of operations are also significantly affected by general economic and
 competitive conditions, changes in interest rates, as well as government policies and actions of regulatory authorities. Additionally, future changes in applicable law, regulations or government policies may materially affect the Company.

To operate successfully, the Company must manage various types of risk, including but not limited to, market or interest rate risk, credit risk, transaction risk, liquidity risk, security risk, strategic risk,
 reputation risk and compliance risk.

Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and/or interest rates. Since net interest income (the difference between interest earned on loans and investments and interest paid on deposits
 and borrowings) is the Company s primary source of revenue. Net interest income is affected by changes in interest rates as well as fluctuations in the level and duration of the Company s assets and liabilities.

Interest rate risk is the most significant market risk affecting the Company. It is the exposure of the Company s net interest income to adverse movements in interest rates. In addition to directly impacting net
 interest income, changes in interest rates can also affect the amount of new loan originations, the ability of borrowers and debt issuers to repay loans and debt securities, the volume of loan repayments and refinancing, and the flow and mix of
 deposits.

Credit risk is the risk to the Company s earnings and shareholders equity that results from customers, to whom loans have been made and to the issuers of debt securities in which the Company has invested, failing to
 repay their obligations. The magnitude of risk depends on the capacity and willingness of borrowers and debt issuers to repay and the sufficiency of the value of collateral obtained to secure the loans made or investments purchased.

Liquidity risk is the risk the Company may not be able to satisfy current or future financial commitments or may become unduly reliant on alternate funding sources. The Company s objective is to
 fund balance sheet growth while meeting the cash flow requirements of depositors. Management is responsible for liquidity monitoring and has available different sources of liquidity as requirements and demands change. These demands include loan
 growth and repayments, security purchases and maturities, deposit inflows and outflows, and payments on borrowings. Management continually monitors trends to identify patterns that might improve the predictability and timing of the Company s
 liquidity position.

Operational risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital arising from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems, the misconduct or errors of people, and adverse external events. Operational
 losses result from internal fraud; external fraud; employment practices and workplace safety, clients, products, and business practices; damage to physical assets; business disruption and system failures; and execution, delivery, and process
 management.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Regulation G, a rule adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), applies to certain SEC filings, including earnings releases, made by registered companies that contain non-GAAP financial measures. 
 GAAP is generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. Under Regulation G, companies making public disclosures containing non-GAAP financial measures must also disclose, along with each non-GAAP financial measure,
 certain additional information, including a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure to the closest comparable GAAP financial measure (if a comparable GAAP measure exists) and a statement of the Company s reasons for utilizing the non-GAAP
 financial measure as part of its financial disclosures. The SEC has exempted from the definition of non-GAAP financial measures certain commonly used financial measures that are not based on GAAP. When these exempted measures are included in
 public disclosures, supplemental information is not required. Financial institutions like the Company and its subsidiary banks are subject to an array of bank regulatory capital measures that are financial in nature but are not based on GAAP and
 are not easily reconcilable to the closest comparable GAAP financial measures, even in those cases where a comparable measure exists. The Company follows industry practice in disclosing its financial condition under these various regulatory capital
 measures, including period-end regulatory capital ratios for itself and its subsidiary banks, in its periodic reports filed with the SEC, and it does so without compliance with Regulation G, on the widely-shared assumption that the SEC regards such
 non-GAAP measures to be exempt from Regulation G. The Company uses in this Report additional non-GAAP financial measures that are commonly utilized by financial institutions and have not been specifically exempted by the SEC from Regulation G. The
 Company provides, as supplemental information, such non-GAAP measures included in this Report as described immediately below.

Tax-Equivalent Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin: Net interest income, as a component of the tabular presentation by financial institutions of Selected Financial
 Information regarding their recently completed operations, as well as disclosures based on that tabular presentation, is commonly presented on a tax-equivalent basis. That is, to the extent that some component of the institution's net interest
 income, which is presented on a before-tax basis, is exempt from taxation (e.g., is received by the institution as a result of its holdings of state or municipal obligations), an amount equal to the tax benefit derived from that component is added
 to the actual before-tax net interest income total. This adjustment is considered helpful in comparing one financial institution's net interest income to that of another institution or in analyzing any institution s net interest income trend line
 over time, to correct any analytical distortion that might otherwise arise from the fact that financial institutions vary widely in the proportions of their portfolios that are invested in tax-exempt securities, and that even a single institution
 may significantly alter over time the proportion of its own portfolio that is invested in tax-exempt obligations. Moreover, net interest income is itself a component of a second financial measure commonly used by financial institutions, net
 interest margin, which is the ratio of net interest income to average interest-earning assets. For purposes of this measure as well, tax-equivalent net interest income is generally used by financial institutions, again to provide a better basis of
 comparison from institution to institution and to better demonstrate a single institution s performance over time. While we present net interest income and net interest margin utilizing GAAP measures (no tax-equivalent adjustments) as a component
 of the tabular presentation within our disclosures, we do provide as supplemental information net interest income and net interest margin on a tax-equivalent basis.

Critical Accounting Policies

Critical accounting estimates as those estimates made in accordance with GAAP that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the
 financial condition or results of operations. The more significant of these policies are summarized in Note 1, Summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements presented
 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. Refer to Note 2, Recent Accounting Pronouncements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for recently adopted accounting standards.
 Not all significant accounting policies require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments. The allowance for credit losses on loans and unfunded commitments policies noted below are deemed the Company s critical accounting
 estimate.

30 

Index 

The allowance for credit losses consists of the allowance for credit losses for loans and unfunded commitments. The measurement of Current Expensed Credit Losses CECL on financial instruments requires an estimate
 of the credit losses expected over the life of an exposure (or pool of exposures). The estimate of expected credit losses under the CECL approach is based on relevant information about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable
 forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amounts. Historical loss experience is generally the starting point for estimating expected credit losses. The Company then considers whether the historical loss experience should be adjusted
 for asset-specific risk characteristics or current conditions at the reporting date that did not exist over the period from which historical experience was used. Finally, the Company considers forecasts about future economic conditions that are
 reasonable and supportable. The allowance for credit losses for loans, as reported in our consolidated statements of financial condition, are adjusted by a provision (expense) for credit losses, which is recognized in earnings, and reduced by the
 charge-off of loans, net of recoveries. The allowance for credit losses on unfunded commitments represents the expected credit losses on off-balance sheet commitments such as unfunded commitments to extend
 credit and standby letters of credit. However, a liability is not recognized for commitments unconditionally cancellable by the Company. The allowance for credit losses on unfunded commitments is determined by
 estimating future draws and applying the expected loss rates on those draws, and is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Company s consolidated statements of financial condition.

Management of the Company considers the accounting policy relating to the allowance for credit losses to be a critical accounting estimate given the uncertainty in evaluating the level of the allowance required to
 cover management s estimate of all expected credit losses over the expected contractual life of our loan portfolios. Determining the appropriateness of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that
 are inherently uncertain. Subsequent evaluations of the then-existing loan portfolios, in light of the factors then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the allowance for credit losses in those future periods. While management s current
 evaluation of the allowance for credit losses indicates that the allowance is appropriate, the allowance may need to be increased under adversely different conditions or assumptions. The allowance for credit losses is significantly influenced by
 the composition, characteristics and quality of our loan portfolios, as well as the prevailing economic conditions and forecasts utilized. Material changes to these and other relevant factors may result in volatility to the allowance for credit
 losses, and therefore, volatility to our reported earnings. This critical accounting policy and its application are periodically reviewed with the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors.

The Company s policies on the CECL method for allowance for credit losses are disclosed in Note 1, Summary of significant accounting
 policies with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes presented in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024.

Comparison of Financial Condition at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024

ASSETS

Total assets of the Company were 2.9 billion at September 30, 2024 and 2.8 billion at June 30, 2024, an increase of 48.8 million, or 1.7 . Securities available-for-sale and held-to-maturity increased 26.1
 million, or 2.5 , to 1.1 billion at September 30, 2024 as compared to 1.0 billion at June 30, 2024. Net loans receivable remained at 1.5 billion at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024.

 function of the daily account clearing needs and deposit levels as well as activities associated with securities transactions and loan funding. All of these items can cause cash levels to fluctuate significantly on a daily basis. The Company held
 excess cash balances for both quarter ends in response to the recent industry turmoil and has continued to maintain strong capital and liquidity positions as of September 30, 2024.

SECURITIES

Securities available-for-sale and held-to-maturity increased 26.1 million, or 2.5 , to 1.1 billion at September 30, 2024 as compared to 1.0 billion at June 30, 2024. Securities purchases totaled 115.2 million
 during the three months ended September 30, 2024, and consisted primarily of 77.4 million of state and political subdivision securities, 24.7 million of U.S. Treasury securities, 9.2 million of collateralized mortgage obligations and 3.9
 million of mortgage-backed securities. Principal pay-downs and maturities during the three months ended September 30, 2024 amounted to 97.0 million, primarily consisting of 66.5 million of state and political subdivision securities, 25.0
 million of U.S. Treasury securities, 4.5 million of mortgage-backed securities, and 683,000 of collateralized mortgage obligations. At September 30, 2024, 59.3 of our securities portfolio consisted of state and political subdivision securities
 to take advantage of tax savings and to promote the Company s participation in the communities in which it operates. Mortgage-backed securities, which represent 29.3 of our securities portfolio at September 30, 2024, do not contain sub-prime loans
 and are not exposed to the credit risk associated with such lending.

LOANS

Net loans receivable increased 1.2 million, or 0.1 , to 1.5 billion at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024. The loan growth experienced during the three months ended September 30, 2024, consisted primarily of
 15.3 million in commercial real estate loans and 1.7 million in home equity loans, partially offset by a decrease of 11.5 million in commercial loans, 3.8 million in residential real estate loans, and a 537,000 increase in the allowance for
 credit losses on loans. The Company continues to experience loan growth as a result of the continued growth in its customer base and its relationships with other financial institutions in originating loan participations. The Company continues to
 use a conservative underwriting policy in regards to all loan originations, and does not engage in sub-prime lending or other exotic loan products. Updated appraisals are obtained on loans when there is a reason to believe that there has been a
 change in the borrower s ability to repay the loan principal and interest, generally, when a loan is in a delinquent status. Additionally, if an existing loan is to be modified or refinanced, generally, an appraisal is ordered to ensure continued
 collateral adequacy.

Commercial real estate loans are the largest segment of the Company s loan portfolio and are comprised of 82.6 in non-owner occupied loans and 17.4 in owner occupied loans. These loans are generally
 secured by commercial, residential investment or industrial property types. The Company s commercial real estate loan portfolio generally consists of standalone loans supported by both sufficient cash flows and collateral. On a portfolio basis, the
 Company s non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans have a weighted average LTV of approximately 53.6 , and the Company s owner occupied commercial real estate loans have a weighted average LTV of approximately 49.9 , as of September 30,
 2024. The Company s commercial real estate loans are primarily made within our market area in Greene, Columbia, Albany, Ulster and Rensselaer Counties of New York State. The Company actively monitors the economic and credit trends for borrower
 industries and manages our commercial real estate portfolio concentrations to mitigate its credit risk exposure.

As of September 30, 2024, the Company s largest commercial real estate concentration was non-owner occupied multi-family loans at 248.2 million, or 26.1 of total commercial real estate
 loans. Non-owner occupied multi-family loans provide much needed housing for the residents located in our market area and have historically performed well with strong credit metrics. As of September 30, 2024, the weighted average LTV was
 approximately 55.3 for the non-owner occupied multi-family loan segment.

33 

Index 

As of September 30, 2024, non-owner occupied construction loans were 85.7 million, or 9.0 of total commercial real estate loans. Construction loans are typically 12 to 24 months in duration with active monitoring,
 which may include pre-engineering review and third party site inspections for more complex projects. High volatility commercial real estate loan exposure totaled 1.1 million, or 1.0 of the Company s construction exposure. Construction loans are
 primarily comprised of approximately 33.5 mixed use real estate, 23.1 multi-family buildings, 18.6 pre-construction and land loans, and 11.3 retail plaza.

The Company s outstanding balance of non-owner occupied commercial real estate office loans were 56.2 million, or 5.9 of total commercial real estate loans as of September 30, 2024. The office loans are primarily
 low-rise, non-metropolitan buildings, located within our geographic footprint. As of September 30, 2024, the weighted average LTV was approximately 62.9 for the non-owner occupied office loan segment.

ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES ON LOANS

The allowance for credit losses on loans (the ACL is established through a provision made periodically by charges or benefits to the provision for credit losses. This is necessary to maintain the ACL at a level
 which management believes is reasonably reflective of the overall loss expected over the contractual life of the loan portfolio. Management has an established ACL policy to govern the use of judgments exercised in evaluating the ACL required to
 estimate the expected credit losses over the expected contractual life of the loan portfolios and the material effect that such judgments can have on the consolidated financial statements. While management uses available information to recognize
 losses on loans, additions or reductions to the allowance may fluctuate from one reporting period to another. These fluctuations are reflective of changes in the reasonable and supportable forecast, analysis of loans evaluated individually, and/or
 changes in management s assessment of factors.

The ACL is based on the results of life of loan quantitative models, reserves associated with collateral-dependent loans evaluated individually and adjustments for current conditions not accounted for in the
 quantitative models. The discounted cash flow methodology is used to calculate the CECL reserve for the residential real estate, commercial real estate, home equity and commercial loan segments. The remaining life method is utilized to determine
 the CECL reserve for the consumer loan segment. The Company elected to use the practical expedient to evaluate loans individually, if they are collateral dependent loans that are on non-accrual status with a balance of 250,000 or greater, which is
 consistent with regulatory requirements. The fair value of collateral for collateral dependent loans less selling expenses will be compared to the loan balance to determine if a CECL reserve is required. A qualitative factor framework has been
 developed to adjust the quantitative loss rates for asset-specific risk characteristics or current conditions at the reporting date.

The Company charges loans off against the ACL when it becomes evident that a loan cannot be collected within a reasonable amount of time or that it will cost the Company more than it will receive, and all possible
 avenues of repayment have been analyzed, including the potential of future cash flow, the value of the underlying collateral, and strength of any guarantors or co-borrowers. Generally, consumer loans and smaller business loans (not secured by real
 estate) in excess of 90 days are charged-off against the ACL, unless equitable arrangements are made. Included within consumer installment loan charge-offs and recoveries are deposit accounts that have been overdrawn in excess of 60 days. For loans
 secured by real estate, a charge-off is recorded when it is determined that the collection of all or a portion of a loan may not be collected and the amount of that loss can be reasonably estimated. The ACL is increased by a provision for credit
 losses (which results in a charge to expense) and recoveries of loans previously charged off, and is reduced by charge-offs.

Additional information about the ACL is included in Note 4, Loans and Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans , of the Company s 2024
 Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. Management considers the ACL to be appropriate based on evaluation and analysis of the loan portfolio. 

The ACL totaled 19.8 million at September 30, 2024, compared to 19.2 million at June 30, 2024. The ACL to total loans receivable was 1.32 at September 30, 2024 compared to
 1.28 at June 30, 2024. The increase in the ACL from September 30, 2024 to June 30, 2024 was attributable to unfavorable changes in the economic forecasts used in the Company s CECL modeling, primarily due to an
 increase in the Federal Reserve FOMC s median forecasted year over year U.S. civilian unemployment rate and a decrease in the annual change in the U.S. GDP. 

The allowance for credit losses on unfunded commitments as of September 30, 2024 was 1.6 million as compared to 1.3 million at June 30, 2024, an increase of 310,000. The increase in the reserve was primarily due
 to an increase in the contractual obligations to extend credit.

Index 

Non-accrual Loans and Non-performing Assets 

Non-performing assets consist of non-accrual loans, loans over 90 days past due and still accruing, other reals estate owned that has been acquired in partial or full satisfaction of the loan obligation or upon
 foreclosure, and non-performing securities.

Generally, management places loans on non-accrual status once the loans have become 90 days or more delinquent. A non-accrual loan is defined as a loan in which collectability is questionable and therefore interest
 on the loan will no longer be recognized on an accrual basis. A loan is not placed back on accrual status until the borrower has demonstrated the ability and willingness to make timely payments on the loan. A loan does not have to be 90 days
 delinquent in order to be classified as non-performing and may be placed on non-accrual when circumstances indicate that the borrower may be unable to meet the contractual principal or interest payments. The threshold for evaluating classified and
 non-performing loans specifically evaluated for individual credit loss is 250,000. Foreclosed real estate represents property acquired through foreclosure and is valued lower of the carrying amount or fair value, less any estimated disposal costs.
 The Company monitors loan modifications made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. As of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 there were three loans being monitored in the prior twelve months under ASU-2022-02 with a total amortized basis
 of 4.1 million.

DEPOSITS

Deposit flow is influenced by general economic conditions, changes in prevailing interest rates and competition. The diversity of deposit accounts offered allows the Company to be competitive in obtaining funds and
 responding to changes in consumer demand. The Company s emphasis is placed on acquiring locally, stable, low-cost deposits to fund high-quality loans without taking on unnecessary interest rate risk. The ability to attract and maintain deposits and
 the rates paid on these deposits are and will continue to be affected by market conditions.

Deposits totaled 2.5 billion at September 30, 2024 and 2.4 billion at June 30, 2024, an increase of 96.7 million, or 4.1 . The Company had zero brokered deposits at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024,
 respectively. NOW deposits increased 87.9 million, or 5.0 , certificates of deposits increased 17.9 million, or 12.9 , and noninterest-bearing deposits increased 7.4 million, or 5.9 , when comparing September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024. Savings

The Company s deposit base and liquidity position continues to be strong, and the deposit base is well diversified across segments to meet the transactional and investment needs of our customers. Municipal deposits
 are primarily from local New York State government entities, such as counties, cities, villages and towns, as well as school districts and fire departments. There is a seasonal component to municipal deposits levels associated with annual tax
 collections and fiscal spending patterns. In general, municipal balances increase at the end of the first and third quarters of our fiscal year. Municipal deposits above the FDIC insured limit are required to be collateralized by irrevocable
 municipal letters of credits issued by the Federal Home Loan Bank, municipal bonds, US Treasuries or government agency securities. Additionally, the Company offers large retail, business and municipal customers the ability to enhance FDIC insurance
 coverage, by electing to participate their deposit balance into a national deposit network.

The Company has many long-standing relationships with municipal entities throughout its market areas and their deposits have provided a stable funding source for the Company. The Company has a separate municipal
 department for the retention, management, and monitoring of municipal relationships.

Uninsured deposits represents the portion of deposit accounts that exceed the FDIC insurance limit. The Company calculates its uninsured deposit balances based on the methodologies and assumptions used for regulatory
 reporting requirements, which includes affiliate deposits and collateralized deposits.

The following table summarizes total uninsured deposits based on the same methodologies and assumptions used for the Bank s regulatory reporting:

Uninsured deposits after exclusions, represents 12.2 of total deposits as of September 30, 2024. The Company believes that this presentation provides a more accurate view of deposits at risk, given that affiliate
 deposits are not customer facing and therefore are eliminated upon consolidation, and collateralized deposits are fully secured by investments and municipal letters of credit. The Company continually monitors the level and composition of uninsured
 deposits.

BORROWINGS

At September 30, 2024, the Bank had pledged approximately 604.8 million of its residential and commercial mortgage portfolio as collateral for borrowing and irrevocable municipal letters of credit at the Federal
 Home Loan Bank of New York FHLB ). The maximum amount of funding available from the FHLB was 362.4 million at September 30, 2024, of which there were 4.8 million long-term fixed rate borrowings, 130.0 million irrevocable municipal letters of
 credit and 63.0 million in overnight borrowings outstanding at September 30, 2024. At June 30, 2024, the Bank had 115.3 million in overnight borrowings, and 9.2 million of long-term borrowings with the FHLB. Interest rates on overnight
 borrowings are determined at the time of borrowing. The irrevocable municipal letters of credit with the FHLB have been issued to secure municipal transactional deposit accounts, on behalf of Greene County Commercial Bank.

The FHLB term borrowings include long-term fixed rate borrowings from the FHLB 0 Development Advance (ZDA) Program. The Company receives a corresponding credit related to the FHLB term fixed rate borrowings, which
 effectively reduces the interest rate paid to zero percent. At September 30, 2024, the Bank had a FHLB long-term fixed rate borrowing of 4.8 million at a stated rate of 5.2 , maturing March 2025.

The Bank also pledges securities and certificates of deposit as collateral at the Federal Reserve Bank discount window for overnight borrowings and the Bank Term Funding Program BTFP ). The BTFP was established
 by the Federal Reserve Bank to provide additional funding to eligible depository institutions to meet the needs of their depositors. At September 30, 2024, approximately 41.3 million of collateral was available to be pledged against potential
 borrowings at the Federal Reserve Bank discount window and the BTFP, of which there were zero overnight borrowings outstanding with the discount window and 25.0 million outstanding with the BTFP. At September 30, 2024, the BTFP consisted of a
 25.0 million long-term borrowing at a stated rate of 4.8 , maturing in January 2025.

At June 30, 2024, there were zero overnight borrowings outstanding with the discount window and 25.0 million outstanding with the BTFP.

The Bank has established unsecured lines of credit with Atlantic Community Bankers Bank for 15.0 million and three other financial institutions for 75.0 million. The lines of credit provide for overnight borrowing
 and the interest rate is determined at the time of the borrowing. There were no borrowings outstanding with these lines of credit for the Bank at September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024.

On September 17, 2020, the Company entered into Subordinated Note Purchase Agreements SNPA with 14 qualified institutional investors, issued at 4.75 Fixed-to-Floating Rate due September 17, 2030, in the
 aggregate principal amount of 20.0 million, carried net of issuance costs of 424,000 amortized over a period of 60 months. These notes are callable on September 15, 2025. At September 30, 2024, there were 19.9 million of these Subordinated Note
 Purchases Agreements outstanding, net of issuance costs.

On September 15, 2021, the Company entered into Subordinated Note Purchase Agreements with 18 qualified institutional investors, issued at 3.00 Fixed-to-Floating Rate due September 15, 2031, in the aggregate
 principal amount of 30.0 million, carried net of issuance costs of 499,000 amortized over a period of 60 months. These notes are callable on September 15, 2026. At September 30, 2024, there were 29.8 million of these Subordinated Note Purchases
 Agreements outstanding, net of issuance costs.

The sales of the SNPAs were made in a private placement to accredited investors under the exemption from registration provided under Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 506. The Notes are not
 registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended ("Securities Act"), and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements.

For regulatory purposes, the Company allocated the SNPAs to The Bank of Greene County to qualify as Tier 1 capital subject to a 25 of capital limitation under risk-based capital guidelines. The
 portion that exceeds the 25 of capital limitation qualifies as Tier 2 capital.

At September 30, 2024, there were zero other long-term borrowings and therefore, no scheduled maturities of long-term borrowings.

Index 

EQUITY

Shareholders equity increased to 216.3 million at September 30, 2024 compared to 206.0 million at June 30, 2024, resulting primarily from net income of 6.3 million and a decrease in accumulated other
 comprehensive loss of 5.6 million, partially offset by dividends declared and paid of 1.5 million.

The Federal Reserve raised its target benchmark interest rate in 2022 and into the third quarter of calendar year 2023, resulting in subsequent prime lending rate increases of 525 basis points, and a significant
 increase in market rates between March 2022 and December 2023. If market interest rates rise, the fair value of the fixed income bond portfolio will decrease, resulting in additional unrealized losses, and depending on the extent of the rise in
 interest rates, the increase in unrealized losses could be significant. The non-credit portion of unrealized losses are recorded to Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, a component of Shareholders' Equity. A significant increase in market rates
 may have a negative impact on book value per share. The Company's bond portfolio is expected to mature at par and therefore the unrealized losses in the portfolio that result from higher market interest rates will decrease as the bonds become
 closer to maturity. However, if the Company were required to sell investment securities with an unrealized loss for any reason, including liquidity needs, the unrealized loss would become realized and reduce both net income for the reported period
 and regulatory capital, which as currently reported, excludes unrealized losses on investment securities.

As of the quarter ended September 30, 2024, market rates decreased as compared to June 30, 2024 due to the Federal Reserve cutting its target benchmark by 50 basis points at the September 2024 meeting. This resulted
 in the fair value of the fixed income bond portfolio to increase, and improve the unrealized loss position as of September 30, 2024.

On September 17, 2019, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted a stock repurchase program. Under the repurchase program, the Company may repurchase up to 400,000 shares of its common stock. Repurchases will be
 made at management s discretion at prices management considers to be attractive and in the best interests of both the Company and its stockholders, subject to the availability of stock, general market conditions, the trading price of the stock,
 alternative uses for capital, and the Company s financial performance. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company did not repurchase any shares.

GENERAL

Return on average assets and return on average equity are common methods of measuring operating results. Annualized return on average assets decreased to 0.93 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as
 compared to 0.99 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Annualized return on average equity decreased to 11.86 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 14.09 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The
 decrease in return on average assets and return on average equity for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily the result of the balance sheet growing at a faster rate than net income growth. Net income amounted to 6.3 million for
 the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 6.5 million at September 30, 2023, a decrease of 208,000. Average assets increased 58.2 million, or 2.2 , to 2.7 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 2.6
 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Average equity increased 27.5 million, or 15.0 , to 211.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 183.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

INTEREST INCOME

Interest income amounted to 27.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 24.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 3.1 million, or 12.6 . The increase
 in yields earned on loans and securities had the greatest impact on the increases in interest income when comparing the 2024 and 2023 periods. The average balances of loans also increased during the comparative periods contributing to higher
 interest income.

Average loan balances increased 60.4 million and the yield on loans increased 36 basis points when comparing the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The average balance of securities increased 13.7
 million and the yield on such securities increased 45 basis points when comparing the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Average interest-bearing bank balances and federal funds decreased 19.4 million and the yield increased 43 basis
 points when comparing the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

INTEREST EXPENSE

Interest expense amounted to 14.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 11.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 3.4 million, or 30.3 . The increase
 resulted from an increase of 64.1 million in the average balances of interest-bearing liabilities and increase in the average cost of funds. Increase in the cost of NOW deposits, certificates of deposits and insured cash sweep ICS deposits had
 the greatest impact on interest expense reflecting higher market interest rates when comparing the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

The cost of NOW deposits increased 54 basis points, the cost of certificates of deposit increased 49 basis points, and the cost of savings and money market deposits increased 19 basis points when comparing the three
 months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

The average balance of NOW deposits increased 47.7 million and the average balance of certificates of deposits increased 31.0 million, partially offset by a decrease in average savings and money market deposits of
 39.3 million when comparing the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Average borrowings increased 24.7 million when comparing the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Yields on interest-earning assets and costs of
 interest-bearing deposits increased for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as the Company repriced assets and deposits due to the higher interest rate environment. The Company determines interest rates offered on deposit accounts based on
 current and future economic conditions, competition, liquidity needs, the asset-liability position of the Company and growing the retention of relationships.

NET INTEREST INCOME

Net interest income decreased 303,000 to 13.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 13.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in net interest income was due to
 an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities, which increased 64.1 million when comparing the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and increases in rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities, which increased 53
 basis points when comparing the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The decrease in net interest income was partially offset by the increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets, which increased 54.7 million when comparing
 the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, and increases in interest rates on interest-earning assets, which increased 40 basis points when comparing the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

Net interest rate spread and margin both decreased when comparing the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Net interest rate spread decreased 13 basis points to 1.76 for the three months ended September
 30, 2024 as compared to 1.89 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Net interest margin decreased 9 basis points to 2.03 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 2.12 for the three months ended September 30, 2023.
 The decrease was due to the higher interest rate environment, which caused competitive pressure to increase rates paid on deposits, resulting in higher interest expense. This was partially offset by increases in interest income on securities and
 loans, as they reprice at higher yields and the interest rates earned on new balances were higher than the low levels from the prior periods.

41 

Index 

Net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis includes the additional amount of interest income that would have been earned if the Company s investment in tax-exempt securities and loans had been subject to
 federal and New York State income taxes yielding the same after-tax income. Tax equivalent net interest margin was 2.29 and 2.37 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

The Company closely monitors its interest rate risk, and the Company will continue to monitor and prudently manage the asset and liability mix to address the risks or potential negative effects of changes in interest
 rates. Management attempts to mitigate the interest rate risk through balance sheet composition. Several strategies are used to help manage interest rate risk such as maintaining a high level of liquid assets such as short-term federal funds sold
 and various investment securities and maintaining a high concentration of less interest-rate sensitive and lower-costing core deposits.

PROVISION FOR CREDIT LOSSES ON LOANS

Provision for credit losses on loans amounted to 634,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 457,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The loan provision for the three months
 ended September 30, 2024, was primarily attributable to updated economic forecasts used in the quantitative modeling as of September 30, 2024. The allowance for credit losses on loans to total loans receivable was 1.32 at September 30, 2024
 compared to 1.28 at June 30, 2024.

Loans classified as substandard and special mention totaled 59.0 million at September 30, 2024 and 48.6 million at June 30, 2024, an increase of 10.4 million. The increase in loans classified was primarily due to
 downgrades of commercial real estate loans during the period ended September 30, 2024, that were considered to be performing and paying in accordance with the terms of their loan agreements. Of the loans classified as substandard or special
 mention, 55.3 million were performing at September 30, 2024. There were no loans classified as doubtful or loss at September 30, 2024 or June 30, 2024.

Net charge-offs on loans amounted to 114,000 and 93,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, an increase of 21,000. There were no material charge-offs in any loan segment during
 the three months ended September 30, 2024. Net charge-offs to average loans was 0.03 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Net charge-offs to non-performing assets was 12.5 and 6.4 for the three months ended
 September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

 period was primarily due to an increase in fee income earned on customer interest rate swap contracts, and income from bank owned life insurance BOLI ). During the quarter ended December 31, 2023, the Company restructured 23 million of BOLI
 contracts, by surrendering and simultaneously purchasing new higher-yielding policies, which resulted in higher income derived from BOLI during the 2024 quarter.

Noninterest expense increased 705,000, or 8.0 , to 9.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 8.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase during the 2024
 quarter was primarily due to an increase of 387,000 in salaries and employee benefits, due to new positions created during the period to support the Company s continued growth, an increase of 176,000 in service and data processing fees due to
 vendor price negotiations in prior periods, and an increase of 285,000 in the reserve for credit losses on off-balance sheet unfunded commitments, due to the Company s increased contractual obligations to extend credit. This was partially offset
 by a decrease of 156,000 in computer software and support fees, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023.

INCOME TAXES

Provision for income taxes reflects the expected tax associated with the pre-tax income generated for the given period and certain regulatory requirements. The effective tax rate was 6.4 for the three months ended
 September 30, 2024 and 13.0 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The statutory tax rate is impacted by the benefits derived from tax-exempt bond and loan income, the Company s real estate investment trust subsidiary income, and income
 received on the bank owned life insurance, to arrive at the effective tax rate. The decrease in the current quarter s effective tax rate primarily reflects a higher mix of tax-exempt income from municipal bonds, tax advantage loans, bank owned life
 insurance in proportion to pre-tax income and h istoric preservation tax credits received on the Company s new wealth management center, located at 345 Main Street, in Catskill New York. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Market risk is the risk of loss in a financial instrument arising from adverse changes in market rates or prices such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, and equity prices. The
 Company s most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk since the majority of the Company s assets and liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates. The Company s primary sources of funds are deposits and proceeds from
 principal and interest payments on loans, mortgage-backed securities and debt securities, with lines of credit available through the Federal Home Loan Bank, Atlantic Community Bankers Bank and three other financial institutions, as needed. While
 maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit outflows, mortgage prepayments, and lending activities are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions and competition. At
 September 30, 2024, the Company had 213.5 million in cash and cash equivalents, representing 7.4 of total assets, and had 276.5 million available in unused lines of credit.

In response to liquidity concerns in the banking system, the Federal Reserve Board created the Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP). The program made additional funding available to eligible depository institutions to
 help assure the institutions can meet the needs of their depositors. Eligible institutions could obtain liquidity against a wide range of collateral. BTFP advances could be requested through March 11, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has
 25.0 million outstanding through the BTFP.

As needed, to enhance strong levels of liquidity and to fund loan demand, the Bank and Commercial Bank (the Banks may accept brokered deposits, generally in denominations of less than 250,000, from national
 brokerage networks, custodial deposit networks or through IntraFi s one-way CDARS and ICS products, including IntraFi s Insured Network Deposits IND ). The Banks combined can place and obtain brokered deposits up

to 30 of total deposits, in the amount of 745.8 million based on policy. Additionally, both Banks participate in the IntraFi reciprocal two-way CDARS and the ICS products, which provides for reciprocal two-way transactions among other
 institutions, facilitated by IntraFi, for the purpose of maximizing FDIC insurance for depositors.

The Company had zero brokered deposits as of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, respectively.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Not applicable to smaller reporting companies.

Item 4. 

Controls and Procedures

Our management, under the supervision and with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer (who is our principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (who is our principal financial and accounting
 officer), evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), at the end of the
 period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective
 to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports, that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange
 Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the
 Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
 disclosure.

There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that
 have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Because of its inherent limitations, management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and fraud.
 Any control system, is based upon assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objective will be met. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
 inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. No evaluation of control can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that
 all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, with the Company have been detected.
