 million for a members' interest in a newly formed limited liability company, CP LG Library Holdings, LLC CP LG ), with the Company designated as the managing member of CP LG. CP LG used the funds received from the Company, along with funds invested by the member, to acquire a library of films for approximately million. Also on June 5, 2024, the Company entered into a distribution agreement with CP LG to distribute the titles in the acquired library. The purchase included the film library (of which million of the purchase price was allocated to investment in film and television programs for the film library), accounts receivable and certain liabilities associated with the film library, most notably participations and residuals liabilities. 
 
 The Company determined that CP LG is a variable interest entity VIE for which it is the primary beneficiary and is consolidated under the applicable accounting guidance as the Company has the power to direct the significant activities and the right to receive benefits and obligation to absorb losses of CP LG. The Company concluded that the acquired library and related assets and liabilities was not a business and therefore, accounted for the acquisition as an initial consolidation of a VIE that is not a business under the applicable accounting guidance. There was gain or loss recognized upon initial consolidation of the VIE as the sum of the fair value of the consideration paid and noncontrolling interest equaled the fair value of the net assets on the acquisition date. See Note 9 for the noncontrolling interest recorded related to CP LG. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet included assets and liabilities of CP LG totaling million (which is primarily comprised of investment in film and television programs) and million, respectively. The assets and liabilities of CP LG primarily consist of accounts receivable, investment in film and television programs, and participations and residuals.

of the total shares of Lionsgate Studios continue to be held by the Company, while former SEAC public shareholders and founders and common equity financing investors own approximately of Lionsgate Studios. In addition to establishing Lionsgate Studios as a standalone publicly-traded entity, the transaction resulted in approximately million of gross proceeds to the Company, including million in private investments in public equities ("PIPE") financing, which amount excludes an aggregate of approximately million that remains due from a PIPE Investor that subscribed for common shares and which shares, as of September 30, 2024, are pending issuance subject to receipt of such amount. The net proceeds were used to partially pay down amounts outstanding under the Term Loan A and Term Loan B pursuant to the Credit Agreement (see Note 6). 
 
 The Business Combination has been accounted for as a reverse recapitalization in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Under this method of accounting, SEAC was treated as the acquired company and the Studio Business was treated as the acquirer for financial reporting purposes. Accordingly, for accounting purposes, the financial statements of Lionsgate Studios will represent a continuation of the financial statements of the Studio Business, with the Business Combination treated as the equivalent of the Studio Business issuing stock for the historical net assets of SEAC, substantially consisting of cash held in the trust account, accompanied by a recapitalization of the Studio Business equity. The historical net assets of SEAC were stated at fair value, which approximates historical cost, with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded. Operations prior to the Business Combination are those of the Studio Business. The Studio Business continues to be a consolidated subsidiary of the Company. 
 In connection with the Business Combination, as described above, approximately of the Lionsgate Studios common shares were issued to the SEAC public shareholders and founders and other common equity financing investors in exchange for net proceeds of million.

million and a reduction of accumulated other comprehensive income of million for the issuance of the Lionsgate Studios common shares, which was based upon the ownership interest in the carrying value of Lionsgate Studios. The reduction in noncontrolling interest was due to the negative carrying value of Lionsgate Studios as of May 13, 2024, partially offset by an amount allocated to certain options described below. The difference between the net cash proceeds and the amounts recorded as noncontrolling interest and accumulated other comprehensive income was reflected as a reduction of accumulated deficit in the consolidated statement of shareholders' equity (deficit). See Note 9. 
 In connection with the Business Combination, options (the "Sponsor Options") to receive Lionsgate Studios common shares, were issued to certain noncontrolling interest holders, with an exercise price of per share. The Sponsor Options will become exercisable (i) on or after the date on which the trading price of Lionsgate Studios common shares (as adjusted for share splits, share dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) equals or exceeds per share or (ii) if a Change of Control (as defined in the sponsor option agreement) occurs, subject to certain conditions. The Company has recorded the Sponsor Options as part of the noncontrolling interest recorded. 
 
 eOne Acquisition 
 
 On December 27, 2023, the Company, and its subsidiaries, Lions Gate Entertainment Inc., a Delaware corporation LGEI ), and Lions Gate International Motion Pictures S. .r.l., a Luxembourg soci t responsabilit limit e LGIMP and, with the Company and LGEI, collectively the Buyers ), completed the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding equity interests of the companies constituting the Entertainment One television and film eOne business from Hasbro, Inc., a Rhode Island corporation Hasbro ), pursuant to that certain Equity Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement dated August 3, 2023. The aggregate cash purchase price was initially approximately million and subsequently adjusted to million upon the settlement of certain working capital items pursuant to the Purchase Agreement. The final purchase price is subject to further adjustment based on the settlement of certain amounts held back pursuant to the Purchase Agreement. The acquisition of eOne, a film and television production and distribution company, builds the Company's film and television library, strengthens the Company's scripted and unscripted television business, and continues to expand the Company's presence in Canada and the U.K. 
 The acquisition was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting, with the financial results of eOne included in the Company's consolidated results from December 27, 2023. 
 
 Allocation of Purchase Consideration. The Company has made a preliminary estimate of the allocation of the preliminary purchase price of eOne to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair value. The Company is still evaluating the fair value of film and television programs and libraries, accounts receivable, participations and residuals liabilities and income taxes, in addition to ensuring all other assets and liabilities have been identified and recorded. The Company has estimated the preliminary fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on information currently available and will continue to adjust those estimates as additional information pertaining to events or circumstances present at December 27, 2023 becomes available and final appraisals and analysis are completed. The Company will reflect measurement period adjustments, in the period in which the adjustments occur, and the Company will finalize its accounting for the acquisition within one year from December 27, 2023 (see Note 5 for measurement period adjustments recorded through September 30, 2024). A change in the fair value of the net assets may change the amount recognized to goodwill. If the final fair value estimates and tax adjustments related to the net assets acquired decrease from their preliminary estimates, the amount of goodwill will increase and if the final fair value estimates and tax adjustments related to the net assets acquired increase from their preliminary estimates, the amount of goodwill will decrease and may result in a gain on purchase. In addition, the final fair value estimates related to the net assets acquired could impact the amount of amortization expense recorded associated with amounts allocated to film and television programs and other intangible assets. The preliminary goodwill amount is reflected in the table below, and arises from the opportunity for strengthening our global distribution infrastructure and enhanced positioning for motion picture and television projects and selling opportunities. The goodwill will not be amortized for financial reporting purposes, and will not be deductible for federal tax purposes. The fair value measurements were primarily based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market, such as discounted cash flow (DCF) analyses, and thus represent Level 3 fair value measurements.

 (1) Includes current and non-current amounts. 

Investment in films and television programs includes the preliminary fair value of completed films and television programs which have been produced by eOne or for which eOne has acquired distribution rights, as well as the preliminary fair value of films and television programs in production, pre-production and development. For investment in films and television programs, the fair value was preliminarily estimated based on forecasted cash flows discounted to present value at a rate commensurate with the risk of the assets. Titles that were released less than three years prior to the acquisition date (December 27, 2023) were valued individually and will be amortized using the individual film forecast method, based on the ratio of current period revenues to management s estimated remaining total gross revenues to be earned ("ultimate revenue"). Titles released more than three years prior to the acquisition date were valued as part of a library and will be amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of years to years. 
 The intangible assets acquired include trade names with a weighted average estimated useful life of years. The fair value of the trade names was preliminarily estimated based on the present value of the hypothetical cost savings that could be realized by the owner of the trade names as a result of not having to pay a stream of royalty payments to another party. These cost savings were calculated based on a DCF analysis of the hypothetical royalty payment that a licensee would be required to pay in exchange for use of the trade names, reduced by the tax effect realized by the licensee on the royalty payments. 
 
 Other preliminary fair value adjustments were made to property and equipment and right-of-use lease assets to reflect the fair value of certain assets upon acquisition. 
 
 Deferred taxes, net of any required valuation allowance, were preliminarily adjusted to record the deferred tax impact of acquisition accounting adjustments primarily related to amounts allocated to film and television programs, other intangible assets, and certain property and equipment, right-of-use lease assets, and other liabilities. 
 
 The fair value of eOne's cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, participations and residuals, film related obligations and other liabilities were estimated to approximate their book values.

These pro forma adjustments are based on available information as of the date hereof and upon assumptions that the Company believes are reasonable to reflect the impact of the acquisition of eOne on the Company's historical financial information on a supplemental pro forma basis. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statement of operations information does not include adjustments related to integration activities, operating efficiencies or cost savings. In addition, the unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated financial information for the six months ended September 30, 2023 includes an impairment of goodwill and trade name of million which was reflected in the statement of operations of eOne for the six months ended September 30, 2023.

3 Arts Entertainment. During the fourth quarter of the year ended March 31, 2024 (in January 2024), the Company closed on the acquisition of an additional of 3 Arts Entertainment representing approximately half of the noncontrolling interest for million. In addition, the Company purchased certain profit interests held by certain managers and entered into certain option rights agreements, which replaced the put and call rights under the previous arrangement by providing noncontrolling interest holders the right to sell to the Company and the Company the right to purchase their remaining interest beginning in January 2027. 
 At the completion of the purchase, a portion of the noncontrolling interest continued to be considered compensatory, as it was subject to forfeiture provisions upon termination of employment under certain circumstances, and the remaining portion represented the noncontrolling interest holders' fully vested equity interest. Under the new arrangement, the holders' right to sell their interest to the Company, and the Company's right to purchase the noncontrolling interest, are based on a formula-based amount (i.e., a fixed EBITDA multiple), subject to a minimum purchase price, rather than being based on fair value. Since the redemption features described above were based on a formula using a fixed multiple, the compensatory portion of the noncontrolling interest is now considered a liability award, and as a result, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, approximately million was reclassified from mezzanine equity to a liability, and is reflected in "other liabilities - non-current" in the consolidated balance sheet at March 31, 2024 and September 30, 2024. 
 
 The redeemable noncontrolling interest balance related to 3 Arts Entertainment reflects the fully vested equity portion of the noncontrolling interest, which remains classified as redeemable noncontrolling interest outside of shareholders' equity on the Company's consolidated balance sheets due to the purchase and sale rights beginning in 2027 which were determined to be embedded in the noncontrolling interest, and are outside the control of the Company. The redeemable noncontrolling interest is being adjusted to its redemption value through accumulated deficit through the sale or purchase right date in January 2027. Subsequent to the January 2024 transactions noted above, changes in the carrying value of the redeemable noncontrolling interest are reflected in the calculation of basic and diluted net income or loss per common share attributable to Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. shareholders, if dilutive, or to the extent the adjustments represent recoveries of amounts previously reflected in the computation of basic and diluted net income or loss per common share attributable to Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. shareholders (see Note 11).

of Pilgrim Media Group for approximately million, and recorded a reduction to redeemable noncontrolling interest of million, representing the carrying value of the noncontrolling interest purchased, with the difference between the carrying value of the noncontrolling interest purchased and the cash paid for the remaining interest recorded as a reduction to accumulated deficit of million. Prior to the Company's acquisition of the remaining interest, the noncontrolling interest was presented as a redeemable noncontrolling interest outside of shareholders' equity on the Company's consolidated balance sheets, due to put and call options which were determined to be embedded in the noncontrolling interest, and because the put rights were outside the control of the Company. 
 
 Other. The Company has other immaterial redeemable noncontrolling interests.

 The Company has other noncontrolling interests that are not redeemable, which are classified in shareholder's equity on the Company's consolidated balance sheets. These noncontrolling interests include: 
 
 Lionsgate Studios. In connection with the Business Combination discussed in Note 2, on May 13, 2024, the Company recorded a noncontrolling interest representing approximately of Lionsgate Studios amounting to a reduction of noncontrolling interest in shareholders' equity (deficit) of million, due to the negative carrying value of Lionsgate Studios at May 13, 2024, partially offset by an amount allocated to certain options. See Note 2 for further information.

 Accounts Receivable. Accounts receivable are presented net of a provision for doubtful accounts. The Company estimates provisions for accounts receivable based on historical experience for the respective risk categories and current and future expected economic conditions. To assess collectability, the Company analyzes market trends, economic conditions, the aging of receivables and customer specific risks, and records a provision for estimated credit losses expected over the lifetime of the receivables in direct operating expense. 
 
 The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations and monitors its credit exposure through active review of customers' financial condition, aging of receivable balances, historical collection trends, and expectations about relevant future events that may significantly affect collectability. The Company generally does not require collateral for its trade accounts receivable.

As the Company continues to evaluate the Media Networks business and its current restructuring plan in relation to the current micro and macroeconomic environment and the announced plan to separate the Company's Starz business (i.e., Media Networks segment) and Studio Business (i.e., Motion Picture and Television Production segments), including further strategic review of content performance and its strategy on a territory-by-territory basis, the Company may decide to expand its restructuring plan and exit additional territories or remove certain content off its platform in the future. Accordingly, the Company may incur additional content impairment and other restructuring charges. Other Impairments: Amounts in the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 also include impairments of certain operating lease right-of-use and leasehold improvement assets related to the Television Production segment associated with facility leases that will no longer be utilized by the Company, primarily related to the integration of eOne.

 Interest Rate Swaps 
 
 The Company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes primarily through its borrowing activities. The Company s objective is to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows. The Company primarily uses pay-fixed interest rate swaps to facilitate its interest rate risk management activities, which the Company generally designates as cash flow hedges of interest payments on floating-rate borrowings. Pay-fixed swaps effectively convert floating-rate borrowings to fixed-rate borrowings. The unrealized gains or losses from these designated cash flow hedges are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and recognized in interest expense as the interest payments occur. Changes in the fair value of interest rate swaps that are not designated as hedges are recorded in interest expense (see further explanation below). 
 
 Cash settlements related to interest rate contracts are generally classified as operating activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows.

 Accounts Receivable Monetization 
 
 Under the Company's accounts receivable monetization programs, the Company has entered into (1) individual agreements to monetize certain of its trade accounts receivable directly with third-party purchasers and (2) a revolving agreement to monetize designated pools of trade accounts receivable with various financial institutions, as further described below. Under these programs, the Company transfers receivables to purchasers in exchange for cash proceeds, and the Company continues to service the receivables for the purchasers. The Company accounts for the transfers of these receivables as a sale, removes (derecognizes) the carrying amount of the receivables from its balance sheets and classifies the proceeds received as cash flows from operating activities in the statements of cash flows. The Company records a loss on the sale of these receivables reflecting the net proceeds received (net of any obligations incurred), less the carrying amount of the receivables transferred. The loss is reflected in the "other expense" line item on the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. The Company receives fees for servicing the accounts receivable for the purchasers, which represent the fair value of the services and were immaterial for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

As customers paid their balances, the Company would transfer additional receivables into the program. The transferred receivables were fully guaranteed by a bankruptcy-remote wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The third-party purchasers had no recourse to other assets of the Company in the event of non-payment by the customers.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

Overview 
 Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. (the Company, Lionsgate, "Lions Gate," we, us or our encompasses world-class motion picture and television studio operations (collectively referred to as the Studio Business aligned with the STARZ premium global subscription platform to bring a unique and varied portfolio of entertainment to consumers around the world. The Company s film, television, subscription and location-based entertainment businesses are backed by a more than 20,000-title library and a valuable collection of iconic film and television franchises. We classify our operations through three reporting segments: Motion Picture, Television Production, and Media Networks (see further discussion below). 
 
 Proposed Separation 
 
 In October 2024, we filed a joint proxy statement/prospectus on Form S-4 with the SEC relating to the implementation of a plan of arrangement that will result in the separation of the businesses of Lionsgate Studios Corp., of which we own approximately 87.8 and which encompasses our motion picture and television studio operations, from our other businesses, including the STARZ-branded premium subscription platform (the Proposed Separation ). The Proposed S eparation will be subject to the satisfaction of a number of conditions and our Board of Directors, together with the Board of Directors of Lionsgate Studios Corp., may decide not to proceed with the Proposed S eparation. Additionally, the Proposed S eparation is complex in nature, and unanticipated developments or changes, including disruptions in general market conditions, changes in law or execution challenges may affect our ability to complete the Proposed S eparation on the terms and on the timeline we announced, or at all. These or other developments could cause us not to realize some or all of the expected benefits of the Proposed Separation, or to realize them on a different timeline than expected. 
 
 Business Combination 
 
 On May 13, 2024, the Company consummated the business combination agreement (the Business Combination Agreement ), with Screaming Eagle Acquisition Corp., a Cayman Islands exempted company SEAC ), SEAC II Corp., a Cayman Islands exempted company and wholly-owned subsidiary of SEAC New SEAC ), LG Sirius Holdings ULC, a British Columbia unlimited liability company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company Studio HoldCo ), LG Orion Holdings ULC, a British Columbia unlimited liability company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company StudioCo) and other affiliates of SEAC. Pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Business Combination Agreement, the Studio Business was combined with SEAC through a series of transactions, including an amalgamation of StudioCo and New SEAC under a Canadian plan of arrangement (the Business Combination ). In connection with the closing of the business combination, New SEAC changed its name to Lionsgate Studios Corp. (referred to as Lionsgate Studios and continues the existing business operations of StudioCo, which consists of the Studio Business of Lionsgate. The "Studio Business" consists of the businesses of Lionsgate's Motion Picture and Television Production segments, together with substantially all of Lionsgate's corporate general and administrative functions and costs. Lionsgate Studios became a separate publicly traded company and its common shares commenced trading on Nasdaq under the symbol LION on May 14, 2024. 
 
 In connection with and prior to the Business Combination, the Company and StudioCo entered into a separation agreement pursuant to which the assets and liabilities of the Company s Studio Business were transferred to StudioCo such that StudioCo holds, directly or indirectly, all of the assets and liabilities of the Studio Business (the Separation ). 
 
 Following the transaction, approximately 87.8 of the total shares of Lionsgate Studios continue to be held by the Company, while former SEAC public shareholders and founders and common equity financing investors own approximately 12.2 of Lionsgate Studios. In addition to establishing Lionsgate Studios as a standalone publicly-traded entity, the transaction resulted in approximately 330.0 million of gross proceeds to the Company, including 254.3 million in PIPE financing. The net proceeds were used to partially pay down amounts outstanding under the Term Loan A and Term Loan B pursuant to the Credit Agreement (see Note 6 to our unaudited consolidated financial statements). 
 
 The Business Combination has been accounted for as a reverse recapitalization in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Under this method of accounting, SEAC was treated as the acquired company and the Studio Business was treated as the acquirer for financial reporting purposes. Accordingly, for accounting purposes, the financial statements of Lionsgate Studios will represent a continuation of the financial statements of the Studio Business, with the Business Combination treated as the equivalent of the

 Studio Business issuing stock for the historical net assets of SEAC, substantially consisting of cash held in the trust account, accompanied by a recapitalization. The historical net assets of SEAC were stated at fair value, which approximates historical cost, with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded. Operations prior to the Business Combination are those of the Studio Business. The Studio Business continues to be a consolidated subsidiary of the Company. 
 Media Networks Restructuring 
 During fiscal 2024, the Company continued executing its Media Networks restructuring plan, which included exiting all international territories except for Canada and India, and included an evaluation of the programming on Starz's domestic and international platforms. The Company has incurred impairment charges from the inception of the plan through September 30, 2024 amounting to 741.4 million. 
 During the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded net recoveries of content impairment charges related to the Media Networks segment of 4.3 million and 2.4 million, respectively (three and six months ended September 30, 2023 - content impairment charges of 211.6 million and 239.5 million, respectively). 
 As the Company continues to evaluate the Media Networks business and its current restructuring plan in relation to the current micro and macroeconomic environment and the announced plan to separate the Company's Starz business (i.e., Media Networks segment) and Studio Business (i.e., Motion Picture and Television Production segments), including further strategic review of content performance and its strategy on a territory-by-territory basis, the Company may decide to expand its restructuring plan and exit additional territories or remove certain content off its platform in the future. Accordingly, the Company may incur additional content impairment and other restructuring charges. 
 Revenues 
 Our revenues are derived from the Motion Picture, Television Production and Media Networks segments, as described below. We refer to our Motion Picture and Television Production segments collectively as our Studio Business. Our revenues are derived from the U.S., Canada, the United Kingdom and other foreign countries. None of the non-U.S. countries individually comprised greater than 10 of total revenues for the three and six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 Studio Business 
 Motion Picture: Our Motion Picture segment includes revenues derived from the following: 
 Theatrical. Theatrical revenues are derived from the domestic theatrical release of motion pictures licensed to theatrical exhibitors on a picture-by-picture basis (distributed by us directly in the U.S. and through a sub-distributor in Canada). The revenues from Canada are reported net of distribution fees and release expenses of the Canadian sub-distributor. The financial terms that we negotiate with our theatrical exhibitors in the U.S. generally provide that we receive a percentage of the box office results.

Residuals represent amounts payable to various unions or guilds such as the Screen Actors Guild - American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, Directors Guild of America, and Writers Guild of America, based on the performance of the film or television program in certain ancillary markets or based on the individual s (i.e., actor, director, writer) salary level in the television market. 
 Distribution and marketing expenses primarily include the costs of theatrical prints and advertising P A and premium video-on-demand ("Premium VOD") expense and of DVD/Blu-ray duplication and marketing. Theatrical P A includes the costs of the theatrical prints delivered to theatrical exhibitors and the advertising and marketing cost associated with the theatrical release of the picture. Premium VOD expense represents the advertising and marketing cost associated with the Premium VOD release of the picture. DVD/Blu-ray duplication represents the cost of the DVD/Blu-ray product and the manufacturing costs associated with creating the physical products.

 reporting, internal and external audit and tax costs, corporate and other legal support functions, and certain information technology and human resources expense. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
 The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP") requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The application of the following accounting policies, which are important to our financial position and results of operations, requires significant judgments and estimates on the part of management. As described more fully below, these estimates bear the risk of change due to the inherent uncertainty of the estimate. In some cases, changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Accordingly, actual results could differ materially from our estimates. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our financial condition or results of operations will be affected. We base our estimates on past experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. We believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies, which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management's most difficult, subjective and complex judgments. For a summary of all of our accounting policies, including the accounting policies discussed below, see Note 1 to our audited consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on May 30, 2024 (the "Form 10-K"). 
 Accounting for Films and Television Programs and Licensed Program Rights 
 Capitalized costs for films or television programs are amortized and tested for impairment based on whether the content is predominantly monetized individually or as a group. 
 Film and Television Programs Monetized Individually. For films and television programs monetized individually, film cost amortization, participations and residuals expense are based on management's estimates. Costs of acquiring and producing films and television programs and of acquired libraries that are monetized individually are amortized and estimated liabilities for participations and residuals costs are accrued using the individual-film-forecast method, based on the ratio of the current period's revenues to management s estimated remaining total gross revenues to be earned ("ultimate revenue"). Management's judgment is required in estimating ultimate revenue and the costs to be incurred throughout the life of each film or television program. 
 Management estimates ultimate revenues based on historical experience with similar titles or the title genre, the general public appeal of the cast, audience test results when available, actual performance (when available) at the box office or in markets currently being exploited, and other factors such as the quality and acceptance of motion pictures or programs that our competitors release into the marketplace at or near the same time, critical reviews, general economic conditions and other tangible and intangible factors, many of which we do not control and which may change. 
 For motion pictures, ultimate revenue includes estimates over a period not to exceed ten years following the date of initial release of the motion picture. The most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenues for a film intended for theatrical release is the film's theatrical performance, as subsequent revenues from the licensing and sale in other markets have historically been highly correlated to its theatrical performance. After a film's release, our estimates of revenue from succeeding markets are revised based on historical relationships and an analysis of current market trends. 
 For an episodic television series, the period over which ultimate revenues are estimated cannot exceed ten years following the date of delivery of the first episode, or, if still in production, five years from the date of delivery of the most recent episode, if later. The most sensitive factors affecting our estimate of ultimate revenues for a television series is whether the series will be ordered for a subsequent season and estimates of revenue in secondary markets other than the initial license fee, which may depend on a number of factors, including, among others, the ratings or viewership the program achieves on the customers' platforms. The initial estimate of ultimate revenue may include estimates of revenues outside of the initial license window (i.e., international, home entertainment and other distribution platforms) and are based on historical experience for similar programs (genre, duration, etc.) and the estimated number of seasons of the series. Ultimates of revenue beyond the initial license fee are generally higher for programs that have been or are expected to be ordered for multiple seasons. We regularly monitor the performance of each season, and evaluate whether impairment indicators are present (i.e., low ratings, cancellations or the season is not reordered), and based upon our review, we revise our estimates as needed and perform an impairment assessment if impairment indicators are present (see below). 
 For titles included in acquired libraries, ultimate revenue includes estimates over a period not to exceed twenty years following the date of acquisition. 
 48 

Due to the inherent uncertainties involved in making such estimates of ultimate revenues and expenses, these estimates have differed in the past from actual results and are likely to differ to some extent in the future from actual results. In addition, in the normal course of our business, some films and titles are more successful or less successful than anticipated. Management regularly reviews and revises when necessary, its ultimate revenue and cost estimates, which may result in a change in the rate of amortization of film costs and participations and residuals and/or a write-down of all or a portion of the unamortized costs of the film or television program to its estimated fair value (see below). 
 An increase in the estimate of ultimate revenue will generally result in a lower amortization rate and, therefore, less film and television program amortization expense, while a decrease in the estimate of ultimate revenue will generally result in a higher amortization rate and, therefore, higher film and television program amortization expense, and also periodically results in an impairment requiring a write-down of the film cost to the title s fair value. These write-downs are included in amortization expense within direct operating expenses in our consolidated statements of operations. See further discussion below under Impairment Assessment . 
 Film and Television Programs Monetized as a Group. Licensed programming rights may include rights to more than one exploitation window under the Company's output and library agreements. For films with multiple windows, the license fee is allocated between the windows based upon the proportionate estimated fair value of each window which generally results in the majority of the cost allocated to the first window on newer releases. 
 Certain license agreements and productions may include additional ancillary rights in addition to the rights for exploitation on the Starz Platforms. A portion of the cost of these licenses and the cost of produced content, is allocated between the programming rights for exploitation on the Starz Platforms and investment in film and television programs for exploitation outside of the Starz Platforms in ancillary markets (e.g., home video, digital platforms, television, etc.) based on the relative fair value of those markets. The estimates of fair value for the allocation between windows of exploitation on the Starz Platform and ancillary markets is based on historical experience of the values of similar titles licensed in subsequent windows and estimates of future revenues in ancillary markets. 
 The cost of licensed program rights for films and television programs (including original series) exhibited by the Media Networks segment are generally amortized on a title-by-title or episode-by-episode basis using an accelerated or straight-line method based on the expected and historical viewership patterns, or the current and anticipated number of exhibitions over the license period or estimated life for owned or produced programs. The number of exhibitions is estimated based on the number of exhibitions allowed in the agreement (if specified) and the expected usage of the content. Participations and residuals are expensed in line with the amortization of production costs. 
 Changes in management s estimate of the anticipated exhibitions and viewership patterns of films and original series on our platforms could result in the earlier recognition of our programming costs than anticipated. 
 Impairment Assessment. A film group or individual film or television program is evaluated for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of an individual film or film group is less than its unamortized cost. If the result of the impairment test indicates that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value, an impairment charge will then be recorded for the amount of the difference. 
 Estimate of Fair Value. For content that is predominantly monetized individually (primarily investment in film and television programs related to the Motion Picture and Television Production segments), the fair value is determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis of the cash flows directly attributable to the title. For motion pictures intended for theatrical release, the discounted cash flow analysis used in the impairment evaluation prior to theatrical release is subjective and the key inputs include estimates of future anticipated revenues, estimates of box office performance, which may differ from future actual results. These estimates are based in part on the historical performance of similar films, test audience results when available, information regarding competing film releases, and critic reviews. For television programs, the discounted cash flow analysis used in the impairment evaluation includes key inputs such as estimates of future anticipated revenue, as discussed above. See further discussion of Valuation Assumptions below. 
 For content that is predominantly monetized as a group (primarily licensed program rights in the Media Networks segment and internally produced programming, as discussed above), the fair value is determined based on the present value of the discounted cash flows of the group using the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are independent of other produced and licensed content. The Company's film groups are generally aligned with the Company's networks and digital content offerings domestically (i.e., Starz Networks) and internationally by territory or groups of territories where content assets are shared across the various territories. Content removed from the service and abandoned is written down to its fair value, if any, determined using a discounted cash flow approach. 
 As a result of the Media Networks restructuring initiatives discussed in "Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Overview", we have incurred impairment charges from the inception of the plan through September 30, 2024 amounting to 741.4 million. During the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, we 
 49 

recorded net recoveries of content impairment charges related to the Media Networks segment of 4.3 million and 2.4 million, respectively, which are included in restructuring and other in the unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations (three and six months ended September 30, 2023 - content impairment charges of 211.6 million and 239.5 million, respectively) (see Note 3 and Note 14 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements). 
 Valuation Assumptions. The discounted cash flow analysis includes cash flows estimates of ultimate revenue and costs as well as a discount rate (a Level 3 fair value measurement, see Note 8 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements). The discount rate utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis is based on the weighted average cost of capital of the Company plus a risk premium representing the risk associated with producing a particular film or television program. Estimates of future revenue involve measurement uncertainty and it is therefore possible that reductions in the carrying value of investment in films and television programs may be required as a consequence of changes in management s future revenue estimates. 
 Revenue Recognition. Our Motion Picture and Television Production segments generate revenue principally from the licensing of content in domestic theatrical exhibition, home entertainment (e.g., digital media), television, and international market places. Our Media Networks segment generates revenue primarily from the distribution of our STARZ premium subscription video services. 
 Our content licensing arrangements include fixed fee and minimum guarantee arrangements, and sales or usage based royalties. Our fixed fee or minimum guarantee licensing arrangements in the television, digital media and international markets may, in some cases, include multiple titles, multiple license periods (windows) with a substantive period in between the windows, rights to exploitation in different media, or rights to exploitation in multiple territories, which may be considered distinct performance obligations. When these performance obligations are considered distinct, the fixed fee or minimum guarantee in the arrangement is allocated to the title, window, media right or territory as applicable, based on estimates of relative standalone selling prices. The amounts related to each performance obligation (i.e., title, window, media or territory) are recognized when the content has been delivered, and the window for the exploitation right in that territory has begun, which is the point in time at which the customer is able to begin to use and benefit from the content. 
 Sales or usage based royalties represent amounts due to us based on the sale or usage of our content by the customer, and revenues are recognized at the later of when the subsequent sale or usage occurs, or the performance obligation to which some or all the sales or usage-based royalty has been allocated has been satisfied (or partially satisfied). Generally, when we license completed content (with standalone functionality, such as a movie, or television show), our performance obligation will be satisfied prior to the sale or usage. When we license intellectual property that does not have stand-alone functionality (e.g., brands, themes, logos, etc.), our performance obligation is generally satisfied in the same period as the sale or usage. The actual amounts due to us under these arrangements are generally not reported to us until after the close of the reporting period. We record revenue under these arrangements for the amounts due and not yet reported to us based on estimates of the sales or usage of these customers and pursuant to the terms of the contracts. Such estimates are based on information from our customers, historical experience with similar titles in that market or territory, the performance of the title in other markets and/or available data in the industry. While we believe these estimates are reasonable estimates of the amounts due under these arrangements, such estimated amounts could differ from the actual amounts to be subsequently reported by the customer, which could be higher or lower than our estimates, and could result in an adjustment to revenues in future periods. 
 Revenue from the theatrical release of feature films are treated as sales or usage-based royalties and recognized starting at the exhibition date and based on our participation in box office receipts of the theatrical exhibitor . 
 Digital media revenue sharing arrangements are recognized as sales or usage based royalties. 
 Revenue from commissions are recognized as such services are provided. 
 Media Networks revenues may be based on a variable fee (i.e., a fee based on number of subscribers who receive our networks or other subscriber based factors) or to a lesser extent, may be based on a monthly fixed fee or minimum guarantee, subject to nominal annual escalations. Media Networks revenue is also generated through the distribution of our SVOD service directly to consumer through the Starz App. The variable distribution fee arrangements represent sales or usage based royalties, which are recognized over the period of such sales or usage by our distributor, which is the same period that the content is provided to the distributor. Estimates of revenue generated but not yet reported to us by our distribution partners are made based on the estimated number of subscribers using historical trends and recent reporting. Media Networks fixed fee or minimum guarantee programming revenue is recognized over the contract term based on the continuous delivery of the content to the distributor. Subscribers through the Starz App are billed in advance of the start of their monthly or annual membership and revenues are recognized ratably over each applicable membership period. Payments to distributors for marketing support costs for which Starz receives a discrete benefit are recorded as distribution and marketing costs, and payments to distributors for which Starz receives no discrete benefit are recorded as a reduction of revenue.

Goodwill. At September 30, 2024, the carrying value of goodwill was 806.5 million. Goodwill is allocated to our reporting units, which are our operating segments or one level below our operating segments (component level). Reporting units are determined by the discrete financial information available for the component and whether that information is regularly reviewed by segment management. Components are aggregated into a single reporting unit if they share similar economic characteristics. Our reporting units for purposes of goodwill impairment testing, along with their respective goodwill balances at September 30, 2024, were Motion Picture (goodwill of 396 million), Media Networks (no remaining goodwill balance), and our Television (goodwill of 317 million) and Talent Management (goodwill of 93 million) businesses, both of which are part of our Television Production segment. 
 Goodwill is not amortized but is reviewed for impairment each fiscal year or between the annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. We perform our annual impairment test as of January 1 in each fiscal year. A goodwill impairment loss would be recognized for the amount that the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. An entity may perform a qualitative assessment of the likelihood of the existence of a goodwill impairment. The qualitative assessment is an evaluation, based on all identified events and circumstances which impact the fair value of the reporting unit of whether or not it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit. If we believe that as a result of our qualitative assessment it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test is not required but may be performed at the option of the Company. A quantitative assessment requires determining the fair value of our reporting units. The determination of fair value requires considerable judgment and requires assumptions and estimates of many factors, including revenue and market growth, operating margins and cash flows, market multiples and discount rates. 
 In performing a quantitative assessment of goodwill, we determine the fair value of our reporting units by using a combination of discounted cash flow ("DCF") analyses and market-based valuation methodologies. The models rely on significant judgments and assumptions surrounding general market and economic conditions, short-term and long-term growth rates, discount rates, income tax rates, and detailed management forecasts of future cash flow and operating margin projections, and other assumptions, all of which are based on our internal forecasts of future performance as well as historical trends. The market-based valuation method utilizes EBITDA multiples from guideline public companies operating in similar industries and a control premium. The results of these valuation methodologies are weighted as to their relative importance and a single fair value is determined. The fair value of our reporting units is reconciled to the market value of our equity, determined based on the average prices of our common shares just prior to the period end. Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors. As a result, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the annual or interim goodwill impairment tests will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future. 
 Goodwill Impairment Assessments: 
 Fiscal 2025. During the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, there were no events or circumstances that have changed that would indicate that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. 
 Fiscal 2024. For our annual goodwill impairment test for fiscal 2024, we performed qualitative goodwill impairment assessments for our reporting units with a remaining goodwill balance (Motion Picture, and our Television and Talent Management businesses, both of which are part of our Television Production segment). 
 Our qualitative assessments considered the market price of the Company s common shares, the recent performance of these reporting units, and updated forecasts of performance and cash flows, as well as the current micro and macroeconomic environments in relation to the current and expected performance of these reporting units, and industry considerations, and determined that since the date of the most recent quantitative assessment performed over these reporting units, there were no events or circumstances that rise to a level that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of those reporting units below their carrying values; therefore, a quantitative goodwill impairment analysis was not required for these reporting units. 
 Management will continue to monitor all of its reporting units for further changes in the business environment that could impact the recoverability in future periods. The recoverability of goodwill is dependent upon the continued growth of revenue and cash flows from our business activities. Examples of events or circumstances that could result in changes to the underlying key assumptions and judgments used in our goodwill impairment tests, and ultimately impact the estimated fair value of our reporting units may include the global economy; consumer consumption levels of our content; adverse macroeconomic conditions related to higher inflation and interest rates and currency rate fluctuations, and the impact on the global economy from wars, terrorism and multiple international conflicts, and future bank failures; volatility in the equity and debt markets which could result in higher weighted-average cost of capital; capital market transactions; the duration and potential impact of strikes of unions on our ability to produce, acquire and distribute our content; the commercial success of our television 
 51 

programming and motion pictures; our continual contractual relationships with our customers; and changes in consumer behavior. If our assumptions are not realized, it is possible that additional impairment charges may need to be recorded in the future. 
 Finite-Lived Intangible Assets. At September 30, 2024, the carrying value of our finite-lived intangible assets was 916.5 million. Our finite-lived intangible assets primarily relate to customer relationships associated with U.S. MVPDs, including cable operators, satellite television providers and telecommunications companies ("Traditional Affiliate"), which amounted to 839.2 million. The amount of our customer relationship asset related to these Traditional Affiliate relationships reflects the estimated fair value of these customer relationships determined in connection with the acquisition of Starz on December 8, 2016, net of amortization recorded since the date of the Starz acquisition. Beginning October 1, 2023, our finite-lived intangible assets also include the trade names previously accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets. 
 Identifiable intangible assets with finite lives are amortized to depreciation and amortization expense over their estimated useful lives, ranging from 5 to 16 years. The Starz Traditional Affiliate customer relationship intangible asset is amortized in the proportion that current period revenues bear to management s estimate of future revenue over the remaining estimated useful life of the asset, which results in greater amortization in the earlier years of the estimated useful life of the asset than the latter years. 
 Amortizable intangible assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances (triggering events) indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. If a triggering event has occurred, an impairment analysis is required. The impairment test first requires a comparison of undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated over the useful life of an asset to the carrying value of the asset. The impairment test is performed at the lowest level of cash flows associated with the asset. If the carrying value of the asset exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows, the asset would not be deemed to be recoverable. Impairment would then be measured as the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value. 
 The Company monitors its finite-lived intangible assets and changes in the underlying circumstances each reporting period for indicators of possible impairments or a change in the useful life or method of amortization of our finite-lived intangible assets. For fiscal 2024, due to changes in the industry related to the migration from linear to OTT and direct-to-consumer consumption, and continuing difficult macro and microeconomic conditions, we performed an impairment analysis of our amortizable intangible assets. The impairment analysis requires a comparison of undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated over the useful life of an asset to the carrying value of the asset. Based on our impairment analysis, the estimated undiscounted cash flows exceeded the carrying amount of the assets and therefore no impairment charge was required. 
 During the three and six months ended September 30, 2024, there were no events or circumstances that would indicate that the carrying amount of our finite-lived intangible assets may not be recoverable. 
 Determining whether an intangible asset is recoverable or impaired requires various estimates and assumptions, including whether events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable, determining estimates of future cash flows for the assets involved and, when applicable, the assumptions applied in determining fair value, including discount rates, growth rates, market risk premiums and other assumptions about the economic environment. Should the revenues from our Traditional Affiliate relationships decline more than the assumed attrition rates used in our current estimates, either as a result of decreases in subscriber rates or changes of the terms of our renewals of our Traditional Affiliate contracts, we may have indicators of impairment which could result in an impairment of our customer relationships intangible assets, or we may need to further shorten the useful life or adopt a more accelerated method of amortization, both of which would increase the amount of amortization expense we record. 
 Income Taxes. We are subject to federal and state income taxes in the U.S., and in several foreign jurisdictions. We record deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carryforwards and certain temporary differences, net of applicable reserves in these jurisdictions. We recognize a future tax benefit to the extent that realization of such benefit is more likely than not on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis; otherwise, a valuation allowance is applied. In order to realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets, we will need to generate sufficient taxable income in the future in each of the jurisdictions which have these deferred tax assets. However, the assessment as to whether there will be sufficient taxable income in a jurisdiction to realize our net deferred tax assets in that jurisdiction is an estimate which could change in the future depending primarily upon the actual performance of our Company. We will be required to continually evaluate the more likely than not assessment that our net deferred tax assets will be realized, and if operating results deteriorate in a particular jurisdiction, we may need to record a valuation allowance for all or a portion of our deferred tax assets through a charge to our income tax benefit (provision). As of March 31, 2024, we had a valuation allowance of 808.3 million against certain U.S. and foreign deferred tax assets that may not be realized on a more likely than not basis. 
 Our quarterly income tax provision and our corresponding annual effective tax rate are based on expected income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. For interim financial 
 52 

reporting, we estimate the annual effective tax rate based on projected taxable income for the full year and record a quarterly tax provision in accordance with the expected annual effective tax rate. As the year progresses, we refine the estimates of the year s taxable income as new information becomes available, including year-to-date financial results. This continual estimation process often results in a change to our expected annual effective tax rate for the year. When this occurs, we adjust our income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs so that the year-to-date income tax provision reflects the expected annual effective tax rate. Significant judgment is required in determining our expected annual effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions. 
 Our effective tax rates differ from the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate and is affected by many factors, including the overall level of income (loss) before taxes and its mix across the jurisdictions in which we conduct operations, changes in tax laws and regulations, changes in valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets, changes in unrecognized tax benefits, tax planning strategies available to us, and other discrete items.

Revenues. Consolidated revenues decreased 66.9 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 reflecting a decrease of 69.6 million from our Media Networks business and increased intersegment eliminations of 31.2 million, partially offset by an increase of 33.9 million from our Studio Business. Studio Business revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 included approximately 126.7 million of revenues from eOne (acquired December 27, 2023, therefore the three months ended September 30, 2023 included no comparable revenues). Intersegment eliminations relate to the licensing of product from our Studio Business to the Media Networks segment. 
 Motion Picture revenue increased 11.2 million due to increased international revenue driven by Borderlands and the multi-platform release, The Killer's Game , partially offset by lower theatrical, and home entertainment revenue. Motion Picture revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 included approximately 15.6 million of revenues from eOne. Motion Picture revenue included 72.1 million of revenue from licensing Motion Picture segment product to the Media Networks segment, representing an increase of 11.6 million from the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Television Production revenue increased 22.7 million due to the inclusion of revenue from eOne of approximately 111.1 million, offset by lower home entertainment digital and international revenue. Television Production revenue included 149.9 million of revenue from licensing Television Production segment product to our Media Networks segment, representing an increase of 19.6 million from the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 The increase in intersegment eliminations of 31.2 million is primarily associated with higher Television Production revenues of 19.6 million, for licenses of original series to the Starz Platforms, and higher Motion Picture revenues of 11.6 million reflecting the licensing of certain recent theatrical releases to Starz, both in the Media Networks segment as discussed above. 
 Media Networks revenue decreased 69.6 million and reflected decreases in international revenue of 68.6 million due to the exiting of the majority of international territories, and a decrease at Starz Networks of 1.0 million. 
 See further discussion in the Segment Results of Operations section below. 
 Direct Operating Expenses. Direct operating expenses by segment were as follows for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Amount of Segment Revenues Amount of Segment Revenues Amount Percent (Amounts in millions) Direct operating expenses Studio Business: Motion Picture 255.7 62.8 202.7 51.2 53.0 26.1 Television Production 367.2 88.1 307.9 78.2 59.3 19.3 Total Studio Business 622.9 75.6 510.6 64.6 112.3 22.0 Media Networks 197.3 56.9 212.8 51.1 (15.5) (7.3) Other 6.0 nm 0.3 nm 5.7 1,900.0 Intersegment eliminations (183.0) nm (166.6) nm (16.4) 9.8 643.2 67.8 557.1 54.9 86.1 15.5 
 _______________________ 
 nm - Percentage not meaningful. 
 
 Direct operating expenses increased in the three months ended September 30, 2024 due to higher direct operating expenses for our Studio Business, partially offset by lower direct operating expenses for the Media Networks segment, and higher intersegment eliminations. The increase at the Studio Business reflects higher direct operating expenses of the Television Production segment associated with higher Television Production revenues, and higher direct operating expenses as a percentage of revenue of the Motion Picture segment driven by the performance and costs of the titles released in the quarter, in particular, Borderlands, which resulted in higher direct operating cost in relation to revenue. The decrease in Media Networks direct operating expense was driven by decreases of 36.7 million due to the territories exited, partially offset by an increase at Starz Networks of 21.2 million due to higher programming cost amortization. The increase in intersegment eliminations is due 
 55 

to increased Television Production revenue from licenses of original series to the Starz Platforms, and increased Motion Picture revenue from licenses of recent theatrical releases to the Starz Platforms, as discussed above. See further discussion in the Segment Results of Operations section below. 
 
 Other. Other direct operating expense in the three months ended September 30, 2024 includes rent cost for production facilities that were unutilized as a result of the industry strikes amounting to 5.2 million, which was not allocated to the segments, and is included in direct operating expense. In addition, other direct operating expense in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 includes share-based compensation. 
 
 Distribution and Marketing Expenses. Distribution and marketing expenses by segment were as follows for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Change 2024 2023 Amount Percent (Amounts in millions) Distribution and marketing expenses Studio Business: Motion Picture 126.0 99.0 27.0 27.3 Television Production 8.0 8.5 (0.5) (5.9) Total Studio Business 134.0 107.5 26.5 24.7 Media Networks 99.1 114.3 (15.2) (13.3) Other 0.2 0.3 (0.1) (33.3) Intersegment eliminations (0.4) (0.4) n/a 232.9 221.7 11.2 5.1 U.S. theatrical P A and Premium VOD expense included in Motion Picture distribution and marketing expense 90.7 65.5 25.2 38.5 
 _______________________ 
 nm - Percentage not meaningful. 
 
 Distribution and marketing expenses increased in the three months ended September 30, 2024, due to higher Studio Business distribution and marketing expense, partially offset by lower Media Networks distribution and marketing expense. The increase at the Studio Business primarily reflects higher Motion Picture theatrical P A and Premium VOD expense associated with the theatrical slate releases in the current quarter. The decrease in Media Networks distribution and marketing expense was due to a decrease of 10.9 million primarily from the international territories exited, and a decrease at Starz Networks of 4.3 million. See further discussion in the Segment Results of Operations section below. 
 
 General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses by segment were as follows for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 56 

Three Months Ended September 30, Change 2024 of Revenues 2023 of Revenues Amount Percent (Amounts in millions) General and administrative expenses Studio Business: Motion Picture 22.8 26.7 (3.9) (14.6) Television Production 17.0 14.3 2.7 18.9 Total Studio Business 39.8 41.0 (1.2) (2.9) Media Networks 23.3 22.8 0.5 2.2 Corporate 28.1 32.8 (4.7) (14.3) Share-based compensation expense 16.6 24.8 (8.2) (33.1) Purchase accounting and related adjustments 1.7 2.2 (0.5) (22.7) Total general and administrative expenses 109.5 11.5 123.6 12.2 (14.1) (11.4) 
 
 General and administrative expenses decreased in the three months ended September 30, 2024, resulting from decreased share-based compensation expense, corporate and Studio Business general and administrative expense, and purchase accounting and related adjustments, partially offset by increased Media Networks general and administrative expenses. Studio Business general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 included approximately 6.0 million from eOne. See further discussion in the Segment Results of Operations section below. 
 Corporate general and administrative expenses decreased 4.7 million, or 14.3 , primarily due to a decrease in incentive based compensation, partially offset by an increase in professional fees and approximately 3.0 million of corporate general and administrative expenses from eOne. 
 The decrease in share-based compensation expense included in general and administrative expense in the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 is primarily due to lower fair values in 
 the current quarter associated with performance-based stock option and other equity awards that are revalued at each 
 reporting period until the stock option or equity award vests and the applicable performance goals are achieved. The following table presents share-based compensation expense by financial statement line item: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (Amounts in millions) Share-based compensation expense by expense category General and administrative expense 16.6 24.8 Restructuring and other (1) 
 4.9 1.1 Direct operating expense 0.8 0.9 Distribution and marketing expense 0.2 0.3 Total share-based compensation expense 22.5 27.1 
 _______________________ 
 (1) Represents share-based compensation expense included in restructuring and other expenses reflecting the impact of the acceleration of vesting schedules for equity awards pursuant to certain severance arrangements. 
 
 Purchase accounting and related adjustments include the expense associated with the noncontrolling equity interests in the distributable earnings related to 3 Arts Entertainment, and the non-cash charge for the amortization of the recoupable portion of the purchase price related to 3 Arts Entertainment, all of which are accounted for as compensation and are included in general and administrative expense. The noncontrolling equity interests in the distributable earnings of 3 Arts Entertainment are reflected as an expense rather than noncontrolling interest in the unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations due to the relationship to continued employment. Purchase accounting and related adjustments decreased 0.5 million, or 22.7 , primarily due to lower noncontrolling equity interests in the distributable earnings related to 3 Arts Entertainment of 0.5 
 57 

million associated with a lower noncontrolling interest ownership percentage as a result of our acquisition of an additional interest in 3 Arts Entertainment (see Note 9 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements). 
 Depreciation and Amortization Expense. Depreciation and amortization of 45.5 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 0.9 million from 44.6 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to increased amortization of intangible assets. 
 Restructuring and Other. Restructuring and other decreased 216.0 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, and includes restructuring and severance costs and certain transaction and other costs, when applicable. Restructuring and other costs were as follows for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (see Note 14 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements): 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Increase (Decrease) 2024 2023 Amount Percent (Amounts in millions) Restructuring and other: Content and other impairments (1)

 nm - Percentage not meaningful. 
 (1) Media Networks Restructuring: As discussed in "Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Overview" , the Company recorded net recoveries of content impairment charges related to the Media Networks segment in the three months ended September 30, 2024 of 4.3 million (three months ended September 30, 2023 - content impairment charges of 211.6 million). See Note 14 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. Other Impairments: Amounts in the three months ended September 30, 2024 also include impairments of certain operating lease right-of-use and leasehold improvement assets related to the Television Production segment associated with facility leases that will no longer be utilized by the Company. 
 (2) Severance costs were primarily related to restructuring, acquisition integration activities and other cost-saving initiatives. 
 (3) Transaction and other costs in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 reflect transaction, integration and legal costs associated with certain strategic transactions, and restructuring activities and also include costs and benefits associated with legal and other matters. 
 Goodwill and Intangible Asset Impairment. Goodwill and intangible asset impairment of 663.9 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023 included goodwill impairment of 493.9 million and impairment of our indefinite-lived trade names of 170.0 million related to the Media Networks reporting unit. There was no comparable charge in the three months ended September 30, 2024. See "Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates", Goodwill and Note 5 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. 
 Interest Expense. Interest expense of 74.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 10.5 million from the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to higher average interest rates and balances on variable rate corporate debt and film related obligations, partially offset by a slightly larger benefit from the interest rate swaps. The following table sets forth the components of interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 
 58 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (Amounts in millions) Interest Expense Cash Based: Revolving credit facility 17.5 8.3 Term loans 18.0 23.5 Senior Notes 9.8 9.8 IP credit facilities (1) 
 6.0 Other (2) 
 13.3 14.5 64.6 56.1 Amortization of debt issuance costs and other non-cash interest (3) 
 9.7 7.7 Total interest expense 74.3 63.8 
 _______________________ 
 (1) IP credit facilities interest expense includes interest expense associated with the eOne IP Credit Facility and LG IP Credit Facility. 
 (2) Other interest expense includes payments associated with certain film related obligations (Production Tax Credit Facility, Film Library Facility, Backlog Facility and other, see Note 7 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements), and payments and receipts associated with the Company's interest rate swaps (see Note 17 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements). 
 (3) Amounts include the amortization of unrealized losses in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to de-designated interest rate swaps which are being amortized to interest expense (see Note 17 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements). 
 Interest and Other Income. Interest and other income of 3.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased as compared to interest and other income of 2.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to higher interest income. 
 Other Expense. Other expense of 15.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased as compared to other expense of 11.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is primarily due to realized and unrealized foreign currency losses in the three months ended September 30, 2024, offset by a decrease in the loss recorded related to our monetization of accounts receivable programs in the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 (see Note 18 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements). 
 Loss on Extinguishment of Debt. Loss on extinguishment of debt of 0.5 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 related to the write-off of debt issuance costs associated with the voluntary prepayment of 355.1 million principal amount of the Term Loan B. There was no comparable loss on extinguishment of debt in the three months ended September 30, 2023. See Note 6 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 Loss on Investments, net. Loss on investments, net was nil for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 1.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 related to other investments. 
 Equity Interests Income (Loss). Equity interests loss of 0.1 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to equity interests income of 1.8 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to lower income generated by our equity method investees. 
 
 Income Tax Benefit (Provision). We had an income tax provision of 1.9 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to an income tax benefit of 2.0 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023. Our income tax provision differs from the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of 21 multiplied by income (loss) before taxes due to the mix of our earnings across the various jurisdictions in which our operations are conducted, changes in valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets, and certain minimum income and foreign withholding taxes. Our income tax provision for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was also impacted by charges for interest on uncertain tax benefits. 
 
 Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. Shareholders. Net loss attributable to our shareholders for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 163.3 million, or basic and diluted net loss per common share of 0.68 on 239.3 million weighted average common shares outstanding. This compares to net loss attributable to our 
 59 

shareholders for the three months ended September 30, 2023 of 886.2 million, or basic and diluted net loss per common share of 3.79 on 234.0 million weighted average common shares outstanding. 
 
 Segment Results of Operations and Non-GAAP Measures 
 The Company's primary measure of segment performance is segment profit. Segment profit is defined as segment revenues, less segment direct operating and segment distribution and marketing expense, less segment general and administration expenses. Total segment profit represents the sum of segment profit for our individual segments, net of eliminations for intersegment transactions. Segment profit and total segment profit excludes, when applicable, corporate general and administrative expense, restructuring and other costs, share-based compensation, certain programming and content charges as a result of changes in management and/or programming and content strategy, certain charges related to the COVID-19 global pandemic, and purchase accounting and related adjustments. Segment profit when presented in accordance with ASC 280 within the notes to the consolidated financial statements is a GAAP financial measure and is disclosed in Note 15 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 We also present below our total segment profit for all of our segments and the sum of our Motion Picture and Television Production segment profit as our "Studio Business" segment profit. Total segment profit and Studio Business segment profit, when presented outside of the segment information and reconciliations included in Note 15 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, is considered a non-GAAP financial measure, and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with United States GAAP. We use this non-GAAP measure, among other measures, to evaluate the aggregate operating performance of our business. 
 The Company believes the presentation of total segment profit and Studio Business segment profit is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to view total segment performance in a manner similar to the primary method used by the Company's management and enables them to understand the fundamental performance of the Company's businesses before non-operating items. Total segment profit and Studio Business segment profit is considered an important measure of the Company s performance because it reflects the aggregate profit contribution from the Company's segments, both in total and for the Studio Business and represents a measure, consistent with our segment profit, that eliminates amounts that, in management s opinion, do not necessarily reflect the fundamental performance of the Company s businesses, are infrequent in occurrence, and in some cases are non-cash expenses. Not all companies calculate segment profit or total segment profit in the same manner, and segment profit and total segment profit as defined by the Company may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies due to differences in the methods of calculation and excluded items. 
 The following table reconciles the GAAP measure, operating loss, to the non-GAAP measure, total segment profit, for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. In addition, each of segment direct operating expense, distribution and marketing expense and general and administrative expense is reconciled to the respective line items presented in the GAAP-based statement of operations in the preceding section of the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations which discusses consolidated results of operations.

 (1) Lionsgate Original Releases: Includes titles originally planned for a wide theatrical release by Lionsgate, including titles that have changed from a planned wide theatrical release to an initial direct-to-streaming release. These releases include films developed and produced in-house, films co-developed and co-produced and films acquired or licensed from third parties. In addition, Lionsgate Original Releases also includes multi-platform and direct-to-platform motion pictures originally released or licensed by Lionsgate, and the licensing of our original release motion picture content to other ancillary markets (location-based entertainment, games, etc.). 
 (2) Other Film: Includes acquired and licensed brands and libraries originally released by other parties such as third-party library product, including our titles released by acquired companies prior to our acquisition of the company (i.e., Summit Entertainment library), and titles released with our equity method investees, Roadside Attractions and Pantelion Films, and other titles. 
 
 62 

Theatrical revenue decreased 8.1 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to a decrease of 9.0 million from Lionsgate Original Releases due to greater revenue generated from the fiscal 2024 theatrical slate titles in the prior year as compared to the fiscal 2025 theatrical slate titles in the current year. 
 
 Home entertainment revenue decreased 54.8 million, or 30.1 , in the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, due to lower digital media revenue of 51.2 million primarily due to decreases from Lionsgate Original Releases. Digital media revenue from Lionsgate Original Releases declined 43.0 million due to digital media revenue in the prior year's quarter from our fiscal 2023 and prior theatrical slate titles, and in particular, John Wick: Chapter 4 and Jesus Revolution, which compared to lower revenue in the current quarter from our fiscal 2024 and prior theatrical slate titles. The decrease in digital media revenue was also due to a decrease from Other Film of 8.2 million from our acquired library titles. 
 Television revenue increased 7.9 million, or 7.8 , in the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, due to an increase from Lionsgate Original Releases of 6.4 million due to a greater number of television windows opening in the current quarter for our theatrical slate titles. 
 International revenue increased 68.3 million, or 85.7 , in the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to an increase from Lionsgate Original Releases of 63.5 million driven by higher revenue generated from our fiscal 2025 theatrical slate, and in particular, Borderlands, as compared to our fiscal 2024 theatrical slate, and increased revenue from multi-platform releases, and in particular, The Killer's Game. In addition, the increase in international revenue was also due to an increase from Other Film of 4.8 million from our acquired library titles. 
 
 Direct Operating Expense. The increase in direct operating expenses is due to greater direct operating expenses as a percentage of motion picture revenue as compared to the prior year's quarter, driven by the change in the mix of titles and product categories generating revenue. In particular, the increase was driven by the performance and cost of the titles released in the quarter, including Borderlands , which had a higher amortization rate as compared to the titles released in the prior year's quarter. Investment in film write-downs included in Motion Picture segment direct operating expense were 18.3 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to approximately 26.8 million in the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Distribution and Marketing Expense. The increase in distribution and marketing expense in the three months ended September 30, 2024 is due to higher theatrical P A and Premium VOD expense due to higher expense associated with the theatrical slate releases in the current quarter. In the three months ended September 30, 2024, approximately 15.4 million of theatrical P A and Premium VOD expense was incurred in advance for films to be released in subsequent quarters, compared to approximately 15.2 million in the prior year's quarter in the Motion Picture segment. 
 Gross Contribution. Gross contribution of the Motion Picture segment for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, due to the negative contribution of the theatrical slate titles released in the quarter, including Borderlands , as a result of higher direct operating expense as a percentage of revenue, and higher theatrical P A and Premium VOD expense. These decreases in gross contribution were partially offset by increased Motion Picture revenue. 
 63 

General and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expenses of the Motion Picture segment decreased 3.9 million, or 14.6 primarily due to a decrease in incentive based compensation. 
 Television Production 
 The table below sets forth Television Production gross contribution and segment profit for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Change 2024 2023 Amount Percent (Amounts in millions) Television Production Segment: Revenue 416.6 393.9 22.7 5.8 Expenses: Direct operating expense 367.2 307.9 59.3 19.3 Distribution marketing expense 8.0 8.5 (0.5) (5.9) Gross contribution 41.4 77.5 (36.1) (46.6) General and administrative expenses 17.0 14.3 2.7 18.9 Segment profit 24.4 63.2 (38.8) (61.4) Direct operating expense as a percentage of revenue 88.1 78.2 Gross contribution as a percentage of revenue 9.9 19.7 
 
 Revenue. The table below sets forth Television Production revenue and changes in revenue by media for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Television Production revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 included approximately 111.1 million of revenues from eOne.

 The primary component of Television Production revenue is domestic television revenue. Domestic television revenue increased in the three months ended September 30, 2024 due to an increase of approximately 91.3 million for revenues from eOne in the current quarter, and an increase of 27.1 million from intersegment revenues from the licensing of Starz original series to Starz Networks, partially offset by a decrease from reality television programs and other third-party domestic television revenue. 
 International revenue in the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 23.9 million, or 32.5 , as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 due to a decrease of 15.0 million from intersegment revenues from the licensing of Starz original series to Starz Networks, and lower third-party revenue of approximately 10.2 million. 
 64 

Home entertainment revenue in the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 49.7 million due to decreased third-party digital media revenues, and in particular, digital media revenue in the prior year's quarter for The Continental, partially offset by increased intersegment revenues from the licensing of Starz original series to Starz Networks. 
 Other revenue increased 5.0 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, and primarily reflects revenue of 3 Arts Entertainment, which is generated from commissions and executive producer fees earned related to talent management. 
 Direct Operating Expense. Direct operating expense of the Television Production segment in the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 59.3 million, or 19.3 due to the increase in Television Production revenues. Direct operating expenses as a percentage of television production revenue increased primarily due to the mix of titles generating revenue in the current quarter as compared to the prior year's quarter, and in particular, the prior year's quarter included significant revenue from The Continental which has a lower amortization rate as compared to the current quarter. 
 Gross Contribution. Gross contribution of the Television Production segment for the three months ended September 30, 2024 decreased as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, due to lower television production revenue and higher direct operating expenses as a percentage of television production revenue. 
 General and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expenses of the Television Production segment increased 2.7 million, or 18.9 . Television Production general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 included 5.0 million from eOne. 
 Media Networks 
 
 The table below sets forth Media Networks gross contribution and segment profit for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. As previously discussed in "Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Overview", beginning in fiscal 2023, the Company began a plan to restructure its Media Networks international business. During fiscal 2024, the Company continued executing its restructuring plan which included exiting all international territories except Canada and India, which was completed in May 2024. As a result, certain territories were exited beginning May 2023, with additional territories exited during fiscal 2024 and the first quarter of fiscal 2025 (the Exited Territories ), therefore the results of operations for Other for the three months ended September 30, 2023 reflect amounts including the results of operations of the Exited Territories.

 (2) During the quarter ended June 30, 2024, the Company began reflecting the results of operations of Canada within Starz Networks. Accordingly, the following amounts were reclassified from "Other" (formerly "LIONSGATE+") to Starz Networks in the three months ended September 30, 2023 to conform to the current period presentation: (i) revenue of 4.2 million; (ii) direct operating expense of 3.4 million; and (iii) distribution and marketing expense of 0.2 million, which resulted in gross contribution and segment profit of 0.6 million reclassified. The amounts reflected in "Other" consist of the results of operations outside of the U.S. and Canada.

Subscriber Data. The number of period-end service subscribers is a key metric which management uses to evaluate a non-ad supported subscription video service. We believe this key metric provides useful information to investors as a growing or decreasing subscriber base is a key indicator of the health of the overall business. Service subscribers may impact revenue differently depending on specific distribution agreements we have with our distributors which may include fixed fees, rates per basic video household or a rate per STARZ subscriber. The table below sets forth, for the periods presented, subscriptions to our Media Networks and STARZPLAY Arabia services.

Revenue. Media Networks revenue decreased 69.6 million and reflected lower Other revenue of 68.6 million and a decrease at Starz Networks of 1.0 million. Starz Networks' revenue decreased 1.0 million primarily because of higher OTT revenue of 11.3 million resulting from price increases, offset by the continued decline in revenue from traditional linear services of 14.2 million. Starz Networks initiated a price increase at the end of June 2023, which was implemented by its various partners throughout the quarter ended September 30, 2023. An additional price increase was implemented by its partners beginning in September 2024. The decrease in Other revenue was primarily the result of the exit from the Exited Territories of approximately 66.9 million. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the following original series premiered on STARZ:

 Direct Operating and Distribution and Marketing Expenses . Direct operating and distribution and marketing expenses primarily represent programming cost amortization and advertising and marketing costs, respectively. The level of programming cost amortization and advertising and marketing costs and thus the gross contribution margin for the Media Networks' segment can fluctuate from period to period depending on the number of new original series and first-run output theatrical movies premiering on the network during the period. Programming cost amortization and advertising and marketing costs generally increase in periods where new original series premiere. In addition, the shutdown of the international service in the Exited Territories will result in a decrease in expenses going forward. 
 The decrease in Media Networks direct operating expenses in the three months ended September 30, 2024 is due to decreases in Other of 36.7 million primarily due to the exit from the Exited Territories, partially offset by increases at Starz Networks of 21.2 million. The increase in Starz Networks direct operating expense was due primarily to an increase of 40.9 million related to theatrical releases under our programming output agreements, partially offset by lower programming cost amortization of 17.2 million related to our Starz Originals. 
 The decrease in Media Networks distribution and marketing expense is due to a decrease in Other of 10.9 million primarily from the exit from the Exited Territories, and a decrease of 4.3 million at Starz Networks. 
 Gross Contribution. The decrease in gross contribution compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was due to lower gross contribution at Starz Networks of 17.9 million and from Other of 21.0 million, driven by higher Starz Networks direct operating expense and lower Other revenue, which was partially offset by lower Other direct operating expense and distribution and marketing expense, as described above. 
 General and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expenses of the Media Networks segment in the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased from the prior year's quarter, due to increases of 4.1 million at Starz Networks, partially offset by decreases of 3.6 million from Other resulting from the exit from the Exited Territories.

Revenues. Consolidated revenues decreased 140.8 million in the six months ended September 30, 2024 reflecting a decrease of 100.6 million from our Media Networks business, higher intersegment eliminations of 37.3 million, and a decrease of 2.9 million from our Studio Business. Studio Business revenues for the six months ended September 30, 2024 included approximately 228.3 million of revenues from eOne (acquired December 27, 2023, therefore the six months ended September 30, 2023 included no comparable revenues). Intersegment eliminations relate to the licensing of product from our Studio Business to the Media Networks segment. 
 Motion Picture revenue decreased 48.5 million due to lower home entertainment and theatrical revenue, primarily due to revenue in the prior year's period from John Wick: Chapter 4 , partially offset by increased international and television revenue. Motion Picture revenues for the six months ended September 30, 2024 included approximately 40.4 million of revenues from eOne. Motion Picture revenue included 136.3 million of revenue from licensing Motion Picture segment product to the Media Networks segment, representing an increase of 59.2 million from the six months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Television Production revenue increased 45.6 million due to the inclusion of revenue from eOne of 187.9 million, offset by lower home entertainment digital and international revenue. Television Production revenue included 189.4 million of revenue from licensing Television Production segment product to our Media Networks segment, representing a decrease of 21.9 million from the six months ended September 30, 2023. 
 The increase in intersegment eliminations of 37.3 million is primarily associated with higher Motion Picture intersegment revenues of 59.2 million reflecting the licensing of certain recent theatrical releases to Starz, partially offset by lower Television Production intersegment revenues of 21.9 million for licenses of original series to the Starz Platforms. 
 Media Networks revenue decreased 100.6 million, and reflected decreases in international revenue of 103.2 million due to the exiting of the majority of international territories, partially offset by an increase of 2.6 million at Starz Networks. 
 See further discussion in the Segment Results of Operations section below. 
 
 Direct Operating Expenses. Direct operating expenses by segment were as follows for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 Six Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change Amount of Segment Revenues Amount of Segment Revenues Amount Percent (Amounts in millions) Direct operating expenses Studio Business Motion Picture 405.9 53.8 389.3 48.5 16.6 4.3 Television Production 569.5 86.6 482.8 78.8 86.7 18.0 Total Studio Business 975.4 69.1 872.1 61.6 103.3 11.8 Media Networks 363.5 52.2 419.2 52.6 (55.7) (13.3) Other 8.8 nm 1.0 nm 7.8 780.0 Intersegment eliminations (275.3) nm (254.0) nm (21.3) 8.4 1,072.4 60.1 1,038.3 54.0 34.1 3.3 
 _______________________ 
 nm - Percentage not meaningful 
 Direct operating expenses increased in the six months ended September 30, 2024, due to higher direct operating expenses of our Studio Business, partially offset by lower direct operating expenses of our Media Networks segment and increased intersegment eliminations. The increase at the Studio Business reflects higher direct operating expenses of the Television Production segment due to increased revenues from Television Production, and higher direct operating expenses as a percentage of revenue of the Motion Picture segment driven by the performance and costs of the titles released in the quarter, in particular, Borderlands , which resulted in higher direct operating cost in relation to revenue. The decrease in Media Networks direct operating expense was driven by decreases of 62.0 million due to the territories exited, partially offset by increases at Starz Networks of 6.3 million due to higher programming cost amortization. The increase in intersegment eliminations is due to higher Motion Picture revenue from licenses of original series to the Starz Platforms, as discussed above. See further discussion in the Segment Results of Operations section below. 
 
 70 

Other. Other direct operating expense in the six months ended September 30, 2024 includes rent cost for production facilities that were unutilized as a result of the industry strikes amounting to 10.5 million, which was not allocated to the segments, and is included in direct operating expense. In addition, other direct operating expense in the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 includes share-based compensation, and COVID related charges, if any, net of insurance recoveries. 
 Distribution and Marketing Expenses. Distribution and marketing expenses by segment were as follows for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 Six Months Ended September 30, Change 2024 2023 Amount Percent (Amounts in millions) Distribution and marketing expenses Studio Business: Motion Picture 208.1 220.3 (12.2) (5.5) Television Production 18.5 16.6 1.9 11.4 Total Studio Business 226.6 236.9 (10.3) (4.3) Media Networks 205.0 231.3 (26.3) (11.4) Other 0.5 0.4 0.1 25.0 Intersegment eliminations (0.6) (2.5) 1.9 nm 431.5 466.1 (34.6) (7.4) U.S. theatrical P A and Premium VOD expense included in Motion Picture distribution and marketing expense 142.0 149.9 (7.9) (5.3) 
 _______________________ 
 nm - Percentage not meaningful 
 Distribution and marketing expenses decreased in the six months ended September 30, 2024, due to lower Studio Business and Media Networks distribution and marketing expense. The decrease at the Studio Business primarily reflects lower Motion Picture theatrical P A and Premium VOD expense associated with the theatrical slate releases in the current period. The decrease in Media Networks distribution and marketing expense was due to a decrease of 22.2 million primarily from the international territories exited, and a decrease at Starz Networks of 4.1 million. See further discussion in the Segment Results of Operations section below. 
 
 General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses by segment were as follows for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 Six Months Ended September 30, Change 2024 of Revenues 2023 of Revenues Amount Percent (Amounts in millions) General and administrative expenses Studio Business Motion Picture 51.3 56.1 (4.8) (8.6) Television Production 34.8 27.0 7.8 28.9 Total Studio Business 86.1 83.1 3.0 3.6 Media Networks 43.8 48.6 (4.8) (9.9) Corporate 61.5 63.1 (1.6) (2.5) Share-based compensation expense 33.8 40.1 (6.3) (15.7) Purchase accounting and related adjustments 3.8 12.2 (8.4) (68.9) Total general and administrative expenses 229.0 12.8 247.1 12.8 (18.1) (7.3) 
 
 71 

General and administrative expenses decreased in the six months ended September 30, 2024, resulting from decreased purchase accounting and related adjustments, share-based compensation expense, Media Networks and corporate general and administrative expenses, partially offset by increased Studio Business general and administrative expenses. Studio Business general and administrative expenses for the six months ended September 30, 2024 included approximately 13.0 million from eOne. See further discussion in the Segment Results of Operations section below. 
 Corporate general and administrative expenses decreased 1.6 million, or 2.5 , primarily due to a decrease in incentive based compensation, partially offset by an increase in professional fees and approximately 6.0 million of corporate general and administrative expenses from eOne. 
 The decrease in share-based compensation expense included in general and administrative expense in the six months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the six months ended September 30, 2023 is primarily due to lower fair values in 
 the current period associated with performance-based stock option and other equity awards that are revalued at each 
 reporting period until the stock option or equity award vests and the applicable performance goals are achieved. The following table presents share-based compensation expense by financial statement line item: 
 Six Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (Amounts in millions) Share-based compensation expense by expense category General and administrative expense 33.8 40.1 Restructuring and other (1) 
 4.9 1.6 Direct operating expense 1.4 1.4 Distribution and marketing expense 0.5 0.4 Total share-based compensation expense 40.6 43.5 
 _______________________ 
 (1) Represents share-based compensation expense included in restructuring and other expenses reflecting the impact of the acceleration of vesting schedules for equity awards pursuant to certain severance arrangements. 
 Purchase accounting and related adjustments include the expense associated with the noncontrolling equity interests in the distributable earnings related to 3 Arts Entertainment, and the non-cash charge for the amortization of the recoupable portion of the purchase price related to 3 Arts Entertainment, all of which are accounted for as compensation and are included in general and administrative expense. The noncontrolling equity interests in the distributable earnings of 3 Arts Entertainment are reflected as an expense rather than noncontrolling interest in the unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations due to the relationship to continued employment. Purchase accounting and related adjustments decreased 8.4 million, or 68.9 , primarily due to lower noncontrolling equity interests in the distributable earnings related to 3 Arts Entertainment of 7.1 million associated with a lower noncontrolling interest ownership percentage as a result of our acquisition of an additional interest in 3 Arts Entertainment (see Note 9 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements). In addition, purchase accounting and related adjustments decreased due to lower amortization of the recoupable portion of the purchase price of 3 Arts Entertainment of 1.3 million, due to the amortization period ending in May 2023. 
 Depreciation and Amortization Expense. Depreciation and amortization of 91.6 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 increased 2.6 million from 89.0 million in the six months ended September 30, 2023 due to increased amortization of intangible assets. 
 Restructuring and Other. Restructuring and other decreased 225.4 million in the six months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the six months ended September 30, 2023, and includes restructuring and severance costs and certain transaction and other costs, when applicable. Restructuring and other costs were as follows for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (see Note 14 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements):

 _______________________ 
 (1) Media Networks Restructuring: As discussed in "Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Overview" , the Company recorded net recoveries of content impairment charges related to the Media Networks segment in the six months ended September 30, 2024 of 2.4 million (six months ended September 30, 2023 - content impairment charges of 239.5 million). See Note 14 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. Other Impairments: Amounts in the six months ended September 30, 2024 also include impairments of certain operating lease right-of-use and leasehold improvement assets related to the Television Production segment associated with facility leases that will no longer be utilized by the Company primarily related to the integration of eOne. 
 (2) Severance costs were primarily related to restructuring, acquisition integration activities and other cost-saving initiatives. 
 (3) Transaction and other costs in the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 reflect transaction, integration and legal costs associated with certain strategic transactions, and restructuring activities and also include costs and benefits associated with legal and other matters. In the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, transaction and other costs also includes a benefit of 7.1 million and 3.8 million, respectively, associated with an arrangement to migrate subscribers in some of the exited territories to a third-party in connection with the Starz international restructuring. 
 Goodwill and Intangible Asset Impairment. Goodwill and intangible asset impairment of 663.9 million in the six months ended September 30, 2023 included goodwill impairment of 493.9 million and impairment of our indefinite-lived trade names of 170.0 million related to the Media Networks reporting unit. There was no comparable charge in the six months ended September 30, 2024. See "Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates", Goodwill and Note 5 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for further information. 
 Interest Expense. Interest expense of 143.1 million in the six months ended September 30, 2024 increased 17.3 million from the six months ended September 30, 2023 due to higher average interest rates and balances on variable rate corporate debt and film related obligations, partially offset by a slightly larger benefit from the interest rate swaps. The following table sets forth the components of interest expense for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 
 73 

Six Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (Amounts in millions) Interest Expense Cash Based: Revolving credit facility 31.5 17.8 Term loans 38.7 43.9 Senior Notes 19.7 20.0 IP credit facilities (1) 
 6.0 Other (2) 
 28.7 29.5 124.6 111.2 Amortization of debt issuance costs and other non-cash interest (3) 
 18.5 14.6 Total interest expense 143.1 125.8 
 ______________________ 
 (1) IP credit facility interest expense includes interest expense associated with the eOne IP Credit Facility and the LG IP Credit Facility. 
 (2) Other interest expense includes payments associated with certain film related obligations (Production Tax Credit Facility, Film Library Facility, Backlog Facility and other, see Note 7 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements), and payments and receipts associated with the Company's interest rate swaps (see Note 17 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements). 
 (3) Amounts include the amortization of unrealized losses in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to de-designated interest rate swaps which are being amortized to interest expense (see Note 17 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements). 
 Interest and Other Income. Interest and other income of 8.5 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 increased as compared to interest and other income of 4.7 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023 due to higher interest income. 
 Other Expense. Other expense of 18.9 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 increased as compared to other expense of 17.2 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is primarily due to realized and unrealized foreign currency losses in the six months ended September 30, 2024, offset by a decrease in the loss recorded related to our monetization of accounts receivable programs in the six months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the six months ended September 30, 2023 (see Note 18 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements). 
 Gain (Loss) on Extinguishment of Debt. Loss on extinguishment of debt of 6.4 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 related to the write-off of debt issuance costs associated with the September 2024 voluntary prepayment of 355.1 million principal amount of the Term Loan B, the May 2024 voluntary prepayment of 84.9 million principal amount of the Term Loan A and 214.1 million of the Term Loan B, and the 5.5 Senior Notes exchange. In the six months ended September 30, 2023, the gain on extinguishment of debt of 21.2 million represented a gain associated with the repurchase of 85.0 million principal amount of 5.5 Senior Notes at a discount. See Note 6 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 Loss on Investments, net. Loss on investments, net was nil for the six months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 1.7 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023 related to other investments. 
 Equity Interests Income. Equity interests income of 0.8 million in the six months ended September 30, 2024 compared to equity interests income of 1.5 million in the six months ended September 30, 2023 due to lower income generated by our equity method investees. 
 
 74 

Income Tax Provision. We had an income tax provision of 12.0 million in the six months ended September 30, 2024, compared to an income tax provision of 7.8 million in the six months ended September 30, 2023. Our income tax provision differs from the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of 21 multiplied by income (loss) before taxes due to the mix of our earnings across the various jurisdictions in which our operations are conducted, changes in valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets, and certain minimum income and foreign withholding taxes. Our income tax provision for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was also impacted by charges for interest on uncertain tax benefits, and benefited from the release of uncertain tax benefits due to the close of audits or expiration of statutory limitations. Our income tax provision for the six months ended September 30, 2024 was also impacted by additional deferred tax expense as result of the Separation that occurred during the quarter ended June 30, 2024. 
 
 Net Loss Attributable to Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. Shareholders. Net loss attributable to our shareholders for the six months ended September 30, 2024 was 222.7 million, or basic and diluted net loss per common share of 0.94 on 237.5 million weighted average common shares outstanding. This compares to net loss attributable to our shareholders for the six months ended September 30, 2023 of 956.9 million, or basic and diluted net loss per common share of 4.12 on 232.1 million weighted average common shares outstanding. 
 
 Segment Results of Operations and Non-GAAP Measures 
 See "Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Results of Operations - Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2023", Segment Results of Operations and Non-GAAP measures for a definition of the non-GAAP measure, total segment profit and Studio Business segment profit, which when presented outside of the segment information and reconciliations included in Note 15 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, is considered a non-GAAP financial measure, and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with United States GAAP. We use this non-GAAP measure, among other measures, to evaluate the aggregate operating performance of our business. 
 The following table reconciles the GAAP measure, operating loss, to the non-GAAP measure, total segment profit, for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. In addition, each of segment direct operating expense, distribution and marketing expense and general and administrative expense is reconciled to the respective line items presented in the GAAP-based statement of operations in the preceding section of the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations which discusses consolidated results of operations.

 ____________________ 
 (1) Lionsgate Original Releases: Includes titles originally planned for a wide theatrical release by Lionsgate, including titles that have changed from a planned wide theatrical release to an initial direct-to-streaming release. These releases include films developed and produced in-house, films co-developed and co-produced and films acquired or licensed from third parties. In addition, Lionsgate Original Releases also includes multi-platform and direct-to-platform motion pictures originally released or licensed by Lionsgate, and the licensing of our original release motion picture content to other ancillary markets (location-based entertainment, games, etc.). 
 (2) Other Film: Includes acquired and licensed brands and libraries originally released by other parties such as third-party library product, including our titles released by acquired companies prior to our acquisition of the company (i.e., Summit Entertainment library), and titles released with our equity method investees, Roadside Attractions and Pantelion Films, and other titles. 
 Theatrical revenue decreased 38.0 million in the six months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the six months ended September 30, 2023 due to a decrease of 38.8 million from Lionsgate Original Releases due to revenue in the prior year's period from the fiscal 2023 theatrical slate release, John Wick: Chapter 4, partially offset by increased revenue from multi-platform releases in the current period, and in particular, The Strangers: Chapter 1 . 
 77 

Home entertainment revenue decreased 105.4 million, or 27.6 , in the six months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the six months ended September 30, 2023, due to lower digital media revenue of 85.2 million primarily due to decreases from Lionsgate Original Releases. Digital media revenue from Lionsgate Original Releases declined 74.0 million due to revenue in the prior year's period from our fiscal 2023 and prior theatrical slate titles, and in particular, John Wick: Chapter 4 and Jesus Revolution, which compared to lower revenue in the current period from our fiscal 2024 and prior theatrical slate titles. This decrease in digital media revenue was partially offset by increased digital media revenue in the current period from our fiscal 2025 theatrical slate title, The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare. In addition, the decrease in home entertainment revenue was also due to lower packaged media revenue of 20.2 million primarily due to revenue in the prior year's period for John Wick: Chapter 4 . 
 Television revenue increased 47.4 million, or 31.7 , in the six months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the six months ended September 30, 2023 due to an increase from Lionsgate Original Releases of 46.4 million due to a greater number of television windows opening in the current period for our theatrical slate titles, and higher revenue recognized for those titles, and in particular, The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds Snakes. 
 International revenue increased 55.3 million, or 34.4 , in the six months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the six months ended September 30, 2023 due to an increase from Lionsgate Original Releases of 37.1 million driven by higher revenue generated from our fiscal 2025 theatrical slate, and in particular, Borderlands , as compared to our fiscal 2024 theatrical slate, and increased revenue from multi-platform releases, and in particular, The Killer's Game, offset by revenue in the prior year's period for John Wick: Chapter 4. In addition, the increase in international revenue was also due to an increase from Other Film of 18.2 million from our acquired library titles. 
 Direct Operating Expense. The increase in direct operating expenses is due to greater direct operating expenses as a percentage of motion picture revenue as compared to the prior year's period, driven by the change in the mix of titles and product categories generating revenue. In particular, the increase was driven by the performance and cost of the titles released in the period, including Borderlands , which had a higher amortization rate as compared to the titles released in the prior year's period. Investment in film write-downs included in Motion Picture segment direct operating expense were 18.5 million in the six months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 27.0 million in the six months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Distribution and Marketing Expense. The decrease in distribution and marketing expense in the six months ended September 30, 2024 is due to lower theatrical P A and Premium VOD expense associated with the theatrical slate releases in the current period. In the six months ended September 30, 2024 approximately 20.9 million of P A and Premium VOD expense was incurred in advance for films to be released in subsequent quarters, compared to approximately 19.7 million in the six months ended September 30, 2023 in the Motion Picture segment. 
 Gross Contribution. Gross contribution of the Motion Picture segment for the six months ended September 30, 2024 decreased as compared to the six months ended September 30, 2023 due to the negative contribution of the theatrical slate titles released in the period, including Borderlands , as a result of higher direct operating expense as a percentage of revenue, and lower Motion Picture revenue. These decreases in gross contribution were partially offset by lower Motion Picture distribution and marketing expense. 
 General and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expenses of the Motion Picture segment in the six months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 4.8 million, or 8.6 , primarily due to a decrease in incentive based compensation.

 The primary component of Television Production revenue is domestic television revenue. Domestic television revenue increased in the six months ended September 30, 2024 due to an increase of approximately 157.6 million for revenues from eOne in the current period, and a decrease from reality television programs and other third-party domestic television revenue. 
 International revenue in the six months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 20.1 million, or 19.0 as compared to the six months ended September 30, 2023 due to a decrease of 26.8 million from intersegment revenues from the licensing of Starz original series to Starz Networks, partially offset by increased third-party revenue. 
 Home entertainment revenue in the six months ended September 30, 2024 decreased 42.2 million, or 43.6 as compared to the six months ended September 30, 2023 due to decreased third-party digital media revenues, and in particular, digital media revenue in the prior year's period for The Continental, partially offset by increased intersegment revenues from the licensing of Starz original series to Starz Networks. 
 Other revenue in the six months ended September 30, 2024 increased 6.6 million, or 17.3 from the six months ended September 30, 2023, and primarily reflects revenue of 3 Arts Entertainment, which is generated from commissions and executive producer fees earned related to talent management. 
 Direct Operating Expense. Direct operating expense of the Television Production segment in the six months ended September 30, 2024 increased 86.7 million, or 18.0 due to the increase in Television Production revenues. Direct operating 
 79 

expenses as a percentage of television production revenue increased primarily due to the mix of titles generating revenue in the current period as compared to the prior year's period, and in particular, the prior year's period included significant revenue from The Continental which has a lower amortization rate as compared to the current period. There were no investment in film and television programs write-downs included in Television Production segment direct operating expense in the six months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 5.4 million in the six months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Gross Contribution. Gross contribution of the Television Production segment for the six months ended September 30, 2024 decreased as compared to the six months ended September 30, 2023, due to higher direct operating expenses as a percentage of television production revenue, partially offset by increased television production revenue. 
 General and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expenses of the Television Production segment increased 7.8 million, or 28.9 . Television Production general and administrative expenses for the six months ended September 30, 2024 included 11.0 million from eOne. 
 Media Networks

 _______________________ 
 (1) Starz Networks represents the results of operations of the U.S. and Canada, see footnote (2) below. 
 (2) During the quarter ended June 30, 2024, the Company began reflecting the results of operations of Canada within Starz Networks. Accordingly, the following amounts were reclassified from "Other" (formerly "LIONSGATE+") to Starz Networks in the six months ended September 30, 2023 to conform to the current period presentation: (i) revenue of 8.4 million; (ii) direct operating expense of 6.1 million; and (iii) distribution and marketing expense of 1.3 million, which resulted in gross contribution and segment profit of 1.0 million reclassified. The amounts reflected in "Other" consist of the results of operations outside of the U.S. and Canada. 

Revenue . Media Networks revenue decreased 100.6 million and reflected lower Other revenue of 103.2 million, partially offset by an increase of 2.6 million at Starz Networks. Starz Networks' revenue increased 2.6 million primarily because of higher OTT revenue of 32.2 million resulting from price increases, offset by the continued declines in revenue from traditional linear services of 29.9 million. Starz Networks initiated a price increase at the end of June 2023, which was implemented by its various partners throughout the period ended September 2023. An additional price increase was implemented by its partners beginning in September 2024. The Other revenue of 8.8 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 includes 1.6 million from the Exited Territories. The decrease in Other revenue was primarily the result of the exit from the Exited Territories which was approximately 89.7 million. In addition, the decrease in Other was due to ancillary revenue earned during the six months ended September 30, 2023 from the distribution of certain Starz Originals and licensed content to third-party distributors outside of the Starz Platforms decreasing by approximately 13.0 million as compared to the corresponding period in fiscal 2024.

 Direct Operating and Distribution and Marketing Expenses . Direct operating and distribution and marketing expenses primarily represent programming cost amortization and advertising and marketing costs, respectively. The level of programming cost amortization and advertising and marketing costs and thus the gross contribution margin for the Media Networks' segment can fluctuate from period to period depending on the number of new original series and first-run output theatrical movies premiering on the network during the period. Programming cost amortization and advertising and marketing costs generally increase in periods where new original series premiere. In addition, the shutdown of the international service in the Exited Territories will result in a decrease in expenses going forward. 
 The decrease in Media Networks direct operating expenses is due to decreases at Other of 62.0 million, partially offset by an increase at Starz Networks of 6.3 million in the six months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in Starz Networks direct operating expense was due primarily to an increase of 69.3 million related to theatrical releases under our programming output agreements, partially offset by lower programming cost amortization of 62.9 million related to our Starz Originals. Other direct operating expenses decreased 62.7 million due to the exit from the Exited Territories. Other direct operating expense of 6.1 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 includes 1.1 million from the Exited Territories. 
 The decrease in Media Networks distribution and marketing expense is due to a decrease in Other of 22.2 million primarily due to a decrease in distribution and advertising expenses resulting from the exit from the Exited Territories, and a decrease of 4.1 million at Starz Networks. 
 Gross Contribution. The decrease in gross contribution compared to the six months ended September 30, 2023 was due to decreased gross contribution from Other of 19.0 million, partially offset by increased gross contribution at Starz Networks of 0.4 million, driven by lower Other revenue, partially offset by lower Other direct operating expense and distribution and marketing expense, as described above. 
 General and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expenses in the six months ended September 30, 2024 decreased from the prior year's period, due to a decrease of 6.8 million from Other resulting from the exit from the Exited Territories, partially offset by an increase of 2.0 million at Starz Networks.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Sources of Cash 
 Our liquidity and capital requirements in the six months ended September 30, 2024 were provided principally through cash generated from operations, corporate debt, our film related obligations (as further discussed below), and the monetization of trade accounts receivable. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 229.6 million. 
 Business Combination. As discussed under "Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Overview", on May 13, 2024, the Company closed the Business Combination Agreement, and Lionsgate Studios became a separate publicly traded company and its common shares commenced trading on Nasdaq under the symbol "LION" on May 14, 2024. Following the transaction, approximately 87.8 of the total shares of Lionsgate Studios continue to be held by the Company, while former SEAC public shareholders and founders and common equity financing investors own approximately 12.2 of Lionsgate Studios. In addition to establishing Lionsgate Studios as a standalone publicly-traded entity, the transaction resulted in approximately 330.0 million of gross proceeds to the Company, including 254.3 million in PIPE financing. The net proceeds were used to partially pay down amounts outstanding under the Term Loan A and Term Loan B pursuant to the Credit Agreement (see Note 6 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements). 
 Corporate Debt 
 Our corporate debt at September 30, 2024, excluding film related obligations discussed further below, consisted of the following: 
 Senior Credit Facilities: 
 Revolving Credit Facility. We have a 1.25 billion revolving credit facility (with 421.5 million outstanding at September 30, 2024) due April 2026 (the "Revolving Credit Facility").

 Term Loan A. We have a term loan A facility due April 2026 (the "Term Loan A"), with 314.4 million outstanding at September 30, 2024. 
 Term Loan B. We have a term loan B facility due March 2025 (the "Term Loan B", and, together with the Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan A, the "Senior Credit Facilities"), with 250.0 million outstanding at September 30, 2024.

The Exchange Notes will initially be guaranteed by all existing obligors under the Existing Notes, and upon completion of the separation of the Studio Business and the Starz Business, the Exchange Notes will be guaranteed exclusively by entities which are part of the Studio Business. 
 eOne IP Credit Facility: In July 2024, certain subsidiaries of the Company entered into a senior secured amortizing term credit facility (the "eOne IP Credit Facility") based on and secured by the Company s intellectual property rights primarily associated with certain titles acquired as part of the eOne acquisition.

 See Note 7 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our film related obligations. 
 Accounts Receivable Monetization and Governmental Incentives 
 Our accounts receivable monetization programs include individual agreements to monetize certain of our trade accounts receivable directly with third-party purchasers and previously have included a revolving agreement to monetize designated pools of trade accounts receivable with various financial institutions. 
 84 

In addition, we utilize governmental incentives, programs and other structures from states and foreign countries (e.g., sales tax refunds, transferable tax credits, refundable tax credits, low interest loans, direct subsidies or cash rebates, calculated based on the amount of money spent in the particular jurisdiction in connection with the production) to fund our film and television productions and reduce financial risk. 
 See Note 18 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for our accounts receivable monetization programs and our tax credit receivables. 
 Uses of Cash 
 Our principal uses of cash in operations include the funding of film and television productions, film and programming rights acquisitions, the distribution and marketing of films and television programs, and general and administrative expenses. We also use cash for debt service (i.e. principal and interest payments) requirements, equity method or other equity investments, quarterly cash dividends when declared, the purchase of common shares under our share repurchase program, capital expenditures, and acquisitions of or investment in businesses. 
 In addition, the Company has a redeemable noncontrolling interest balance of 99.7 million as of September 30, 2024 related to its acquisition of a controlling interest, consisting of a limited liability company interest, in 3 Arts Entertainment, and 93.2 million included in other liabilities-non current representing the compensatory portion of the 3 Arts Entertainment noncontrolling interest, which may require the use of cash in the event the holders of the noncontrolling interests require the Company to repurchase their interests (see Note 9 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements). 
 We may from time to time seek to retire or purchase or refinance our outstanding debt through cash purchases, and/or exchanges for equity securities, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, refinancing's, or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges or refinancing's, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, our assessment of opportunities to lower interest expense, contractual restrictions and other factors, and such repurchases or exchanges could result in a charge from the early extinguishment of debt. The amounts involved may be material. 
 Anticipated Cash Requirements. The nature of our business is such that significant initial expenditures are required to produce, acquire, distribute and market films and television programs, while revenues from these films and television programs are earned over an extended period of time after their completion or acquisition. In addition to the cash requirements of any potential future redemption of our noncontrolling interests as discussed above, which we may fund with a combination of cash on hand, borrowings under our line of credit and/or new financing arrangements, we have other anticipated cash requirements outside of our normal operations. 
 As we continue to evaluate the Media Networks business and its current restructuring plan in relation to the current micro and macroeconomic environment and the announced plan to separate the Company's Starz business (i.e., Media Networks segment) and Studio Business (i.e., Motion Picture and Television Production segments), including further strategic review of content performance and its strategy on a territory-by-territory basis, we may decide to expand our restructuring plan and exit additional territories or remove certain content off its platform in the future. We may incur additional content impairment and other restructuring charges. 
 In the short-term, we currently expect that our cash requirements for productions will increase and our marketing spend will decrease in fiscal 2025 as compared to fiscal 2024. 
 However, we currently believe that cash flow from operations, cash on hand, revolving credit facility availability, the monetization of trade accounts receivable, tax-efficient financing, the availability from other financing obligations, available production, license or intellectual property financing, and proceeds from equity financing (see Note 2 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements), will be adequate to meet known operational cash and debt service (i.e. principal and interest payments) requirements for the next 12 months and beyond, including the funding of future film and television production, film and programming rights acquisitions and theatrical and home entertainment release schedules, and future equity method or other investment funding requirements. We monitor our cash flow liquidity, availability, fixed charge coverage, capital base, film spending and leverage ratios with the long-term goal of maintaining our credit worthiness. 
 Our current financing strategy is to fund operations and to leverage investment in films and television programs in the short-term and long-term through our cash flow from operations, our revolving credit facility, eOne IP Credit Facility, LG IP Credit Facility, production loans and programming notes, government incentive programs, the monetization of trade accounts receivable, our Production Tax Credit Facility, our Film Library Facility, our Backlog Facility, and other obligations. In addition, we may acquire businesses or assets, including individual films or libraries that are complementary to our business. Any such transaction could be financed through our cash flow from operations, credit facilities, equity or debt financing. If additional financing beyond our existing cash flows from operations and credit facilities cannot fund such transactions, there is 
 85 

no assurance that such financing will be available on terms acceptable to us. Our ability to obtain any additional financing will depend on, among other things, our business plans, operating performance, the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing, and short and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies. Additionally, circumstances related to inflation and rising interest rates and bank failures has caused disruption in the capital markets, which could make financing more difficult and/or expensive, and we may not be able to obtain such financing. We may also dispose of businesses or assets, including individual films or libraries, and use the net proceeds from such dispositions to fund operations or such acquisitions, or to repay debt. 
 Material Cash Requirements from Known Contractual and Other Obligations. Our material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations primarily relate to our corporate debt and film related obligations. The following table sets forth our significant contractual and other obligations as of September 30, 2024 and the estimated timing of payment:

 (1) See Note 6 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for further information on our corporate debt. 
 (2) See Note 7 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for further information on our film related obligations. 
 (3) Content related payables include minimum guarantees and accrued licensed program rights obligations included on our consolidated balance sheet, which represent amounts payable for film or television rights that we have acquired or licensed. 
 (4) Film related obligations commitments include distribution and marketing commitments, minimum guarantee commitments, program rights commitments, and production loan commitments not reflected on the consolidated balance sheets as they did not then meet the criteria for recognition. 
 (5) Includes cash interest payments on our corporate debt and film related obligations, based on the applicable SOFR interest rates at September 30, 2024, net of payments and receipts from the Company's interest rate swaps, and excluding the interest payments on the revolving credit facility as future amounts are not fixed or determinable due to fluctuating balances and interest rates. 
 (6) Not included in the amounts above are 93.2 million included in other liabilities-non current representing the compensatory portion of the 3 Arts Entertainment noncontrolling interest and 99.7 million of redeemable noncontrolling interest, as future amounts and timing are subject to a number of uncertainties such that we are unable to make sufficiently reliable estimations of future payments (see Note 9 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements). 
 
 86 

We have an exclusive multiyear post pay-one output licensing agreement with Universal for live-action films theatrically released in the U.S. starting January 1, 2022. The Universal agreement provides us with rights to exhibit these films immediately following their pay-one windows. We are unable to estimate the amounts to be paid under the Universal agreement for films that have not yet been released in theaters, however, such amounts are expected to be significant. 
 
 For additional details of contingencies, see Note 16 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 Covenants. The Senior Credit Facilities contain representations and warranties, events of default and affirmative and negative covenants that are customary for similar financings and which include, among other things and subject to certain significant exceptions, restrictions on the ability to declare or pay dividends, create liens, incur additional indebtedness, make investments, dispose of assets and merge or consolidate with any other person. In addition, a net first lien leverage maintenance covenant and an interest coverage ratio maintenance covenant apply to the Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan A and are tested quarterly. As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all applicable covenants. 
 
 The Exchange Notes contain certain restrictions and covenants that, subject to certain exceptions, limit the Company s ability to incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends or repurchase the Company s common shares, make certain loans or investments, and sell or otherwise dispose of certain assets subject to certain conditions, among other limitations. As of September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all applicable covenants. 
 Share Repurchase Plan. On February 2, 2016, our Board of Directors authorized to increase our previously announced share repurchase plan from 300 million to 468 million. To date, approximately 288.1 million of our common shares have been purchased under the plan, leaving approximately 179.9 million of authorized potential repurchases. The remaining 179.9 million of our common shares authorized under the plan may be purchased from time to time at our discretion, including quantity, timing and price thereof, and will be subject to market conditions. Such purchases will be structured as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements. During the six months ended September 30, 2024, the Company did not repurchase any common shares. 
 Dividends. The amount of dividends, if any, that we pay to our shareholders is determined by our Board of Directors, at its discretion, and is dependent on a number of factors, including our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, capital requirements and restrictions under our credit agreements, and shall be in compliance with applicable law. 
 Capacity to Pay Dividends. At September 30, 2024, the capacity to pay dividends under the Senior Credit Facilities and the Senior Notes significantly exceeded the amount of the Company's accumulated deficit or net loss, and therefore the Company's net loss of 240.9 million and accumulated deficit of 3,396.4 million were deemed free of restrictions from paying dividends at September 30, 2024. 
 
 Discussion of Operating, Investing, Financing Cash Flows 
 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash decreased by 84.4 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and decreased by 43.1 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023, before foreign exchange effects on cash. Components of these changes are discussed below in more detail. 
 Operating Activities. Cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows: 
 Six Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net Change (Amounts in millions) Net Cash Flows Provided By (Used In) Operating Activities (240.9) 330.3 (571.2) 
 
 Cash flows used in operating activities for the six months ended September 30, 2024 were 240.9 million compared to cash flows provided by operating activities of 330.3 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities is due to greater cash used in changes in operating assets and liabilities of 467.8 million. The greater cash used in changes in operating assets and liabilities was driven by increased cash used for investment in film and television programs and program rights, greater decreases in participations and residuals, content related payables and accounts payable and accrued liabilities, partially offset by greater proceeds from decreases in accounts receivable, net and greater increases in deferred revenue. 
 87 

Investing Activities. Cash flows used in investing activities for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows: 
 Six Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (Amounts in millions) Net proceeds from purchase price adjustments for eOne acquisition (see Note 2) 12.0 Proceeds from the sale of other investments 0.2 Investment in equity method investees and other (2.0) (11.3) Acquisition of assets (film library and related assets) (35.0) Increase in loans receivable (2.1) Capital expenditures (18.2) (18.3) Net Cash Flows Used In Investing Activities (43.2) (31.5) 
 Cash flows used in investing activities of 43.2 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 compared to cash flows used in investing activities of 31.5 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to cash used for the acquisition of a film library and related assets, partially offset by proceeds from the settlement of certain working capital items pursuant to the Purchase Agreement for eOne in the current period. 
 Financing Activities. Cash flows provided by (used in) financing activities for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows: 
 Six Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (Amounts in millions) Debt - borrowings, net of debt issuance and redemption costs 2,537.5 1,084.5 Debt - repurchases and repayments (2,569.0) (1,165.5) Net proceeds from (repayments and repurchases of) debt (31.5) (81.0) Film related obligations - borrowings 1,274.2 943.6 Film related obligations - repayments (1,289.8) (1,172.9) Net proceeds from (repayments of) film related obligations (15.6) (229.3) Sale of noncontrolling interest in Lionsgate Studios Corp. (see Note 2) 283.1 Other financing activities (36.3) (31.6) Net Cash Flows Provided By (Used In) Financing Activities 199.7 (341.9) 
 Cash flows provided by financing activities of 199.7 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 compared to cash flows used in financing activities of 341.9 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023. Cash flows provided by financing activities for the six months ended September 30, 2024 primarily reflects proceeds from the sale of a noncontrolling interest in Lionsgate Studios of 283.1 million, which was partially offset by net film related obligations repayments of 15.6 million, net debt repayments of 31.5 million, and cash used for other financing activities of 36.3 million representing primarily tax withholding required on equity awards of 28.6 million. Net debt repayments of 31.5 million in the six months ended September 30, 2024 included the below transactions, along with required repayments on our term loans and borrowings and repayments under our revolving credit facility for working capital purposes: 
 In May 2024, we used the proceeds from the Business Combination to prepay 84.9 million principal amount of the Term Loan A and 214.1 million of the Term Loan B. 
 In July 2024 and September 2024, we borrowed 340.0 million under the eOne IP Credit Facility and 455.0 million under the LG IP Credit Facility, respectively. 
 In September 2024, we used the proceeds from the LG IP Credit Facility to prepay 355.1 million principal amount of the Term Loan B. 
 88 

Cash flows used in financing activities of 341.9 million for the six months ended September 30, 2023 primarily reflects net film related obligations repayments of 229.3 million due to net repayments under production loans and the Production Tax Credit Facility of 168.9 million and net repayments under the Backlog Facility, Film Library Facility and other of 60.4 million, and net debt repayments and repurchases of 81.0 million. Net debt repayments and repurchases of 81.0 million in the six months ended September 30, 2023 included the below transaction, along with required repayments on our term loans: 
 During the six months ended September 30, 2023, we repurchased 85.0 million principal amount of the 5.5 Senior Notes for 61.4 million. 
 Other financing activities in the six months ended September 30, 2023 also includes tax withholding required on equity awards of 30.7 million. 
 
 Remaining Performance Obligations and Backlog 
 
 Remaining performance obligations represent deferred revenue on the balance sheet plus fixed fee or minimum guarantee contracts where the revenue will be recognized and the cash received in the future (i.e., backlog). As disclosed in Note 10 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, remaining performance obligations were 1.8 billion at September 30, 2024 (March 31, 2024 - 1.8 billion). The backlog portion of remaining performance obligations (excluding deferred revenue) related to our Motion Picture and Television Production segments was 1.3 billion at September 30, 2024 (March 31, 2024 - 1.5 billion). 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 
 Currency and Interest Rate Risk Management 
 Market risks relating to our operations result primarily from changes in interest rates and changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Our exposure to interest rate risk results from the financial debt instruments that arise from transactions entered into during the normal course of business. As part of our overall risk management program, we evaluate and manage our exposure to changes in interest rates and currency exchange risks on an ongoing basis. Hedges and derivative financial instruments will continue to be used in the future in order to manage our interest rate and currency exposure. We have no intention of entering into financial derivative contracts, other than to hedge a specific financial risk. See Note 17 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information on our financial instruments, and see Part II, Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk found in our Form 10-K. 
 
 Certain of our borrowings, primarily borrowings under our Senior Credit Facilities, eOne IP Credit Facility, LG IP Credit Facility and our film related obligations are, and are expected to continue to be, at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income would decrease. The applicable margin with respect to loans under the revolving credit facility and Term Loan A is a percentage per annum equal to SOFR plus 0.10 plus 1.75 margin. The applicable margin with respect to loans under our Term Loan B is a percentage per annum equal to SOFR plus 0.10 plus 2.25 margin. Advances under the eOne IP Credit Facility and LG IP Credit Facility bear interest at a rate equal to Term SOFR plus 2.25 per annum. Assuming the revolving credit facility is drawn up to its maximum borrowing capacity of 1.25 billion, based on the applicable SOFR in effect as of September 30, 2024, each quarter point change in interest rates would result in a 1.7 million change in annual net interest expense on the revolving credit facility, Term Loan A, Term Loan B, eOne IP Credit Facility, LG IP Credit Facility and interest rate swap agreements. 
 
 The variable interest film related obligations (which includes our production loans, programming notes, Production Tax Credit Facility, Film Library Facility, Backlog Facility and other) incur primarily SOFR-based interest, with applicable margins ranging from 0.25 to 3.25 per annum. A quarter point increase of the interest rates on the variable interest film related obligations would result in 3.1 million in additional costs capitalized to the respective film or television asset for production loans and programming notes (based on the outstanding principal amount of such loans), and a 1.8 million change in annual net interest expense (based on the outstanding principal amount of such loans, and assuming the Production Tax Credit Facility and Backlog Facility are utilized up to their maximum capacity of 260.0 million and 175.0 million, respectively). 
 At September 30, 2024, our 5.5 Senior Notes and Exchange Notes had an outstanding carrying value of 698.2 million, and an estimated fair value of 581.4 million. A 1 increase in the level of interest rates would decrease the fair value of the 5.5 Senior Notes by approximately 21.5 million, and a 1 decrease in the level of interest rates would increase the fair value of the 5.5 Senior Notes by approximately 22.8 million.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 The term disclosure controls and procedures is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended (the Exchange Act ). These rules refer to the controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within required time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the end of the period covered by this report, the Company carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e). Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that such controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 On December 27, 2023, we purchased all of the issued and outstanding equity interests of the companies constituting the Entertainment One television and film eOne business and, as a result, we have begun integrating the processes, systems and controls relating to eOne into our existing system of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with our integration plans. As required by Rule 13a-15(d) of the Exchange Act, the Company, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated whether any changes occurred to the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, such control. Based on that evaluation, except for the processes, systems and controls relating to the integration of eOne, there has been no such change during the quarter ended September 30, 2024. 

91 

PART II 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 
 From time to time, the Company is involved in certain claims and legal proceedings arising in the normal course of business. Due to the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of litigation and claims, the Company often cannot predict what the eventual outcome of the pending matters will be, what the timing of the ultimate resolution of these matters will be, or what the eventual loss, if any, related to each pending matter may be. 
 
 For a discussion of certain claims and legal proceedings, see Note 16 - Contingencies to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, which discussion is incorporated by reference into this Part II, Item 1, Legal Proceedings. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 
 Other than as set forth below, there were no other material changes to the risk factors previously reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024. 
 
 The separation of the Company s motion picture and television studio operations, from its other businesses, is subject to various risks and uncertainties, and may not be completed in accordance with the expected plans or anticipated timeline, or at all, and will involve significant time and expense, which could disrupt or adversely affect the Company s business. 
 
 On October 14, 2024, the Company filed a joint proxy statement/prospectus on Form S-4 with the SEC relating to the implementation of a plan of arrangement that will result in the separation of the businesses of Lionsgate Studios Corp., of which the Company owns approximately 87.8 and which encompasses the Company s motion picture and television studio operations, from its other businesses, including the STARZ-branded premium subscription platform (the Proposed Separation ). The separation into two separate, publicly traded companies is complex in nature, and unanticipated developments or changes, including changes in the law, the macroeconomic environment, competitive conditions, regulatory approvals or clearances, the uncertainty of the financial markets and challenges in executing the Proposed Separation, could delay or prevent the completion of the Proposed Separation, or cause the Proposed Separation to occur on terms or conditions that are different or less favorable than expected. The process of completing the proposed Separation has been and is expected to continue to be time-consuming and involves significant costs and expenses. The costs of the Proposed Separation may be significantly higher than what the Company currently anticipates and may not yield a discernible benefit if the Proposed Separation is not completed or is not well executed, or the expected benefits of the Proposed Separation is not realized. Executing the Proposed Separation will also require significant amounts of the Company s management s time and effort, which may divert management s attention from operating and growing the Company s businesses. In addition, if the Proposed Separation is abandoned, not completed, or delayed or if the expected benefits of the Separation are not realized, there may be a negative impact on the market price of the Company s common shares. 
 
 The Proposed Separation may result in litigation and/or regulatory inquiries and investigations, which could harm the Company s business, financial condition and operating results and could divert management attention. 
 
 Additionally, the Proposed Separation may result in litigation and/or regulatory inquiries and investigations, which could harm the Company s financial condition and operating results and could divert management attention. In the past, securities class action litigation and/or shareholder derivative litigation and inquiries or investigations by regulatory authorities have often followed certain significant business transactions, such as the sale of a company or announcement of any other strategic transaction, such as the Proposed Separation. Any litigation or investigation relating to the Proposed Separation could result in substantial costs and divert management s attention from other business concerns, which could adversely affect the Company s business and cash resources and the ultimate value of its common shares. 
 
 Purported noteholders have instituted suit against the Company claiming that it breached the indenture governing Lions Gate Capital Holdings LLC s 5.500 senior notes due 2029 by virtue of an amendment executed in connection with an exchange by certain noteholders for new notes. 
 
 On August 27, 2024, purported holders of the Company s 5.500 senior notes due 2029 (the 5.500 Notes filed a complaint against the Company in New York State court asserting claims for declaratory judgment and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing based on a May 2024 transaction in which the Company exchanged approximately 390 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.500 Notes for new 5.500 exchange notes due 2029 and entered into 
 92 

Supplemental Indenture No. 10 to the indenture governing the 5.500 Notes (the Indenture ). The main basis for these claims is that Supplemental Indenture No. 10 allegedly implicated certain provisions of the Indenture that require consent of each affected holder for certain types of waivers, amendments, and supplements to the Indenture. The relief sought includes a request for a declaration that Supplemental Indenture No. 10 and the associated exchange transaction are null and void, as well as for a permanent injunction against the Proposed Separation transactions going forward to the extent they have not already taken place. On September 13, 2024, another purported holder sought to intervene as a plaintiff in the same suit asserting nearly identical claims, which intervention was granted on October 11, 2024. 
 
 Although the Company believes that these allegations are without merit, there can be no assurance that the plaintiffs will not be successful in obtaining relief sought in their complaints. If they are successful in obtaining a declaratory judgment, they may also issue the trustee of the 5.500 Notes a notice of default and seek accelerated payments for amounts due under the 5.500 Notes. These actions may result in an outcome that could have a material adverse impact on the Company s business, operations and financial conditions as well as their stakeholders, as any such actions could require payments on the 5.500 Notes earlier than expected. In addition, if plaintiffs obtain an injunction against moving forward with the Proposed Separation, the Proposed Separation, to the extent not yet completed, may need to be abandoned. Even if the Company is successful in defending against such claims, it may expend significant management time and attention and funds to defend against such claims. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 
 
 Issuer Purchases of Securities 
 
 On May 31, 2007, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 50 million of our common shares. On each of May 29, 2008 and November 6, 2008, our Board of Directors authorized additional repurchases up to an additional 50 million of our common shares. On December 17, 2013, our Board of Directors authorized the Company to increase its stock repurchase plan to 300 million and on February 2, 2016, our Board of Directors authorized the Company to further increase its stock repurchase plan to 468 million. To date, approximately 288.1 million (or 16,608,796) of our common shares have been purchased, leaving approximately 179.9 million of authorized potential repurchases. The remaining 179.9 million of our common shares may be purchased from time to time at the Company s discretion, including quantity, timing and price thereof, and will be subject to market conditions.
