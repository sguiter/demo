 (b) Includes primarily damage billings, delinquent payment charges, other processing fees, and provisions for specific uncollectible receivables. 
 Leasing and Services Revenue 
 The majority of revenue and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023) was generated by lease income subject to the guidance of Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) ("ASC 842"). The remaining revenue was generated by performance obligations in contracts with customers for services or the sale of units subject to the guidance in Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) ("ASC 606"). 
 Receivables and Credit Losses 
 The Company manages credit risk associated with its accounts receivable at the customer level.

 Contract Assets and Liabilities 
 When customers are billed in advance for services, the Company defers recognition of revenue until the related services are performed, which generally occurs at the end of the contract. The balance sheet classification of deferred revenue is determined based on the contractual lease term. For contracts that continue beyond their initial contractual lease term, revenue continues to be deferred until the services are performed. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had approximately million and million , respectively, of deferred revenue related to services billed in advance. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, million and million, respectively, of deferred revenue billed in advance was recognized as revenue. 
 The Company does not have material contract assets, and it did not recognize any material impairments for any contract assets. 
 The Company's uncompleted contracts with customers have unsatisfied (or partially satisfied) performance obligations. For the future services revenues that are expected to be recognized within twelve months, the Compa ny has elected to utilize the optional disclosure exemption regarding transaction price allocated to unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) performance obligations. The transaction price for performance obligations that will be completed in greater than twelve months is variable based on the market rate in place at the time those services are provided, and therefore, the Company is applying the optional expedient to omit disclosure of such amounts. 
 The primary costs to obtain contracts fo r new and rental unit sales with the Company's customers are commissions. The Company pays its sales force commissions on the sale of new and rental units. For new and rental unit sales, the period benefited by each commission is less than one year. As a result, the Company has applied the practical expedient for incremental costs of obtaining a sales contract and expenses commissions as incurred.

 The following Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations MD A is intended to help the reader understand WillScot Holdings Corporation ("WillScot") operations and our present business environment. MD A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto, contained in Part I, Item 1 of this report. The discussion of results of operations in this MD A is presented on a historical basis, as of or for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 or prior periods. 
 On January 31, 2023, the Company completed the sale of its former United Kingdom ("UK") Storage Solutions segment. This MD A presents the historical financial results of the former UK Storage Solutions segment as discontinued operations for all periods presented. On July 29, 2024, the Company amended and restated its certificate of incorporation to effect a change of the Company s name from WillScot Mobile Mini Holdings Corp. to WillScot Holdings Corporation." 
 The consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States GAAP ). We use certain non-GAAP financial metrics to supplement the GAAP reported results to highlight key operational metrics that are used by management to evaluate Company performance. Reconciliations of GAAP financial information to the disclosed non-GAAP measures are provided in the Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures section of MD A. 

Executive Summary 
 We are a leading business services provider specializing in innovative and flexible turnkey temporary space solutions. We service diverse end markets across all sectors of the economy throughout the United States ("US"), Canada, and Mexico. As of September 30, 2024, our branch network included approximately 260 branch locations and additional drop lots to service our over 85,000 customers. We offer our customers an extensive selection of Ready to Work temporary space solutions with over 152,000 modular space units and over 210,000 portable storage and cold storage units in our fleet. 
 We primarily lease, rather than sell, our modular and portable storage units to customers, which results in a highly diversified and predictable recurring revenue stream. Over 90 of new lease orders are on our standard lease agreement, pre-negotiated master lease or national account agreements. The initial lease periods vary, and our leases are customarily renewable on a month-to-month basis after their initial term. Our lease revenue is highly predictable due to its recurring nature and the underlying stability and diversification of our lease portfolio. Furthermore, given that our customers value flexibility, they consistently extend their leases or renew on a month-to-month basis such that the average effective duration of our lease portfolio, excluding seasonal portable storage leases, is approximately 38 months. We complement our core leasing business by selling both new and used units, allowing us to leverage scale, achieve purchasing benefits and redeploy capital employed in our lease fleet. 
 Our customers operate in a diversified set of end markets, including construction, commercial and industrial, retail and wholesale trade, energy and natural resources, education, government and institutions and healthcare. Core to our operating model is the ability to redeploy standardized assets across end markets. We track several market leading indicators to predict demand, including those related to our two largest end markets, the commercial and industrial sector and the construction sector, which collectively accounted for approximately 85 of our revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 We remain focused on our core priorities of growing leasing revenues by increasing units on rent, both organically and through our acquisition strategy, delivering Ready to Work turnkey solutions to our customers with value added products and services ("VAPS"), and continually improving the overall customer experience. 
 Significant Developments 
 Termination of Agreement to Acquire McGrath RentCorp 
 On January 28, 2024, we entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the Merger Agreement with McGrath RentCorp ("McGrath"). On September 17, 2024, the Company and McGrath mutually agreed to terminate the Merger Agreement. In accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, during the three months ended September 30, 2024, we paid McGrath a 180.0 million termination fee, which was treated as an operating expense in the quarter. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded 8.8 million and 41.3 million respectively, in legal and professional fees primarily related to the McGrath transaction within selling, general and administrative expense ("SG A"). 
 25 

In connection with the proposed acquisition of McGrath, we entered into a commitment letter dated January 28, 2024, which was amended and restated on June 13, 2024 and modified by a Notice of Reduction of Bridge Commitments on June 28, 2024 (the "Commitment Letter"), pursuant to which certain financial institutions committed to make available, in accordance with the terms of the Commitment Letter, (i) a senior secured bridge credit facility and (ii) an upsize to the existing ABL Facility (as defined below). As a result of the termination of the Merger Agreement, the Commitment Letter was terminated. 
 Restructuring 
 In June 2024, the Company implemented a cost-reduction plan to be completed by the end of 2024. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, r estructuring costs incurred under this plan i ncluded employee termination costs of 2.3 million and 8.5 million, respectively. 
 Financing Activities 
 On June 28, 2024, Williams Scotsman, Inc. ("WSI") completed a private offering of 500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.625 senior secured notes due 2029 (the "2029 Secur ed Notes") to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A . P roceeds were used to repay approximately 495.0 million of outstanding indebtedness under the ABL Facility and certain fees and expenses. 
 Mobile Mini Trade Name Impairment 
 In the second quarter of 2024, we determined that a review of the carrying value of the Mobile Mini trade name was necessary based on the Company's plan to rebrand under a single WillScot brand name and discontinue the use of the Mobile Mini trade name. As of June 30, 2024, the Mobile Mini trade name was tested for impairment using the relief from royalty valuation method. After determining the estimated fair value, we recorded an impairment charge of 132.5 million during the three months ended June 30, 2024. This non-cash charge was recorded to impairment loss on intangible asset on the consolidated statement of operations. After the impairment charge , t he remaining net book value of the Mobile Mini trade name was 31.5 million, which is being amortized over a remaining useful life. 
 Acquisitions 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of three local storage and modular companies, which consisted primarily of approximately 600 storage units and 800 modular units, and one national provider of premium large clearspan structures for 84.5 million. As of the acquisition dates, the fair value of rental equipment acquired was 80.7 million. 
 Share Repurchases 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased 3,623,298 shares of Common Stock for 140.4 million, excluding excise tax. As of September 30, 2024, 951.9 million of the authorization for future repurchases of the Common Stock remained available. Given that we believe our free cash flow is predictable (with the exception of isolated events), we believe that repurchases will be a recurring capital allocation priority. 
 Interest Rate Swap Agreements 
 In January 2024, we entered into two interest rate swap agreements with financial counterparties relating to 500.0 million in aggregate notional amount of variable-rate debt under the ABL Facility. Under the terms of the agreements, we receive a floating rate equal to one-month term SOFR and make payments based on a weighted average fixed interest rate of 3.70 on the notional amount. The swap agreements were designated and qualified as hedges of our exposure to changes in interest payment cash flows created by fluctuations in variable interest rates on the ABL Facility. The swap agreements terminate on June 30, 2027. 
 Segment Reporting 
 In January 2024, we completed the unification of our go-to market structure by integrating our modular and storage divisions under a single leadership team organized by metropolitan statistical area (MSA), which enables us to consistently deliver our portfolio of solutions to our entire customer base. In connection with this change in operating model, we realigned the composition of our operating and reportable segments. As a result, we concluded we have two operating segments (US and Other North America) that aggregate into one reportable segment.

Additionally, based on our segment realignment, we have conformed our VAPS presentation to include all VAPS not specific to portable storage orders as modular space VAPS and recalculated average monthly rental rates. This treatment is consistent with prior treatment in our previous Modular Segment. All historical product operating key performance indicators have been recast to be presented on a comparable basis for all periods. 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, results and key drivers of our financial performance included: 
 Total revenues decreased 3.4 million, or 0.6 . Leasing revenue decreased 11.2 million, or 2.4 , and delivery and installation revenue decreased 0.8 million, or 0.7 . These decreases were partially offset by an increase in new unit sales revenue of 7.7 million, or 75.8 , and an increase in rental unit sales revenue of 0.9 million, or 7.5 . 
 Modular product revenue, which represented 77.8 of consolidated revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024, increased 17.3 million, or 3.8 , to 467.8 million. The increase was driven by delivery and installation revenue, which increased 7.2 million, or 8.6 , new unit sales revenue, which increased 8.2 million, or 92.5 , and rental unit sales revenue, which increased 1.2 million, or 12.3 . Core leasing revenue increased 0.7 million, or 0.2 . 
 Modular revenue drivers for the three months ended September 30, 2024 included: 
 Modular space average monthly rental rate increased 69, or 6.1 , year over year to 1,199 representing a continuation of the long-term price optimization and VAPS penetration opportunities across our portfolio. 
 Average modular space units on rent decreased 3,270, or 3.3 , year over year. 
 Average modular space monthly utilization decreased 180 basis points ("bps") to 62.1 . 
 Storage product revenue, which represented 22.2 of consolidated revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024, decreased 20.7 million, or 13.4 , to 133.6 million. The decrease was driven by a decrease in core leasing revenue of 11.9 million, or 10.1 , driven by reduced portable storage container volumes, partially offset by increased rates on portable storage containers and increased revenue from acquired climate-controlled containers and refrigerated storage units. Delivery and installation revenue also decreased 8.0 million, or 25.0 , driven by reduced delivery volumes and decreased pricing. Rental unit sales revenue decreased 0.3 million, or 9.1 , and new unit sales decreased 0.5 million, or 40.6 . Storage revenue drivers for the three months ended September 30, 2024 included: 
 Portable storage average monthly rental rate increased 23, or 9.5 , year over year to 265 as a result of our price management tools, processes and benefits from increased VAPS penetration opportunities, as well as higher rates on the climate-controlled containers and refrigerated storage units acquired in 2023 and 2024. 
 Average portable storage units on rent decreased 27,551, or 18.3 , year over year driven by lower demand for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The lower demand was driven largely by decreased new construction project starts over the past two years as compared to higher activity levels experienced during 2021 and 2022 and less demand in the retail and wholesale trade customer segment. 
 27 

Average portable storage monthly utilization decreased 12.1 to 58.1 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Generated loss from continuing operations of 70.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, which included the 180.0 million termination fee paid to McGrath and other discrete costs in the period of 13.4 million, including 8.8 million of legal and professional fees related to the proposed acquisition of McGrath, 1.7 million of integration costs, and 2.5 million of restructuring, lease impairment expense, and other related charges primarily related to employee termination costs as a result of a cost-reduction plan implemented in June 2024. Gross profit margin for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 53.5 . 
 Generated Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations of 266.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, representing an increase of 1.4 million, or 0.5 , as compared to the same period in 2023. 
 Adjusted EBITDA margin from continuing operations was 44.4 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and increased 50 bps versus prior year. Leasing margins increased 127 bps versus prior year and delivery and installation margins decreased 896 bps versus prior year. 
 Net cash (used in) provided by operating activities decreased 192.6 million to 1.6 million net cash used in operating activities for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 191.0 million net cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended September, 30, 2023. Net cash used in investing activities, excluding cash used for acquisitions, increased by 18.2 million. Capital expenditures for rental equipment increased 6.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as a result of increased new fleet purchases, including additional investment in climate-controlled containers and refrigerated storage units. Purchases of property, plant, and equipment decreased 2.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Proceeds from the sale of rental equipment increased 0.5 million. Proceeds from the sale of property, plant, and equipment decreased 12.1 million. Net CAPEX increased 15.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Generated a Free Cash Flow deficit of 60.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, representing a decrease of 207.9 million as compared to the same period in 2023, which was driven by the 180.0 million termination fee paid to McGrath and related transaction costs. Excluding one-time, nonrecurring payments of 180.0 million for the McGrath termination fee and 23.3 million for transaction costs from terminated acquisitions, Adjusted Free Cash Flow was 143.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 147.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we acquired a national provider of premium large clearspan structures for 13.9 million. We also returned 61.7 million to shareholders through stock repurchases, reducing outstanding Common Stock by 1,587,785 shares. 
 With the exception of isolated events, we believe the predictability of our Free Cash Flow allows us to pursue multiple capital allocation priorities opportunistically, including investing in organic opportunities we see in the market, maintaining leverage in our stated range, opportunistically executing accretive acquisitions, and returning capital to shareholders. 
 In addition to using GAAP financial measurements, we use Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Gross Profit Percentage, Net CAPEX and Free Cash Flow, which are non-GAAP financial measures, to evaluate our operating results. As such, we include in this Form 10-Q reconciliations to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations and descriptions of why we believe these measures provide useful information to investors as well as a description of the limitations of these measures are included in "Reconciliation of non-GAAP Financial Measures" and "Liquidity and Capital Resources."

Portable storage average units on rent decreased by 27,551 units, or 18.3 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 driven by lower demand in 2024. The lower demand was driven largely by decreased new construction project starts over the past two years as compared to higher activity levels experienced during 2021 and 2022 and less demand in the retail and wholesale trade customer segment. The average portable storage unit utilization rate during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 58.1 as compared to 70.2 
 29 

during the same period in 2023. Modular space average units on rent decreased 3,270 units, or 3.3 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, which was also largely driven by decreased new construction project starts over the past two years as compared to higher activity levels experienced during 2021 and 2022. The average modular space utilization rate during the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 62.1 as compared to 63.9 during the same period in 2023. 
 Modular space average monthly rental rates increased 6.1 year over year to 1,199 for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Increases were driven by a continuation of the long-term price optimization and VAPS penetration opportunities. Average portable storage monthly rental rates increased 9.5 year over year to 265 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as a result of our price management tools, processes and benefits from increased VAPS penetration opportunities, as well as higher rates on the climate-controlled containers and refrigerated storage units acquired in 2023 and 2024. Total VAPS revenues, which are included in leasing revenues, increased 0.3 million, or 0.3 , to 100.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 99.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Gross profit: Gross profit decreased 18.2 million, or 5.4 , to 321.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 339.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in gross profit was a result of decreased delivery and installation gross profit of 10.5 million, increased depreciation expense of 9.3 million, and a 2.9 million decrease in leasing gross profit. The decrease was partially offset by a 4.5 million increase in new and rental unit sales gross profit. The decrease in leasing gross profit was primarily driven by lower demand in 2024. Cost of leasing and services increased by 1.4 million, or 0.8 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 versus the three months ended September 30, 2023, driven by an increase in subcontractors costs of 7.7 million, or 11.5 , and an increase in labor costs of 0.8 million, or 1.1 . These increased costs were partially offset by a decrease in materials costs of 6.1 million, or 21.5 . Cost of sales increased by 4.1 million, or 35.1 , which is directionally in line with the 38.4 increase in sales revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Our resulting gross profit percentage was 53.5 and 56.2 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our Adjusted Gross Profit Percentage, excluding the effects of depreciation of rental equipment, was 66.1 and 67.2 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decreases, as referenced above, were mainly driven by lower utilization rates, specifically on portable storage products. 
 SG A: SG A decreased 1.1 million, or 0.7 , to 150.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 152.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Employee SG A excluding stock compensation decreased 9.7 million, or 15.4 , primarily as a result of decreased variable compensation expense, including management incentives, and lower employee headcount as a result of the cost-reduction plan implemented in June 2024. Service agreements and professional fees, excluding discrete expenses for certain one-time projects, decreased 5.6 million, or 24.4 , and our provision for credit losses, net of write offs, decreased 1.1 million, or 10.6 . These decreased costs were partially offset by a 8.0 million increase in discrete expenses for certain one-time projects, primarily legal and professional fees related to the proposed acquisition of McGrath, a 3.2 million increase in real estate and occupancy costs, a 1.1 million increase in marketing and advertising expense, and a 1.0 million increase in travel costs. 
 Adjusted EBITDA: Adjusted EBITDA increased 1.4 million, or 1 , to 266.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 265.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was driven by a 4.5 million increase in new and used sales gross profit and decreased SG A, excluding discrete costs, of 10.2 million, or 7.2 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was partially offset by a 2.9 million decrease in leasing gross profit and decreased delivery and installation gross profit of 10.5 million. 
 Other depreciation and amortization: Other depreciation and amortization increased 5.3 million to 23.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 17.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily related to the amortization of the Mobile Mini tradename in 2024. 
 Termination fee: We paid the termination fee of 180.0 million to McGrath related to the termination of the Merger Agreement during the three months ended September 30, 2024, which was treated as an operating expense. 
 Restructuring costs: Restructuring costs of 2.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were due to employee termination costs as a result of a cost-reduction plan implemented in June 2024. 
 Currency (gains) losses, net: Currency (gains) losses, net decreased by 0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Other expense (income), net: Other expense, net was 0.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to other income, net of 8.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. This change was primarily attributable to a gain on sale of fixed assets related to a real estate sale transaction during the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Interest expense, net: Interest expense, net increased 2.0 million, or 3.8 , to 55.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 53.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in interest 
 30 

expense was a result of higher overall weighted average interest rates as a result of increased benchmark rates and higher outstanding debt balances. See Note 9 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our debt. 
 Income tax (benefit) expense: Income tax benefit was 20.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to income tax expense of 32.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, a change of 53.3 million. The change was primarily driven by a decrease in income from continuing operations before income tax for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Capital expenditures for rental equipment: Capital expenditures for rental equipment increased 6.0 million, or 9 , to 69.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 63.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 as a result of increased refurbishment spending and new fleet purchases, including additional investment in climate-controlled containers and refrigerated storage units. Net CAPEX increased 15.3 million, or 35 , to 58.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 from 43.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 driven by the increase in capital expenditures for rental equipment as described above and a 12.1 million decrease in proceeds from the sale of property, plant, and equipment, partially offset by a 2.2 million decrease in purchases of property, plant and equipment, and a 0.5 million increase in proceeds from the sale of rental equipment.

Additionally, based on our segment realignment, we have conformed our VAPS presentation to include all VAPS not specific to portable storage orders as modular space VAPS and recalculated average monthly rental rates. This treatment is consistent with prior treatment in our previous Modular Segment. All historical product operating key performance indicators have been recast to be presented on a comparable basis for all periods. 
 
 Comparison of Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 Revenue: Total revenue increased 40.8 million, or 2.3 , to 1,793.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 1,752.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Leasing revenue increased 18.7 million, or 1.4 , as compared to the same period in 2023 driven by improved pricing and value added products penetration, partially offset by a decrease of 35,125 total average units on rent. Delivery and installation revenues decreased 11.7 million, or 3.5 , due to decreased deliveries and returns. Rental unit sales increased 10.9 million, or 34.5 , primarily driven by a single large project in the second quarter and increased overall rental unit sales activity, and new unit sales increased 22.9 million, or 76.8 , primarily related to sales activity from a company we acquired in the middle of the third quarter of 2023. 
 Total average units on rent for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 221,619 and 256,744, respectively. Modular space average units on rent decreased 3,522 units, or 3.6 , and portable storage average units on rent decreased by 31,603 units, or 20.0 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The lower demand was driven largely by decreased new construction project starts over the past two years as compared to higher activity levels experienced during 2021 and 2022 and less demand in the retail and wholesale trade customer segment. The average modular space utilization rate during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 62.3 as compared to 64.8 during the same period in 2023. The average portable storage utilization rate during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 59.8 as compared to 74.1 during the same period in 2023. 
 Modular space average monthly rental rates increased 8.4 to 1,175 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Increases were driven by a continuation of the long-term price optimization and VAPS penetration opportunities. Average portable storage monthly rental rates increased 16.4 to 263 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as a result of our price management tools, processes and benefits from increased VAPS penetration opportunities, as well as higher rates on the climate-controlled containers and refrigerated storage units acquired in 2023 and 2024. Total VAPS revenues, which are included in leasing revenues, increased 4.9 million, or 1.7 , to 296.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 291.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Gross profit: Gross profit decreased 25.2 million, or 2.5 , to 965.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 990.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in gross profit was a result of a 36.2 million increase in depreciation of rental equipment and decreased delivery and installation gross profit of 24.1 million. These decreases in gross profit were partially offset by a 22.4 million increase in leasing gross profit and increased new and rental unit sale gross profit of 12.6 million. The increase in leasing gross profit was primarily a result of increased revenues due to favorable average monthly rental rates including VAPS across both portable storage and modular space units, which offset lower unit on rent volumes. Cost of leasing and services increased by 8.6 million, or 1.6 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, driven by a 19.2 million, or 10.0 , increase in labor cost and a 3.5 million, or 4.7 , increase in vehicle, equipment and other costs partially offset by a 10.7 million, or 13.1 , decrease in material costs and a 3.3 million, or 1.7 , decrease in subcontractor costs. Cost of sales increased by 21.2 million, or 65.6 , which is directionally in line with increased sales revenues of 55.1 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 33 

Our gross profit percentage was 53.8 and 56.5 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our Adjusted Gross Profit Percentage, excluding the effects of depreciation of rental equipment, was 66.5 and 67.4 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decreases, as referenced above, were mainly driven by lower utilization rates, specifically on portable storage products. 
 SG A: SG A increased 43.4 million, or 9.6 , to 493.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 449.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Discrete expenses for certain one-time projects, primarily legal and professional fees related to the proposed acquisition of McGrath, increased 42.7 million. Real estate and occupancy costs increased 11.8 million, or 18.7 , and stock compensation expense increased 2.1 million to 28.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 26.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. These increases were partially offset by a 5.6 million, or 9.4 , decrease in service agreements and professional fees, a 2.9 million, or 1.5 , decrease in employee costs, a 2.3 million, or 12.5 , decrease in travel costs and a 3.8 million, or 19.0 , decrease in the provision for credit losses, net of write offs. 
 Adjusted EBITDA: Adjusted EBITDA increased 4.8 million, or 1 , to 778.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 773.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was driven by a 22.4 million increase in leasing gross profit, a 12.6 million increase in new and used sales gross profit, and decreased SG A, excluding discrete costs, of 1.3 million, or 0.3 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was partially offset by decreased delivery and installation gross profit of 24.1 million and decreased other expense (income), net of 16.5 million. 
 Other depreciation and amortization: Other depreciation and amortization increased 6.8 million to 59.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 52.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily related to the amortization of the Mobile Mini tradename in 2024. 
 Termination fee: We paid the termination fee of 180.0 million to McGrath related to the termination of the Merger Agreement during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, which was treated as an operating expense. 
 Impairment loss on intangible asset: Impairment loss on intangible asset was 132.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 related to the impairment of the Mobile Mini trade name based on the Company's plan to rebrand under a single WillScot brand name and discontinue the use of the Mobile Mini trade name. 
 Lease impairment expense and other related charges: Lease impairment expense and other related charges increased to 0.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. These charges were related to the exit of an office property. 
 Restructuring costs: Restructuring costs of 8.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 were primarily due to employee termination costs as a result of a cost-reduction plan implemented in June 2024. 
 Currency (gains) losses, net: Currency gains, net decreased by 7.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. This change was primarily attributable to a 7.7 million loss in 2023 on the settlement of the contingent foreign currency forward contract relating to the sale of the former UK Storage Solutions segment in January 2023. 
 Other expense (income), net: Other expense, net was 1.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to other income, net of 14.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. This change was primarily attributable to a gain on sale of fixed assets related to a real estate sale transaction during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and insurance recoveries received in 2023 related to Hurricane Ian in the Gulf Coast area of the United States in 2022. 
 Interest expense, net: Interest expense increased 22.0 million to 168.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 145.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in interest expense was a result of higher overall weighted average interest rates as a result of increased benchmark rates and higher outstanding debt balances. See Note 9 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our debt. 
 Income tax (benefit) expense: Income tax (benefit) expense decreased 112.2 million to a benefit of 17.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to expense of 94.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in expense was driven by a decrease in income from continuing operations before income tax for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Income from discontinued operations: Income from discontinued operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was related to the former UK Storage Solutions segment, which was sold January 2023. 
 34 

Capital expenditures for rental equipment: Capital expenditures for rental equipment increased 40.9 million, or 25 , to 207.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 166.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 as a result of increased refurbishment spending and new fleet purchases, including additional investment in climate-controlled containers and refrigerated storage units. Net CAPEX increased 46.5 million, or 35 , to 178.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 131.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 driven by the increase in capital expenditures for rental equipment as described above and a 12.1 million decrease in proceeds from the sale of property, plant, and equipment. This increase was partially offset by a 5.9 million increase in proceeds from the sale of rental equipment for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 In addition to using GAAP financial measurements, we use certain non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate our operating results. As such, we include in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Set forth below are definitions and reconciliations to the nearest comparable GAAP measure of certain non-GAAP financial measures used in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q along with descriptions of why we believe these measures provide useful information to investors as well as a description of the limitations of these measures. Each of these non-GAAP financial measures has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for analysis of, results reported under GAAP. Our measurements of these metrics may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 We define EBITDA as net income (loss) plus interest (income) expense, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and amortization. Our adjusted EBITDA ("Adjusted EBITDA") reflects the following further adjustments to EBITDA to exclude certain non-cash items and the effect of what we consider transactions or events not related to our core business operations: 
 Goodwill and other impairment charges related to non-cash costs associated with impairment charges to goodwill, other intangibles, rental fleet and property, plant and equipment. 
 Restructuring costs, lease impairment expense, and other related charges associated with restructuring plans designed to streamline operations and reduce costs including employee and lease termination costs. 
 Currency (gains) losses, net on monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies other than the subsidiaries functional currency. 
 Transaction costs including legal and professional fees and other transaction specific related costs. 
 Costs to integrate acquired companies, including outside professional fees, non-capitalized costs associated with system integrations, non-lease branch and fleet relocation expenses, employee training costs, and other costs required to realize cost or revenue synergies. 
 Non-cash charges for stock compensation plans. 
 Other expenses, including consulting expenses related to certain one-time projects, financing costs not classified as interest expense, and gains and losses on disposals of property, plant, and equipment. 
 Our Chief Operating Decision Maker ("CODM") evaluates business performance utilizing Adjusted EBITDA as shown in the reconciliation of the Company s consolidated income from continuing operations to Adjusted EBITDA below. Management believes that evaluating performance excluding such items is meaningful because it provides insight with respect to the intrinsic and ongoing operating results of the Company and captures the business performance inclusive of indirect costs. 
 Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider the measure in isolation or as a substitute for net income, cash flow from operations or other methods of analyzing WillScot s results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are: 
 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for our working capital needs; 
 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our indebtedness; 
 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our tax expense or the cash requirements to pay our taxes; 
 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect historical cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; 
 Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the impact on earnings or changes resulting from matters that we consider not to be indicative of our future operations; 
 Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; and 
 Other companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. 
 35 

Because of these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as discretionary cash available to reinvest in the growth of our business or as a measure of cash that will be available to meet our obligations. 
 The following table provides reconciliations of (Loss) income from continuing operations to Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations:

 Adjusted EBITDA Margin 
 We define Adjusted EBITDA Margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue. Management believes that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA Margin provides useful information to investors regarding the performance of our business. The following table provides reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA Margin: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, (in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations (A) 266,863 265,480 778,448 773,663 Revenue (B) 601,432 604,834 1,793,203 1,752,391 Adjusted EBITDA Margin from Continuing Operations (A/B) 44.4 43.9 43.4 44.1 Gross profit (C) 321,484 339,694 965,490 990,694 Gross Profit Margin (C/B) 53.5 56.2 53.8 56.5 
 Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Profit Percentage 
 We define Adjusted Gross Profit as gross profit plus depreciation of rental equipment. Adjusted Gross Profit Percentage is defined as Adjusted Gross Profit divided by revenue. Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Profit Percentage are not measurements of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to gross profit, gross profit percentage, or other performance measures derived in accordance with GAAP. In addition, our measurement of Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Profit Percentage may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Management believes that the presentation of Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Profit Percentage provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations and assists in analyzing the performance of our business.

 Net CAPEX 
 We define N et CAPEX as purchases of rental equipment and refurbishments and purchases of property, plant and equipment (collectively, "Total Capital Expenditures"), less proceeds from the sale of rental equipment and proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment (collectively, "Total Proceeds"), which are all included in cash flows from investing activities. Management believes that the presentation of Net CAPEX provides useful information regarding the net capital invested in our rental fleet and property, plant and equipment each year to assist in analyzing the performance of our business. As presented below, Net CAPEX includes amounts for the former UK Storage Solutions segment through January 31, 2023.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Overview 
 WillScot is a holding company that derives its operating cash flow from its operating subsidiaries. Our principal sources of liquidity include cash flows generated from operating activities of our subsidiaries, borrowings under our ABL Facility, and sales of debt securities. We have consistently accessed the debt capital markets both opportunistically and as necessary to support the growth of our business, desired leverage levels, and other capital allocation priorities. We believe we have ample liquidity in the ABL Facility and are generating substantial free cash flow, which together support both organic operations and other capital allocation priorities as they arise. We believe that our liquidity sources are sufficient to satisfy our anticipated operating, debt service and capital cash requirements over the next twelve months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. 
 We continue to review available acquisition opportunities with the awareness that any such acquisition may require us to incur additional debt to finance the acquisition and/or to issue shares of our Common Stock or other equity securities as acquisition consideration or as part of an overall financing plan. In addition, we will continue to evaluate alternatives to optimize our capital structure, which could include the issuance or repurchase of additional unsecured and secured debt, equity securities and/or equity-linked securities. There can be no assurance as to the timing of any such issuance or repurchase. If we obtain additional capital by issuing equity, the interests of our existing stockholders will be diluted. If we incur additional indebtedness, that indebtedness may contain significant financial and other covenants that may significantly restrict our operations. Availability of financing and the associated terms are inherently dependent on the debt and equity capital markets and subject to change. From time to time, we may also seek to streamline our capital structure and improve our financial position through refinancing or restructuring our existing debt or retiring certain of our securities for cash or other consideration. 
 37 

Our revolving credit facility provides an aggregate principal amount of up to 3.7 billion, consisting of: (i) a senior secured asset-based US dollar revolving credit facility in the aggregate principal amount of 3.3 billion (the US Facility and (ii) a 400.0 million senior secured asset-based multicurrency revolving credit facility (the "Multicurrency Facility," and together with the US Facility, the ABL Facility ). Borrowing availability under the ABL Facility is equal to the lesser of 3.7 billion an d the applicable borrowing bases. The borrowing bases are a function of, among other things, the value of the assets in the relevant collateral pool, of which our rental equipment represents the largest component. At September 30, 2024, we had 1.7 billion of available borrowing capacity under the ABL Facility. 
 Cash Flow Comparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 The consolidated statements of cash flows include amounts for the former UK Storage Solutions segment through January 31, 2023. See Note 3 to the financial statements for disclosure of significant investing items related to the former UK Storage Solutions segment. 
 The following summarizes our change in cash and cash equivalents for the periods presented: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, (in thousands) 
 2024 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 382,725 541,918 Net cash used in investing activities (268,668) (217,522) Net cash used in financing activities (113,234) (337,082) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 
 (735) 701 Net change in cash and cash equivalents 
 88 (11,985) 
 Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 382.7 million as compared to 541.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 159.2 million. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the payment of 212.5 million for the McGrath termination fee and transaction costs from terminated acquisitions during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 268.7 million as compared to 217.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a 51.1 million increase in net cash used in investing activities. The increase in net cash used in investing activities resulted from 404.0 million in proceeds from the sale of the former UK Storage Solutions in the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and a 40.9 million increase in refurbishment spending and new fleet purchases, including additional investment in climate-controlled containers and refrigerated storage units, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 The increase in net cash used in investing activities was partially offset by a 397.7 million decrease in cash used in acquisitions, net of cash acquired, a 5.9 million increase in proceeds from the sale of rental equipment and a 7.7 million decrease in cash used for the settlement of a contingent foreign currency forward contract upon the closing of the sale of the former UK Storage Solutions segment in January 2023. 
 Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 113.2 million as compared to 337.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 223.8 million. The decrease was primarily due to a 547.8 million decrease in cash used for the repurchase of common stock in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We paused share repurchases in the fourth quarter of 2023 as acquisition discussions advanced with McGrath and resumed repurchasing shares of our Common Stock in April 2024. 
 The decrease was partially offset by a 319.0 million increase in repayments of borrowings, net of receipts from borrowings. 
 Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow 
 Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow are non-GAAP measures. We define Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by operating activities, less purchases of, and proceeds from, rental equipment and refurbishments and property, plant and equipment, which are all included in cash flows from investing activities. We define Adjusted Free Cash Flow as Free Cash Flow excluding one-time, nonrecurring payments for the McGrath termination fee and transaction costs from terminated acquisitions. Management believes that the presentation of Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow provides useful additional information concerning cash flow available to fund our capital allocation alternatives. 
 38 

The following table provides a reconciliation of net cash (used in) provided by operating activities to Free Cash Flow. 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, (in thousands) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Net cash (used in) provided by operating activities (1,562) 190,998 382,725 541,918 Purchase of rental equipment and refurbishments (69,398) (63,388) (206,989) (166,097) Proceeds from sale of rental equipment 13,238 12,720 43,906 37,974 Purchase of property, plant and equipment (3,318) (5,563) (16,119) (16,752) Proceeds from sale of property, plant and equipment 918 13,001 1,133 13,266 Free Cash Flow (60,122) 147,768 204,656 410,309 Cash paid for termination fee 180,000 180,000 Cash paid for transaction costs from terminated acquisitions 
 23,266 32,451 Adjusted Free Cash Flow 143,144 147,768 417,107 410,309 
 Free Cash Flow for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 204.7 million as compared to 410.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a decrease of 205.7 million. Free Cash Flow decreased principally as a result of the 159.2 million decrease in cash provided by operating activities, a 40.9 million increase in cash used in the purchase of rental equipment and refurbishments, and a 12.1 million decrease in proceeds from the sale of property, plant, and equipment. The 159.2 million decrease in cash provided by operating activities was driven by 212.5 million of cash paid for the McGrath termination fee and transaction costs from terminated acquisitions. The 205.7 million decrease in Free Cash Flow was partially offset by a 5.9 million increase in proceeds from the sale of rental equipment. Adjusted Free Cash for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 417.1 million as compared to 410.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 6.8 million. 
 The 382.7 million in cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was returned to shareholders through repurchases and cancellations of common stock of 130.3 million and reinvested into the business to support the purchase of rental equipment, including VAPS, and refurbishments, acquire three local storage and modular companies and one national provider of premium large clearspan structures for 84.5 million, and fund repayment of borrowings under our ABL Facility. 
 Material cash requirements 
 The Company s material cash requirements include the following contractual and other obligations: 
 Debt 
 The Company has outstanding debt related to its ABL Facility, 2025 Secured Notes, 2028 Secured Notes, 2029 Secured Notes, 2031 Secured Notes, and finance leases totaling 3.6 billion as of September 30, 2024, 547.6 million of which is obligated to be repaid within the next twelve months. We have the intent and believe we have the ability to refinance the 526.5 million carrying value of the 2025 Secured Notes on a long-term basis as demonstrated by the forecasted available capacity under the ABL Facility, among other refinancing alternatives to be considered opportunistically. Refer to Note 9 for further information regarding outstanding debt. 
 Operating leases 
 The Company has commitments for future minimum rental payments relating to operating leases, which are primarily for real estate. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had lease obligations of 300.8 million, with 71.5 million payable within the next twelve months. 
 Other 
 In addition to the cash requirements described above, the Company has a share repurchase program authorized by the Board of Directors, which allows the Company to repurchase up to 1.0 billion of outstanding shares of Common Stock. This program does not obligate the Company to repurchase any specific amount of shares. As of September 30, 2024, 951.9 million of the approved share repurchase amount remained available. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources is based on our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. GAAP requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we consider reasonable under the circumstances and reevaluate our estimates and judgments as appropriate. The actual results experienced by us may differ materially and adversely from our estimates. For a complete 
 39 

discussion of our significant critical accounting estimates, see the Critical Accounting Estimates section in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the "2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K"). 
 There were no significant changes to our critical accounting estimates during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 We are exposed to certain market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Changes in these factors cause fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows. We evaluate and manage exposure to these market risks as follows: 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We are primarily exposed to interest rate risk through our ABL Facility, which bears interest at variable rates. We had 1.5 billion in outstanding principal under the ABL Facility at September 30, 2024. To manage interest rate risk, in January 2024 and January 2023, respectively, we executed interest rate swap agreements relating to an aggregate of 500.0 million and 750.0 million in notional amount of variable-rate debt under our ABL Facility. The January 2024 and January 2023 swap agreements provide for us to pay a weighted average effective fixed interest rate of 3.70 and 3.44 per annum, respectively, and receive a variable interest rate equal to one-month term SOFR, with maturity dates of June 30, 2027. After taking into account the impact of the swaps, an increase in interest rates by 100 basis points on our ABL Facility would have increased quarter to date interest expense by approximately 0.7 million based on current outstanding borrowings. 
 Foreign Currency Risk 
 We currently generate approximately 94 of our consolidated net revenues in the US, and the reporting currency for our consolidated financial statements is the US dollar. However, we are exposed to currency risk through our operations in Canada and Mexico. For the operations outside the US, we bill customers primarily in their local currency, which is subject to foreign currency rate changes. As our net revenues and expenses generated outside of the US increase, our results of operations could be adversely impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Since we recognize foreign revenues in local foreign currencies, if the US dollar strengthens, it could have a negative impact on our foreign revenues upon translation of those results into the US dollar for consolidation into our financial statements. 
 In addition, we are exposed to gains and losses resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on transactions generated by our foreign subsidiaries in currencies other than their local currencies. These gains and losses are primarily driven by intercompany transactions and rental equipment purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the purchasing entity. These exposures are included in currency (gains) losses, net, on the consolidated statements of operations. 
 
 41 

ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended (the "Exchange Act") as of September 30, 2024. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 Changes in Internal Controls 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II 

ITEM 1. Legal Proceedings 
 The Company is involved in various lawsuits, claims and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. The Company assesses these matters on a case-by-case basis as they arise and establishes reserves as required. As of September 30, 2024, with respect to these outstanding matters, the Company believes that the amount or range of reasonably possible loss will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows of the Company. However, the outcome of such matters is inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. 

ITEM 1A. Risk Factors 
 The Company s financial position, results of operations and cash flows are subject to various risks, many of which are not exclusively within the Company s control, which may cause actual performance to differ materially from historical or projected future performance. In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the risk factors discussed in Item 1A. of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, which have not materially changed, except for risks associated with the completion of the McGrath acquisition, which are no longer applicable because the Company and McGrath mutually agreed to terminate the Merger Agreement .

 A share repurchase program authorizes the Company to repurchase its outstanding shares of Common Stock. In September 2024, the Board of Directors approved a reset of the share repurchase program authorizing the Company to repurchase up to 1.0 billion of its outstanding shares of Common Stock. As of September 30, 2024, 951.9 million of the 1.0 billion share repurchase authorization remained available for use. 

ITEM 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities 
 None. 

ITEM 4. Mine Safety Disclosures 
 Not applicable. 

ITEM 5. Other Information 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, no director or Section 16 officer of the Company or a "Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement" or "non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement," as each term is defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K. 
 The Company s proxy statement for its 2024 annual meeting of stockholders inadvertently provided incorrect dates for the submission of director nominations pursuant to the advance notice provision of the Company s Amended and Restated Bylaws. The proxy statement should have stated that director nominations submitted pursuant to the advance notice provision must be received at the office of the Corporate Secretary no earlier than February 7, 2025, and no later than March 9, 2025. Notice of a nomination must also comply with requirements set forth in the Bylaws.
