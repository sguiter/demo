 The forward-looking statements contained herein are based on our current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effects on our business. There can be no assurance that future developments affecting our business will be those that we have anticipated. These forward-looking statements involve a number of risks, uncertainties (some of which are beyond our control) or other assumptions that may cause actual results or performance to be materially different from those expressed or implied by these forward- looking statements.

Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time 
 3 

and it is not possible for us to predict all such risk factors, nor can we assess the effect of all such risk factors on our business or the extent to which any factor or combination of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should any of the assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary in material respects from those projected in these forward-looking statements.

 NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

 Liquidity and Going Concern 
 
 The CEA business is highly capital-intensive. Since its inception, the Company has incurred losses and generated negative cash flows from operations. At September 30, 2024, the Company had an accumulated deficit of million and cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash of million. Currently, the Company s primary sources of liquidity and capital resources are cash on hand, cash flows generated from the sale of products, and the credit facilities with Cargill Financial. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the Company's outstanding debt principal totaled million. On April 1, 2025, the Company is required to begin making quarterly principal payments under the Senior Facility (defined below) and quarterly interest payments under both the Senior Facility and the Subordinated Facility (defined below). 
 The Company s current operating plan indicates that it will continue to incur losses from operations and generate negative cash flows from operating activities until the Texas and Washington facilities start operating at full commercial scale and generate sufficient gross profit to cover its losses. The Company's cash on hand as of September 30, 2024, and projected cash inflows generated from operations over the next 12 months are not expected to be sufficient to fund anticipated cash outflows for operations and the required debt service obligations beginning April 1, 2025. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern for the next twelve months. 
 The Company s Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of September 30, 2024, do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty and have been prepared to assume the Company will continue as a going concern . 
 The Company s plan to alleviate the conditions that raised substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern includes the following: 
 
 Renegotiate the terms of the credit facilities with Cargill Financial to provide the Company with additional working capital over the next twelve months, subject to terms and conditions precedent to the Senior Facility. 
 10 

million loss on assets disposed of other than by sale, primarily related to construction-in-progress assets related to certain growing technology and equipment that will not be utilized in the Company's current facilities or in future construction projects, following the Company s realignment of its facility in Hamilton, Montana (the "Montana Facility") away from a research and development focus and an assessment of recent growing process advancements and alignment of the Company's technology across its facilities. Loss on disposals are included in "Selling, general and administrative" on the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.

 Agreements with Cargill Financial 
 
 On September 3, 2021, Local Bounti Operating Company LLC and certain subsidiaries entered into (a) a credit agreement (the "Senior Credit Agreement") with Cargill Financial for an up to million multiple-advance term loan (the "Senior Facility") and (b) a subordinated credit agreement (the "Subordinated Credit Agreement" and, together with the Senior Credit Agreement, the "Original Credit Agreements") with Cargill Financial for an up to million multiple-advance term loan (the "Subordinated Facility" and, together with the Senior Facility, the "Facilities"). 
 
 As previously disclosed in the Company's Annual Financial Statements, Local Bounti Operating Company LLC and certain subsidiaries and Cargill Financial entered into a series of amendments: the First Amendment, the Second Amendment, the Third Amendment, the Fourth Amendment, the Fifth Amendment, the Sixth Amendment, and the Seventh Amendment to the Original Credit Agreements. 
 
 In the first half of 2024, Local Bounti Operating Company LLC, the Company, and certain subsidiaries and Cargill Financial entered into the Eighth Amendment, the Ninth Amendment, and the Tenth Amendment to the Original Credit Agreements (as so amended, collectively referred to as the "Amended Credit Agreements"), as further described below. 
 Eighth Amendment to Credit Agreements 
 
 On January 23, 2024, the Company, along with certain subsidiaries of the Company, entered into an Eighth Amendment to the Original Credit Agreements (the "Eighth Amendment") with Cargill Financial to further amend the Original Credit Agreements. The Eighth Amendment allows for the payment in kind of the quarterly interest payments due and payable for the quarter ending March 31, 2024. 
 
 Ninth Amendment to Credit Agreements 
 
 On March 26, 2024, the Company, along with certain of its subsidiaries, entered into a Ninth Amendment to the Original Credit Agreements (the "Ninth Amendment") with Cargill Financial to further amend the Original Credit 
 13 

million in working capital for the Company, million of which has been drawn down. 
 
 Tenth Amendment to Credit Agreements 
 
 On June 28, 2024, the Company, along with certain of its subsidiaries, entered into a Tenth Amendment to the Original Credit Agreements (the "Tenth Amendment") with Cargill Financial to further amend the Original Credit Agreements. The Tenth Amendment adds a new maximum cash operating expense to revenue ratio covenant, to be tested beginning with the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2024. 
 
 General provisions to the Amended Credit Agreements 
 
 The interest rate on the Subordinated Facility is per annum. The interest rate on the Senior Facility is equal to SOFR plus a margin (which varies between to depending on the Senior Facility net leverage ratio) per annum, with accrued interest paid quarterly in arrears on the first business day of the subsequent quarter through the maturity date on September 3, 2028. Principal payments are due and payable quarterly under the Senior Facility, beginning April 1, 2025, based on the principal balance as of December 31, 2023 and assuming a fixed straight line amortization schedule. The remaining unpaid principal balance under both the Senior Facility and the Subordinated Facility is due on the September 3, 2028 maturity date. 
 
 In accordance with the Original Credit Agreements, the Company is required to have a debt service reserve account which is shown as restricted cash on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Fifth Amendment and Sixth Amendment, taken together, reduced the minimum balance to maintain in the debt service reserve account to through March 31, 2025. From and after April 1, 2025, the minimum balance to maintain in the debt service reserve account will be increased to quarters of scheduled interest payments and quarters of scheduled principal payments.

Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, including the Notes to those statements, included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and the section entitled "Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. As discussed in more detail in the section entitled "Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements," this discussion contains forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. 
 
 Our Mission and Vision 
 Our mission is to revolutionize agriculture, ensuring accessibility to fresh, sustainable, locally grown produce to nourish communities everywhere for generations to come. Our vision is to reimagine freshness. We envision a future where transformative innovation and technology combine to enable us to locally grow produce with minimal food miles, ensuring the freshest and most sustainable offerings for communities everywhere. We believe that happy plants make happy taste buds, and we are committed to reimagining the standards of freshness. We also believe that local is the best kind of business, and we are committed to helping communities thrive for generations to come. We are committed to building empowered local teams. Together, we are capable of extraordinary achievements in sustainable agriculture. 
 Company Overview 
 Local Bounti is a controlled environment agriculture ("CEA") company that produces sustainably grown produce, focused primarily on living and loose leaf lettuce, arugula, spinach, and basil. Founded in 2018, and headquartered in Hamilton, Montana, Local Bounti utilizes its patented Stack Flow Technology to grow healthy food sustainably and affordably. Our proprietary process is a hybrid growing approach, utilizing vertical farming in early plant growth, followed by greenhouse farming for final grow out. We designed our Stack Flow Technology to give our products exactly what they need at every step of their growth cycle. Our goal is to grow in an environmentally sustainable manner that not only increases harvest efficiency and enhances unit economics, but also limits water usage and reduces the carbon footprint of the production and distribution process. Controlling the environmental conditions in both the 'Stack' and 'Flow' components of our growing system helps to ensure healthy, nutritious, and consistent products that are non-genetically modified organisms ("non-GMO"). We use 90 less water, 90 less land, and significantly less pesticides and herbicides than traditional outdoor agriculture operations. 
 
 Our first facility in Hamilton, Montana (the "Montana Facility") commenced construction in 2019 and reached commercial operation by the second half of 2020. In 2022, we acquired California-based complementary greenhouse farming company Hollandia Produce Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries, which operated under the name Pete's. Through the Pete's Acquisition, we significantly increased our growing footprint to include two then-existing facilities in California and one under-construction facility in Georgia. The Georgia facility initially became operational in July 2022 and was significantly expanded in 2023. In 2024, we completed construction on two new facilities in Washington and Texas, bringing our total facility count to six. 
 
 We distribute our products to approximately 13,000 retail locations across 35 U.S. states, primarily through direct relationships with blue-chip retail customers, including Albertsons, Sam's Club, Kroger, Target, Walmart, Whole Foods, Brookshire's, H-E-B, and AmazonFresh. Our primary products include living butter lettuce for which we are a leading provider with an approximate 80 share of the CEA market within the Western U.S. as well as packaged leafy greens and cress. We recently introduced new Grab Go Salad Kits and additions to our baby leaf portfolio with several high-velocity offerings, including spinach, arugula, and basil. In addition, we introduced 50/50 blend and power greens in the third quarter of 2024. We signed an offtake agreement with Sam's Club in October 2022 for our leafy greens production initially from our Georgia facility and now including both our Georgia and Texas facilities. The offtake agreement provides for the sale of defined minimum quantities of leafy greens from our Georgia and Texas facilities and runs through September 2028. 
 
 We intend to continue to increase our production capacity and expand our reach to new markets, new geographies, and new customers through the building of new facilities, the expansion of existing facilities, or the acquisition of existing greenhouse facilities, which we would evaluate to update with our Stack Flow Technology . We conduct an ongoing build-versus-buy analysis whenever we decide to build a new facility or acquire an existing facility. We also continue to explore expanding our product offerings to new varieties of fresh greens, herbs, berries, and other produce. Additionally, we evaluate commercial opportunities as part of these expansion efforts on an ongoing basis.

Commercial Facility Update 
 
 Hamilton, Montana Facility Transition to Commercial Production Now Complete 
 
 We completed the transition of our Montana facility from a research and development focus to a commercially oriented focus growing produce for sale to customers in the third quarter of 2024. This transition follows the capacity enhancements brought about by the completion of the Georgia facility and the commencement of operations at both the Texas and Washington facilities and is expected to help drive toward our goal of achieving positive adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter of 2025. 
 
 Capacity Expansion Project Update 
 
 Plans remain in place to build additional capacity across our network of facilities enabled with our Stack Flow Technology . The planned expansions are designed to provide additional capacity and allow for our growing product assortment to meet existing demand from our direct relationships with blue-chip retailers and distributors. The timing and scope of these projects, which include plans to expand into the Midwest, remain under review pending ongoing discussions with retailers to optimize those facilities for specific products in support of retail commitments and strategies to expand distribution. 
 
 Product Development Distribution 
 
 We expanded our product assortment in the third quarter of 2024 by introducing several high-velocity offerings, including Arugula, Spinach, Spring Mix Spinach Blend, Power Crisp, and Basil. We began shipping our entire assortment to customers during the third quarter and added additional distribution with retailers in the mass and grocery channels in the fourth quarter. 
 
 We continued our rollout of Grab-and-Go Salad Kits to customers throughout the Pacific Northwest and Southern United States. The Grab-and-Go assortment includes four unique flavor offerings: Artisanal Chicken Caesar, Memphis Inspired Chicken, Sweet Poppy Power, and Modern Greek Style. 
 
 Factors Affecting Our Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 We have expended, and we expect to continue to expend substantial resources as we: 
 
 complete construction and commissioning of new and expanded facilities; 
 
 standardize operating and manufacturing processes across our facilities including increased expenses associated with growing operations; 
 
 identify and invest in future growth opportunities, including new product lines; 
 
 invest in product innovation and development; 
 
 invest in sales and marketing efforts to increase brand awareness, engage customers and drive sales of our products; and 
 
 incur additional general administration expenses

 The following sections discuss and analyze the changes in the significant line items in our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the comparative periods in the table above. 
 
 Sales 
 
 We derive our revenue from the sale of produce grown at our six facilities. 
 
 Sales increased by 3.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was due to increased production and growth in sales from our facility in Georgia and sales from our new facilities in Texas and Washington, which began shipping and sell products in the second quarter of 2024 . 
 
 Sales increased by 7.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was due to increased production and growth in sales from our facility in Georgia and, to a lesser extent, sales from our new facilities in Texas and Washington, which began shipping and sell products in the second quarter of 2024 . 
 
 Cost of Goods Sold 
 
 Cost of goods sold is the direct cost of growing produce for sale at our greenhouse facilities, including labor costs, which consists of wages, salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation, seeds, soil, nutrients and other input supplies, packaging materials, depreciation, utilities and other manufacturing overhead. We expect that, over time, cost of goods sold will decrease as a percentage of sales, as a result of scaling our business. 
 
 Cost of goods sold increased by 2.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, due primarily to production ramp-up at our new Texas and Washington facilities and increased production at our Georgia facilities. 
 
 Cost of goods sold increased by 5.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, due primarily to production ramp-up at our new Texas and Washington facilities and increased production at our Georgia facilities. 
 
 Research and Development 
 
 Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs related to the continued development of our production, harvesting, and post-harvest packaging methods, techniques, and processes, as well as production surplus costs related to the development and testing of our production processes during the post-commissioning phase at our new facilities. Our research and development efforts are focused on the development of environmental controls and Stack and Flow processes to increase production yields and to develop new leafy green SKUs, value-added products such as grab-and-go salads, and new crops, including spinach, arugula, basil, and berries. Research and development is performed at the Montana, Texas, Washington, California, and Georgia facilities, where we continue to develop our commercial scale Stack Flow Technology and processes for implementation throughout our facility footprint. 
 
 21 

Research and development costs increased by 2.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 and increased by 3.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase for both the quarter to date and year to date period is related primarily to the additional development of our production, harvesting, and post-harvest packaging techniques and processes, including production surplus costs, related to the development and testing of our commercial scale Stack Flow Technology and production processes at the Washington, and Texas facilities. 
 
 Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses 
 
 Selling, general, and administrative expenses consist of employee compensation, including salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation for our executive, legal, finance, information technology, human resources and sales and marketing teams, expenses for third-party professional services, insurance, marketing, advertising, computer hardware and software, and amortization of intangible assets, among others. We expect selling, general, and administrative expenses to continue decreasing for the remainder of 2024 due primarily to realized employee related cost savings of approximately 5.0 million on an annualized basis as a result of our actions to streamline our organizational structure in late 2023 and early 2024 . 
 
 Selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased by 2.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, related to a 1.6 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense, a 0.5 million decrease in salaries, benefits, and payroll related fees, a 0.3 million decrease in legal, accounting, and professional consulting fees, and a 0.1 million decrease in marketing and advertising costs, which was partially offset by an increase of 0.4 million on loss on disposal of fixed assets. 
 
 Selling, general, and administrative expenses decreased by 16.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily related to a 10.1 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense that was a result of prior year awards that were issued at a higher fair value, as compared to the fair value of awards being expensed in the current period, that fully vested and expensed in prior periods. Additional decreases as compared to the prior year period were a 2.9 million decrease in legal, accounting, and professional consulting fees, a 2.2 million decrease in salaries, benefits, and payroll related fees, a 0.5 million decrease in transaction costs, and a 0.5 million decrease in marketing and advertising costs, which was partially offset by an increase of 0.4 million on loss on disposal of fixed assets. 
 
 Change in Fair Value of Warrant Liability 
 
 The change in fair value of warrant liability includes the mark-to-market adjustments to the warrant liability to reflect its fair value as of the end of the reporting period. The decrease in the fair value of warrant liability for the three months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily due to the decrease in our closing stock price at September 30, 2024 compared to the closing stock price on the prior measurement date of June 30, 2024. The increase in fair value of the warrant liability for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily due to a net increase in our closing stock price at September 30, 2024 compared to the closing stock price on the prior measurement date of December 31, 2023. The period-end close stock price is a key input to the Black-Scholes model we use to measure and estimate the fair value of the warrant at the end of each reporting period. 
 
 Interest Expense, net 
 
 Interest expense consists primarily of contractual interest and amortization of debt issuance costs, net of interest capitalized for construction assets, related to the loans from Cargill Financial and also interest recognized per the terms of our financing obligations related to our Montana Facility and our Carpinteria Facility and Oxnard Facility (collectively, the California Facilities ). We capitalize interest costs on borrowings during the construction period of major construction projects as part of the cost of the constructed assets. 
 
 Interest expense, net increased by 11.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is primarily due to a significant increase in the principal amount outstanding on the Senior Facility which increased interest expense by 10.9 million over the prior year period. Also contributing to the net increase was 0.3 million of incremental interest expense for the financing obligations related to the California Facilities. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we capitalized 0.4 million and 4.2 million of interest, respectively. 
 
 22 

Interest expense, net increased by 22.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is primarily due to a significant increase in the principal amount outstanding on the Senior Facility which increased interest expense by 21.0 million over the prior year period. Also contributing to the net increase was 1.5 million of incremental interest expense for the financing obligations related to the California Facilities. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we capitalized 10.5 million and 9.5 million of interest, respectively. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 The CEA business is highly capital-intensive. Since our inception, we have incurred losses and generated negative cash flows from operations. At September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 387.0 million and, cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash of 6.8 million . Currently, our primary sources of liquidity and capital resources are cash on hand, cash flows generated from the sale of our p roducts, and the credit facilities with Cargill Financial. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, our outstanding debt principal totaled 431.7 million, and on April 1, 2025, we are required to begin making quarterly principal payments under the Senior Facility and quarterly interest payments under both the Senior Facility and the Subordinated Facility. Also, the credit facilities contain various financial and non-financial covenants and certain restrictions on our business, which include restrictions on additional indebtedness, minimum liquidity, and other financial covenants, and material adverse effects that could cause us to be at risk of default. 
 
 During the quarter ended September 30, 2024, we failed to comply with the following financial covenants: minimum liquidity, minimum production, maximum cash operating expense ratio, and certain capital expenditure limitations. We obtained waivers for these covenant violations and, therefore, are in compliance with the credit facilities covenants as of September 30, 2024. While we obtained permanent waivers for all past covenant violations, there can be no assurances that we will be able to obtain waivers for any future covenant compliance violations. A failure to comply with the covenants and other provisions of these debt instruments, including any failure to make payments when required, would generally result in events of default under such instruments, which could result in the acceleration of a substantial portion of such indebtedness. 
 
 Our current operating plan indicates that we will continue to incur losses from operations and generate negative cash flows from operating activities until the Texas and Washington facilities start operating at full commercial scale and generate sufficient gross profit to cover our losses. Our cash on hand as of September 30, 2024, and projected cash inflows generated from operations over the next 12 months are expected to be insufficient to fund anticipated cash outflows for operations and the required debt service obligations beginning April 1, 2025. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for the next twelve months. 
 
 Our plan to alleviate the conditions that raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern includes the following: 
 
 Renegotiate the terms of the credit facilities with Cargill Financial to provide additional working capital over the next twelve months, subject to terms and conditions precedent to the Senior Facility. 
 Renegotiate the terms of the credit facilities with Cargill Financial to defer all principal payments due under the Senior Facility through November 30, 2025, subject to terms and conditions precedent to the Senior Facility. 
 Renegotiate the terms of the credit facilities with Cargill Financial to allow for the payment in kind of the interest payments on the Senior Facility and the Subordinated Facility through November 30, 2025, subject to terms and conditions precedent to the Senior Facility. 
 Renegotiate the terms of the credit facilities with Cargill Financial to waive the restricted cash requirement of two quarters of future interest and principal payments through November 30, 2025, subject to terms and conditions precedent to the Senior Facility. 
 Continue to ramp production at the Company s Washington and Texas facilities to full commercial scale to accelerate and significantly increase revenue growth. 
 Reduce production costs as a result of manufacturing and technical developments. 
 Lower research and development and general and administrative costs. 
 Reduce or delay uncommitted capital expenditures, including nonessential facilities and information technology projects. 
 Raise additional working capital through other sources of debt and equity financings. 
 
 While we fully expect to implement and execute our plans and to have access to these additional sources of capital, such plans or other additional sources of financing may not be achievable on favorable terms and conditions, or at all, and these conditions and events in the aggregate do not alleviate substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern over the next twelve months from the date these Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are issued. 
 23 

This substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern may adversely affect our stock price and our ability to raise capital, and failure to obtain this necessary capital on acceptable terms, or at all, may force us to delay, limit, reduce, or terminate our operations and future growth. We will need to raise additional working capital funds to operate our business and fund continued construction, commissioning, and operating at commercial scale with sufficient gross profit, which is expected to extend beyond the next twelve months from the date these Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are issued. If additional financing is available, financing terms may lead to significant dilution of our stockholders equity. 
 
 Cargill Loans 
 
 In September 2021, the Company and Cargill Financial entered into the Senior Facility and the Subordinated Facility. Subsequent to the amendments described in Note 6 , Debt , of the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, Cargill Financial may in its sole discretion provide advances under the Facilities of up to 343.5 million (plus paid-in-kind interest and fees), including working capital advances and capital to fund the remaining construction costs at our facilities in Georgia, Texas, and Washington, subject to certain conditions. The credit facilities, as amended, require quarterly principal and interest payments beginning April 1, 2025, which is reflected in the table below, and the funding of a debt service reserve on April 1, 2025 equal to two quarters of principal and interest payments. The Senior Facility and the Subordinated Facility are included in "Short-term debt" and "Long-term debt" on the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, our principal and estimated interest payment obligations for the Senior Facility and the Subordinated Facility are as follows (1) : 
 
 (in thousands) Remainder of 2024 2025 65,361 2026 87,148 2027 87,148 2028 433,143 Total 672,800 
 _____________________ 
 
 (1) Interest is calculated based on a 12.5 interest rate for the Subordinated Facility and a 13.10 interest rate for the Senior Facility effective as of October 1, 2024. 
 
 Financing Obligations 
 
 We have two financing obligations related to sale leaseback transactions that did not qualify for sales treatment of the underlying assets. In June 2020, the Company completed the construction of the Montana Facility. Subsequent to its completion, the Company entered into a sale leaseback transaction of the Montana Facility with Grow Bitterroot, LLC, a related party, for total consideration of 6.9 million with a current lease term of 20 years. On April 27, 2023, Hollandia Real Estate, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and STORE Master Funding XXXI, LLC consummated a 35 million multi-site sale and leaseback transaction with an initial term of 25 years relating to our California Facilities. 
 
 The following table summarizes future aggregate financing obligation payments by fiscal year for both the California Facilities and the Montana Facility: 
 Financing Obligation (in thousands) Remainder of 2024 1,237 2025 5,024 2026 5,158 2027 5,297 2028 5,439 Thereafter 121,532 Total financing obligation payments 143,687

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Limitations on effectiveness of control and procedures 
 
 In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.

 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 
 Except as set forth below, there have been no material updates to our risk factors included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Risks Related to Local Bounti's Business 
 
 There is substantial doubt regarding Local Bounti s ability to continue as a going concern. Local Bounti will require additional financing to continue as a going concern, and a failure to obtain this necessary capital on acceptable terms, or at all, may force Local Bounti to delay, limit, reduce or terminate its operations and future growth. If additional financing is available, financing terms may lead to significant dilution of our stockholders equity. 
 
 The CEA business is highly capital-intensive. Local Bounti has incurred losses and generated negative cash flows from operations since its inception. At September 30, 2024, Local Bounti had an accumulated deficit of 387.0 million and cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash of 6.8 million. Currently, our primary sources of liquidity and capital resources are cash on hand, cash flows generated from the sale of our products, and the Facilities with Cargill Financial. 
 
 Local Bounti s current operating plan indicates that it will continue to incur losses from operations and generate negative cash flows from operating activities until the Texas and Washington facilities start operating at full commercial scale and begin generating sufficient positive gross profit to cover its losses. These conditions raise substantial doubt about Local Bounti s ability to continue as a going concern through the next twelve months. This substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern may adversely affect our stock price and our ability to raise capital. 
 
 Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to obtain the necessary financing to meet our obligations and repay our liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due, and to generate profitable operations in the future. We plan to provide for our capital requirements through amounts available under our credit facilities with Cargill Financial, our current cash position, cash generated from product sales, anticipated additional deferrals of future cash interest and principal payments under the Company's credit facilities with Cargill Financial, and additional working capital through other sources of debt and equity financings. There can be no assurance that we will be able to raise additional capital to fund operations with terms acceptable to us, or at all, and failure to obtain this necessary capital may force Local Bounti to delay, limit, reduce or terminate its operations and future growth. 
 
 Such financings may result in dilution to stockholders, issuance of securities with priority as to liquidation and dividend and other rights more favorable than common stock, imposition of debt covenants and repayment obligations, or other restrictions that may adversely affect Local Bounti s business. 
 
 Risks Related to Local Bounti's Term Loan Facility 
 
 Local Bounti has entered into agreements with Cargill Financial for term loan credit facilities. The credit facilities are secured by all of the Company's and its subsidiaries' assets, including their intellectual property. If we are unable to meet certain conditions precedent, we may not be able to draw down funds available under the facilities, which could materially and adversely affect our business and operations. Additionally, if there is an occurrence of an uncured event of default, Cargill Financial has the right to foreclose on all of the Company's and its subsidiaries' assets, and securities in the Company could be rendered worthless. 
 
 Local Bounti's credit facilities with Cargill Financial are secured by all of the Company's and its subsidiaries' assets, including their intellectual property. Additionally, the definitive documentation for the credit facilities states that if Local Bounti defaults on its obligations, Cargill Financial could foreclose on all Local Bounti assets, which would materially harm Local Bounti's business, financial condition and results of operations. The credit facilities with Cargill Financial contain various financial and non-financial covenants and certain restrictions on our business, which include restrictions on additional indebtedness, minimum liquidity and other financial covenants, and material adverse effects, that could cause us to be at risk of default. We are currently in compliance with the financial covenants under the credit facilities, but in the past, we have periodically failed to meet certain quarterly financial covenants. While we 
 27 

were able to obtain permanent waivers for all past covenant violations, there can be no assurances that we will be able to obtain waivers for any future covenant compliance violations. A failure to comply with the covenants and other provisions of these debt instruments, including any failure to make payments when required, would generally result in events of default under such instruments, which could result in the acceleration of a substantial portion of such indebtedness. 
 
 The pledge of our assets and other restrictions may also limit Local Bounti's flexibility in raising capital for other purposes. Because all of Local Bounti's assets are pledged under the credit facility, Local Bounti's ability to incur additional secured indebtedness or to sell or dispose of assets to raise capital may be impaired, which could have an adverse effect on Local Bounti's financial flexibility. Further, there are numerous conditions precedent to drawing down amounts available under the credit facility, including that amounts remaining to be drawn are at Cargill Financial's discretion. If we are unable to meet these conditions precedent, we may not be able to draw down funds available under the facilities, which could materially and adversely affect our business and operations. Refer to Note 6, Debt , of the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about the credit facility. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 
 There were no unregistered sales of our equity securities during the period covered by this quarterly report which were not previously reported in a Current Report on Form 8-K.
