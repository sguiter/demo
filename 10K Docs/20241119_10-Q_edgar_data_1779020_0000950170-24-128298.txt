 FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 Certain statements contained herein, as well as in other filings we make with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission SEC and other written and oral information we release, regarding our future performance constitute "forward-looking statements" as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements may relate to, among other things, the impact on our business, operations and financial results of the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East (each of which, among other things, may affect many of the items listed below); our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity by realizing near-term revenue growth and related cash returns and preserving cash until such cash returns, if any are obtained; the demand for our products and services; revenue growth; effects of competition; supply chain and technology initiatives; inventory and in-stock positions; state of the economy; state of the credit markets, including mortgages, home equity loans, and consumer credit; access to available capital to meet our operating requirements and to service our debt instruments; the effect on our borrowing facilities of an event of default, including if an Annual Report on Form 10-K contains a Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm that includes disclosure regarding going concern; impact of tariffs; demand for credit offerings; management of relationships with our employees, suppliers and vendors, and customers; international trade disputes, natural disasters, public health issues (including pandemics and related quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, and similar restrictions), and other business interruptions that could disrupt supply or delivery of, or demand for, our products or services; continuation of equity programs; net earnings performance; earnings per share; capital allocation and expenditures; liquidity; return on invested capital; expense leverage; stock-based compensation expense; commodity price inflation and deflation; the ability to issue debt on terms and at rates acceptable to us; the impact and expected outcome of investigations, inquiries, claims, and litigation; the effect of accounting charges; the effect of adopting certain accounting standards; the impact of regulatory changes; financial outlook; our ability to maintain our exchange listing; and the integration of acquired companies into our organization and the ability to recognize the anticipated synergies and benefits of those acquisitions. 
 Forward-looking statements are based on currently available information and our current assumptions, expectations and projections about future events. You should not rely on our forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to future events, risks and uncertainties many of which are beyond our control, dependent on the actions of third parties, or currently unknown to us as well as potentially inaccurate assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projections. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those described in Part II, Item 1A, Risk Factors and elsewhere in this report and as also may be described from time to time in future reports we file with the SEC. You should read such information in conjunction with our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes and Part I, Item 2, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this report. There also may be other factors that we cannot anticipate or that are not described in this report, generally because we do not currently perceive them to be material. Such factors could cause results to differ materially from our expectations. 
 Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we do not undertake to update these statements other than as required by law. You are advised, however, to review any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our periodic filings with the SEC.

 difference between net loss and comprehensive loss and we have not presented a separate Statement of Comprehensive Income (Loss) that would otherwise be required. There were no significant changes to our critical accounting estimates or our significant accounting policies as disclosed in our 2023 Form 10-K. Strategic Reorganization and Other Charges During the three months ended June 30, 2024, we announced the pending retirement of our Chief Executive Officer. This has resulted in approximately million and million in expense related to the associated transition and retirement agreement for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Additionally, we launched a reduction in force and curtailed certain non-core product development activities and recorded million and million in strategic reorganization and other related charges, primarily related to severance costs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. In July 2024, we temporarily suspended our Danimer Catalytic Technologies business, including additional reduction in force, to further capital conservation. There were no asset impairments associated with this suspension, but we do expect to record additional strategic reorganization and other related charges in the quarter ending December 31, 2024 that will reduce the immediate cost savings realized. Risk, Uncertainties and Going Concern We have prepared the financial statements on a going concern basis, which assumes that we will continue our operations for the foreseeable future and be able to realize our assets and discharge our liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. However, we believe that, with our history of negative cash flows and our current lack of financial resources, substantial doubt exists regarding our ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year after the date of filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The financial statements do not reflect any adjustments that would be necessary if we became unable to continue as a going concern. Historically, we have funded working capital, capital expenditures, and our day-to-day operations through issuance of equity (see Note 10) and debt financings (see Note 9). We do not have a history of generating cash flow from operations.

We do not have expected in-service dates for our Greenfield Facility, since we have paused major construction. We will need to obtain additional financing to complete our Greenfield Facility. In 2022, the engineering cost estimate ranged from million to million, which does not consider any effect of subsequent inflation, and if we do not obtain financing, our investment could be impaired.

percent. We reported an income tax expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 of million and million , respectively, which resulted in effective income tax rates of -1.18 and -0.27 , respectively. Our effective tax rates differed from the federal statutory rate of due to our valuation allowances against substantially all of our net deferred income tax assets. In assessing the realizability of deferred income tax assets, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods at which time those temporary differences become deductible. In making valuation allowance determinations, we consider all available evidence, positive and negative, affecting specific deferred income tax assets, including the scheduled reversal of deferred income tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, the length of carry-back and carry-forward periods, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. At September 30, 2024, we maintained a full valuation allowance against our net deferred income tax assets due to the uncertainty surrounding realization of such assets.

We plan to retire any Convertible Notes surrendered to pay the exercise price for Dividend Warrants.

3.25 Convertible Senior Notes On December 21, 2021, we issued million principal amount of our Convertible Senior Notes due Convertible Notes ), subject to an indenture Indenture ). The Convertible Notes are our senior, unsecured obligations and accrue interest at a rate of per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning on June 15, 2022. We will settle conversions by paying or delivering, as applicable, cash, shares of common stock or a combination of cash and shares, at our election. The initial conversion rate, which is subject to change, is approximately per share of common stock. If certain liquidity conditions are met, we may redeem the Convertible Notes between December 19, 2024 and October 20, 2026. The Convertible Notes mature on December 15, 2026. The Indenture requires us to offer to repurchase the Convertible Notes upon the occurrence of certain Fundamental Change events, including specified change of control transactions and any delisting of our Common Stock. In addition, upon the occurrence of certain events, including the acceleration of the Senior Secured Term Loan, the holders of of the Convertible Notes may accelerate the principal balance of the Convertible Notes. If such acceleration occurs, it would cause an event of default under the Senior Secured Term Loan and the Revolving Credit Agreement, which could result in the principal and interest on our Senior Secured Term Loan and Revolving Credit Agreement becoming immediately due and payable. On July 12, 2024, we completed the distribution of Dividend Warrants as described in Note 8. In addition to Dividend Warrants being exercisable for cash, beginning on July 26, 2024 and subject to the terms and conditions of the warrant agreement governing the Dividend Warrants, holders of Dividend Warrants could also exercise their Dividend Warrants with Convertible Notes at face value, meaning that one Convertible Note having a principal amount of may be surrendered as consideration to exercise Dividend Warrants. Convertible Notes surrendered to pay the exercise price for Dividend Warrants will be retired. As of September 30, 2024, we have retired million of previously outstanding convertible notes resulting in a gain on extinguishment of million. Capped Calls Also in December 2021, in connection with the Convertible Notes, we purchased call options Capped Calls from certain well-capitalized financial institutions for million. The Capped Calls permit us to require the counterparties to deliver to us shares of our common stock, subject to a capped number of shares. We may also net-settle the Capped Calls and receive cash instead of shares. We have not exercised any of the Capped Calls at September 30, 2024, and the Capped Calls expire on .

million principal amount senior secured term loan Senior Secured Term Loan ). The Senior Secured Term Loan is secured by substantially all of our assets, other than the assets of Danimer Catalytic Technologies and assets associated with the Greenfield Facility. The Senior Secured Term Loan matures on the earlier of March 17, 2027 or September 15, 2026 if more than million of the existing Convertible Notes remain outstanding on that date. After payment of the lender s expenses, including the first three years of premiums for a collateral protection insurance policy for the benefit of the lender, we received net proceeds of million. The Senior Secured Term Loan accrues interest at a stated annual rate of , payable monthly. As part of the Senior Secured Term Loan agreement, we are required to hold million in an interest-payment reserve account, which we have reported as restricted cash. Upon the occurrence of certain events, including a Fundamental Change, the acceleration of the Convertible Notes, Revolving Credit Agreement or certain other debt or outstanding obligations, or our filing of an Annual Report on Form 10-K containing a Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm that includes disclosure regarding going concern, the principal balance under the Senior Secured Term Loan may accelerate and become due immediately. If such acceleration were to occur, that would cause a cross-default of substantially all of our other debt. In connection with the Senior Secured Term Loan, we also issued warrants with a five-year maturity to the lender to purchase million shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share. We determined the fair value of these warrants as of the closing date was million using the Black-Scholes model and included this amount in additional paid-in capital. New Markets Tax Credit Transactions We entered into financing arrangements under the New Markets Tax Credit NMTC program with various unrelated third-party financial institutions (individually and collectively referred to as Investors ), which then invest in certain Investment Funds . In each of the financing arrangements, we loaned money to the Investment Funds. These loans of million are recorded as leveraged loan receivables at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Each Investment Fund then contributed the funds from our loan and the Investor s investment to a special purpose entity, which then in turn loaned the contributed funds to a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. We believe these borrowings, and our related loans to the Investment Funds, will be forgiven in 2026 and 2029. Revolving Credit Agreement On April 19, 2024, we entered into an asset-based lending agreement Revolving Credit Agreement ). The Revolving Credit Agreement provides for borrowings under a revolving commitment of million. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Revolving Credit Agreement, we may request an increase in the Revolving Commitment by an amount between million and million. The amount of the Revolving Commitment available for borrowing at any given time is million, subject to a borrowing base formula that is based upon our accounts receivable and inventory, as more fully described in the Revolving Credit Agreement.

We recognized million and million of expense related to these awards during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We recognized million and million of expense related to these awards during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Market-based Restricted Stock During 2021, we granted shares of restricted stock for which the restrictions lapse on successive thirds of the award on the first date the volume-weighted average price per share of our common stock equals or exceeds for any 20 trading dates within 30-day trading periods beginning on December 29, 2021, 2022, and 2023, respectively. These awards were fully amortized at December 31, 2023. We recognized million and million of related expense during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. During 2023, we instituted a cash settlement feature for certain of these awards if the 2020 Incentive Plan does not have enough shares remaining to fulfill these awards at the time of vesting. As such, of the shares of market-based restricted stock are accounted for as liabilities that are marked to market each period. We maintained a liability of million as a result of this feature as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. All of these shares remained outstanding at September 30, 2024. Performance-based Restricted Stock Units During 2021, we initiated a Performance-based RSU program. Under this program, each participant is awarded a number of units PRSU s) that may vest based on our performance against one or more specified metrics, with to of these PRSUs vesting proportionally with achieved threshold and target attainment levels. We previously had certain PRSUs that contained a cash settlement feature and we accounted for these PRSUs as liabilities that are marked to market using the price of our common stock at the end of each reporting period with a life-to-date expense adjustment. These outstanding cash-settleable PRSUs were forfeited during the nine months ending September 30, 2024 in association with the transition and retirement agreement of the Chief Executive Officer.

million. We set the values of our restricted stock unit and restricted stock awards without market-based vesting provisions on their respective grant dates at the closing price of a share of our common stock on each grant date. We re-value our restricted stock unit awards that include a cash settlement feature each month at the closing price of a share of our common stock on the last trading day of the month, or at September 30, 2024. We re-value our dividend warrant liability at the end of each reporting period using the closing price of a share our of Dividend Warrants on the last trading day of the period, or at September 30, 2024. Level 2 We valued our restricted stock awards that contain a market-based vesting provision on the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation, which takes into account a large number of potential stock price scenarios over time and incorporates varied assumptions about volatility and exercise behavior for those various scenarios. These assumptions are based on market data but cannot be directly observed. We estimated the fair value of our Senior Secured Term Loan based on an analysis of market activity since loan inception at September 30, 2024 and determined it was approximately million. Level 3 We value our stock options, ESPP instruments, Private Warrants and Common Warrants using the Black-Scholes option pricing model on the respective grant dates. We re-value the Private Warrants, Common Warrants and any stock options with a cash-settlement feature at the end of each period. Since our stock price history as a publicly traded company is shorter in duration than the expected lives of our options (other than ESPP instruments), we use the historical volatility of a group of peer companies in combination with our own historical volatility to assess expected volatility. We have not paid and do not currently anticipate paying a cash dividend on our common stock, so we have set the expected annual dividend yield to zero for all calculations. We used risk-free rates equal to the U.S. Treasury yield curves in effect as of each valuation date for durations equal to the expected lives of each instrument. We use the simplified method under Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 14, defined as the mid-point between the vesting period and the contractual term for each option, to determine the expected lives of stock-settled stock options and we use the remaining contractual lives of ESPP instruments, Private Warrants, Common Warrants, and stock options with a cash-settlement feature as their expected lives.

 Introductory Note 
 The Company (formerly Live Oak Acquisition Corp. Live Oak )), was incorporated in the State of Delaware on May 24, 2019 as a special purpose acquisition company formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock 
 23 

purchase, recapitalization, reorganization, or similar business combination with one or more businesses. Live Oak completed its initial public offering in May 2020. On December 29, 2020 Closing Date ), Live Oak consummated a business combination Business Combination with Meredian Holdings Group, Inc. MHG or Legacy Danimer ), with Legacy Danimer surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Live Oak. The Business Combination was accounted for as a reverse recapitalization, meaning that Legacy Danimer was treated as the accounting acquirer and Live Oak was treated as the accounting acquiree. Effectively, the Business Combination was treated as the equivalent of Legacy Danimer issuing stock for the net assets of Live Oak, accompanied by a recapitalization. In connection with the Business Combination, Live Oak changed its name to Danimer Scientific, Inc. On August 11, 2021, we closed the acquisition of Novomer, Inc. (integrated into our business as Danimer Catalytic Technologies ). 
 Overview 
 We are a performance polymer company specializing in bioplastic replacement for traditional petroleum-based plastics. We bring together innovative technologies to deliver biodegradable bioplastic materials to global consumer product companies. We believe that we are the only commercial company in the bioplastics market to combine the production of a base polymer along with the reactive extrusion capacity in order to give customers a drop-in replacement for a wide variety of petroleum-based plastics. We derive our revenue primarily from product sales of PHA- and PLA-based resins as well as from services such as contract research and development and tolling. 
 PHA-Based Resins: We are a leading producer of polyhydroxyalkanoate PHA ), a key biodegradable ingredient in a wide range of engineered materials that are plastic alternatives, which we sell under the proprietary Nodax brand name, for use in a wide variety of plastic applications including straws, food containers and cutlery, among other things. We make Nodax through a fermentation process where bacteria consume vegetable oil and make PHA within their cell walls as energy reserves. We harvest the PHA from the bacteria, then purify and filter the bioplastic before forming the PHA into pellets, which we combine with other inputs using a reactive extrusion process to manufacture formulated finished product. We design our PHAs to be a drop-in replacement for petroleum-based plastics so that the converters do not have to purchase new equipment to switch to our new biodegradable plastic. Utilizing PHA as a base resin for a wide variety of application-specific engineered materials significantly expands the number of potential applications for bioplastics in the industry and enables us to produce resin that is not just compostable, but also fully biodegradable. 
 In December 2018, we acquired a fermentation facility in Winchester, Kentucky Kentucky Facility for production of PHA on a commercial scale. We embarked on a two-phase commissioning strategy for the Kentucky Facility, which expanded the capacity of the plant by 45 million pounds to total plant capacity up to 65 million pounds of Nodax-based finished product, which includes other blended inputs, per year. The capacity expansion was completed in 2022. 
 In November 2021, we broke ground on the construction of a PHA plant in Bainbridge, Georgia Greenfield Facility ). Through September 30, 2024, we have invested 189.5 million in the Greenfield Facility, excluding capitalized interest and internal labor. The Greenfield Facility has an engineering cost estimate ranging from 515 million to 665 million, which was most recently updated in December 2022 and does not consider any effect of inflation. The Greenfield Facility has a planned annual production capacity of approximately 125 million pounds of finished product. We suspended construction of the Greenfield Facility during 2022 and completion of the facility is contingent upon securing additional financing. 
 We estimate construction of a commercial Rinnovo plant would cost between 140 million to 220 million. This range does not account for the impact of inflation on our construction costs arising since the completion of our engineering cost estimate in the second quarter of 2022. We believe this will be an important aspect of our long-term corporate development. Once a commercial Rinnovo plant is completed and after making some additional investments in extrusion capacity, the Danimer network is expected to have production capacity of approximately 330 million pounds of Nodax-based finished product. Danimer also expects to have approximately 60 million pounds of Rinnovo remaining to sell on a standalone basis or in formulations that don't include Nodax. In July 2024, we temporarily suspended our Danimer Catalytic Technologies business, including additional reduction in force, to further capital conservation. There were no asset impairments associated with this suspension, but we do expect to record additional strategic reorganization and other related charges in the quarter ending December 31, 2024 that will reduce the immediate cost savings realized. 
 PLA-Based Resins: Since 2004, we have been producing proprietary plastics using a natural plastic called polylactic acid PLA as a base resin. PLA has limited functionality in its unformulated, or neat, form. We purchase PLA and formulate it into bioplastic resins by leveraging the expertise of our chemists and our proprietary reactive extrusion process. Our formulated PLA products allow many companies to begin to use renewable and compostable plastics to meet their customers growing sustainability needs. We were the first company in the world to create a bioplastic suitable for coating disposable paper cups to withstand the temperatures of hot liquids such as coffee. We have expanded our product portfolio and now supply customers globally. 
 Research and Development R D and Tolling Services: Our technology team partners with global consumer product companies to develop custom biopolymer formulations for specific applications. R D contracts are designed to develop a formulated resin using PHA, PLA and other biopolymers that can be run efficiently on existing conversion equipment. We expect successful R D contracts to culminate in supply agreements with the R D customers. Our R D services thus not only provide revenue but also a pipeline of future products. 
 24 

In addition to producing our own products, we also toll manufacture for customers that need our unique extruder or reactor setup for new or scale-up production. Our specialty tolling services primarily involve processing customer-owned raw materials to assist them in addressing their extrusion capacity constraints or manufacturing challenges. 
 Key Factors Affecting Operating Results 
 We believe that our performance and future success depend on several factors that present significant opportunities for us but also pose risks and challenges, including those discussed below. 
 Factors Impacting Our Revenue 
 We derive our revenue from product sales of PHA- and PLA-based resins as well as from services such as R D and tolling. 
 The most significant drivers of PHA-based revenue are the pace of adoption of our materials and, in the longer-term, our ability to bring additional production capacity online, such as our Greenfield Facility. Our product revenue from PLA-based resins is primarily impacted by the effective launch of new product offerings in new markets by our customers. Finally, our product revenue will be impacted in the future by our ability to deliver biopolymer formulations that can be efficiently run on customer conversion equipment and meet customer application specifications and requirements and by our ability to negotiate successful PHA-related license sales agreements. 
 Our service revenue is primarily impacted by the timing of, and execution against, customer contracts. Research and development services generally involve milestone-based contracts to develop PHA-based solutions designed to a customer s specifications. Upon the completion of research and development contracts, customers generally have the option to enter into long-term supply agreements with us for the developed product solutions. 
 Factors Impacting Our Expenses 
 Cost of revenue 
 Cost of revenue is comprised of costs of goods sold and direct costs associated with research and development service projects. Costs of goods sold consists of raw materials and ingredients, personnel, related production overhead, rent, utilities and depreciation. Costs associated with research and development service contracts include outside consulting and testing, personnel and related overhead incurred in direct relation to specific service contracts. 
 Selling, general and administrative expense 
 Selling, general and administrative expense consists of personnel costs, corporate administration expenses, and elements of depreciation and amortization, rent, facility and marketing expenses that are not directly attributable to direct costs of production or associated with research and development activities. 
 Research and development expense 
 Research and development expense includes personnel costs, depreciation, amortization, third-party consulting and testing fees, and rent and related facility expenses directly attributable to research and development activities not associated with revenue generating service contracts. 
 Current Developments 
 During the third quarter, we made further inroads in our mission to create biodegradable consumer packaging and other products which address the global plastics waste crisis by: 
 continuing to make commercial shipments of cutlery resin to our converter partners to service a large QSR, and 

making additional progress in negotiating development and supply agreements with our blue-chip customers. 

Russia Ukraine Conflict 
 With respect to the war in Ukraine, our business and operational environment is impacted by, among other things, responsive governmental actions including sanctions imposed by the U.S. and other governments. 
 While we do not have operations in either Russia or Ukraine, we have experienced a decline in sales due to the conflict, specifically sales of some of our PLA products. We have also experienced supply chain challenges and increased logistics and raw material costs, including but not limited to canola oil, which our PHA production currently uses as a feedstock. Although we did not and do not source canola oil from Ukraine, and we have placed orders to reduce our exposure to shortages or inflation, we believe global canola oil prices have been more volatile due to events in Ukraine. 
 The extent to which the conflict may continue to impact us in future periods will depend on future developments, including the severity and duration of the conflict, its impact on regional and global economic conditions, and the extent of supply chain disruptions. We will continue to monitor the conflict and assess the related sanctions and other effects and may take further actions if necessary. 
 25 

Critical Accounting Policies 
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported periods. Our disclosure of our key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results, are set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Revenue 
 For the third quarter of 2024, revenue decreased by 21 as compared to the prior year quarter. In the current quarter, PHA-based product sales of 6.6 million decreased 1.8 million, or 22 , over the prior year quarter due to the reallocation of business among converters by one of our end customers, Starbucks. PHA-based product sales represented 83 of our product revenues in the current quarter and 81 of product revenue in the prior year quarter. Current quarter PLA-based product sales of 1.3 million decreased 0.6 million compared to the prior year quarter due to decreased demand from certain PLA customers and approximates the future run rate for our PLA business. 
 The increase in service revenue relates primarily to a new R D contract for 1.3 million, of which 0.3 million was earned and recognized in the current year quarter. 
 During the current quarter, we had two customers that each accounted for 10 or more of revenue and that collectively accounted for 61 of total revenue. In the prior year quarter, we also had two customers that each accounted for 10 or more of revenue and that collectively accounted for 64 of total revenue. 
 Cost of revenue and gross profit 
 Cost of revenue decreased 15 for the current quarter as compared with the prior year quarter. This is largely driven by the sales volume decreases and cost reduction efforts taken throughout the business, partially offset by unfavorable fixed cost absorption, and inflationary impacts. 
 The decline in gross profit percentage as compared with the prior year quarter was primarily due to unfavorable fixed cost absorption in the current quarter. 
 26 

Operating expenses 
 The current quarter improvement as compared to the prior year quarter in selling, general and administrative expense primarily relates to a decrease in stock-based compensation of 11.8 million for certain executive awards that were fully amortized in December 2023, which was partially offset by increases in legal and consulting expenses of 1.1 related to shareholder litigation costs and recent financing transactions. The improvement in research and development expense as compared to the prior year quarter also relates primarily to a decrease in stock-based compensation expense of 1.7 million for executive awards. We continue to focus on reducing expenses company-wide. 
 Loss on remeasurement of warrants 
 The current quarter remeasurement loss of warrants primarily reflects the increase in the fair value of the 45.7 million publicly-traded Dividend Warrants, which was partially offset by the decrease in the fair value of the 15 million outstanding Common Warrants due to a decrease in the share price during the quarter. The prior year quarter remeasurement gain reflects the decrease in fair value of the 3.9 million outstanding Private Warrants due to a decrease in the share price during the prior year quarter. 
 Interest expense 
 The increase, as compared to the prior year quarter, in interest expense, net of capitalization, primarily resulted from an increase of 0.5 million cash interest expense and 0.4 million increase in loan cost amortization expense related to the Senior Secured Term Loan as well as the Revolving Credit Agreement, which is new in the current quarter. 
 Gain on loan extinguishment 
 The current quarter gain on loan extinguishment of 6.8 million is related to the retirement of 8.1 million of our previously outstanding 3.25 Convertible Notes that were exchanged for equity as part of the aforementioned Dividend Warrant transaction. 
 Income taxes 
 For the current quarter, we had an immaterial amount of tax expense as compared to a benefit of 0.5 million in the prior year quarter. Our effective tax rates differed from the federal statutory rate of 21 due to our valuation allowances against substantially all of our net deferred tax assets.

Revenue 
 Revenues during the current nine month period decreased by 26 as compared to the prior year nine month period. PHA-based product sales of 20.7 million decreased 1.2 million, or 5.4 over the prior year nine month period due primarily to a 9.9 decrease in sales price which was not fully offset by a 5.0 increase in volumes sold. PHA-based product sales represented 82 of our product revenues in the current year period and 65 of product revenue in the prior year period. Current nine month period PLA-based product sales of 4.4 million decreased 7.3 million compared to the prior year nine month period due to decreased demand from certain PLA customers and approximates the future run rate for our PLA business. 
 The decrease in service revenue relates primarily to our completion of our portion of several R D contracts since the beginning of the prior year period. 
 During the current nine month period, we had two customers that each individually accounted for 10 or more of revenue and collectively accounted for 64 of total revenue, whereas in the prior year period we had two customers that each individually accounted for 10 or more of revenue and collectively accounted for 65 of total revenue. 
 Cost of revenue and gross profit 
 Cost of revenue decreased 17 for the current nine month period as compared with the prior year nine month period. This is largely driven by the sales volume decreases and cost reduction efforts taken throughout the business, partially offset by unfavorable fixed cost absorption, and inflationary impacts. 
 The decline in gross profit percentage as compared with the prior year period was primarily due to unfavorable fixed cost absorption. 
 Operating expenses 
 The current period improvement in selling, general and administrative expense as compared to the prior year period primarily relates to a decrease in stock-based compensation of 36.1 million for executive awards that were fully amortized in December 2023, which was partially offset by increases of 2.7 million in legal expenses related to our on-going shareholder litigation activity as well as recent debt and financing transactions and a 2.1 million increase in bad debt due to increased customer reserves in the current year period. The improvement in research and development expense relates primarily to a decrease in stock-based compensation expense of 4.9 million for executive awards that were fully amortized in December 2023 as well as a decrease of 0.9 million in compensation and benefits related to a one-time write-off of deferred payroll costs in the prior year period and headcount reductions taken during the current year period. We continue to focus on reducing expenses company-wide. 
 Gain on remeasurement of warrants 
 The current period remeasurement gain of warrants primarily reflects the decrease in the fair value of the 15 million outstanding Common Warrants due to a decrease in the share price during the period offset by the increase in the fair value of the 45.7 million outstanding Dividend Warrants. The prior year period remeasurement loss was due to an increase in the share price during that period that impacted the fair value of the 3.9 million outstanding Private Warrants. 
 Interest expense 
 The increase in interest expense, net of capitalization, as compared to the prior year, resulted from a 4.6 million increase in cash interest expense and 2.7 million increase in loan cost amortization expense related to the Senior Secured Term Loan as well as the Revolving Credit Agreement, which is new in current nine month period, offset by an increase of 0.9 million in interest income on the deposited proceeds from the Senior Secured Term Loan. 
 Gain on loan extinguishment 
 The current period gain on loan extinguishment of 6.8 million is related to the retirement of 8.1 million of our previously outstanding 3.25 Convertible Notes that were exchanged for equity as part of the aforementioned Dividend Warrant transaction. 
 Income taxes 
 For the current period, we had an immaterial amount of tax expense as compared to a benefit of 0.2 million in the prior year period. Our effective tax rates differed from the federal statutory rate of 21 due to our valuation allowances against substantially all of our net deferred tax assets. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our primary sources of liquidity are equity issuances and debt financings. At September 30, 2024, we had 22.2 million in cash and cash equivalents and other working capital of 26.4 million. While we believe we have developed the capabilities to generate revenue that will eventually be sufficient to cover our ongoing operating costs, we are currently experiencing a period of low sales volume. We anticipate significant near-term revenue growth from customers in 2025, however these revenues are uncontracted and we do not 
 28 

currently anticipate our existing liquidity is sufficient to sustain us until our expected revenues and resulting cash returns on revenue occur. As a result of our inability to generate cash from operations, coupled with the interest expense under our debt agreements and expenses related to potential financing transactions, we are forecasting that we will likely not have adequate liquidity to fund our operations and meet our financial obligations in the near term and that substantial doubt exists about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern over the next twelve months from the date of this Form 10-Q as we do not currently expect cash resources and forecasted cash flows will be sufficient. 
 We have significant debt. At September 30, 2024, our long-term debt totaled 381.9 million, as described in greater detail below. Our most significant borrowing facilities are our 3.25 Convertible Senior Notes and our Senior Secured Term Loan. 
 In light of our substantial leverage position and potential for a future liquidity shortfall, we continue to analyze a variety of transactions and mechanisms designed to reduce debt and/or provide sources of incremental liquidity, including restructuring our existing debt, additional debt or equity issuances and/or asset sales. Such transactions, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions, various required covenants and other factors and may not be consummated on terms that are favorable to our existing debt holders and equity holders, or at all. These alternative measures may not be successful, and we may be unable to secure necessary liquidity or to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. Even if these alternative measures are successful, such measures could result in a material dilution to our public shareholders. 
 In addition, the maturity of certain of our debt may be accelerated in certain situations, including if we cannot meet our debt service obligations, and, to the extent such debt is secured, lenders may foreclose on the assets securing such debt. Under the Indenture governing the Convertible Notes, we are required to offer to repurchase our Convertible Notes upon the occurrence of certain Fundamental Change events, including specified change of control transactions and any delisting of our Common Stock from the New York Stock Exchange NYSE ). Upon the occurrence of certain events, including a Fundamental Change or our filing of an Annual Report on Form 10-K containing a Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm that includes disclosure regarding going concern, the lenders under the Senior Secured Term Loan may accelerate the maturity of the borrowings thereunder and such acceleration could cause a cross-default or cross-acceleration of all of our other outstanding debt. Such a cross-default or cross-acceleration could have a wider impact on our liquidity than might otherwise arise from a default or acceleration of a single debt instrument. If an event of default occurs, or if other debt agreements cross-default, and the lenders under the affected debt agreements accelerate the maturity of any loans or other debt outstanding, we may not have sufficient liquidity to repay all of our debt. 
 We broke ground on our Greenfield Facility construction in November 2021 and started placing orders for long-lead time equipment items. The Greenfield Facility has an engineering cost estimate ranging from 515 million to 665 million, which does not consider the effects of inflation. As of September 30, 2024, we have invested 189.5 million of capital, excluding capitalized interest and internal labor, for the Greenfield Facility. During 2022, we suspended construction of the Greenfield Facility and completion of the facility is contingent upon receiving additional financing. 
 3.25 Convertible Senior Notes 
 On December 21, 2021, we issued 240 million principal amount of our 3.25 Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 Convertible Notes ), subject to an indenture Indenture ). 
 The Convertible Notes are our senior, unsecured obligations and accrue interest at a rate of 3.25 per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning on June 15, 2022. We will settle conversions by paying or delivering, as applicable, cash, shares of common stock or a combination of cash and shares, at our election. The initial conversion rate, which is subject to change, is approximately 10.79 per share of common stock. If certain liquidity conditions are met, we may redeem the Convertible Notes between December 19, 2024, and October 20, 2026. The Convertible Notes will mature on December 15, 2026. There are 231.9 million principal amount of Convertible Notes remaining outstanding at September 30, 2024. 
 The Indenture requires us to offer to repurchase the Convertible Notes upon the occurrence of certain Fundamental Change events, including specified change of control transactions and any delisting of our Common Stock from the NYSE. See Item 1A. Risk Factors There can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with the continued listing standards of the NYSE. In addition, upon the occurrence of certain events, including the acceleration of the Senior Secured Term Loan, the holders of 25 of the Convertible Notes may accelerate the principal balance of the Convertible Notes. If such acceleration occurs, it would cause an event of default under the Senior Secured Term Loan and the Revolving Credit Agreement. 
 On July 12, 2024, we completed the distribution of Dividend Warrants as described in Note 8. In addition to Dividend Warrants being exercisable for cash, subject to the terms and conditions of the warrant agreement governing the Dividend Warrants, holders of Dividend Warrants may also exercise their Dividend Warrants with Convertible Notes at face value, meaning that one Convertible Note having a principal amount of 1,000 may be surrendered as consideration to exercise 200 Dividend Warrants. Convertible Notes surrendered to pay the exercise price for Dividend Warrants will be retired. As of September 30, 2024, we have retired 8.1 million of previously outstanding convertible notes resulting in a gain on extinguishment of 6.8 million. 
 29 

Capped Calls 
 Also in December 2021, in connection with the Convertible Notes, we purchased call options Capped Calls from certain well-capitalized financial institutions for 35 million. The Capped Calls permit us to require the counterparties to deliver to us shares of our common stock, subject to a capped number of shares. We may also net-settle the Capped Calls and receive cash instead of shares. We have not exercised any of the Capped Calls at September 30, 2024, and the Capped Calls expire on April 12, 2027. 
 Senior Secured Term Loan 
 On March 17, 2023, we closed a 130 million principal amount Senior Secured Term Loan. The Senior Secured Term Loan matures on the earlier of March 17, 2027 or September 15, 2026 if more than 100 million of the existing Convertible Notes remains outstanding on that date. After payment of the lender s expenses, including the first three years of premiums for a collateral protection insurance policy for the benefit of the lender, we received net proceeds of 98.6 million. The Senior Secured Term Loan accrues interest at a fixed annual rate of 14.4 . As part of the Senior Secured Term Loan agreement, we are required to hold certain interest payments in a restricted reserve account, which resulted in classification of 12.5 million of cash as restricted cash. 
 The Senior Secured Term Loan contains various customary covenants. Upon the occurrence of certain events, including a Fundamental Change, the acceleration of the Convertible Notes, Revolving Credit Agreement or certain other debt and or other obligations, or our filing of an Annual Report on Form 10-K containing a Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm that includes disclosure regarding going concern, the principal balance of the Senior Secured Term Loan may accelerate and become due immediately. If such acceleration occurs, it would cause a cross-default of substantially all of our other debt. 
 In connection with the Senior Secured Term Loan, we also issued warrants with a five-year maturity to the lender to purchase 1.5 million shares of our common stock at an exercise price of 7.50 per share. We determined the fair value of these warrants as of the closing date was 0.5 million, which we included in additional paid in capital, using the Black-Scholes model. 
 Revolving Credit Agreement 
 On April 19, 2024, we entered into an asset-based lending agreement Revolving Credit Agreement ). The Revolving Credit Agreement provides for borrowings under a revolving commitment of 20.0 million Revolving Commitment ). Subject to the terms and conditions of the Revolving Credit Agreement, we may request an increase in the Revolving Commitment by an amount not to exceed 5.0 million, provided that any such request for an increase be in a minimum amount of 2.5 million. The amount of the Revolving Commitment available for borrowing at any given time is 18.5 million, subject to a borrowing base formula that is based upon our accounts receivable and inventory, as more fully described in the Revolving Credit Agreement. We are required to borrow a minimum of 50 of the calculated weekly borrowing base formula at all times. At September 30, 2024, the remaining availability under the Revolving Credit Agreement was 4.8 million. 
 Amounts borrowed under the Revolving Credit Agreement accrue interest at an annual rate equal to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate plus 7 , and any unused Revolving Commitment accrues an unused facility fee at an annual rate of 0.5 , each payable monthly. The Revolving Credit Agreement matures on April 19, 2027; however, certain provisions exist that can accelerate the maturity date. 
 The Revolving Credit Agreement also contains other customary representations, warranties, and affirmative and negative covenants. Upon the occurrence of certain events, including a Fundamental Change, the acceleration of the Convertible Notes, Senior Secured Term Loan or certain other debt or other obligations, the principal balance of the Revolving Credit Agreement may accelerate and become due immediately. 
 The Revolving Credit Agreement is secured by a lien on all of our accounts receivable and inventory and the proceeds thereof and certain other assets as set forth in the Revolving Credit Agreement. 
 Cash Flows for the Nine Months Ended September 30 2024 and 2023: 
 The following table summarizes our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities:

84,488 

Cash flows from operating activities 
 The period-to-period increase in cash outflows is primarily due to changes in working capital, specifically in accounts receivable and inventory, as well as increased interest payments related to our Senior Secured Term Loan and Revolving Credit Agreement in the current year and compared to a partial payment on the Senior Secured Term Loan in the prior year period as well as the Revolving Credit Agreement, which is new in the current year period. 
 30 

Cash flows from investing activities 
 In the current nine month period, we used 6.3 million for the purchase of property, plant and equipment as compared to the 25.7 million for such purchases in the prior year nine month period. During 2024, we are continuing to decrease capital expenditures to align with our cost savings initiatives. 
 Cash flows from financing activities 
 For the nine month period ended September 30, 2024, net cash provided by financing activities of 15.6 million consisted primarily of: 
 Proceeds from issuance of warrants and common stock, net of issuance costs, of 13.4 million; 

Proceeds from the completion of our Revolving Credit Agreement, net of issuance costs, of 19.6 million; and 

Payments of debt of 17.6 million. 

For the nine month period ended September 30, 2023 , net cash provided by financing activities of 84.5 million consisted primarily of: 
 Proceeds from our Senior Secured Term Loan of 130 million, less issuance costs of 33.3 million; and 

Payments of debt of 12.4 million, including all of our previously existing 10.2 million Subordinated Term Loan. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 At September 30, 2024, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We are exposed to various market risks, including potential losses arising from adverse changes in market prices and rates, such as various commodity prices, particularly canola oil. We do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. 
 Our primary financial instruments are cash and cash equivalents. This includes cash in banks and highly rated, liquid money market investments. We believe these instruments are not subject to material potential near-term losses in future earnings from reasonably possible near-term changes in market rates or prices. 
 Commodity Price Risk 
 Our products are made using various purchased components and several basic raw materials, in particular PLA, polybutylene succinate PBS ), polybutylene adipate terephthalate PBAT and canola oil. We expect prices for these items to fluctuate based on marketplace demand and other factors, such as the effect of the Russian invasion of Ukraine on canola oil prices. Our product margins and level of profitability may fluctuate whether or not we pass increases in purchased component and raw material costs on to our customers. 
 Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, including the Interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls can prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. There are inherent limitations in all control systems, including the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of one or more persons. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and, while our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to be effective under circumstances where they should reasonably be expected to operate effectively, there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential conditions. Because of the inherent limitations in any control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
 Our management, with the participation of our Interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Our management and our Interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective 
 31 

in providing them with material information relating to the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the three month period ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 PART II OTHE R INFORMATION 
 Ite m 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 Refer to the information provided in Note 14 to the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements presented in Part I, Item 1. of this report. 
 Item 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 Our results of operations and financial condition are subject to various risks and uncertainties as disclosed in Part I, Item 1A. of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 2023 Form 10-K ). The following information updates, and should be read in conjunction with, the information disclosed in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors of our 2023 Form 10-K, which are incorporated herein by reference. You should carefully consider the risks set forth in our 2023 Form 10-K and the following risks, together with all the other information in this report, including our condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. If any of the risks actually materialize, our operating results, financial condition and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected. Except as disclosed below, there have been no material changes from the risk factors disclosed in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 The following risk factors below are hereby added to the risk factors disclosed in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 Our negative cash flows and current lack of financial resources raise substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. 
 Based on the definitions in the relevant accounting standards, we evaluated whether there are certain conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. If we are unable to raise additional funding to meet our operational needs, we may be forced to limit or cease our operations and/or liquidate our assets. Although our condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern, our negative cash flows from operations and current lack of financial resources raise substantial doubt as to our ability to satisfy our obligations as they become due within one year from the date of filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on our current plans and projections, our unrestricted cash resources of 22.2 million and 26.4 million in working capital at September 30, 2024 and forecasted cash flows are not expected to be sufficient liquidity to fund our operations for the next twelve months from the issuance date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We anticipate significant near-term revenue growth from recent customer awards and through organic growth in 2025, however these revenues are uncontracted, and we do not currently anticipate our existing liquidity is sufficient to sustain us until our expected revenues and resulting cash returns on revenue occur. Given the uncertainties around our liquidity, our ability to execute our business plan,and ability to comply with the covenants under our Senior Secured Term Loan, Convertible Notes and Revolving Credit Agreement, we have concluded that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for at least one year from the date of issuance of these Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Refer to Note 9. Debt. 
 We may need to further increase our cash balance by issuing additional shares of our Common Stock, debt or other securities, including senior or subordinated notes, debt securities convertible into equity, or shares of preferred stock, and we may need to do so sooner than we currently expect. There is no assurance that sources of financing will be available on a timely basis, or on satisfactory terms, or at all, and any additional financing may result in substantial dilution to our stockholders. We may be forced to seek protection from our creditors through bankruptcy proceedings, discontinue operations, or liquidate our assets, and we may receive less than the carrying value of those assets. Any of these outcomes could cause our shareholders to lose some or all of their investment. 
 We have used a substantial portion of our capacity to incur secured debt without seeking consent from the lenders of our Senior Secured Term Loan, certain other secured lenders, and other stakeholders. Consequently, our ability to raise additional secured debt without such consent as part of a restructuring is significantly limited. 
 Even if we are able to raise significant additional capital necessary to continue our operations over the next year, if we are unable to obtain additional adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, when we require it, our ability to continue to pursue our business objectives, develop our technology and products, and respond to business opportunities, challenges, unforeseen circumstances 
 32 

or developments could be significantly limited, and our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. 
 We may not be able to access the liquidity needed to meet our operating requirements and to service our debt instruments, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. If we cannot maintain adequate liquidity, we may undertake restructuring transactions and/or seek bankruptcy protection to undertake restructuring efforts, and we may have to liquidate our assets and may receive less than the value at which those assets are carried on our condensed consolidated interim balance sheet. 
 At September 30, 2024, we had 22.2 million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and 4.8 million of availability under the Revolving Credit Agreement, which resulted in a total liquidity position of 27.0 million. We expect our liquidity position to be impacted by (i) the Senior Secured Term Loan s monthly interest payments 1.6 million based on the principal amount outstanding at September 30, 2024), (ii) the Convertible Notes semi-annual interest payments 3.8 million based on amounts outstanding at September 30, 2024), which will next occur on December 15, 2024 and (iii) the Revolving Credit Agreement s monthly interest payments 0.1 million based on the principal amount outstanding at September 30, 2024). 
 To address a potential future liquidity shortfall, we are evaluating sources of incremental liquidity including additional debt issuances or refinancings and/or asset sales, none of which have been implemented at this time. Any such financing transaction may not be consummated on terms that are favorable to our existing debt holders and equity holders, or at all. 
 Our ability to obtain incremental liquidity, make scheduled payments and/or to refinance our outstanding debt obligations may depend on our financial and operating performance, which may be affected by prevailing economic, industry, and competitive conditions and by financial, business, and other factors beyond our control. We may not be able to achieve, a sufficient level of cash flow from operating activities to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our debt. If we are unable to fund our debt service obligations, operating expenses and capital expenditures, we may pursue restructuring transactions, including refinancing all or part of our debt, selling assets, seeking to raise additional capital, and pursuing one or more internal reorganizations or other restructuring activities, strategic corporate alignment and cost-saving initiatives or other significant corporate transactions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. Any refinancing of debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which may negatively impact our ability to manage our business and raise additional capital. These alternative measures may not be successful, and we may be unable to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. Even if these alternative measures are successful, such measures could result in a material dilution to our public shareholders. 
 In addition, the maturity of certain of our debt may be accelerated in certain situations, including if we cannot meet our debt service obligations, and, to the extent such debt is secured, lenders may foreclose on the assets securing such debt. The Indenture requires us to offer to repurchase the Convertible Notes upon certain Fundamental Change events, including specified change of control transactions and any delisting of our Common Stock. Upon the occurrence of certain events, including a Fundamental Change or our filing of an Annual Report on Form 10-K contains a Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm that includes disclosure regarding going concern, the lenders under the Senior Secured Term Loan may accelerate the maturity of the borrowings, and such acceleration could cause a cross-default or cross-acceleration of all of our other debt. Such a cross-default or cross-acceleration could have a wider impact on our liquidity than might otherwise arise from a default or acceleration of a single debt instrument. If an event of default occurs, or if other debt agreements cross-default, and the lenders under the affected debt agreements accelerate the maturity of any loans or other debt outstanding, we may not have sufficient liquidity to repay all of our debt and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. 
 If any of these risks are realized, our business and financial condition would be adversely affected. 
 There can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with the continued listing standards of the NYSE. 
 On May 21, 2024, we were notified by NYSE Regulation that we were not in compliance with the NYSE s continued listing criteria because the average closing price of our Common Stock was less than 1.00 over a 30-day consecutive trading day period ending May 20, 2024. We are subject to a 180-day cure period and we cannot be certain that we will be able to cure our non-compliance, despite completing a reverse-stock split, which was approved by our stockholders at a Special Meeting of Stockholders held on October 23, 2024. 
 If the NYSE delists our securities from trading on its exchange for failure to meet the listing standards, we and our security holders could face significant material adverse consequences including: 
 a limited availability of market quotations for our securities; 

a determination that our common stock is a penny stock, which will require brokers trading in common stock to adhere to more stringent rules, possibly resulting in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for shares of our common stock; 

a limited amount of analyst coverage; 

a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future; and 

33 

the occurrence of a Fundamental Change under the Indenture governing our 3.250 Convertible Notes due 2026, in which case the holders of the Convertible Notes could require us to repurchase them for the principal amount plus any accrued interest and the lenders under our Senior Secured Term Loan could accelerate the maturity of borrowings thereunder. Such accelerations could result in the lenders under the Revolving Credit Agreement declaring all obligations under the Revolving Credit Agreement immediately due and payable. 

In addition, if our total market capitalization falls below an average of 50 million for 30 consecutive trading days and we are unable to regain compliance during an 18-month cure period, the NYSE may commence suspension and de-listing procedures. As of November 18, 2024, our 30-day average market capitalization was approximately 43 million. 
 Lastly, if (i) the price per share of our common stock falls to an abnormally low price, (ii) our market capitalization falls below an average of 15 million for 30 consecutive trading days, or (iii) we choose to liquidate the Company, the NYSE may immediately commence suspension and de-listing procedures. 
 Due to the Reverse Stock Split, we expect to regain compliance with the NYSE s continued listing criteria with regard to both (i) the average closing price of our Common Stock being greater than 1.00 over a 30-day consecutive trading day period and (ii) the price per share of our Common Stock being above an abnormally low price. 
 If the NYSE delists our Common Stock from trading, we and our stockholders could face significant material adverse consequences, including: a limited availability of market quotations for our securities; triggering a Fundamental Change under the Indenture controlling the Convertible Notes, which could result in the holders of our Convertible Notes requiring us to repurchase them; the acceleration of the Senior Secured Term Loan and/or Revolving Credit Agreement; reduced liquidity for our securities; a determination that our common stock is a penny stock, which will require brokers trading in our common stock to adhere to more stringent rules and regulations, possibly resulting in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for shares of our common stock; a limited amount of analyst coverage; a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future; and a negative impact to, or termination of, our critical business relationships.
