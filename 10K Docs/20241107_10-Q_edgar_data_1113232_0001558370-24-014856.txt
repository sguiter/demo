Work in process Finished goods (completed systems) Inventories, net When recorded, inventory reserves reduce the carrying value of inventories to their net realizable value. We establish inventory reserves when conditions exist that indicate inventory may be in excess of anticipated demand or is obsolete based upon assumptions about future demand for our products or market conditions. We regularly evaluate the ability to realize the value of inventories based on a combination of factors including the following: forecasted sales or usage, estimated product end of life dates, estimated current and future market value and new product introductions. Purchasing and usage alternatives are also explored to mitigate inventory exposure. warranty for all of our systems, the terms and conditions of which vary depending upon the product sold. For all systems sold, we accrue a liability for the estimated cost of standard warranty at the time of system shipment and, if applicable, defer the portion of systems revenue attributable to non-standard warranty. Costs for non-standard warranty are expensed as incurred. Factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of installed units, historical and anticipated product failure rates, material usage and service labor costs. We periodically assess the adequacy of our recorded liability and adjust the amount as necessary.

(d) Forward Currency Exchange Contracts Beginning in February 2024, we entered into forward currency exchange contracts to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our earnings and cash flows. These contracts have month-to-month settlement dates. Any gains or losses on these contracts are reported within Other, net in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. Any open contracts at period end that have settlement dates within one month after the reported period end and any mark-to-market valuation adjustments related to these open contracts are recorded in the current asset or current liability account and any unrealized gain or loss recognized is recorded within Other, net in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. These contracts are measured at fair value using observable market inputs such as forward currency exchange rates and our counterparties credit risks. Based on these inputs, the derivative instruments are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. At September 30, 2024, the recognized unrealized loss on these forward exchange contracts was approximately million. Based on our continued ability to trade and enter into forward contracts, we consider the markets for our fair value instruments to be active. We evaluated the credit risk associated with the counterparties to these derivative instruments and determined that as of September 30, 2024, such credit risks have not had an adverse impact on the fair value of these instruments. million. As part of the sale, we also entered into a lease agreement of our headquarters facility.

The million decrease was primarily due to a decrease in pre-tax income. Income tax expense was million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to a decrease in in the benefit received from share-based compensation. The effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was less than the U.S. statutory rate of primarily attributable to the Foreign Derived Intangible Income deduction, Federal research and development tax credits and excess tax benefits from share-based compensation. The deferred income taxes of million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes, as well as the tax effect of carryforwards. As of September 30, 2024, we have recorded a million valuation allowance in the U.S. against certain tax credits due to the uncertainty of their realization.

In August 2023, our Board of Directors approved additional funding of million for our stock repurchase program, to be available on full utilization of the million repurchase funding approved in February 2022. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we repurchased million shares at an average cost of per share. The timing and actual number of any additional shares to be repurchased under this program will depend on various factors including price, corporate and regulatory requirements, alternative investment opportunities and other market conditions. Repurchased shares are accounted for when the transaction is settled and returned to the status of authorized but unissued shares. Accordingly, on our balance sheet, the repurchase price is deducted from common stock par value and from additional paid-in capital for the excess over par value. If additional paid-in capital has been exhausted, the excess over par value is deducted from retained earnings. Direct costs incurred to acquire the shares are included in the total cost of the shares.

 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Certain statements within "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Words such as may, will, should, would, anticipates, expects, intends, plans, believes, seeks, estimates and similar expressions identify such forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements contained herein are based on current expectations and entail various risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in such forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such a difference include, among other things, those set forth under "Liquidity and Capital Resources" below and under Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A to our 2023 Form 10-K , which discussion is incorporated herein by reference. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which reflect management's analysis only as of the date hereof. We assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements to reflect actual results or changes in factors or assumptions affecting forward-looking statements, except as may be required by law. Overview We are primarily a producer of ion implantation equipment used in the fabrication of semiconductor chips in the United States, Europe, and Asia. In addition, we provide extensive worldwide aftermarket service and support, including spare parts, equipment upgrades and maintenance services to the semiconductor industry. Our product development and manufacturing activities currently occur primarily in the United States and South Korea. Our equipment and service products are highly technical and are sold through a direct sales force in the United States, Europe, and Asia. Consolidation and partnering within the semiconductor manufacturing industry has resulted in a small number of customers representing a substantial portion of our business. Our ten largest customers accounted for 48.2 of total revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Demand for our capital equipment in the first nine months of 2024 has been relatively flat. The overall mature process segment represented 98 of our shipped systems revenue, with 1 of shipments to advanced logic and 1 of shipments to dynamic random-access memory DRAM ). Power device shipments comprised 58 of total systems revenue with the general mature segment representing 32 , and image sensors at 9 . Critical Accounting Estimates Management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations included herein and in our 2023 Form 10-K are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Management s estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Management has not identified any need to make any material change in, and has not changed, any of our critical accounting estimates and judgments as described in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our 2023 Form 10-K.

The 36.5 million decrease in product revenue for the

Table of Contents 
 three-month period ended September 30, 2024, in comparison to the same period in 2023, was primarily driven by a decrease in system sales. Deferred revenue includes payments received in advance of system sales as well as deferral of revenue from systems sales for installation and other future performance obligations. The total amount of deferred revenue at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was 164.0 million and 210.9 million, respectively. Services Services revenue, which includes the labor component of maintenance and service contracts and fees for service hours provided by on-site service personnel, was 9.7 million, or 3.8 of revenue, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 9.0 million, or 3.1 of revenue, for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Although services revenue typically increases with the expansion of the installed base of systems, it can fluctuate from period to period based on capacity utilization at customers manufacturing facilities, which affects the need for equipment service. Nine months ended September 30, 2024 Compared with Nine months ended September 30, 2023 Product Product revenue was 735.6 million, or 96.1 of revenue, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 795.0 million, or 96.9 of revenue, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The 59.4 million decrease in product revenue for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2024, in comparison to the same period in 2023, was primarily driven by a decrease in system sales. Services Services revenue was 29.8 million, or 3.9 of revenue, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with 25.3 million, or 3.1 of revenue, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Revenue Categories used by Management In addition to the line item revenue categories discussed above, management also regularly disaggregates revenue in the following categories, which it finds relevant and useful: Systems and Aftermarket revenues, in which Aftermarket is: A. The portion of Product revenue relating to spare parts, product upgrades and used equipment, combined with B. Services revenue, which is the labor component of Aftermarket revenues; (Aftermarket purchases reflect current fab utilization as opposed to Systems purchases which reflect capital investment decisions by our customers, which have differing economic drivers); Revenue by geographic regions, since economic factors impacting customer purchasing decisions may vary by geographic region; and Revenue by our customer market segments, since they can be subject to different economic drivers at different periods of time, impacting a customer s likelihood of purchasing capital equipment during any particular period. Currently, management references three customer market segments: memory, mature process technology and leading edge foundry and logic.

 Aftermarket and Systems Revenue Three months ended September 30, 2024 Compared with Three months ended September 30, 2023 Included in total revenue of 256.6 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 is revenue from our Aftermarket business of 55.5 million, compared with 60.9 million of Aftermarket revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Aftermarket revenue fluctuates from period to period based on capacity utilization at customers manufacturing facilities, which affects the sale of spare parts and demand for equipment service. Aftermarket revenue can also fluctuate from period to period based on the demand for system upgrades or used equipment. The remaining 201.1 million of revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was systems revenue, compared with 231.4 million of systems revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Systems revenue fluctuates from period to period based on our customers capital spending. Nine months ended September 30, 2024 Compared with Nine months ended September 30, 2023 Included in total revenue of 765.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is revenue from our Aftermarket business of 170.3 million, compared with 178.5 million of Aftermarket revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The remaining 595.1 million of revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was systems revenue, compared with 641.8 million of systems revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

The decrease in gross margin primarily resulted from an unfavorable mix of system revenue. Services Gross margin from services revenue was (4.9) for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 12.4 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in gross margin is attributable to changes in the mix of service contracts .

The increase in gross margin primarily resulted from a favorable mix of system revenue. Services Gross margin from services revenue was 6.2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 10.6 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in gross margin is attributable to changes in the mix of service contracts . Operating Expenses The following table sets forth our operating expenses: Three months ended Period-to-Period Nine months ended Period-to-Period September 30, Change September 30, Change 2024 2023 2024 2023 (dollars in thousands) Research and development 26,395 24,093 2,302 9.6 77,843 71,996 5,847 8.1 Percentage of revenue 10.3 8.2 10.2 8.8 Sales and marketing 16,808 16,465 343 2.1 51,483 46,146 5,337 11.6 Percentage of revenue 6.6 5.6 6.7 5.6 General and administrative 19,854 17,446 2,408 13.8 52,842 48,519 4,323 8.9 Percentage of revenue 7.7 6.0 6.9 5.9 Total operating expenses 63,057 58,004 5,053 8.7 182,168 166,661 15,507 9.3 Percentage of revenue 24.6 19.8 23.8 20.3 Our operating expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, including wages, commissions, incentive-based compensation, stock-based compensation and related benefits and taxes; project material costs related to the design and development of new products and enhancement of existing products; and professional fees, travel and depreciation expenses. Personnel costs are our largest expense, representing 35.5 million, or 56.3 , of our total operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 34.8 million, or 60.0 , of our total operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2023.

The higher personnel costs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are primarily due to increases in wages and headcount as well as stock compensation expense, partially offset by a decrease in variable compensation expense.

Three months ended September 30, 2024 Compared with Three months ended September 30, 2023 Research and development expense was 26.4 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 2.3 million, or 9.6 , compared with 24.1 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is primarily due to higher project and consulting expenses and higher personnel expenses associated with increases in wages partially offset by a decrease in variable compensation expense. Nine months ended September 30, 2024 Compared with Nine months ended September 30, 2023 Research and development expense was 77.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 5.8 million, or 8.1 , compared with 72.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is primarily due to higher project and consulting expenses and higher personnel expenses associated with increases in wages partially offset by a decrease in variable compensation expense and temporary employees.

 Three months ended September 30, 2024 Compared with Three months ended September 30, 2023 General and administrative expense was 19.9 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 2.4 million, or 13.8 , compared with 17.4 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is primarily due to an increase in bad debt expense of 2.8 million partially offset by lower personnel expenses associated with a decrease in variable compensation expense. Nine months ended September 30, 2024 Compared with Nine months ended September 30, 2023 General and administrative expense was 52.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 4.3 million, or 8.9 , compared with 48.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase is primarily due to higher bad debt expense and higher personnel expenses associated with an increase in wages and stock compensation partially offset by a decrease in variable compensation expense. Other Income (Expense) Three months ended Period-to-period Nine months ended Period-to-period September 30, change September 30, change 2024 2023 2024 2023 (dollars in thousands) Other income (expense): 8,452 1,995 6,457 323.7 15,366 4,449 10,917 245.4 Percentage of revenue 3.4 0.7 2.1 0.6 Other income (expense) consists of interest earned and accretion on our invested cash balances, interest expense relating to the finance lease obligation we incurred in connection with the 2015 sale of our headquarters facility and other financing obligations as well as foreign exchange gains and losses attributable to both fluctuations of the U.S. dollar against local currencies of the countries in which we operate and forward currency exchange contracts. Other income was 8.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with other income of 2.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The 6.5 million increase in other income (expense) compared to the same prior year period was primarily due to an increase in interest income of 2.0 million and an increase in foreign exchange gains of 7.7 million, partially offset by foreign exchange losses of 3.2 million from forward currency exchange contracts. Other income was 15.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with other income of 4.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The 10.9 million increase in other income (expense) compared to the same prior year period was primarily due to an increase in interest income of 5.3 million, an increase in foreign exchange gains of 5.1 million and foreign exchange gains of 0.5 million from forward currency exchange contracts. Income Tax Provision

The 0.9 million decrease was primarily due to a decrease in pre-tax income. Income tax expense was 20.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 16.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to a decrease in the benefit received from share-based compensation.

 The effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was less than the U.S. statutory rate of 21 primarily attributable to the Foreign Derived Intangible Income deduction, Federal research and development tax credits and excess tax benefits from share-based compensation. The deferred income taxes of 58.9 million and 53.4 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes, as well as the tax effect of carryforwards. As of September 30, 2024, we have recorded a 12.1 million valuation allowance in the U.S. against certain tax credits due to the uncertainty of their realization. Realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income. We believe it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized; however, ultimate realization could be impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at this time. Liquidity and Capital Resources At September 30, 2024, we had 120.1 million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and 459.3 million in short-term investments, in addition to 6.7 million in restricted cash. Management believes that maintaining a strong cash balance is necessary to fund a continuing ramp in our business which can require significant cash investment to meet sudden demand. Additionally, we are using cash to repurchase shares as part of our stock repurchase program and are considering both organic and inorganic opportunities to drive future growth, for which cash resources will be necessary. Our liquidity is affected by many factors. Some of these relate specifically to the operations of our business, for example, the rate of sales of our products, and others relate to the uncertainties of global economic conditions, including the availability of credit and the condition of the overall semiconductor equipment industry. Our industry requires ongoing investments in operations and research and development that are not easily adjusted to reflect changes in revenue. As a result, profitability and cash flows can fluctuate more widely than revenue. Stock repurchases, as discussed below, also reduce our cash balances. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we generated 128.0 million and 91.3 million, respectively, of cash related to operating activities. Investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 resulted in cash outflows of 117.8 million, 7.5 million of which was used for capital expenditures and 433.9 million of which was used to purchase short-term investments, offset by 323.6 million related to maturities of short-term investments. Investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 resulted in cash outflows of 74.2 million, 10.5 million of which was used for capital expenditures and 271.6 million of which was used to purchase short-term investments, offset by 207.9 million related to maturities of short-term investments. Financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 resulted in a cash usage of 56.6 million. During the first nine months of 2024, (i) 45.4 million in cash was used to repurchase our common stock, (ii) 11.4 million was used for payments to government tax authorities for income tax withholding on employee compensation arising from the vesting of RSUs, where units are withheld by us to cover taxes, and (iii) 1.1 million was used to reduce the liability under the finance lease of our corporate headquarters. These amounts were partially offset by 1.2 million of proceeds related to the purchase of shares under our 2020 ESPP during the first nine months of 2024. In comparison, financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 resulted in cash usage of 53.2 million, of which (i) 37.5 million related to the repurchase of our common stock (ii) 15.8 million related to payments made to government tax authorities for income tax withholding on employee compensation arising from the vesting of RSUs, and (iii) 0.9 million relating to the reduction of our financing lease liability. These amounts were partially offset by 1.0 million of proceeds related to the purchase of shares under our 2020 ESPP and exercise of stock options during the first nine months of 2023. As of September 30, 2024, we had a security deposit of 5.9 million related to the lease of our corporate headquarters in the form of a cash collateralized letter of credit issued with UBS Bank USA, which is classified as long-term restricted cash on our balance sheet. We believe that based on our current market, revenue, expense and cash flow forecasts, our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash requirements for the short- and long-term.
