 operational Trains, for a total production capacity of approximately mtpa of LNG (the Liquefaction Project ). The Sabine Pass LNG Terminal also has operational regasification facilities that include LNG storage tanks, vaporizers and marine berths. Additionally, the Sabine Pass LNG Terminal includes a -mile natural gas supply pipeline that interconnects the Sabine Pass LNG Terminal with several large interstate and intrastate pipelines (the Creole Trail Pipeline ). 
 
 We are pursuing an expansion project to provide additional liquefaction capacity, and we have commenced commercialization to support the additional liquefaction capacity associated with this potential expansion project. The development of this site or other projects, including infrastructure projects in support of natural gas supply and LNG demand, will require, among other things, acceptable commercial and financing arrangements before we make a positive FID. 
 
 We do not have employees and thus we and our subsidiaries have various services agreements with affiliates of Cheniere in the ordinary course of business, including services required to construct, operate and maintain the Liquefaction Project, and administrative services. See Note 10 Related Party Transactions for additional details of the activity under these services agreements during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, Cheniere owned of our limited partner interest in the form of million of our common units. Cheniere also owns of our general partner interest and our incentive distribution rights IDRs ).

 of all distributions made by us. In addition, the general partner holds IDRs, which allow the general partner to receive a higher percentage of quarterly distributions of available cash from operating surplus as additional target levels are met, but may transfer these rights separately from its general partner interest. The higher percentages range from to , inclusive of the general partner interest. 
 Our partnership agreement requires that, within days after the end of each quarter, we distribute all of our available cash, which, as defined in our partnership agreement, is generally our cash on hand at the end of a quarter less the amount of any reserves established by our general partner. All distributions we have paid to date have been made from accumulated operating surplus as defined in the partnership agreement. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our total securities beneficially owned in the form of common units were held by Cheniere, by CQP Target Holdco L.L.C. CQP Target Holdco and other affiliates of Blackstone Inc. Blackstone and Brookfield Asset Management Inc. Brookfield and by the public. All of our general partner interest was held by Cheniere. CQP Target Holdco s equity interests are owned by BIP Chinook Holdco L.L.C., an affiliate of Blackstone, and owned by BIF IV Cypress Aggregator (Delaware) LLC, an affiliate of Brookfield. The ownership of CQP Target Holdco, Blackstone and Brookfield are based on their most recent filings with the SEC.

 We value the Liquefaction Supply Derivatives using a market or option-based approach incorporating present value techniques, as needed, which incorporates observable commodity price curves, when available, and other relevant data. 
 
 We include a significant portion of the Liquefaction Supply Derivatives as Level 3 within the valuation hierarchy as the fair value is developed through the use of internal models which incorporate significant unobservable inputs. In instances where observable data is unavailable, consideration is given to the assumptions that market participants may use in valuing the asset or liability. To the extent valued using an option pricing model, we consider the future prices of energy units for unobservable periods to be a significant unobservable input to estimated net fair value. In estimating the future prices of energy units, we make judgments about market risk related to liquidity of commodity indices and volatility utilizing available market data. Changes in facts and circumstances or additional information may result in revised estimates and judgments, and actual

Liquefaction Supply Derivatives 
 
 We hold Liquefaction Supply Derivatives which are primarily indexed to the natural gas market and international LNG indices. As of September 30, 2024, the remaining fixed terms of the Liquefaction Supply Derivatives ranged up to approximately years, some of which commence or accelerate upon the satisfaction of certain events or development of infrastructure to support natural gas gathering and transport. 
 
 The forward notional amount for the Liquefaction Supply Derivatives was approximately TBtu and TBtu as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, inclusive of amounts under contracts with unsatisfied contractual conditions, and exclusive of extension options that were uncertain to be taken as of both September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

 Fair Value and Location of Derivative Assets and Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets 
 
 All existing counterparty derivative contracts provide for the unconditional right of set-off in the event of default. We have elected to report derivative assets and liabilities arising from those derivative contracts with the same counterparty and the unconditional contractual right of set-off on a net basis. The use of derivative instruments exposes us to counterparty credit risk, or the risk that a counterparty will be unable to meet its commitments, in instances when our derivative instruments are in an asset position. Additionally, counterparties are at risk that we will be unable to meet our commitments in instances where our derivative instruments are in a liability position. We incorporate both our own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty s nonperformance risk in fair value measurements depending on the position of the derivative. In adjusting the fair value of our derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk, we have considered the impact of any applicable credit enhancements, such as collateral postings, set-off rights and guarantees.

SPL is restricted from making distributions under agreements governing its indebtedness generally until, among other requirements, appropriate reserves have been established for debt service using cash or letters of credit and a historical debt service coverage ratio and projected debt service coverage ratio of at least :1.00 is satisfied.

 The following potential future sources of revenue are omitted from the table above under exemptions we have elected: (1) all performance obligations that are part of a contract that has an original expected duration of one year or less and (2) substantially all variable consideration under our SPAs and TUAs as well as variable consideration that is allocated entirely to a wholly unsatisfied performance obligation or to a wholly unsatisfied promise to transfer a distinct good or service that forms part of a single performance obligation when that performance obligation qualifies as a series. The amount of revenue from variable fees that is not included in the transaction price will vary based on the future prices of the underlying variable index, primarily Henry Hub, throughout the contract terms, to the extent customers elect to take delivery of their LNG, and adjustments to the consumer price index. Certain of our contracts contain additional variable consideration based on the outcome of contingent events and the movement of various indexes. We have not included such variable consideration in the transaction price to the extent the consideration is considered constrained due to the uncertainty of ultimate pricing and receipt. Additionally, we have excluded variable consideration related to volumes that are contractually subject to additional liquefaction capacity beyond what is currently in construction or operation.

Overview 
 
 We are a publicly traded Delaware limited partnership formed by Cheniere. We provide clean, secure and affordable LNG to integrated energy companies, utilities and energy trading companies around the world. We aspire to conduct our business in a safe and responsible manner, delivering a reliable, competitive and integrated source of LNG to our customers. 
 
 LNG is natural gas (methane) in liquid form. The LNG we produce is shipped all over the world, converted back into natural gas (called regasification and then transported via pipeline to homes and businesses and used as an energy source that is essential for heating, cooking, other industrial uses and back up for intermittent energy sources. Natural gas is a cleaner-burning, abundant and affordable source of energy. When LNG is converted back to natural gas, it can be used instead of coal, which reduces the amount of pollution traditionally produced from burning fossil fuels, like sulfur dioxide and particulate matter that enters the air we breathe. Additionally, compared to coal, it produces significantly fewer carbon emissions. By liquefying natural gas, we are able to reduce its volume by 600 times so that we can load it onto special LNG carriers designed to keep the LNG cold and in liquid form for efficient transport overseas. 
 
 We own a natural gas liquefaction and export facility located in Cameron Parish, Louisiana at Sabine Pass (the Sabine Pass LNG Terminal ), one of the largest LNG production facilities in the world, which has six operational Trains, for a total production capacity of approximately 30 mtpa of LNG (the Liquefaction Project ). The Sabine Pass LNG Terminal also has operational regasification facilities that include five LNG storage tanks with aggregate capacity of approximately 17 Bcfe and vaporizers with regasification capacity of approximately 4 Bcf/d, as well as three marine berths, two of which can accommodate vessels with nominal capacity of up to 266,000 cubic meters and the third berth which can accommodate vessels with nominal capacity of up to 200,000 cubic meters. We also own a 94-mile natural gas supply pipeline through our subsidiary, CTPL, that interconnects the Sabine Pass LNG Terminal with several large interstate and intrastate pipelines (the Creole Trail Pipeline ). 
 
 Our long-term customer arrangements form the foundation of our business and provide us with significant, stable, long-term cash flows. We have contracted most of our anticipated production capacity under SPAs, in which our customers are generally required to pay a fixed fee with respect to the contracted volumes irrespective of their election to cancel or suspend deliveries of LNG cargoes, and under IPM agreements, in which a gas producer sells natural gas to us on a global LNG or natural gas index price, less a fixed liquefaction fee, shipping and other costs. The SPAs also have a variable fee component, 
 21 

Table of Contents 

 which is generally structured to cover the cost of natural gas purchases, transportation and liquefaction fuel consumed to produce LNG. Since we procure most of our feedstock for LNG production from the U.S., the structure of these contracts helps limit our exposure to fluctuations in U.S. natural gas prices. Through our SPAs and IPM agreement, we have contracted approximately 80 of the total anticipated production from the Liquefaction Project with approximately 14 years of weighted average remaining life as of September 30, 2024, excluding volumes that are contractually subject to additional liquefaction capacity beyond what is currently in construction or operation. 
 We remain focused on safety, operational excellence and customer satisfaction. Increasing demand for LNG has allowed us to expand our liquefaction infrastructure in a financially disciplined manner. We have increased available liquefaction capacity at our Liquefaction Project as a result of debottlenecking and other optimization projects. We believe these factors provide a foundation for additional growth in our portfolio of customer contracts in the future. We hold a significant land position at the Sabine Pass LNG Terminal, which provides opportunity for further liquefaction capacity expansion. We are developing an expansion adjacent to the Liquefaction Project with a total production capacity of up to approximately 20 mtpa of LNG, inclusive of estimated debottlenecking opportunities (the SPL Expansion Project ). In February 2024, certain of our subsidiaries submitted an application to the FERC under the Natural Gas Act (the NGA for authorization to site, construct and operate the SPL Expansion Project, as well as an application to the DOE requesting authorization to export LNG to FTA countries and non-FTA countries, both of which applications exclude debottlenecking. The development of the SPL Expansion Project or other projects, including infrastructure projects in support of natural gas supply and LNG demand, will require, among other things, acceptable commercial and financing arrangements before a positive FID is made. 
 
 Additionally, we are committed to the management of our most important ESG impacts, risks and opportunities. In August 2024, Cheniere published Energy Secured, Benefits Delivered , its fifth Corporate Responsibility CR report, which details its approach and progress on ESG matters. Cheniere s CR report is available at cheniere.com/our-responsibility/reporting-center. Information on Cheniere s website, including the CR report, is not incorporated by reference into this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

Overview of Significant Events 
 
 Our significant events since January 1, 2024 and through the filing date of this Form 10-Q include the following: 
 
 Strategic 
 
 In February 2024, certain of our subsidiaries submitted an application to the FERC under the NGA for authorization to site, construct and operate the SPL Expansion Project, as well as an application to the DOE requesting authorization to export LNG to FTA countries and non-FTA countries, both of which applications exclude debottlenecking. In October 2024, the authorization from the DOE to export LNG to FTA countries was received. 
 Operational 
 
 As of October 25, 2024, approximately 2,700 cumulative LNG cargoes totaling over 185 million tonnes of LNG have been produced, loaded and exported from the Liquefaction Project. 
 Financial 
 
 On October 25, 2024, with respect to the third quarter of 2024, we declared a cash distribution of 0.810 per common unit to unitholders of record as of November 4, 2024, and the related general partner distribution, to be paid on November 14, 2024. These distributions consist of a base amount of 0.775 per unit and a variable amount of 0.035 per unit. 
 In May 2024, we issued 1.2 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.750 Senior Notes due 2034 (the 2034 CQP Senior Notes ). In June 2024, the net proceeds, together with cash on hand, were used to retire 1.2 billion outstanding aggregate principal amount of SPL s 5.625 Senior Secured Notes due 2025 (the 2025 SPL Senior Notes ). 
 In May 2024, in connection with the 2034 CQP Senior Notes issuance, Moody s Ratings Moody s upgraded our issuer credit rating to Baa2 from Ba1 and revised our outlook to stable from positive. Moody s also upgraded SPL s issuer credit rating to Baa1 from Baa2 and revised SPL s outlook to stable from positive.

 Net income 
 
 Net income declined by 156 million and 1.5 billion between the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods of 2023. The decline between the respective three and nine month periods was primarily attributable to unfavorable changes in fair value of derivatives of 215 million and 1.6 billion, respectively, principally attributable to our IPM agreement with Tourmaline Oil Marketing Corp, which decreased from 217 million and 1.5 billion during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, to 32 million and 238 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, due to the nonrecurrence of significant declines of historic volatility in international gas prices and moderated and sustained spot prices during the current periods relative to the same periods of 2023. The remaining unfavorable changes in fair value of derivatives of 30 million and 352 million during the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods of 2023 were primarily due to an unfavorable shift in long-term U.S. natural gas forward prices. 
 
 Partially offsetting the aforementioned unfavorable changes between the three month periods was an increase in LNG revenues, net of cost of sales excluding the aforementioned changes in fair value of derivatives, of 51 million due to an increase in production volume compared to the same period of 2023. Partially offsetting the aforementioned unfavorable changes between the nine month periods was a decrease in maintenance expense of 70 million due to reduced operating and maintenance activities compared to the same period of 2023. 
 
 The following is an additional discussion of the significant drivers of the variance in net income by line item: 
 Revenues 
 
 We had 73 million and 734 million decreases in revenues between the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods of 2023, which was primarily attributable to 137 million and 997 million decreases, respectively, from lower pricing per MMBtu as a result of declining Henry Hub pricing, partially offset by 82 million and 287 million increases, respectively, from higher production volume largely due to reduced maintenance activities compared to the same periods of 2023 and cooler weather. 
 
 Operating costs and expenses 
 
 The increases in operating costs and expenses of 88 million and 733 million between the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the same periods of 2023, was primarily attributable to 215 million and 1.6 billion unfavorable variances, respectively, over the same periods from changes in fair value of derivatives included in cost of sales, as discussed above under Net income . The unfavorable variances were partially offset by 125 million and 766 million decreases between the comparative three and nine month periods, respectively, in cost of sales excluding the effect of derivative changes, primarily as a result of 99 million and 661 million decreases, respectively, in cost of natural gas feedstock largely due to lower U.S. natural gas prices. 
 
 Significant factor affecting our results of operations 
 Below is a significant factor that affects our results of operations. 
 
 Gains and losses on derivative instruments 
 
 Derivative instruments are utilized to manage our exposure to commodity-related marketing and price risks and are reported at fair value on our Consolidated Financial Statements. For commodity derivative instruments related to our IPM agreements, the underlying LNG sales being economically hedged are accounted for under the accrual method of accounting, whereby revenues expected to be derived from the future LNG sales are recognized only upon delivery or realization of the underlying transaction. Notwithstanding the operational intent to mitigate risk exposure over time, the recognition of derivative instruments at fair value has the effect of recognizing gains or losses relating to future period exposure, and given the significant volumes, long-term duration and volatility in price basis for certain of our derivative contracts, the use of derivative instruments may result in continued volatility of our results of operations based on changes in market pricing, counterparty credit risk and other relevant factors that may be outside of our control. For example, as described in Note 6 Derivative Instruments of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, the fair value of the Liquefaction Supply Derivatives incorporates, as applicable, market participant-based assumptions pertaining to certain contractual uncertainties, including those 
 24 

Table of Contents 

 related to the availability of market information for delivery points, which may require future development of infrastructure, as well as the timing of satisfaction of certain events or development of infrastructure to support natural gas gathering and transport. We may recognize changes in fair value through earnings that could significantly impact our results of operations if and when such uncertainties are resolved. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 The following information describes our ability to generate and obtain adequate amounts of cash to meet our requirements in the short term and the long term. In the short term, we expect to meet our cash requirements using operating cash flows and available liquidity, consisting of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash equivalents and available commitments under our credit facilities. Additionally, we expect to meet our long term cash requirements by using operating cash flows and other future potential sources of liquidity, which may include debt offerings by us or our subsidiaries and equity offerings by us. The table below provides a summary of our available liquidity (in millions). Future material sources of liquidity are discussed below. 
 September 30, 2024 Cash and cash equivalents 331 Restricted cash and cash equivalents designated for the Liquefaction Project 
 80 Available commitments under our credit facilities (1): SPL Revolving Credit Facility 
 766 CQP Revolving Credit Facility 
 1,000 Total available commitments under our credit facilities 1,766 Total available liquidity 2,177 
 
 (1) Available commitments represent total commitments less loans outstanding and letters of credit issued under each of our credit facilities as of September 30, 2024. See Note 8 Debt of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our credit facilities and other debt instruments. 
 
 Our liquidity position subsequent to September 30, 2024 will be driven by future sources of liquidity and future cash requirements. For a discussion of our future sources and uses of liquidity, see the liquidity and capital resources disclosures in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 . 
 
 Although our sources and uses of cash are presented below from a consolidated standpoint, we and our subsidiary SPL operate with independent capital structures. Certain restrictions or requirements under debt instruments executed by SPL limit its ability to distribute cash, including the following: 
 SPL is required to deposit all cash received into restricted cash and cash equivalents accounts under certain of their debt agreements. The usage or withdrawal of such cash is restricted to the payment of liabilities related to the Liquefaction Project and other restricted payments. In addition, SPL s operating costs are managed by subsidiaries of Cheniere under affiliate agreements, which may require SPL to advance cash to the respective affiliates; and 
 SPL is restricted by affirmative and negative covenants included in certain of its debt agreements in its ability to make certain payments, including distributions, unless specific requirements are satisfied. 
 Despite the restrictions noted above, we believe that sufficient flexibility exists to enable each independent capital structure to meet its currently anticipated cash requirements. The sources of liquidity at SPL primarily fund the cash requirements of SPL, and any remaining liquidity not subject to restriction, as supplemented by liquidity provided by our other operations, is available to enable CQP to meet its cash requirements. 
 Supplemental Guarantor Information 
 
 Certain debt obligations of CQP (the Guaranteed Obligations consist of the CQP Revolving Credit Facility, 1.5 billion of 4.500 Senior Notes due 2029, 1.5 billion of 4.000 Senior Notes due 2031, 1.2 billion of 3.25 Senior Notes due 2032, 1.4 billion of 5.950 Senior Notes due 2033 and the 2034 CQP Senior Notes (collectively, the CQP Senior Notes ), all of which are jointly and severally guaranteed by certain subsidiaries of CQP, as prescribed within the respective debt agreements (each a Guarantor and collectively, the CQP Guarantors ). 
 25 

Table of Contents 

 The CQP Guarantors guarantees of such obligations are full and unconditional, subject to certain release provisions including, as applicable, (1) the sale, disposition or transfer (by merger, consolidation or otherwise) of the capital stock or all or substantially all of the assets of a Guarantor, (2) the liquidation or dissolution of a Guarantor, (3) following the release of a Guarantor from another guarantee that resulted in the creation of its guarantee of the Guaranteed Obligation and (4) the legal defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of obligations under the indenture governing the CQP Senior Notes. In the event of a default in payment of the principal or interest by us, whether at maturity of the respective debt obligation or by declaration of acceleration, call for redemption or otherwise, legal proceedings may be instituted against the CQP Guarantors to enforce the guarantee. 
 The Guaranteed Obligations contain affirmative and negative covenants that are customary for the respective debt instrument, including, with limited exceptions, restrictions on CQP s and the CQP Guarantors ability to incur additional indebtedness and/or liens, enter into hedging arrangements and/or engage in transactions with affiliates. The Guaranteed Obligations also include events of default that are customary for the respective debt instrument, which are subject to customary grace periods and materiality standards. 
 
 The rights of holders of the Guaranteed Obligations against the CQP Guarantors may be limited under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or state fraudulent transfer or conveyance law. Each guarantee contains a provision intended to limit the CQP Guarantor s liability to the maximum amount that it could incur without causing the incurrence of obligations under its guarantee to be a fraudulent conveyance or transfer under U.S. federal or state law. However, there can be no assurance as to what standard a court will apply in making a determination of the maximum liability of the CQP Guarantors. Moreover, this provision may not be effective to protect the guarantee from being voided under fraudulent conveyance laws. There is a possibility that the entire guarantee may be set aside, in which case the entire liability may be extinguished.
