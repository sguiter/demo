 Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as well as our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 and filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on February 29, 2024 (the Form 10-K ). This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current plans, expectations and beliefs involving risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors of the Form 10-K and other factors set forth in the Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. 
 
 Overview 
 
 The Vita Coco Company is a leading platform for brands in the functional beverage category. We pioneered packaged coconut water in 2004 and have extended our business into other categories. Our mission is to deliver great tasting, natural and nutritious products that we believe are better for consumers and better for the world. We are one of the largest brands globally in the coconut and other plant waters category, and a large supplier of private label coconut water. 
 
 Our branded portfolio is led by our Vita Coco brand, which is the leader in the coconut water category in the United States, and also includes coconut oil, juice, and milk offerings. Our other brands include Ever Ever , a sustainably packaged water, and PWR LIFT , a protein-infused fitness drink. We also offered Runa , a plant-based energy drink inspired by the guayusa plant native to Ecuador, which we ceased selling in December 2023. We supply private label products to key retailers in both the coconut water and coconut oil categories. Additionally, we generate revenue from bulk product sales to beverage and food companies. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we source our coconut water from a diversified global network of 15 factories across six countries supported by thousands of coconut farmers. As we do not own any of these factories, our supply chain is a fixed asset-lite model designed to better react to changes in the market or consumer preferences. We also work with co-packers in America and Europe to support local packaging and repacking of our products to better service our customers needs. 
 
 Vita Coco is available in over 30 countries, with our primary markets in North America, the United Kingdom and China. Our primary markets for private label are North America and Europe. Our products are distributed primarily through club, food, drug, mass, convenience, e-commerce and food service channels. We are also available in a variety of on-premise locations such as corporate offices, fitness clubs, airports and educational institutions. 

Recent Events 
 
 In early October 2024, the east coast ports of America experienced a labor strike that temporarily shut those ports, resulting in some delays even after the ports reopened. The work stoppage was temporarily resolved, but certain matters are still being negotiated, with a deadline for resolving these issues set as January 2025. It is possible that we may experience a port stoppage related to these negotiations in early 2025 if agreement is not reached. Related to the October 2024 work stoppage, some of the ocean freight carriers issued notices of impending surcharges to be applied if the port closures resulted in disruptions. We currently do not expect to pay any of these surcharges, but if further port disruptions occur in early 2025, we may see similar attempts to charge customers disruption-related charges. 

Key Factors Affecting Our Performance 
 
 We believe that our performance and future success depend on a number of factors that present significant opportunities for us. There have been no material changes to such factors from those described in the Form 10-K under the heading Key Factors Affecting our Performance and the changes noted below in "Impact of Global Events Causing Macroeconomic Uncertainty." Those factors also pose risks and challenges, including those discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Form 10-K. 

Impact of Global Events Causing Macroeconomic Uncertainty 
 Uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment resulting from geopolitical and economic instability (including the effects of current wars and other international conflicts) and variability in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and

 inflationary cost environments may affect our global supply chain. It is not currently possible to ascertain the overall impact of these macroeconomic uncertainties on the Company s business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. Future events and effects related to these macroeconomic uncertainties cannot be determined with precision and actual results could significantly differ from estimates or forecasts. For a further discussion of the risks and challenges posed by these events, please see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of the Form 10-K. 

Components of Our Results of Operations 
 Net Sales 
 We generate revenue through the sale of our Vita Coco branded coconut water, private label and Other products in the Americas and International segments. Our sales are predominantly made to distributors or to retailers for final sale to consumers through retail channels, which includes sales to traditional brick and mortar retailers, who may also resell our products through their own online platforms. Our revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns, discounts, credits, and any taxes collected from consumers. 
 The Company provides trade promotions and sales discounts to its customers and distributors. Since these sales promotions and sales discounts do not meet the criteria for a distinct good or service, they are primarily accounted for as a reduction of revenue and include payments to customers and distributors for performing activities on our behalf, such as payments for in-store displays, payments to gain distribution of new products, payments for shelf space and discounts to promote lower retail prices. These condensed consolidated financial statements include accruals for these promotion and discounts. The accruals are made for invoices that have not yet been received as of the end of the reporting period and are recorded as a reduction of sales, and are based on contract terms and our historical experience with similar programs and require management judgment with respect to estimating customer and consumer participation and performance levels. 
 Cost of Goods Sold 
 Cost of goods sold includes the costs of the products sold to customers, inbound and outbound shipping and handling costs, freight and duties, shipping and packaging supplies, and warehouse fulfillment costs. 
 Gross Profit and Gross Margin 
 Gross profit is net sales less cost of goods sold, and gross margin is gross profit as a percentage of net sales. Gross profit has been, and will continue to be, affected by various factors, including the mix of products we sell, the channels through which we sell our products, the promotional environment in the marketplace, manufacturing costs, commodity prices, warehouse costs, and transportation rates. We expect that our gross margin will fluctuate from period to period depending on the interplay of these variables. 
 Management believes gross margin provides investors with useful information related to the profitability of our business prior to considering the operating costs incurred. Management uses gross profit and gross margin as key measures in making financial, operating, and planning decisions and in evaluating our performance. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses ("SG A") include marketing expenses, promotional expenses, and general and administrative expenses. Marketing and promotional expenses consist primarily of costs incurred promoting and marketing our products and are primarily driven by investments to grow our business and retain customers. General and administrative expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation, broker commissions and other headcount-related expenses associated with supply chain operations, finance, information technology, human resources and other administrative-related personnel, as well as general overhead costs of the business, including research and development for new innovations, rent and related facilities and maintenance costs, depreciation and amortization, and legal, accounting, and professional fees. We expense all SG A as incurred. 
 
 Other Income (Expense), Net 
 Unrealized Gain/(Loss) on Derivative Instruments

Table of Contents 

 We are subject to foreign currency risks as a result of our inventory purchases and intercompany transactions. In order to mitigate the foreign currency risks, we and our subsidiaries enter into foreign currency exchange contracts which are recorded at fair value. Unrealized gain/(loss) on derivative instruments consists of gains or losses on such foreign currency exchange contracts which are unsettled as of period end. See Part I, Item 3 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Foreign Currency Exchange Risk for further information. 
 Foreign Currency Gain/(Loss) 
 Our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. We maintain the financial statements of each entity within the group in its local currency, which is also the entity s functional currency. Foreign currency gain/(loss) represents the transaction gains and losses that arise from exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency. See Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Foreign Currency Exchange Risk for further information. 
 Interest Income 
 Interest income consists of interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents, and money market funds. 
 Interest Expense 
 Interest expense consists of interest payable on our credit facilities and vehicle loans. 
 Income Tax Expense 
 We are subject to federal and state income taxes in the United States and taxes in foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using statutory rates. We regularly assess the need to record a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets if, based upon the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. 
 
 Operating Segments 
 We operate in two reporting segments: 
 Americas The Americas segment is comprised of our operations in the Americas region, primarily in the United States and Canada. 
 International The International segment is comprised of our operations primarily in Europe, the Middle East, and the Asia Pacific regions, which includes the Company s procurement arm. 
 Each segment derives its revenues from the following product categories: 
 Vita Coco Coconut Water This product category consists of all branded coconut water product offerings under the Vita Coco labels, where the majority ingredient is coconut water. For these products, control is transferred upon customer receipt, at which point the Company recognizes the transaction price for the product as revenue. 
 Private Label This product category consists of all private label product offerings, which includes coconut water and oil. The Company determined the production and distribution of private label products represents a distinct performance obligation. Since there is no alternative use for these products and the Company has the right to payment for performance completed to date, the Company recognizes the revenue for the production of these private label products over time as the production for open purchase orders occurs, which may be prior to any shipment. 
 Other This product category consists of all other products, which includes Runa (until we ceased selling it in December 2023) , Ever Ever and PWR LIFT product offerings, Vita Coco product extensions beyond coconut water, coconut milk products, and other revenue transactions (e.g., bulk product sales). For these products, control is transferred upon customer receipt, at which point the Company recognizes the transaction price for the product as revenue.

 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the primary driver of the consolidated net sales decrease of 3.7 was a 36.8 decrease in private label net sales, which was in part due to the transition out of private label coconut oil sales to a key customer, coupled with lower private label coconut water volumes, which were impacted by supply constraints. Vita Coco Coconut Water net sales increased 7.8 with a case equivalents ("CE") volume increase of 6.3 . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the net sales increase of 0.3 , was driven by Vita Coco Coconut Water, which had a 4.5 net sales increase, partially offset by private label net sales decrease of 13.1 .

Gross margin decreased approximately 1.9 percentage points to 38.8 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 40.7 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in gross profit resulted from the lower CE volume and consequent net sales, along with higher transportation costs, which were partially offset by lower finished goods costs and improved net pricing on Vita Coco Coconut Water. Gross profit increased by 16.6 million, or 11.7 , to 157.5 million for

 the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase resulted from volume CE growth and lower finished goods costs, partly offset by higher transportation costs.

 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2024, SG A decreased by 1.7 million, or 5.2 , versus the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by reduced marketing expense of 1.8 million due to reduced spending in light of product supply constraints. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, SG A decreased by 1.9 million, or 2.1 , versus the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was primarily driven lower marketing expense of 4.6 million and reduced bad debt expense of 0.9 million, partially offset by increased personnel related expenses of 3.6 million.

 Unrealized Gain/(Loss) on Derivative Instruments 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded gains of 2.6 million and losses of 4.0 million, respectively, for the mark-to-market changes in fair value on the outstanding derivative instruments for forward foreign currency exchange contracts, with the largest gain for the three months ended September 30, 2024 related to the contracts hedging the BRL and THB. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded losses of 5.9 million and losses of 1.8 million, respectively, for the mark-to-market changes in fair value on the outstanding derivative instruments for forward foreign currency exchange contracts, with the largest loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 related to the contracts hedging the BRL, partially offset by gains on THB, GBP, and CAD hedges. 
 Foreign Currency Gain/(Loss) 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the change in foreign currency gain was 1.8 million as compared to September 30, 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the change in foreign currency gain was 0.9 million as compared to September 30, 2023. The change in all periods was a result of movements in various foreign currency exchange rates related to transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. 
 Interest Income 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024, the increase in interest income was 1.1 million as compared to September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher levels of cash invested with financial institutions during the third quarter of 2024 compared to the third quarter of 2023. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the change in interest income was 3.9 million as compared to the same period ending September 30, 2023. The increase in interest income period over period was due to the cash investment program that began in April 2023, in addition to higher levels of cash invested with financial institutions compared to prior year.

 The change in interest expense is immaterial. 
 Income Tax Expense 
 (in thousands) Three Months Ended September 30, Change Nine Months Ended September 30, Change 2024 2023 Amount Percentage 2024 2023 Amount Percentage Income tax expense (6,362) (4,011) (2,351) 58.6 (16,555) (10,101) (6,454) 63.9 Tax rate 24.8 20.9 23.9 20.2 
 Our quarterly income tax provision is based on an estimated annual effective tax rate applied to our consolidated year-to-date pre-tax income or loss. The effective income tax rate is based upon the estimated income for the year, the composition of that income in different countries, and adjustments, if any, in the applicable quarterly periods for the potential tax consequences, benefits, resolutions of tax audits or other tax contingencies. 
 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 our effective tax rate was 23.9 and 20.2 , respectively. The effective tax rate for the current period is higher than the US statutory rate of 21 primarily as a result of state income taxes for the US company and other nondeductible expenses for tax purposes, and is partially offset by lower statutory tax rates in countries outside the US that we operate in. The change in effective tax rates between the periods is primarily driven by the jurisdictional mix of our pre-tax profits and the impact of higher non-deductible expenses this year related to covered employees' compensation in relation to the pre-tax profits. 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are supplemental non-GAAP financial measures that are used by management and external users of our financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors and lenders. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered as alternatives to net income as a measure of financial performance or cash flows from operations as a measure of liquidity, or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP and should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. 
 These non-GAAP measures are a key metric used by management and our Board of Directors to assess our financial performance. We present these non-GAAP measures because we believe they assist investors in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance and because we believe it is useful for investors to see the measures that management uses to evaluate the Company. 
 We define EBITDA as net income before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA with adjustments to eliminate the impact of certain items, including certain non-cash and other items, that we do not consider representative of our ongoing operating performance.

The amounts for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 relate to costs for the May 26, 2023 offering. The amounts for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 relate to an expense waiver of certain costs incurred during the November 9, 2023 block trade. The Company did not receive any proceeds from the sale of the shares. For additional information regarding the expense waiver for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, see Note 14, Related Party Transactions , in our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 (d) Reflects other charges primarily related to the impairment loss of assets held for sale in 2023 and other non-recurring expenses. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Since our inception, we have financed our operations primarily through cash generated from our business operations and proceeds on borrowings through our credit facilities and term loans. We had 156.7 million and 132.5 million of cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. From time to time, we may supplement our liquidity needs with incremental borrowing capacity under the 2020 Credit Facility. 
 Considering recent market conditions and our business assumptions, we have reevaluated our operating cash flows and cash requirements and believe that current cash, cash equivalents, future cash flows from operating activities and cash available under our 2020 Credit Facility will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs, including working capital needs, capital expenditures and contractual obligations for at least 12 months from the issuance date of the condensed consolidated financial statements included herein and the foreseeable future. 
 Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our revenue growth rate, our working capital needs primarily for inventory build, our global footprint, the expansion of our marketing activities, the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts, the introduction of new and enhanced products and the continued market consumption of our products, as well as any shareholder distribution either through equity buybacks or dividends. Our asset-lite operating model has historically provided us with a low cost, nimble, and scalable supply chain, which allows us to adapt to changes in the market or consumer preferences while also efficiently introducing new products across our platform. We may seek additional equity or debt financing in the future in order to acquire or invest in complementary 
 31 

Table of Contents 

 businesses, products and/or new IT infrastructures. In the event that we require additional financing, we may not be able to raise such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital or generate cash flows necessary to expand our operations and invest in continued product innovation, we may not be able to compete successfully, which would harm our business, operations and financial condition. 
 Cash Flows 
 The following tables summarize our sources and uses of cash: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, Change 2024 2023 Amount Percentage (in thousands) Cash flows provided by (used in): Operating activities 35,977 70,003 (34,026) 48.6 Investing activities (849) (528) (321) (60.8 Financing activities (10,364) 5,897 (16,261) n/m Effects of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 333 212 121 57.1 Net (decrease)/increase in cash and cash equivalents 25,097 75,584 (50,487) 66.8 
 Operating Activities 
 Our main source of operating cash is payments received from our customers. Our primary use of cash in operating activities are for cost of goods sold and SG A expenses. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash provided by operating activities decreased 34.0 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by higher inventory purchases partly offset by increase in net income, net of non-cash adjustments. 
 Investing Activities 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, cash used in investing activities was 0.8 million as compared to 0.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the increase was due to equipment purchases and higher technology related capital expenditures. 
 Financing Activities 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash used by financing activities was 16.3 million higher primarily driven by share repurchases that occurred in 2024 and lower proceeds from stock award exercises. See Note 10, Stockholders' Equity, for further discussion on share repurchases. 
 Debt 
 We had an immaterial amount of debt outstanding as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, which was related to vehicle loans. 
 Revolving Credit Facility 
 In May 2020, the Company entered into the 2020 Credit Facility, which currently provides for committed borrowings of 60 million. The maturity date on the 2020 Credit Facility is May 12, 2026. 
 Starting in December 2022, borrowings on the 2020 Credit Facility bear interest at rates based on either: 1) a fluctuating rate per annum determined to be the sum of Daily Simple SOFR plus the Spread; or 2) a fixed rate per annum determined to be the sum of the Term SOFR plus the Spread. The Spread ranges from 1.00 to 1.75 , which is based on the Company s leverage ratio (as defined in the credit agreement) for the immediately preceding fiscal quarter as defined in the credit agreement. In addition, the Company is currently subject to an unused commitment fee ranging from 0.10 and 0.20 on the unused amount of the line of credit, with the rate being based on the Company s leverage ratio (as defined in the credit agreement). 
 32 

Table of Contents 

 The outstanding balance on the Revolving Facility was zero as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we were compliant with all financial covenants. 
 Vehicle Loans 
 We periodically enter into vehicle loans. Interest rates on these vehicle loans range from 4.56 to 5.68 . The outstanding balance on the vehicle loans as of September 30, 2024 was less than 0.1 million. 
 For additional information, see Note 6, Debt , in our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
 There have been no material changes to our contractual obligations from those described in the Form 10-K. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates 
 Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, costs and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 Our critical accounting policies are described under the heading Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates in the Form 10-K and the notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements appearing in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, there were no material changes to our critical accounting policies from those discussed in the Form 10-K. 
 
 Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 A description of recently adopted and issued accounting pronouncements that may potentially impact our financial position and results of operations is disclosed in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , to our condensed consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 We are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily include interest rate sensitivities. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the outstanding amounts related to our 2020 Credit Facility incur interest fees at variable interest rates and are affected by changes in the general level of market interest rates. However, there was zero outstanding balance on the 2020 Credit Facility as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Risk 
 We transact business globally in multiple currencies and hence have foreign currency risks related to our net sales, cost of goods sold and operating expenses. We use derivative financial instruments to reduce our net exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. Our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce the volatility caused by foreign exchange rate changes on the earnings, cash flows and financial position of our international operations. We generally target to hedge a majority of our forecasted yearly foreign currency exchange exposure through a 24-month 
 33

 rolling layered approach and leave a portion of our currency forecast floating at spot rate. Our currency forecast and hedge positions are reviewed quarterly. The gains and losses on the forward contracts associated with our balance sheet positions are recorded in Other income (expense), net in the condensed consolidated statements of operations appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
 The total notional values of our forward exchange contracts were 99.4 million and 121.0 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The derivatives on the forward exchange contracts resulted in an unrealized loss of (5.9) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and we estimate that a 10 strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar would have resulted in an approximately 0.3 million gain or loss. 
 A portion of our cash and cash equivalents are denominated in foreign currencies. As of September 30, 2024, a 1 change in the value of the U.S. dollar compared to foreign currencies would have caused our cash and cash equivalents to decrease or increase by 0.1 million. As of December 31, 2023, a 1 change in the value of the U.S. dollar compared to foreign currencies would have caused our cash and cash equivalents to decrease or increase by 0.1 million. 
 Inflation Risk 
 Inflation generally affects us by increasing our cost of transportation, labor and manufacturing costs. In recent years, we have seen fluctuating transportation costs caused by global supply chain disruptions or geopolitical instability and general inflation effects, which may cause pressure on our costs and margins. More specifically, we source a large amount of our finished goods from international countries, which exposes us to international supply chain inflation, particularly ocean freight. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, general inflationary pressures continue to increase the other elements of our cost of goods and operating expenses. 
 Credit Risk 
 We are exposed to concentration of credit risk from our major customers. In the nine months ended September 30, 2024, sales to two customers represented approximately 48 of our consolidated net sales. We have not experienced credit issues with these customers. We maintain provisions for potential credit losses and evaluate the solvency of our customers on an ongoing basis to determine if additional allowances for doubtful accounts and customer credits need to be recorded. Significant economic disruptions or a slowdown in the economy could result in significant additional charges. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Limitations on effectiveness of controls and procedures 
 In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs. 
 Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, evaluated, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Shares of Common Stock may be repurchased under the Program from time to time through open market purchases, block trades, private transactions or accelerated or other structured share repurchase programs. To the extent not retired, shares of Common Stock repurchased under the Program will be placed in the Company's treasury shares. The extent to which the Company repurchases shares of Common Stock and the timing of such repurchases will depend upon a variety of factors, including market conditions, regulatory requirements and other corporate considerations, as determined by the Company. The Program has no time limits, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased 504,246 shares at a cost of 12.0 million under this program.
