 Allowance for Credit Losses 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we did not recognize an allowance for credit loss for any security in the investment portfolio and we did not record any provision for credit loss for investment securities during the three or nine months ended September 30, 2024 or 2023. 
 We evaluated the securities in an unrealized loss position as of September 30, 2024, assessing their credit ratings as well as any adverse conditions specifically related to the security. Based upon our assessment of the amount and timing of cash flows to be collected over the remaining life of each instrument, we believe the unrealized losses as of September 30, 2024 are not indicative of the ultimate collectability of the current amortized cost of the securities. Rather, the unrealized losses on securities held as of September 30, 2024 were primarily driven by fluctuations in interest rates, and to a lesser extent, movements in credit spreads following the purchase of those securities.

 In connection with the 2024 Notes offering, we recorded capitalized debt issuance costs and an original issue discount of million.

 Revolving Credit Facility 
 On April 29, 2024, we entered into a new million unsecured revolving credit facility (the 2024 Revolving Credit Facility) to replace our then outstanding million secured revolving credit facility (the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility). The 2024 Revolving Credit Facility matures on May 21, 2029. Borrowings under the 2024 Revolving Credit Facility may be used for general corporate purposes, including to support growth, new business production and operations, and accrue interest at a variable rate equal to, at our discretion, (i) a Base Rate (as defined in the 2024 Revolving Credit Facility) subject to a floor of per annum plus a margin of to per annum, or (ii) the Adjusted Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) (as defined in the 2024 Revolving Credit Facility) plus a margin of to per annum, with the margin in each of (i) or (ii) based on our applicable corporate credit rating at the time. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, amounts were drawn under the 2024 or 2021 Revolving Credit Facilities, respectively. 
 Under the 2024 Revolving Credit Facility, we are required to pay a quarterly commitment fee on the average daily undrawn amount of to , based on the applicable corporate credit rating at the time. As of September 30, 2024, the applicable commitment fee was . For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded million and million, respectively, of commitment fees in interest expense. 
 We incurred debt issuance costs of million in connection with the 2024 Revolving Credit Facility and had million of unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility remaining at the time of its replacement. Combined unamortized debt issuance costs are amortized through interest expense on a straight-line basis over the contractual life of the 2024 Revolving Credit Facility. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, unamortized deferred debt issuance costs of million and million, respectively, were recorded in Other Assets on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
 Under the 2024 Revolving Credit Facility we are subject to certain covenants, including a maximum debt-to-total capitalization ratio of , a minimum consolidated net worth requirement (as defined therein), and a requirement to maintain compliance with the financial standards prescribed by the PMIERs (subject to any GSE approved waivers). We were in compliance with all covenants at September 30, 2024.

 Excess-of-loss Reinsurance 
 Insurance-Linked Notes 
 NMIC is a party to reinsurance agreements with Oaktown Re V Ltd., Oaktown Re VI Ltd., and Oaktown Re VII Ltd. (special purpose reinsurance entities collectively referred to as the Oaktown Re Vehicles) effective October 29, 2020, April 27, 2021, and October 26, 2021, respectively. Each agreement provides NMIC with aggregate excess-of-loss reinsurance coverage on a defined portfolio of mortgage insurance policies. Under each agreement, NMIC retains a first layer of aggregate loss exposure on covered policies and the respective Oaktown Re Vehicle then provides second layer loss protection up to a defined reinsurance coverage amount. NMIC then retains losses in excess of the respective reinsurance coverage amounts. 
 NMIC makes risk premium payments to the Oaktown Re Vehicles for the applicable outstanding reinsurance coverage amount and pays an additional amount for anticipated operating expenses (capped at thousand per year). NMIC ceded aggregate premiums to the Oaktown Re Vehicles of million and million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and million and million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 NMIC applies claims paid on covered policies against its first layer aggregate retained loss exposure under each excess-of-loss agreement. NMIC did not cede any incurred losses on covered policies to the Oaktown Re Vehicles during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, as the aggregate first layer risk retention for each applicable agreement was not exhausted during such periods. 
 Under the terms of each excess-of-loss reinsurance agreement, the Oaktown Re Vehicles are required to fully collateralize their outstanding reinsurance coverage amount to NMIC with funds deposited into segregated reinsurance trusts. Such trust funds are required to be invested in short-term U.S. Treasury money market funds at all times. Each Oaktown Re Vehicle financed its respective collateral requirement through the issuance of mortgage insurance-linked notes to unaffiliated investors. Such insurance-linked notes mature (in the case of the notes issued by Oaktown Re V Ltd.) and years (in the case of the notes issued by Oaktown Re VI Ltd. and Oaktown Re VII Ltd.) from the inception date of their associated reinsurance agreement. We refer to NMIC s reinsurance agreements with and the insurance-linked note issuances by Oaktown Re Vehicles individually as the 2020-2 ILN Transaction, 2021-1 ILN Transaction, and 2021-2 ILN Transaction, and collectively as the ILN Transactions. 
 The respective reinsurance coverage amounts provided by the Oaktown Re Vehicles decrease (over a period in the case of Oaktown Re V Ltd. and -year period in the case of Oaktown Re VI Ltd. and Oaktown Re VII Ltd.) as the underlying insured mortgages are amortized or repaid, and/or the mortgage insurance coverage is canceled. As the reinsurance coverage decreases, a prescribed amount of collateral held in trust by the Oaktown Re Vehicles is distributed to ILN Transaction noteholders as amortization of the outstanding insurance-linked note principal balances. The outstanding reinsurance coverage amounts stop amortizing, and the distribution of collateral assets to ILN Transaction noteholders and amortization of insurance-

 or less of the reinsurance coverage amount at inception or if NMIC reasonably determines that changes to GSE or rating agency asset requirements would cause a material and adverse effect on the capital treatment afforded to NMIC under a given agreement. In addition, there are certain events that trigger mandatory termination of an agreement, including NMIC's failure to pay premiums or consent to reductions in a trust account to make principal payments to noteholders, among others. 
 Effective July 25, 2024, NMIC exercised its optional call to terminate a reinsurance agreement with and the associated insurance-linked notes issued by Oaktown Re III Ltd. In connection with the termination, NMIC s excess of loss reinsurance agreement with Oaktown Re III Ltd. was commuted and the insurance-linked notes issued by Oaktown Re III Ltd. were redeemed in full with a distribution of remaining collateral assets.

Cash and Cash Equivalents on our condensed consolidated balance sheets includes restricted amounts of million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The restricted balances required under these transactions will decline over time as the outstanding principal balance of the respective insurance-linked notes are amortized. 
 Traditional Reinsurance 
 NMIC is party to excess-of-loss reinsurance agreements with broad panels of third-party reinsurers the 2022-1 XOL Transaction, effective April 1, 2022, the 2022-2 XOL Transaction, effective July 1, 2022, the 2022-3 XOL Transaction, effective October 1, 2022, the 2023-1 XOL Transaction, effective January 1, 2023, the 2023-2 XOL Transaction, effective July 1, 2023, and the 2024 XOL Transaction, effective January 1, 2024 which we refer to collectively as the XOL Transactions. Each XOL Transaction provides NMIC with aggregate excess-of-loss reinsurance coverage on a defined portfolio of mortgage insurance policies. Under each agreement, NMIC retains a first layer of aggregate loss exposure on covered policies and the reinsurers then provide second layer loss protection up to a defined reinsurance coverage amount. The reinsurance coverage amount of each XOL Transaction is set to approximate the PMIERs minimum required assets of its reference pool and decreases from its peak over a period in the event the PMIERs minimum required assets of the pool declines. NMIC retains losses in excess of the outstanding reinsurance coverage amount. 
 Under the terms of the XOL Transactions, NMIC makes risk premium payments to its third-party reinsurance providers for the outstanding reinsurance coverage amount and ceded aggregate premiums of million and million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and million and million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. NMIC applies claims paid on covered policies against its first layer aggregate retained loss exposure under each agreement. NMIC did not cede any incurred losses on covered policies under the XOL Transactions during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, as the aggregate first layer risk retention for each agreement was not exhausted during such periods.

NMIC has the option, based on certain conditions and subject to a termination fee, to terminate the agreement as of December 31, 2024 or semi-annually thereafter, which could result in NMIC recapturing the related risk. 
 Under the terms of the 2022 Seasoned QSR Transaction, NMIC cedes premiums earned related to of the net risk on eligible policies primarily for a seasoned pool of mortgage insurance policies that had previously been covered under the retired Oaktown Re Ltd. and Oaktown Re IV Ltd. reinsurance transactions, after the consideration of coverage provided by other QSR Transactions. The 2022 Seasoned QSR Transaction is scheduled to terminate on June 30, 2032. NMIC has the option, based on certain conditions, to terminate the agreement as of June 30, 2025 or quarterly thereafter through December 31, 2027 with the payment of a termination fee, and as of March 31, 2028 or quarterly thereafter without the payment of a termination fee. Such termination could result in NMIC recapturing the related risk.

 NMIC may terminate any or all of the QSR Transactions without penalty if, due to a change in PMIERs requirements, it is no longer able to take full PMIERs asset credit for the risk-in-force (RIF) ceded under the respective agreements. Additionally, under the terms of the QSR Transactions, NMIC may elect to selectively terminate its engagement with individual reinsurers on a run-off basis i.e. , reinsurers continue providing coverage on all risk ceded prior to the termination date, with no new cessions going forward) or cut-off basis i.e. , the reinsurance arrangement is completely terminated with NMIC recapturing all previously ceded risk) under certain circumstances. Such selective termination rights arise when, among other reasons, a reinsurer experiences a deterioration in its capital position below a prescribed threshold and/or a reinsurer breaches (and fails to cure) its collateral posting obligations under the relevant agreement.

 ceding commission for premiums ceded under the QSR Transactions, except with respect to the 2022 Seasoned QSR Transaction under which it receives a ceding commission and the 2020 QSR Transaction under which it receives a ceding commission. NMIC also receives a profit commission under each of the QSR Transactions, provided that the loss ratios on loans covered under the 2016, 2018, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2022 Seasoned, 2023 and 2024 QSR Transactions, generally remain below , , , , , , and , respectively, as measured annually. Ceded claims and claim expenses under each of the QSR Transactions reduce the respective profit commission received by NMIC on a dollar-for-dollar basis. 
 In accordance with the terms of the 2016 QSR Transaction, rather than making a cash payment or transferring investments for ceded premiums written, NMIC established a funds withheld liability, which also includes amounts due to NMIC for ceding and profit commissions. Any loss recoveries and any potential profit commission to NMIC are realized from this account until exhausted. NMIC s reinsurance recoverable balance is further supported by trust accounts established and maintained by each reinsurer in accordance with the PMIERs funding requirements for risk ceded to non-affiliates. The reinsurance recoverable on loss reserves related to the 2016 QSR Transaction was million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 In accordance with the terms of the 2018, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2022 Seasoned, 2023 and 2024 QSR Transactions, cash payments for ceded premiums earned are settled on a quarterly basis, offset by amounts due to NMIC for ceding and profit commissions. Any loss recoveries and any potential profit commission to NMIC are also recognized quarterly. NMIC's reinsurance recoverable balance is supported by trust accounts established and maintained by each reinsurer in accordance with the PMIERs funding requirements for risk ceded to non-affiliates. The aggregate reinsurance recoverable on loss reserves related to the 2018, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2022 Seasoned, 2023, and 2024 QSR Transactions was million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 We remain directly liable for all claim payments if we are unable to collect the recoverables due from our reinsurers and, as such, we actively monitor and manage our counterparty credit exposure to our reinsurance providers. We establish an allowance for expected credit loss against our reinsurance recoverable if we do not expect to recover amounts due from one or more of our reinsurance counterparties, and report our reinsurance recoverable net of such allowance, if any. We actively monitor the counterparty credit profiles of our reinsurers and each is required to partially collateralize its obligations under the terms of the QSR Transactions. The allowance for credit loss established against our reinsurance recoverable was deemed immaterial as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we paid claims totaling million, including claims covered under the QSR Transactions representing million of ceded claims and claim expenses. 
 We had loans in default in our primary insured portfolio as of September 30, 2024, which represented a default rate against total policies in-force and loans in default in our primary portfolio as of December 31, 2023, which represented a default rate against total policies in-force. The size of the reserve we establish for each defaulted loan (and by extension our aggregate reserve for claims and claim expenses) reflects our best estimate of the future claim payment to be made for each individual loan in default. Our future claims exposure is a function of the number of defaulted loans that progress to claim payment (which we refer to as frequency) and the amount to be paid to settle such claims (which we refer to as severity). Our estimates of claims frequency and severity are not formulaic, rather they are broadly synthesized based on historical observed experience for similarly situated loans and assumptions about future macroeconomic factors.

 The claims incurred section of the table above shows claims and claim expenses incurred on defaults occurring in current and prior years, including IBNR reserves, and is presented net of reinsurance. The amount of claims incurred relating to current year defaults increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to an increase in the total number of new delinquencies emerging during the period tied to the growth and natural seasoning of our portfolio, partially offset by a decrease in the average case reserve established against newly defaulted loans. Our provision for claims and claim expenses during both the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 benefited from favorable development on prior year defaults. We recognized million and million of favorable prior year development during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, primarily due to cure activity and ongoing analysis of recent loss development trends. We may increase or decrease our claim estimates and reserves as we learn additional information about individual defaulted loans, and continue to observe and analyze loss development trends in our portfolio. Gross reserves of million related to prior year defaults remained as of September 30, 2024.

Our provision for income taxes for interim reporting periods is established based on our estimated annual effective tax rate for a given year. Our effective tax rate may fluctuate between interim periods due to the impact of discrete items not included in our estimated annual effective tax rate, including the tax effects associated with the vesting of RSUs and exercise of options. Such items are treated on a discrete basis in the reporting period in which they occur. 
 As a mortgage guaranty insurance company, we are eligible to claim a tax deduction for our statutory contingency reserve balance, subject to certain limitations outlined under IRC Section 832(e), and only to the extent we acquire tax and loss bonds in an amount equal to the tax benefit derived from the claimed deduction, which is our intent. As a result, our interim provision for income taxes for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 primarily represents a change in our net deferred tax liability.

 We separately recognize an allowance for credit losses for premiums receivable based on credit losses expected to arise over the life of the receivable. Due to the nature of our insurance policies (a necessary precondition for access to mortgage credit for covered borrowers) and the short duration of the related receivables, we do not typically experience credit losses against our premium receivables and the allowance for credit loss established on premium receivable was deemed immaterial at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

 The Wisconsin OCI has imposed a prescribed accounting practice for the treatment of statutory contingency reserves that differs from the treatment promulgated by the NAIC. Under Wisconsin OCI's prescribed practice mortgage guaranty insurers are required to reflect changes in their contingency reserves through statutory income. Such approach contrasts with the NAIC's treatment, which records changes to contingency reserves directly to unassigned funds. As a Wisconsin-domiciled insurer, NMIC's statutory net income reflects an expense associated with the change in its contingency reserve. While such treatment impacts NMIC's statutory net income, it does not have an effect on NMIC's statutory capital position.

Under the terms of each agreement, NMIC will retain a first layer of aggregate loss exposure on covered policies and its reinsurance counterparties will then provide second layer loss protection up to a defined reinsurance coverage amount (of million for the 2025 XOL Transaction and million for the 2026 XOL Transaction). NMIC retains losses in excess of the respective reinsurance coverage amounts.

 We provide private MI through our primary insurance subsidiary, NMIC. NMIC is wholly-owned, domiciled in Wisconsin and principally regulated by the Wisconsin OCI. NMIC is approved as an MI provider by the GSEs and is licensed to write coverage in all 50 states and D.C. Our subsidiary, NMIS, provides outsourced loan review services to mortgage loan originators and our subsidiary, Re One, historically provided reinsurance coverage to NMIC in accordance with certain statutory risk retention requirements. Such requirements have been repealed and the reinsurance coverage provided by Re One to NMIC has been commuted. Re One remains a wholly-owned, licensed insurance subsidiary; however, it does not currently have active insurance exposures. 
 MI protects lenders and investors from default-related losses on a portion of the unpaid principal balance of a covered mortgage. MI plays a critical role in the U.S. housing market by mitigating mortgage credit risk and facilitating the secondary market sale of high- loan-to-value (LTV) i.e., above 80 residential loans to the GSEs, who are otherwise restricted by their charters from purchasing or guaranteeing high-LTV mortgages that are not covered by certain credit protections. Such credit protection and secondary market sales allow lenders to increase their capacity for mortgage commitments and expand financing access to existing and prospective homeowners. 
 NMIH, a Delaware corporation, was incorporated in May 2011, and we began start-up operations in 2012 and wrote our first MI policy in 2013. Since formation, we have sought to establish customer relationships with a broad group of mortgage lenders and build a diversified, high-quality insured portfolio. As of September 30, 2024, we had issued master policies with 2,062 customers, including national and regional mortgage banks, money center banks, credit unions, community banks, builder-owned mortgage lenders, internet-sourced lenders and other non-bank lenders. As of September 30, 2024, we had 207.5 billion of primary insurance-in-force (IIF) and 55.3 billion of primary risk-in-force (RIF). 
 We believe that our success in acquiring a large and diverse group of lender customers and growing a portfolio of high-quality IIF traces to our founding principles, whereby we aim to help qualified individuals achieve their homeownership goals, ensure that we remain a strong and credible counter-party, deliver a high-quality customer service experience, establish a differentiated risk management approach that emphasizes the individual underwriting review or validation of the vast majority of the loans we insure, utilizing our proprietary Rate GPS pricing platform to dynamically evaluate risk and price our policies, and foster a culture of collaboration and excellence that helps us attract and retain experienced industry leaders. 
 Our strategy is to continue to build on our position in the private MI market, expand our customer base and grow our insured portfolio of high-quality residential loans by focusing on long-term customer relationships, disciplined and proactive risk selection and pricing, fair and transparent claim payment practices, responsive customer service, and financial strength and profitability. 
 Our common stock trades on the Nasdaq under the symbol NMIH. Our headquarters is located in Emeryville, California. As of September 30, 2024, we had 229 employees. Our corporate website is located at www.nationalmi.com . Our website and the information contained on or accessible through our website are not incorporated by reference into this report. 
 We discuss below our results of operations for the periods presented, as well as the conditions and trends that have impacted or are expected to impact our business, including new insurance writings, the composition of our insurance portfolio and other factors that we expect to impact our results.

Conditions and Trends Affecting Our Business 
 
 Macroeconomic Developments 
 Macroeconomic factors, including persistent inflation, elevated interest rates, flagging consumer confidence and increasing jobless claims could have a pronounced impact on the housing market, the mortgage insurance industry and our business in future periods. A marked decline in housing demand, a significant and protracted decrease in house prices or a sustained increase in unemployment could reduce the pace of new business activity in the private mortgage insurance market and negatively impact our future new insurance written (NIW) volume, or contribute to an increase in our future default and claim experience. 
 
 Key Factors Affecting Our Results 
 
 New Insurance Written, Insurance-In-Force and Risk-In-Force 
 NIW is the aggregate unpaid principal balance of mortgages underpinning new policies written during a given period. Our NIW is affected by the overall size of the mortgage origination market and the volume of high-LTV mortgage originations. Our NIW is also affected by the percentage of such high-LTV originations covered by private versus government MI or other alternative credit enhancement structures and our share of the private MI market. NIW, together with persistency, drives our IIF. IIF is the aggregate unpaid principal balance of the mortgages we insure, as reported to us by servicers at a given date, and represents the sum total of NIW from all prior periods less principal payments on insured mortgages and policy cancellations (including for prepayment, nonpayment of premiums, coverage rescission and claim payments). RIF is related to IIF and represents the aggregate amount of coverage we provide on all outstanding policies at a given date. RIF is calculated as the sum total of the coverage percentage of each individual policy in our portfolio applied to the unpaid principal balance of such insured mortgage. RIF is affected by IIF and the LTV profile of our insured mortgages, with lower LTV loans generally having a lower coverage percentage and higher LTV loans having a higher coverage percentage. Gross RIF represents RIF before consideration of reinsurance. Net RIF is gross RIF net of ceded reinsurance. 
 
 Net Premiums Written and Net Premiums Earned 
 We set our premium rates on individual policies based on the risk characteristics of the underlying mortgage loans and borrowers, and in accordance with our filed rates and applicable rating rules. On June 4, 2018, we introduced a proprietary risk-based pricing platform, which we refer to as Rate GPS . Rate GPS considers a broad range of individual variables, including property type, type of loan product, borrower credit characteristics, and lender and market factors, and provides us with the ability to set and charge premium rates commensurate with the underlying risk of each loan that we insure. We introduced Rate GPS in June 2018 to replace our previous rate card pricing system. While most of our new business is priced through Rate GPS , we also continue to offer a rate card pricing option to a limited number of lender customers who require a rate card for operational reasons. We believe the introduction and utilization of Rate GPS provides us with a more granular and analytical approach to evaluating and pricing risk, and that this approach enhances our ability to continue building a high-quality mortgage insurance portfolio and delivering attractive risk-adjusted returns. 
 Premiums are generally fixed for the duration of our coverage of the underlying loans. Net premiums written are equal to gross premiums written minus ceded premiums written under our reinsurance arrangements, less premium refunds and premium write-offs. As a result, net premiums written are generally influenced by: 
 NIW; 
 premium rates and the mix of premium payment type, which are either single, monthly or annual premiums, as described below; 
 cancellation rates of our insurance policies, which are impacted by payments or prepayments on mortgages, refinancings (which are affected by prevailing mortgage interest rates as compared to interest rates on loans underpinning our in force policies), levels of claim payments and home prices; and 
 cession of premiums under third-party reinsurance arrangements. 
 Premiums are paid either by the borrower (borrower-paid mortgage insurance or BPMI) or the lender (lender-paid mortgage insurance or LPMI) in a single payment at origination (single premium), on a monthly installment basis (monthly premium) or on an annual installment basis (annual premium). Our net premiums written will differ from our net premiums earned due to policy payment type. For single premiums, we receive a single premium payment at origination, which is earned over the estimated life of the policy. Substantially all of our single premium policies in force as of September 30, 2024 were non- 
 28 

refundable under most cancellation scenarios. If non-refundable single premium policies are canceled, we immediately recognize the remaining unearned premium balances as earned premium revenue. Monthly premiums are recognized in the month billed and when the coverage is effective. Annual premiums are earned on a straight-line basis over the year of coverage. Substantially all of our policies provide for either single or monthly premiums. 
 The percentage of IIF that remains on our books after any twelve-month period is defined as our persistency rate. Because our insurance premiums are earned over the life of a policy, higher persistency rates can have a significant impact on our net premiums earned and profitability. Generally, faster speeds of mortgage prepayment lead to lower persistency. Prepayment speeds and the relative mix of business between single and monthly premium policies also impact our profitability. Our premium rates include certain assumptions regarding repayment or prepayment speeds of the mortgages underlying our policies. Because premiums are paid at origination on single premium policies and our single premium policies are generally non-refundable on cancellation, assuming all other factors remain constant, if single premium loans are prepaid earlier than expected, our profitability on these loans is likely to increase and, if loans are repaid slower than expected, our profitability on these loans is likely to decrease. By contrast, if monthly premium loans are repaid earlier than anticipated, we do not earn any more premium with respect to those loans and, unless we replace the repaid monthly premium loan with a new loan at the same premium rate or higher, our revenue is likely to decline. 

Effect of Reinsurance on Our Results 
 We utilize third-party reinsurance to actively manage our risk, ensure compliance with PMIERs, state regulatory and other applicable capital requirements, and support the growth of our business. We currently have both quota share and excess-of-loss reinsurance agreements in place, which impact our results of operations and regulatory capital and PMIERs asset positions. Under a quota share reinsurance agreement, the reinsurer receives a premium in exchange for covering an agreed-upon portion of incurred losses. Such a quota share arrangement reduces premiums written and earned and also reduces RIF, providing capital relief to the ceding insurance company and reducing incurred claims in accordance with the terms of the reinsurance agreement. In addition, reinsurers typically pay ceding commissions as part of quota share transactions, which offset the ceding company's acquisition and underwriting expenses. Certain quota share agreements include profit commissions that are earned based on loss performance and serve to reduce ceded premiums. Under an excess-of-loss agreement, the ceding insurer is typically responsible for losses up to an agreed-upon threshold and the reinsurer then provides coverage in excess of such threshold up to a maximum agreed-upon limit. We expect to continue to evaluate reinsurance opportunities in the normal course of business. 
 Excess-of-Loss Reinsurance 
 Insurance-Linked Notes 
 NMIC is party to reinsurance agreements with the Oaktown Re Vehicles that provide it with aggregate excess-of-loss reinsurance coverage on defined portfolios of mortgage insurance policies. Under each agreement, NMIC retains a first layer of aggregate loss exposure on covered policies and the respective Oaktown Re Vehicle then provides second layer loss protection up to a defined reinsurance coverage amount. NMIC then retains losses in excess of the respective reinsurance coverage amounts. 
 The respective reinsurance coverage amounts provided by the Oaktown Re Vehicles decrease (over a ten-year period in the case of Oaktown Re V Ltd. and 12.5-year period in the case of Oaktown Re VI Ltd. and Oaktown Re VII Ltd.) as the underlying insured mortgages are amortized or repaid, and/or the mortgage insurance coverage is canceled. As the reinsurance coverage decreases, a prescribed amount of collateral held in trust by the Oaktown Re Vehicles is distributed to ILN Transaction noteholders as amortization of the outstanding insurance-linked note principal balances. The outstanding reinsurance coverage amounts stop amortizing, and the distribution of collateral assets to ILN Transaction noteholders and amortization of insurance-linked note principal is suspended if certain credit enhancement or delinquency thresholds, as defined in each agreement, are triggered (each, a Lock-Out Event). 
 NMIC holds optional termination rights under each ILN Transaction, including, among others, an optional call feature which provides NMIC the discretion to terminate the transaction on or after a prescribed date, and a clean-up call if the outstanding reinsurance coverage amount amortizes to 10 or less of the reinsurance coverage amount at inception or if NMIC reasonably determines that changes to GSE or rating agency asset requirements would cause a material and adverse effect on the capital treatment afforded to NMIC under a given agreement. In addition, there are certain events that trigger mandatory termination of an agreement, including NMIC's failure to pay premiums or consent to reductions in a trust account to make principal payments to noteholders, among others. 
 Effective July 25, 2024, NMIC exercised its optional call to terminate a reinsurance agreement with and the associated insurance-linked notes issued by Oaktown Re III Ltd. In connection with the termination, NMIC s excess of loss reinsurance 
 29 

agreement with Oaktown Re III Ltd. was commuted and the insurance-linked notes issued by Oaktown Re III Ltd. were redeemed in full with a distribution of remaining collateral assets.

 Traditional Reinsurance 
 NMIC is party to six excess-of-loss reinsurance agreements with broad panels of third-party reinsurers the 2022-1 XOL Transaction, effective April 1, 2022, the 2022-2 XOL Transaction, effective July 1, 2022, the 2022-3 XOL Transaction, effective October 1, 2022, the 2023-1 XOL Transaction, effective January 1, 2023, the 2023-2 XOL Transaction, effective July 1, 2023, and the 2024 XOL Transaction, effective January 1, 2024 which we refer to collectively as the XOL Transactions. Each XOL Transaction provides NMIC with aggregate excess-of-loss reinsurance coverage on a defined portfolio of mortgage insurance policies. Under each agreement, NMIC retains a first layer of aggregate loss exposure on covered policies and the reinsurers then provide second layer loss protection up to a defined reinsurance coverage amount. The reinsurance coverage amount of each XOL Transaction is set to approximate the PMIERs minimum required assets of its reference pool and decreases from its peak over a ten-year period in the event the PMIERs minimum required assets of the pool declines. NMIC retains losses in excess of the outstanding reinsurance coverage amount. 
 NMIC holds optional termination rights which provide it the discretion to terminate each XOL Transaction on or after a specified date. NMIC may also elect to terminate the XOL Transactions at any point if the outstanding reinsurance coverage amount amortizes to 10 or less of the reinsurance coverage amount provided at inception, or if it determines that it will no longer be able to take full PMIERs asset credit for the coverage. Additionally, under the terms of the treaties, NMIC may selectively terminate its engagement with individual reinsurers under certain circumstances. Such selective termination rights arise when, among other reasons, a reinsurer experiences a deterioration in its capital position below a prescribed threshold, and/or a reinsurer breaches (and fails to cure) its collateral posting obligation. 
 Each of the third-party reinsurance providers that is party to the XOL Transactions has an insurer financial strength rating of A- or better by S P, A.M. Best or both. 
 The following table presents the inception date, covered production period, initial and current reinsurance coverage amount, and initial and current first layer retained aggregate loss under each outstanding XOL Transaction. Current amounts are presented as of September 30, 2024.

 Quota Share Reinsurance 
 NMIC is party to eight quota share reinsurance treaties the 2016 QSR Transaction, effective September 1, 2016 and as modified April 1, 2019, the 2018 QSR Transaction, effective January 1, 2018, the 2020 QSR Transaction, effective April 1, 2020 and as amended January 1, 2024, the 2021 QSR Transaction, effective January 1, 2021, the 2022 QSR Transaction, effective October 1, 2021, the 2022 Seasoned QSR Transaction, effective July 1, 2022, the 2023 QSR Transaction, effective January 1, 2023 and the 2024 QSR Transaction, effective January 1, 2024 which we refer to collectively as the QSR Transactions. Under each of the QSR Transactions, NMIC cedes a proportional share of its risk on eligible policies to panels of third-party reinsurance providers. Each of the third-party reinsurance providers that is party to the QSR Transactions has an insurer financial strength rating of A- or better by S P, A.M. Best or both. 
 Under the terms of the 2016 QSR Transaction, NMIC cedes premiums written related to 20.5 of the risk on eligible primary policies written for all periods through December 31, 2017 in exchange for reimbursement of ceded claims and claim expenses on covered policies, a 20 ceding commission, and a profit commission of up to 60 that varies directly and inversely with ceded claims. NMIC previously ceded 100 of the risk under its pool agreement with Fannie Mae; however, such agreement expired on August 31, 2023 and NMIC no longer cedes pool risk under the 2016 QSR Transaction. 
 Under the terms of the 2018 QSR Transaction, NMIC cedes premiums earned related to 25 of the risk on eligible policies written in 2018 and 20 of the risk on eligible policies written in 2019, in exchange for reimbursement of ceded claims and claim expenses on covered policies, a 20 ceding commission, and a profit commission of up to 61 that varies directly and inversely with ceded claims. 
 Under the terms of the 2020 QSR Transaction, NMIC cedes premiums earned related to 21 of the risk on eligible policies written between April 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020, in exchange for reimbursement of ceded claims and claim expenses on covered po licies, a 36 ceding commission, and a profit commission of up to 50 that varies directly and inversely with ceded claims. 
 Under the terms of the 2021 QSR Transaction, NMIC cedes premiums earned related to 22.5 of the risk on eligible policies written in 2021 (subject to an aggregate risk written limit which was exhausted on October 30, 2021), in exchange for reimbursement of ceded claims and claim expenses on covered policies, a 20 ceding commission, and a profit commission of up to 57.5 that varies directly and inversely with ceded claims. 
 Under the terms of the 2022 QSR Transaction, NMIC cedes premiums earned related to 20 of the risk on eligible policies written between October 30, 2021 and December 31, 2022, in exchange for reimbursement of ceded claims and claim expenses on covered policies, a 20 ceding commission, and a profit commission of up to 62 that varies directly and inversely with ceded claims. 
 Under the terms of the 2022 Seasoned QSR Transaction, NMIC cedes premiums earned related to 95 of the net risk on eligible policies primarily for a seasoned pool of mortgage insurance policies that had previously been covered under the retired Oaktown Re Ltd. and Oaktown Re IV Ltd. reinsurance transactions, after the consideration of coverage provided by other QSR Transactions, in exchange for reimbursement of ceded claims and claim expenses on covered policies, a 35 ceding commission, and a profit commission of up to 55 that varies directly and inversely with ceded claims. 
 Under the terms of the 2023 QSR Transaction, NMIC cedes premiums earned related to 20 of the risk on eligible policies written in 2023, in exchange for reimbursement of ceded claims and claim expenses on covered policies, a 20 ceding commission, and a profit commission of up to 62 that varies directly and inversely with ceded claims. 
 Under the terms of the 2024 QSR Transaction, NMIC cedes premiums earned related to 20 of the risk on eligible policies written in 2024, in exchange for reimbursement of ceded claims and claim expenses on covered policies, a 20 ceding commission, and a profit commission of up to 56 that varies directly and inversely with ceded claims. 
 NMIC may terminate any or all of the QSR Transactions without penalty if, due to a change in PMIERs requirements, it is no longer able to take full PMIERs asset credit for the RIF ceded under the respective agreements. Additionally, under the 
 31 

terms of the QSR Transactions, NMIC may elect to selectively terminate its engagement with individual reinsurers on a run-off basis i.e. , reinsurers continue providing coverage on all risk ceded prior to the termination date, with no new cessions going forward) or cut-off basis i.e. , the reinsurance arrangement is completely terminated with NMIC recapturing all previously ceded risk) under certain circumstances. Such selective termination rights arise when, among other reasons, a reinsurer experiences a deterioration in its capital position below a prescribed threshold and/or a reinsurer breaches (and fails to cure) its collateral posting obligations under the relevant agreement. 
 See Item 1, Financial Statements - Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 5, Reinsurance for further discussion of these third-party reinsurance arrangements.

 NIW for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 12.2 billion and 34.1 billion, respectively, compared to 11.3 billion and 31.5 billion for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. NIW increased year-on-year primarily due to growth in our customer franchise and market presence tied to the increased penetration of existing customer accounts and new customer activations. 
 
 Primary IIF increased 7 at September 30, 2024 compared to September 30, 2023, primarily due to the NIW generated between such measurement dates, partially offset by the run-off of in-force policies. Our persistency rate was 85.5 at September 30, 2024 and 86.2 at September 30, 2023. Our persistency rate remains historically high due to a continued slowdown in the pace of mortgage refinancing activity tied to the prevailing interest and mortgage rate environment.

 We consider a book to be a collective pool of policies insured during a particular period, normally a calendar year. In general, the majority of underwriting profit, calculated as earned premium revenue minus claims and underwriting and operating expenses, generated by a particular book year emerges in the years immediately following origination. This pattern generally occurs because relatively few of the claims that a book will ultimately experience typically occur in the first few years following origination, when premium revenue is highest, while subsequent years are affected by declining premium revenues, as the number of insured loans decreases (primarily due to loan prepayments), and by increasing losses.

 We utilize certain risk principles that form the basis of how we underwrite and originate NIW. We have established prudential underwriting standards and loan-level eligibility matrices which prescribe the maximum LTV, minimum borrower FICO score, maximum borrower debt-to-income (DTI) ratio, maximum loan size, property type, loan type, loan term and occupancy status of loans that we will insure and memorialized these standards and eligibility matrices in our Underwriting Guideline Manual that is publicly available on our website. Our underwriting standards and eligibility criteria are designed to limit the layering of risk in a single insurance policy. Layered risk refers to the accumulation of borrower, loan and property risk. For example, we have higher credit score and lower maximum allowed LTV requirements for investor-owned properties, compared to owner-occupied properties. We monitor the concentrations of various risk attributes in our insurance portfolio, which may change over time, in part, as a result of regional conditions or public policy shifts. 
 The tables below present our primary NIW by FICO, LTV and purchase/refinance mix for the periods indicated. We calculate the LTV of a loan as the percentage of the original loan amount to the original purchase value of the property securing the loan.

Insurance Claims and Claim Expenses 
 Insurance claims and claim expenses incurred represent estimated future payments on newly defaulted insured loans and any change in our claim estimates for previously existing defaults. Claims incurred are generally affected by a variety of factors, including the macroeconomic environment, national and regional unemployment trends, changes in housing values, borrower risk characteristics, LTV ratios and other loan level risk attributes, the size and type of loans insured, the percentage of coverage on insured loans, and the level of reinsurance coverage maintained against insured exposures. 
 Reserves for claims and claim expenses are established for mortgage loans that are in default. A loan is considered to be in default as of the payment date at which a borrower has missed the preceding two or more consecutive monthly payments. We establish reserves for loans that have been reported to us in default by servicers, referred to as case reserves, and additional loans that we estimate (based on actuarial review and other factors) to be in default that have not yet been reported to us by servicers, referred to as IBNR. We also establish reserves for claim expenses, which represent the estimated cost of the claim administration process, including legal and other fees and other general expenses of administering the claim settlement process. Reserves are not established for future claims on insured loans which are not currently reported or which we estimate are not currently in default. 
 Reserves are established by estimating the number of loans in default that will result in a claim payment, which is referred to as claim frequency, and the amount of the claim payment expected to be paid on each such loan in default, which is referred to as claim severity. Claim frequency and severity estimates are established based on historical observed experience regarding certain loan factors, such as age of the default, cure rates, size of the loan and estimated change in property value. Reserves are released the month in which a loan in default is brought current by the borrower, which is referred to as a cure. Adjustments to reserve estimates are reflected in the period in which the adjustment is made. Reserves are also ceded to reinsurers under the QSR Transactions, ILN Transactions and XOL Transactions as applicable under each treaty. We have not yet ceded reserves under any of the ILN Transactions or XOL Transactions as incurred claims and claim expenses on each respective reference pool remain within our retained coverage layer for each transaction. 
 Our reserve setting process considers the beneficial impact of forbearance, foreclosure moratorium and other assistance programs that may be made available to certain defaulted borrowers. The effectiveness of forbearance and other such assistance programs can be further enhanced by the availability of various repayment and loan modification options which typically allow borrowers to amortize or, in certain instances, outright defer payments otherwise missed during a period of dislocation over an extended length of time. We generally observe that forbearance, repayment and modification, and other assistance programs are an effective tool to bridge dislocated borrowers from a time of acute stress to a future date when they can resume timely payment of their mortgage obligations, and note higher cure rates on defaults benefitting from broad-based assistance programs than would otherwise be expected on similarly situated loans that did not benefit from such programs. 
 In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, politicians, regulators, lenders, loan servicers and others offered extraordinary assistance to dislocated borrowers through, among other programs, the forbearance, foreclosure moratorium and other assistance programs codified under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act). The FHFA and GSEs offered further assistance by introducing new repayment and loan modification options to assist borrowers with their transition out of forbearance programs and default status. 
 The actual claims we incur as our portfolio matures are difficult to predict and depend on the specific characteristics of our current in-force book (including the credit score and DTI ratio of the borrower, the LTV ratio of the mortgage and geographic concentrations, among others), as well as the risk profile of new business we write in the future. In addition, claims experience will be affected by macroeconomic factors such as housing prices, interest rates, unemployment rates and other events, such as natural disasters or global pandemics, and any federal, state or local governmental response thereto. 
 Macroeconomic factors, including persistent inflation, elevated interest rates, flagging consumer confidence and increasing jobless claims could have a pronounced impact on the housing market, the mortgage insurance industry and our business in future periods. A marked decline in housing demand, a significant and protracted decrease in house prices, or a sustained increase in unemployment could contribute to an increase in our future default and claims experience.

 (1) Related to ceded losses recoverable under the QSR Transactions. See Item 1, Financial Statements - Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 5, Reinsurance for additional information. 
 (2) Related to insured loans with their most recent defaults occurring in the current year. For example, if a loan defaulted in a prior year and subsequently cured and later re-defaulted in the current year, the default would be included in the current year. Amounts are presented net of reinsurance and included 63.2 million attributed to net case reserves and 7.0 million attributed to net IBNR reserves for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 54.4 million attributed to net case reserves and 5.8 million attributed to net IBNR reserves for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 (3) Related to insured loans with defaults occurring in prior years, which have been continuously in default before the start of the current year. Amounts are presented net of reinsurance and included 49.8 million attributed to net case reserves and 6.3 million attributed to net IBNR reserves for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 41.1 million attributed to net case reserves and 4.5 million attributed to net IBNR reserves for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 
 The claims incurred section of the table above shows claims and claim expenses incurred on defaults occurring in current and prior years, including IBNR reserves and is presented net of reinsurance. We may increase or decrease our claim estimates and reserves as we learn additional information about individual defaulted loans and continue to observe and analyze loss development trends in our portfolio. Gross reserves of 45.1 million related to prior year defaults remained as of September 30, 2024.

The following table provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending count of loans in default: 
 For the three months ended September 30, For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Beginning default inventory 4,904 4,349 5,099 4,449 Plus: new defaults 2,411 1,744 6,015 4,719 Less: cures (1,529) (1,434) (5,215) (4,434) Less: claims paid (67) (62) (168) (129) Less: rescission and claims denied (7) (3) (19) (11) Ending default inventory 5,712 4,594 5,712 4,594 
 Ending default inventory increased from September 30, 2023 to September 30, 2024, primarily due to the growth and seasoning of our insured portfolio, partially offset by cure activity within our default population during the intervening period. 
 The following table provides details of our claims paid, before giving effect to claims ceded under the QSR Transactions for the periods indicated: 
 For the three months ended September 30, For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Values In Thousands) Number of claims paid (1) 
 67 62 168 129 Total amount paid for claims 2,692 1,402 5,714 3,132 Average amount paid per claim 
 40 23 34 24 Severity (2) 
 64 46 58 51 
 (1) Count includes 21 and 56 claims settled without payment during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and 23 and 47 claims settled without payment during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 (2) Severity represents the total amount of claims paid including claim expenses divided by the related RIF on the loan at the time the claim is perfected, and is calculated including claims settled without payment. 
 
 We paid 67 and 168 claims during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and 62 and 129 claims during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The number of claims paid in each period was modest relative to the size of our insured portfolio and we generally observe that the borrowers of the loans we insure are well-situated with strong credit profiles, stable 30-year fixed rate mortgages, manageable debt service obligations and significant appreciated equity in their homes. An increase in the value of the homes collateralizing the mortgages we insure provides defaulted borrowers with alternative paths and incentives to cure their loan prior to the development of a claim. 
 Our claims severity was 64 and 58 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 46 and 51 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Our claims severity for each period was below long-term industry norms and benefited from the same broad national house price appreciation that supported our claims paid experience. An increase in the value of the homes collateralizing the mortgages we insure provides additional equity support to our risk exposure and raises the prospect of a third-party sale of a foreclosed property, which can mitigate the severity of our settled claims. 
 The number of claims paid and our severity experience in future periods may be impacted if developing economic cycles impose financial strain on borrowers, and each could increase if house price declines serve to limit the alternative paths and incentives to cure delinquencies that are available to defaulted borrowers or erode the equity value of the homes collateralizing the mortgages we insure.

The following table provides detail on our average reserve per default, before giving effect to reserves ceded under the QSR Transactions, as of the dates indicated: 
 Average reserve per default: As of September 30, 2024 2023 (In Thousands) Case (1) 
 21.8 23.4 IBNR (1)(2) 
 1.9 1.9 Total 23.7 25.3 
 (1) Defined as the gross reserve per insured loan in default. 
 (2) Amount includes claims adjustment expenses. 
 Average reserve per default decreased from September 30, 2023 to September 30, 2024, primarily due to changes in observed and forecasted housing market conditions and macroeconomic factors, as well as changes in the composition of our default inventory as measured by the size, vintage and current estimated LTV of defaulted loans between the measurement dates. 
 
 GSE Oversight 
 As an approved insurer , NMIC is subject to ongoing compliance with the PMIERs established by each of the GSEs italicized terms have the same meaning that such terms have in the PMIERs, as described below). The PMIERs establish operational, business, remedial and financial requirements applicable to approved insurers . The PMIERs financial requirements prescribe a risk-based methodology whereby the amount of assets required to be held against each insured loan is determined based on certain loan-level risk characteristics, such as FICO, vintage (year of origination), performing vs. non-performing i.e., current vs. delinquent), LTV ratio and other risk features. In general, higher quality loans carry lower asset charges. 
 Under the PMIERs, approved insurers must maintain available assets that equal or exceed minimum required assets , which is an amount equal to the greater of (i) 400 million or (ii) a total risk-based required asset amount. The risk-based required asset amount is a function of the risk profile of an approved insurer's RIF, assessed on a loan-by-loan basis and considered against certain risk-based factors derived from tables set out in the PMIERs, which is then adjusted on an aggregate basis for reinsurance transactions approved by the GSEs, such as with respect to our ILN Transactions, XOL Transactions and QSR Transactions. The aggregate gross risk-based required asset amount for performing, primary insurance is subject to a floor of 5.6 of performing primary adjusted RIF . 
 By April 15th of each year, NMIC must certify it met all PMIERs requirements as of December 31st of the prior year. We certified to the GSEs by April 15, 2024 that NMIC was in full compliance with the PMIERs as of December 31, 2023. NMIC also has an ongoing obligation to immediately notify the GSEs in writing upon discovery of a failure to meet one or more of the PMIERs requirements. We continuously monitor NMIC's compliance with the PMIERs. 
 The following table provides a comparison of the PMIERs available assets and net risk-based required asset amount as reported by NMIC as of the dates indicated: 
 As of September 30, 2024 2023 (In Thousands) Available assets 3,006,892 2,602,680 Net risk-based required assets 
 1,735,790 1,414,233 
 Available assets were 3.0 billion at September 30, 2024, compared to 2.6 billion at September 30, 2023. The 404 million increase in available assets between the dates presented was primarily driven by NMIC's positive cash flow from operations during the intervening period, partially offset by the payment of an ordinary course dividend from NMIC to NMIH in May 2024. 
 Net risk-based required assets were 1.7 billion at September 30, 2024, compared to 1.4 billion at September 30, 2023. The 322 million increase in the risk-based required asset amount between the dates presented was primarily due to the growth in our gross RIF and aggregate gross risk-based required asset amount. 
 40 

On August 21, 2024, the GSEs and FHFA updated PMIERs to revise the Available Asset credit mortgage insurers will receive for certain assets based on several factors, including asset class and credit rating. The updated PMIERs will take effect on a phased basis beginning March 31, 2025 and will be fully implemented on September 30, 2026. We do not expect the updated PMIERs to have a material impact on our available assets and risk-based required assets, and we expect to remain in full compliance with the existing and updated PMIERs, as applicable, prior to, on and after March 31, 2025.

 Revenues 
 Net premiums earned were 143.3 million and 421.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 130.1 million and 377.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The year-on-year increase in net premiums earned in each respective period was primarily driven by growth in our monthly IIF and monthly pay premium receipts, as well as a decline in the total premiums ceded under our reinsurance treaties. 
 41 

Net investment income was 22.5 million and 62.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 17.9 million and 49.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The year-on-year increase in net investment income in each respective period was primarily driven by an increase in the book yield of our investment portfolio tied to the deployment of new cash flows and reinvestment of rolling maturities at incrementally higher rates, as well as growth in the size of our total invested asset base. 
 Other revenues were 0.3 million and 0.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 0.2 million and 0.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Other revenues represent underwriting fee revenue generated by our subsidiary, NMIS, which provides outsourced loan review services to mortgage loan originators. Changes in other revenues primarily reflect changes in NMIS' outsourced loan review volume. Amounts recognized in other revenues generally correspond with amounts incurred as service expenses for outsourced loan review activities in the same periods. 
 Expenses 
 We recognize insurance claims and claim expenses in connection with the loss experience of our insured portfolio and incur other underwriting and operating expenses, including employee compensation and benefits, policy acquisition costs, and technology, professional services and facilities expenses, in connection with the development and operation of our business. We also incur service expenses in connection with NMIS' outsourced loan review activities. 
 Insurance claims and claim expenses were 10.3 million and 14.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 4.8 million and 14.4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The increase in insurance claims and claim expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by the establishment of initial reserves on newly defaulted loans, as well as an increase in the average case reserve held against previously defaulted loans that have aged in their delinquency status, and was partially offset by the release of a portion of the reserves we established for anticipated claims payments in prior periods in connection with cure activity and ongoing analysis of recent loss development trends. 
 Underwriting and operating expenses were 29.2 million and 87.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 27.7 million and 81.0 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The increase in underwriting and operating expenses in each respective period primarily reflects an increase in employee compensation costs and an adjustment to the pace of amortization of certain deferred policy acquisition costs, partially offset by an increase in ceding commissions received under our QSR Transactions and a decline in certain technology expenses. 
 Service expenses were 0.2 million and 0.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 0.2 million and 0.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Service expenses represent third-party costs incurred by NMIS in connection with the services it provides. Changes in service expenses primarily reflect changes in NMIS' outsourced loan review volume. Amounts incurred as service expenses generally correspond with amounts recognized in other revenues in the same periods. 
 Interest expense was 7.1 million and 29.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 8.1 million and 24.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2024 reflects the lower interest rate achieved on the 2024 Notes as compared to the 2020 Notes they refinanced. Interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 includes 7.0 million of non-recurring costs related to the refinancing of the 2020 Notes and 2021 Revolving Credit Facility. See Item 1, Financial Statements - Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 4, Debt. 
 Income tax expense was 26.5 million and 78.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 23.3 million and 68.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The increase in income tax expense in each respective period was primarily driven by growth in our pre-tax income. Our effective tax rate on pre-tax income was 22.2 and 22.3 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 21.8 and 22.4 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. As a U.S. taxpayer, we are subject to a statutory U.S. federal corporate income tax rate of 21 . Our provision for income taxes for interim periods is established based on our estimated annual effective tax rate for a given year and reflects the impact of discrete tax effects in the period in which they occur. Our effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 reflect the discrete tax effects of the vesting of RSUs and exercise of options. See Item 1, Financial Statements - Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 8, Income Taxes.

Net Income 
 Net income was 92.8 million and 273.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 84.0 million and 238.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Adjusted net income was 92.8 million and 279.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 84.0 million and 238.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Net income and adjusted net income increased in each respective period primarily due to growth in our total revenues, partially offset by increases in our income tax expense and underwriting and operating expenses. Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 includes non-recurring costs incurred in connection with the refinancing of the 2020 Notes and 2021 Revolving Credit Facility; such amounts are excluded from the calculation of adjusted net income. 
 Diluted EPS was 1.15 and 3.36 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 1.00 and 2.83 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Adjusted diluted EPS was 1.15 and 3.43 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 1.00 and 2.83 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. Diluted and adjusted diluted EPS increased in each respective period primarily due to growth in our net income and adjusted net income, as well as a decline in the number of weighted average diluted shares outstanding tied to share repurchase activity. 
 The non-GAAP financial measures of adjusted income before tax, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS are presented to enhance the comparability of financial results between periods.

 Explanation and Reconciliation of Our Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 We believe the use of the non-GAAP measures of adjusted income before tax, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS enhances the comparability of our fundamental financial performance between periods, and provides relevant information to investors. These non-GAAP financial measures align with the way the company's business performance is evaluated by management. These measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be viewed as alternatives to GAAP measures of performance. These measures have been presented to increase transparency and enhance the comparability of our fundamental operating trends across periods. Other companies may calculate these measures differently; their measures may not be comparable to those we calculate and present. 
 Adjusted income before tax is defined as GAAP income before tax, excluding the pre-tax effects of net realized gains or losses from our investment portfolio, periodic costs incurred in connection with capital markets transactions, and other infrequent, unusual or non-operating items in the periods in which such items are incurred. 
 43 

Adjusted net income is defined as GAAP net income, excluding the after-tax effects of net realized gains or losses from our investment portfolio, periodic costs incurred in connection with capital markets transactions, and other infrequent, unusual or non-operating items in the periods in which such items are incurred. Adjustments to components of pre-tax income are tax effected using the applicable federal statutory tax rate for the respective periods. 
 Adjusted diluted EPS is defined as adjusted net income divided by adjusted weighted average diluted shares outstanding. Adjusted weighted average diluted shares outstanding is defined as weighted average diluted shares outstanding, adjusted for changes in the dilutive effect of non-vested shares that would otherwise have occurred had GAAP net income been calculated in accordance with adjusted net income. There will be no adjustment to weighted average diluted shares outstanding in the years that non-vested shares are anti-dilutive under GAAP. 
 Although adjusted income before tax, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted EPS exclude certain items that have occurred in the past and are expected to occur in the future, the excluded items: (1) are not viewed as part of the operating performance of our primary activities; or (2) are impacted by market, economic or regulatory factors and are not necessarily indicative of operating trends, or both. These adjustments, and the reasons for their treatment, are described below. 
 Net realized investment gains and losses . The recognition of the net realized investment gains or losses can vary significantly across periods as the timing is highly discretionary and is influenced by factors such as market opportunities, tax and capital profile, and overall market cycles that do not reflect our current period operating results. 
 Capital markets transaction costs . Capital markets transaction costs result from activities that are undertaken to improve our debt profile or enhance our capital position through activities such as debt refinancing and capital markets reinsurance transactions that may vary in their size and timing due to factors such as market opportunities, tax and capital profile, and overall market cycles. 
 Other infrequent, unusual or non-operating items . Items that are the result of unforeseen or uncommon events, and are not expected to recur with frequency in the future. Identification and exclusion of these items provides clarity about the impact special or rare occurrences may have on our current financial performance. Past adjustments under this category include infrequent, unusual or non-operating adjustments related to severance, restricted stock modification and other expenses incurred in connection with the CEO transition announced in September 2021 and the effects of the release of the valuation allowance recorded against our net federal and certain state net deferred tax assets in 2016 and the re-measurement of our net deferred tax assets in connection with tax reform in 2017. We believe such items are infrequent or non-recurring in nature, and are not indicative of the performance of, or ongoing trends in, our primary operating activities or business.

Consolidated balance sheets September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 (In Thousands) Total investment portfolio 2,708,286 2,371,021 Cash and cash equivalents 133,319 96,689 Premiums receivable 78,454 76,456 Deferred policy acquisition costs, net 63,803 62,905 Software and equipment, net 27,251 30,252 Reinsurance recoverable 29,214 27,514 Prepaid federal income taxes 235,286 235,286 Other assets 44,512 40,384 Total assets 3,320,125 2,940,507 Debt 414,694 397,595 Unearned premiums 71,592 92,295 Accounts payable and accrued expenses 110,968 86,189 Reserve for insurance claims and claim expenses 135,520 123,974 Deferred tax liability, net 380,879 301,573 Other liabilities (1)

 (1) Reinsurance funds withheld has been reclassified as Other liabilities in the prior period. 
 Total cash and investments were 2.8 billion as of September 30, 2024, compared to 2.5 billion as of December 31, 2023. Cash and investments at September 30, 2024 included 148.3 million held by NMIH. The increase in total cash and investments reflects the addition of incremental cash provided by operating activities and a decrease in the unrealized loss position of our fixed income portfolio primarily tied to changes in interest rates, partially offset by share repurchase activity during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Premiums receivable was 78.5 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to 76.5 million as of December 31, 2023. Premiums receivable represents premiums due on our mortgage insurance policies and may fluctuate based on changes in our monthly premium policies in force, where premiums are generally paid one month in arrears, and the pace of settlement of previously outstanding receivables. 
 Net deferred policy acquisition costs were 63.8 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to 62.9 million as of December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by the deferral of certain costs associated with the origination of new policies between the respective balance sheet dates, and was partially offset by the recognition of previously deferred policy acquisition costs. 
 Reinsurance recoverable was 29.2 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to 27.5 million as of December 31, 2023. The increase was driven by an increase in ceded losses recoverable under our QSR Transactions. 
 Prepaid federal income taxes were 235.3 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Prepaid federal income taxes represent tax and loss bonds purchased in connection with our claimed tax deduction for our statutory contingency reserve position. See Item 1, Financial Statements - Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 8, Income Taxes. 
 Other assets were 44.5 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to 40.4 million as of December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in accrued investment income and prepaid expenses, as well as the capitalization of deferred debt issuance costs incurred in connection with the establishment of the 2024 Revolving Credit Facility, partially offset by a reduction in our right-of-use assets tied to the amortization of the operating lease for our corporate headquarters. 
 Debt was 414.7 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to 397.6 million as of December 31, 2023. Debt as of September 30, 2024 represented the carrying value of the 425 million aggregate principal amount 2024 Notes which issued in May 2024. Debt at December 31, 2023 represented the carrying value of the 400 million aggregate principal amount 2020 Notes, 
 45 

which were redeemed in full upon the completion of the 2024 Notes offering. For more information see Item 1, Financial Statements - Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 4, Debt. 
 Unearned premiums were 71.6 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to 92.3 million as of December 31, 2023. The decrease was driven by the amortization of existing unearned premiums through earnings in accordance with the expiration of risk on related single premium policies and the cancellations of other single premium policies, partially offset by single premium policy originations during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Accounts payable and accrued expenses were 111.0 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to 86.2 million as of December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in unsettled trade payables related to the purchase of certain investment securities at September 30, 2024, as well as accrued and unpaid interest on the 2024 Notes, which is payable semi-annually beginning in February 2025, and was partially offset by the settlement of certain contractual payables and accrued expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Reserve for insurance claims and claim expenses was 135.5 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to 124.0 million as of December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by the establishment of initial reserves on newly defaulted loans during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as well as an increase in the average case reserve held against previously defaulted loans that aged in their delinquent status. The increase in the reserves for insurance claims and claim expenses was partially offset by the release of a portion of the reserves we established for anticipated claims payments in prior periods (in connection with cure activity and ongoing analysis of recent loss development trends), as well as the payment of previously reserved claims during the period. See Insurance Claims and Claim Expenses , above for further details. 
 Net deferred tax liability was 380.9 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to 301.6 million as of December 31, 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in the claimed deductibility of our statutory contingency reserve, as well as the decrease in unrealized losses recorded in other comprehensive income. For further information regarding income taxes and their impact on our results of operations and financial position, see Item 1, Financial Statements - Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 8, Income Taxes . 
 The following table summarizes our consolidated cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities: 
 Consolidated cash flows For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net cash provided by (used in): (In Thousands) Operating activities 357,783 312,566 Investing activities (253,156) (117,908) Financing activities (67,997) (62,621) Net increase in cash and cash equivalents 
 36,630 132,037 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 357.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 312.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Cash provided by operating activities increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to an increase in our net premium receipts, growth in our investment income and a reduction in technology service costs paid under our long-term IT services agreement with Tata Consultancy Services, partially offset by an increase in taxes paid, short-term employee incentive payments and net claim settlement costs. 
 Cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 reflects the purchase of fixed and short-term maturities with cash provided by operating activities, and the reinvestment of coupon payments, maturities and sale proceeds within our investment portfolio. 
 Cash used in financing activities was 68.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 62.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Cash used in financing activities primarily relates to the repurchase of common stock and taxes paid on the net share settlement of equity awards for certain employees. Cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 further reflects the net impact of the redemption of the 2020 Notes and issuance of the 2024 Notes during the period.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 NMIH serves as the holding company for our insurance subsidiaries and does not have any significant operations of its own. NMIH's principal liquidity demands include funds for (i) payment of certain corporate expenses; (ii) payment of certain reimbursable expenses of its insurance subsidiaries; (iii) payment of the interest related to the 2024 Notes and 2024 Revolving Credit Facility; (iv) tax payments to the Internal Revenue Service; (v) capital support for its subsidiaries; (vi) repurchase of its common stock; and (vii) payment of dividends, if any, on its common stock. NMIH is not subject to any limitations on its ability to pay dividends except those generally applicable to corporations that are incorporated in Delaware. Delaware law provides that dividends are only payable out of a corporation's surplus or recent net profits (subject to certain limitations). 
 As of September 30, 2024, NMIH had 148.3 million of cash and investments. NMIH's principal sources of net cash are dividends from its subsidiaries and investment income. NMIC paid a 96.3 million ordinary course dividend to NMIH on May 30, 2024, representing its full ordinary course dividend capacity payable under Wisconsin insurance laws for the twelve-month period ending December 31, 2024. NMIH also has access to 250 million of undrawn revolving credit capacity under the 2024 Revolving Credit Facility. 
 On February 10, 2022, our Board of Directors authorized a 125 million share repurchase program (excluding associated costs and applicable taxes) effective through December 31, 2023. On July 31, 2023, our Board of Directors authorized a new 200 million share repurchase program (excluding associated costs and applicable taxes) effective through December 31, 2025. Concurrent with the new authorization, our Board of Directors also approved an extension of our existing 125 million share repurchase program through December 31, 2025 to align its remaining tenor with that of the new 200 million program. The authorization provides NMIH the flexibility, based on market and business conditions, stock price and other factors, to repurchase stock from time to time through open market repurchases, privately negotiated transactions, or other means, including pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 trading plans. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, NMIH repurchased 2.1 million shares of common stock at a total cost of 69.4 million, including associated costs and applicable taxes. As of September 30, 2024, NMIH had 108.1 million of repurchase authority remaining. 
 On May 21, 2024, NMIH completed the 425 million sale of the 2024 Notes, raising net proceeds of 414.1 million after giving effect to offering expenses and an initial underwriting discount. Net proceeds from the offering were primarily used to effect the redemption of the 400 million aggregate principal amount 2020 Notes. In June 2024, NMIH contributed remaining net proceeds of the offering to NMIC. For more information, see Item 1, Financial Statements - Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 4, Debt. 
 NMIH has entered into tax and expense-sharing agreements with its subsidiaries which have been approved by the Wisconsin OCI, with such approvals subject to change or revocation at any time. Among such agreements, the Wisconsin OCI has approved the allocation of interest expense on the 2024 Notes and 2024 Revolving Credit Facility to NMIC, to the extent proceeds from such offering and facility are contributed to NMIC or used to repay, redeem or otherwise defease amounts raised by NMIC under prior credit arrangements that have previously been distributed to NMIC. 
 The 2024 Notes mature on August 15, 2029 and bear interest at a rate of 6.00 , payable semi-annually on February 15 and August 15. The 2024 Revolving Credit Facility matures on May 21, 2029, and accrues interest at a variable rate equal to, at our discretion, (i) a Base Rate (as defined in the 2024 Revolving Credit Facility, subject to a floor of 1.00 per annum) plus a margin of 0.375 to 1.875 per annum, or (ii) the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate (as defined in the 2024 Revolving Credit Facility) plus a margin of 1.375 to 2.875 per annum, with the margin in each of (i) or (ii) based on our applicable corporate credit rating at the time. Borrowings under the 2024 Revolving Credit Facility may be used for general corporate purposes, including to support the growth of our new business production and operations. 
 Under the 2024 Revolving Credit Facility, NMIH is required to pay a quarterly commitment fee on the average daily undrawn amount of 0.175 to 0.525 , based on the applicable corporate credit rating at the time. As of September 30, 2024, the applicable commitment fee was 0.225 . 
 We are subject to certain covenants under the 2024 Revolving Credit Facility, including: a maximum debt-to-total capitalization ratio of 35 , a minimum consolidated net worth requirement (as defined therein), and a requirement to maintain compliance with the financial standards prescribed by the PMIERs (subject to any GSE approved waivers). We were in compliance with all covenants at September 30, 2024. 
 NMIC and Re One are subject to certain capital and dividend rules and regulations prescribed by jurisdictions in which they are authorized to operate and by the GSEs. Under Wisconsin insurance laws, NMIC and Re One may pay dividends up to 
 47 

specified levels i.e., ordinary dividends) with 30 days' prior notice to the Wisconsin OCI. Dividends in larger amounts, or extraordinary dividends, are subject to the Wisconsin OCI's prior approval. Under Wisconsin insurance laws, an extraordinary dividend is defined as any payment or distribution that, together with other dividends and distributions made within the preceding twelve months, exceeds the lesser of (i) 10 of the insurer's statutory policyholders' surplus as of the preceding December 31 or (ii) adjusted statutory net income for the twelve-month period ending the preceding December 31 . On May 30, 2024, NMIC paid a 96.3 million ordinary course dividend to NMIH, representing its full ordinary course dividend capacity payable under Wisconsin insurance laws for the twelve-month period ending December 31, 2024. 
 As an approved insurer under PMIERs, NMIC would generally be subject to additional restrictions on its ability to pay dividends to NMIH if it failed to meet the financial requirements prescribed by PMIERs. Approved insurers that fail to meet the prescribed PMIERs financial requirements are not permitted to pay dividends without prior approval from the GSEs. 
 NMIH may require liquidity to fund the capital needs of its insurance subsidiaries. NMIC's capital needs depend on many factors including its ability to successfully write new business, establish premium rates at levels sufficient to cover claims and operating costs, access the reinsurance markets and meet minimum required asset thresholds under the PMIERs and minimum state capital requirements (respectively, as defined therein). 
 As an approved mortgage insurer and Wisconsin-domiciled carrier, NMIC is required to satisfy financial and/or capitalization requirements stipulated by each of the GSEs and the Wisconsin OCI. The financial requirements stipulated by the GSEs are outlined in the PMIERs. Under the PMIERs, NMIC must maintain available assets that are equal to or exceed a minimum risk-based required asset amount, subject to a minimum floor of 400 million. 
 The risk-based required asset amount under PMIERs is determined at an individual policy-level based on the risk characteristics of each insured loan. Loans with higher risk factors, such as higher LTVs or lower borrower FICO scores, are assessed a higher charge. Non-performing loans that have missed two or more payments are generally assessed a significantly higher charge than performing loans, regardless of the underlying borrower or loan risk profile; however, special consideration is given under PMIERs to loans that are delinquent on homes located in an area declared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency to be a Major Disaster zone eligible for Individual Assistance. 
 NMIC's PMIERs minimum risk-based required asset amount is also adjusted for its reinsurance transactions (as approved by the GSEs). Under NMIC's quota share reinsurance treaties, it receives credit for the PMIERs risk-based required asset amount on ceded RIF. As its gross PMIERs risk-based required asset amount on ceded RIF increases, the PMIERs credit for ceded RIF automatically increases as well (in an unlimited amount). Under NMIC's ILN and XOL Transactions, it generally receives credit for the PMIERs risk-based required asset amount on ceded RIF to the extent such requirement is within the subordinated coverage (excess of loss detachment threshold) afforded by the transaction. 
 On August 21, 2024, the GSEs and FHFA updated PMIERs to revise the Available Asset credit mortgage insurers will receive for certain assets based on several factors, including asset class and credit rating. The updated PMIERs will take effect on a phased basis beginning March 31, 2025 and will be fully implemented on September 30, 2026. We do not expect the updated PMIERs to have a material impact on our available assets and risk-based required assets , and we expect to remain in full compliance with the existing and updated PMIERs, as applicable, prior to, on and after March 31, 2025. 
 NMIC is also subject to state regulatory minimum capital requirements based on its RIF. Formulations of this minimum capital vary by state, however, the most common measure allows for a maximum ratio of RIF to statutory capital (commonly referred to as RTC) of 25:1. The RTC calculation does not assess a different charge or impose a different threshold RTC limit based on the underlying risk characteristics of the insured portfolio. Non-performing loans are treated the same as performing loans under the RTC framework. As such, the PMIERs generally imposes a stricter financial requirement than the state RTC standard. 
 As of September 30, 2024, NMIC had a RTC ratio of 12.6:1 with 35.0 billion of performing primary RIF, net of reinsurance, and 2.8 billion of total statutory capital, including contingency reserves. Re One has no risk in force remaining and no longer reports a RTC ratio. 
 NMIC's principal sources of liquidity include (i) premium receipts on its insured portfolio and new business production, (ii) interest income on its investment portfolio and principal repayments on maturities therein, and (iii) existing cash and cash equivalent holdings. At September 30, 2024, NMIC had 2.7 billion of cash and investments, including 92.8 million of cash and cash equivalents. NMIC's principal liquidity demands include funds for the payment of (i) reimbursable holding company expenses, (ii) premiums ceded under our reinsurance transactions (iii) claims payments, and (iv) taxes as due or otherwise deferred through the purchase of tax and loss bonds. NMIC's cash inflow is generally significantly in excess of its cash outflow in any given period. During the twelve-month period ended September 30, 2024, NMIC generated 370 million of cash flow from 
 48 

operations and received an additional 214 million of cash flow on the maturity and redemption of securities held in its investment portfolio. NMIC is not a party to any contracts (derivative or otherwise) that require it to post an increasing amount of collateral to any counterparty and NMIC's principal liquidity demands (other than claims payments) generally develop along a scheduled path i.e. , are of a contractually predetermined amount and due at a contractually predetermined date). NMIC's only use of cash with the potential to develop along an unscheduled path is claims payments. Given the relatively small size of our current population of defaulted policies, the generally extended duration of the default-to-foreclosure-to-claim cycle, and the potential availability of forbearance, foreclosure moratorium and other borrower assistance programs (which serve to further extend the default-to-foreclosure-to-claim cycle timeline), we do not expect NMIC to use a meaningful amount of cash to settle claims in the near-term. 
 
 Debt and Financial Strength Ratings 
 NMIC's financial strength is rated A- by Fitch Ratings (Fitch) and A3 by Moody's. In October 2024, S P upgraded NMIC's financial strength rating from BBB+ to A- . NMIH's 2024 Notes are rated BBB- by Fitch and Baa3 by Moody's. The outlook for all ratings provided by Fitch, Moody's and S P is stable. 
 
 Consolidated Investment Portfolio 
 The primary objectives of our investment activity are to generate investment income and preserve capital, while maintaining sufficient liquidity to cover our operating needs. We aim to achieve diversification by type, quality, maturity, and industry. We have adopted an investment policy that defines, among other things, eligible and ineligible investments; concentration limits for asset types, industry sectors, single issuers, and certain credit ratings; and benchmarks for asset duration. 
 Our investment portfolio is comprised entirely of fixed maturity instruments. As of September 30, 2024, the fair value of our investment portfolio was 2.7 billion and we held an additional 133.3 million of cash and cash equivalents. Pre-tax book yield on the investment portfolio for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 3.0 . Book yield is calculated as period-to-date net investment income divided by the average amortized cost of the investment portfolio. The yield on our investment portfolio is likely to change over time based on movements in interest rates, credit spreads, the duration or mix of our holdings and other factors. 
 The following tables present a breakdown of our investment portfolio and cash and cash equivalents by investment type and credit rating:

Investment Securities - Allowance for credit losses 
 We did not recognize an allowance for credit loss for any security in the investment portfolio as of September 30, 2024 or December 31, 2023, and we did not record any provision for credit loss for investment securities during the three or nine month periods ended September 30, 2024 or 2023. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the investment portfolio had gross unrealized losses of 128.0 million, of which 127.5 million were associated with securities that had been in an unrealized loss position for a period of twelve months or longer. As of December 31, 2023, the investment portfolio had gross unrealized losses of 184.3 million, of which 183.1 million were associated with securities that had been in an unrealized loss position for a period of twelve months or longer. 
 We evaluated the securities in an unrealized loss position as of September 30, 2024, assessing their credit ratings as well as any adverse conditions specifically related to the security. Based upon our assessment of the amount and timing of cash flows to be collected over the remaining life of each instrument, we believe the unrealized losses as of September 30, 2024 are not indicative of the ultimate collectability of the current amortized cost of the securities. Rather, the unrealized losses on securities held as of September 30, 2024 were primarily driven by fluctuations in interest rates, and to a lesser extent, movements in credit spreads following the purchase of those securities. 
 
 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 We use accounting principles and methods that conform to GAAP. We are required to apply significant judgment and make material estimates in the preparation of our financial statements and with regard to various accounting, reporting and disclosure matters. Assumptions and estimates are required to apply these principles where actual measurement is not possible or practical. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 We believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with revenue recognition, our investment portfolio, deferred policy acquisition costs, premium deficiency reserves, and reserves for insurance claims and claim expenses have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting estimates. There have not been any material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates as compared to the critical accounting policies and estimates described in our 2023 10-K.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 We own and manage a large investment portfolio of various holdings, types and maturities. NMIH's principal source of operating cash is investment income. The assets within the investment portfolio are exposed to the same factors that affect overall financial market performance. 
 We manage market risk via a defined investment policy implemented by our treasury function with oversight from our Board's Risk Committee. Important drivers of our market risk exposure monitored and managed by us include but are not limited to: 
 Changes to the level of interest rates . Increasing interest rates may reduce the value of certain fixed-rate bonds held in the investment portfolio. Higher rates may cause variable rate assets to generate additional income. Decreasing rates will have the reverse impact. Significant changes in interest rates can also affect persistency and claim rates of our insurance portfolio, and as a result we may determine that our investment portfolio needs to be restructured to better align it with future liabilities and claim payments. Such restructuring may cause investments to be liquidated when market conditions are adverse. Additionally, the changes in SOFR based interest rates affect the interest expense related to the Company's debt. 
 Changes to the term structure of interest rates . Rising or falling rates typically change by different amounts along the yield curve. These changes may have unforeseen impacts on the value of certain assets. 
 Market volatility/changes in the real or perceived credit quality of investments . Deterioration in the quality of investments, identified through changes to our own or third-party e.g. , rating agency or investment advisors) assessments, will reduce the value and potentially the liquidity of investments. 
 Concentration risk . If the investment portfolio is highly concentrated in one asset, or in multiple assets whose values are highly correlated, the value of the total portfolio may be greatly affected by the change in value of just one asset or a group of highly correlated assets. 
 Prepayment risk . Bonds may have call provisions that permit debtors to repay prior to maturity when it is to their advantage. This typically occurs when rates fall below the interest rate of the debt. 
 The carrying value of our investment portfolio as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was 2.7 billion and 2.4 billion, respectively, of which 100 was invested in fixed maturity securities. The primary market risk to our investment portfolio is interest rate risk associated with investments in fixed maturity securities. We mitigate the market risk associated with our fixed maturity securities portfolio by matching the duration of our fixed maturity securities with the expected duration of the liabilities that those securities are intended to support. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the duration of our fixed income portfolio, including cash and cash equivalents, was 3.73 years, which means that an instantaneous parallel shift (movement up or down) in the yield curve of 100 basis points would result in a change of 3.73 in fair value of our fixed income portfolio. Excluding cash, our fixed income portfolio duration was 3.76 years, which means that an instantaneous parallel shift (movement up or down) in the yield curve of 100 basis points would result in a change of 3.76 in fair value of our fixed income portfolio. 
 We are also subject to market risk related to the 2024 Revolving Credit Facility and the ILN Transactions. As discussed in Item 1, Financial Statements - Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 4, Debt the 2024 Revolving Credit Facility bears interest at a variable rate and, as a result, increases in market interest rates would generally result in increased interest expense on any outstanding drawn balance. 
 The risk premium amounts under the ILN Transactions are calculated by multiplying the outstanding reinsurance coverage amount at the beginning of any payment period by a coupon rate, which is the sum of one-month SOFR, as applicable, and a risk margin, and then subtracting actual investment income earned on the trust balance during that payment period. An increase in one-month SOFR, as applicable, would generally increase the risk premium payments, while an increase to money market rates, which directly affect investment income earned on the trust balance, would generally decrease them. Although we expect the two rates to move in tandem, to the extent they do not, it could increase or decrease the risk premium payments that otherwise would be due. 
 51 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2024, pursuant to Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Management applied its judgment in assessing the costs and benefits of such controls and procedures, which by their nature, can provide only reasonable assurance regarding management's control objectives. Management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent or detect all errors and fraud. A control system, irrespective of how well it is designed and operated, can only provide reasonable assurance and cannot guarantee that it will succeed in its stated objectives. 
 Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. 
 Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 52 

PART II 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 Certain lawsuits and claims arising in the ordinary course of business may be filed or pending against us or our affiliates from time to time. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, we establish accruals for all lawsuits, claims and expected settlements when we believe it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. When a loss contingency is not both probable and estimable, we do not establish an accrual. Any such loss estimates are inherently uncertain, based on currently available information and are subject to management's judgment and various assumptions. Due to the inherent subjectivity of these estimates and unpredictability of outcomes of legal proceedings, any amounts accrued may not represent the ultimate resolution of such matters. 
 To the extent we believe any potential loss relating to such lawsuits and claims may have a material impact on our liquidity, consolidated financial position, results of operations, and/or our business as a whole and is reasonably possible but not probable, we will disclose information relating to any such potential loss, whether in excess of any established accruals or where there is no established accrual. We will also disclose information relating to any material potential loss that is probable but not reasonably estimable. Where reasonably practicable, we will provide an estimate of loss or range of potential loss. No disclosures are generally made for any loss contingencies that are deemed to be remote. 
 As we have previously disclosed, we were named as a defendant in one litigation case that involves refunds of mortgage insurance premiums under the Homeowners Protection Act. In September 2023, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia granted our motion to dismiss the case. Subsequently, the plaintiff filed a notice of appeal in October 2023, appealing the District Court s decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. The appeal is currently pending. Based upon information available to us and our review of lawsuits and claims filed or pending against us to date, we have not recognized a material accrual liability for these matters, nor do we currently expect it is reasonably possible that these matters will result in a material liability to the Company. However, the outcome of litigation and other legal and regulatory matters is inherently uncertain, and it is possible that one or more of such matters currently pending or threatened could have an unanticipated material adverse effect on our liquidity, consolidated financial position, results of operations, and/or our business as a whole, in the future. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 Risk factors that affect our business and financial results are discussed in Part I, Item 1A of our 2023 10-K. As of the date of this report, we are not aware of any material changes in our risk factors from the risk factors disclosed in our 2023 10-K. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described herein and in our 2023 10-K, which have the potential to affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects in a material and adverse manner. The risks described herein and in our 2023 10-K are not the only risks we face, as there are additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial which may in the future adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results.
