The decrease in gross profit for Domestic Pipe is primarily driven by unfavorable pricing and material cost, partially offset by favorable manufacturing costs. The increase in gross profit for Infiltrator was driven by favorable pricing and improved material cost. 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses 
 Six Months Ended September 30, (Amounts in thousands) 2024 2023 Selling, general and administrative expenses 188,184 178,236 of Net sales 11.8 11.4 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses for six months ended September 30, 2024 increased 9.9 million from the same period in fiscal 2024 and as a percentage of net sales, increased by 0.4 . This increase is primarily due to higher commissions from the increase in volume, as well as continued investments in talent to support strategic areas such as engineering and product development. 
 Loss (gain) on disposal of assets and costs from exit and disposal activities - The gain on disposal in fiscal 2024 was due to the sale of Spartan Concrete, Inc. 
 Interest expense - Interest expense increased 2.3 million in the six months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. The increase was primarily due to increased interest rates. 
 Interest income and other, net - Interest income and other, net increased by 3.0 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year primarily due to increased cash. 
 Income tax expense - The following table presents the effective tax rates for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 Six Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Effective tax rate 23.8 25.0 
 The change in the effective tax rate for the six months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily related to the decrease in state and local income taxes and the increase of the discrete income tax benefit related to the stock-based compensation windfall. See Note 9. Income Taxes for additional information. 
 
 A djusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin - Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin, which are non-GAAP financial measures, have been presented in this Form 10-Q as supplemental measures of financial performance that are not required by, or presented in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to net income as measures of financial performance or cash flows from operations or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP. We calculate Adjusted EBITDA as net income before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, non-cash charges and certain other expenses. We calculate Adjusted EBITDA Margin as Adjusted EBITDA divided by net sales. 
 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are included in this Form 10-Q because they are key metrics used by management and our board of directors to assess our consolidated financial performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry. In addition to covenant compliance and executive performance evaluations, we use these non-GAAP financial measures to supplement GAAP measures of performance to evaluate the effectiveness of our consolidated business strategies, to make budgeting decisions and to compare our performance against that of other peer companies using similar measures. We use Adjusted EBITDA Margin to evaluate our ability to generate profitable sales. 
 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin contain certain other limitations, including the failure to reflect our cash expenditures, cash requirements for working capital needs, cash expenditures to replace assets being depreciated and amortized and interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest on principal payments on our indebtedness. In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin, you should be aware that in the future we will incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation, such as stock-based compensation expense, derivative fair value adjustments, and foreign currency transaction losses. Management compensates for these limitations by relying on our GAAP results and using non-GAAP measures on a supplemental basis.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Historically, we have funded our operations through internally generated cash flow supplemented by debt financings, equity issuance and finance and operating leases. These sources have been sufficient historically to fund our primary liquidity requirements, including working capital, capital expenditures, debt service and dividend payments for our common stock. From time to time, we may explore additional financing methods and other means to raise capital. There can be no assurance that any additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. 
 Free Cash Flow - Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that comprises cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and is used by management and our Board of Directors to assess our ability to generate cash. Accordingly, free cash flow has been presented as a supplemental measure of liquidity that is not required by, or presented in accordance with GAAP, because management believes that free cash flow provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our ability to generate cash flow from operations after capital expenditures. Free cash flow is not a GAAP measure of our liquidity and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of liquidity or any other liquidity measure derived in accordance with GAAP. Our measure of free cash flow is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to different methods of calculation. 
 The following table presents a reconciliation of free cash flow to cash provided by operating activities, the most comparable GAAP measure, for each of the periods presented: 
 Six Months Ended September 30, (Amounts in thousands) 2024 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 350,326 458,864 Capital expenditures (112,182) (82,625) Free Cash Flow 238,144 376,239

 (Amounts in thousands) September 30, 2024 Total debt (debt and finance lease obligations) 1,382,753 Cash 613,020 Net debt (total debt less cash) 769,733 Leverage Ratio 0.8 
 The following table summarizes our available liquidity for the period presented: 
 (Amounts in thousands) September 30, 2024 Revolver capacity 600,000 Less: outstanding borrowings Less: letters of credit (10,450) Revolver available liquidity 589,550 
 In addition to the available liquidity above, we have the ability to borrow up to 1.3 billion under our Senior Secured Credit Facility, subject to leverage ratio restrictions. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 23.5 million in cash that was held by our foreign subsidiaries, including 14.7 million held by our Canadian subsidiaries. We continue to evaluate our strategy regarding foreign cash, but our earnings in foreign subsidiaries still remain indefinitely reinvested, except for Canada. We plan to repatriate earnings from Canada and believe that there will be no additional tax costs associated with the repatriation of such earnings other than any potential non-U.S. withholding taxes. 
 Working Capital and Cash Flows 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had 1,202.6 million in liquidity, including 613.0 million of cash and 589.6 million in borrowings available under our Revolving Credit Agreement, net of outstanding letters of credit. We believe that our cash on hand, together with the availability of borrowings under our Credit Agreement and other financing arrangements and cash generated from operations, will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements, anticipated capital expenditures, and scheduled principal and interest payments on our indebtedness for at least the next twelve months. 
 Working Capital - Working capital increased to 1,024.6 million as of September 30, 2024, from 860.3 million as of March 31, 2024. The increase in working capital is primarily due to an increase in cash, accounts receivable and inventory due to seasonality offset by changes in accounts payable due to the timing of payments. 
 Six Months Ended September 30, (Amounts in thousands) 2024 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 350,326 458,864 Net cash used in investing activities (111,542) (62,200) Net cash used in financing activities (114,640) (143,386) 
 Operating Cash Flows - Cash flows from operating activities decreased 108.5 million during the six months ended September 30, 2024 primarily driven by investment in inventory. 
 Investing Cash Flows - Cash flows used in investing activities during the six months ended September 30, 2024 increased by 49.3 million compared to the same period in fiscal 2024. The increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to increased capital expenditures in fiscal 2025 and the sale of Spartan Concrete in fiscal 2024. 
 Capital expenditures totaled 112.2 million and 82.6 million for the six months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our capital expenditures for the six months ended September 30, 2024 were used primarily to support facility expansions, equipment replacements and technology improvement initiatives. We also acquired 48.5 million of property, plant and equipment under finance leases, which includes transportation equipment to update our fleet of trucks and trailers. 
 We currently anticipate that we will make capital expenditures of approximately 250 million in fiscal year 2025, including approximately 120 million of open orders as of September 30, 2024. Such capital expenditures are expected to be financed using funds generated by operations.

 Financing Cash Flows - During the six months ended September 30, 2024, cash used in financing activities included the repurchase of common stock of 69.9 million, 24.9 million of dividend payments, 11.8 million of payments of finance lease obligations and 10.6 million for shares withheld for tax purposes. 
 During the six months ended September 30, 2023, cash used in financing activities included the repurchase of common stock of 101.6 million, 22.2 million of dividend payments, and 8.8 million for shares withheld for tax purposes. 
 Financing Transactions - There have been no changes in our debt disclosures from those disclosed in Liquidity and Capital Resources in our Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K. We are in compliance with our debt covenants as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 Excluding the guarantees of 50 of certain debt of our unconsolidated South American Joint Venture as further discussed in Note 6. Related Party Transactions to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, we do not have any other off-balance sheet arrangements. As of September 30, 2024, our South American Joint Venture had no outstanding debt subject to our guarantees. We do not believe that this guarantee will have a current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources. 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 There have been no changes in critical accounting policies from those disclosed in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K, except as disclosed in Note 1. Background and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
 We are subject to various market risks, primarily related to changes in interest rates, credit, raw material supply prices and, to a lesser extent, foreign currency exchange rates. Our financial position, results of operations or cash flows may be negatively impacted in the event of adverse movements in the respective market rates or prices in each of these risk categories. Our exposure in each category is limited to those risks that arise in the normal course of business, as we do not engage in speculative, non-operating transactions. Our exposure to market risk has not materially changed from what we previously disclosed in Part II. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk of our Fiscal 2024 Form 10-K except as disclosed below. 
 Interest Rate Risk - We are subject to interest rate risk associated with our bank debt. A 1.0 increase in interest rates on our variable-rate debt would increase our annual forecasted interest expense by approximately 4.1 million based on our borrowings as of September 30, 2024. Assuming the Revolving Credit Facility is fully drawn, each 1.0 increase or decrease in the applicable interest rate would change our interest expense by approximately 10.1 million, for the twelve months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures - The Company s Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO are responsible for evaluating the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ), rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e). The Company s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed in the Company s reports under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Company s CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
 Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, our CEO and CFO concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting - There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, internal control over financial reporting.
