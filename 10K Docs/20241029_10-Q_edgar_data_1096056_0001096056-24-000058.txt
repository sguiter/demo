 identified business units, which aggregate into reportable segments within continuing operations, and within discontinued operations. Luxfer Gas Cylinders forms the Gas Cylinders segment, and Luxfer MEL Technologies and Luxfer Magtech aggregate into the Elektron segment. As of December 31, 2023, it was determined that the Luxfer Graphic Arts reporting segment no longer met the criteria, specifically, similar economic characteristics, to be aggregated within the Elektron segment for 2023. As a result, Luxfer Graphic Arts has been disaggregated from the Elektron segment and is being reported separately as the Graphic Arts segment. The Elektron segment's results for 2023 have been adjusted to exclude Graphic Arts' results. Our Superform business unit used to aggregate into the Gas Cylinders segment but is now recognized within discontinued operations. A summary of the operations of the segments within continuing operations is provided below: 
 Gas Cylinders segment 
 Our Gas Cylinders segment manufactures and markets specialized highly-engineered cylinders, using composites and aluminum alloys, including pressurized cylinders for use in various applications including self-contained breathing apparatus ('SCBA') for firefighters, containment of oxygen and other medical gases for healthcare, alternative fuel ('AF') vehicles, and general industrial applications. 
 Elektron segment Our Elektron segment focuses on specialty materials based primarily on magnesium and zirconium, with key product lines including advanced lightweight magnesium alloys with a variety of uses across a variety of industries; magnesium powders for use in countermeasure flares, as well as heater meals; and high-performance zirconium-based materials and oxides used as catalysts and in the manufacture of advances ceramics, fiber-optic fuel cells, and many other performance products. 
 Graphic Arts segment 
 Our Graphic Arts segment provides a full range of pre-sensitized magnesium, copper and zinc plates, along with associated chemicals, for the production of foil-stamping and embossing dies. In addition, non-sensitized polished brass and magnesium plates are also manufactured for computer numerical control ('CNC') engraving. The segment also advises on turnkey engraving operations, complete with etching machines, computer-to-plate ('CtP') machines, exposure units and film setters. 
 Other 
 Other, as used below, primarily represents unallocated corporate expense and includes non-service related defined benefit pension credit / charge. 
 Management monitors the operating results of its reportable segments separately for the purpose of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment. Segment performance is evaluated by the chief operating decision maker, the CEO, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, using adjusted EBITA (1) and adjusted EBITDA, which is defined as segment income, and is based on operating income adjusted for share-based compensation charges; restructuring charges; loss on disposal of property, plant and equipment; gain on disposal of held for sale assets; acquisitions and disposals costs; and depreciation and amortization. 
 Unallocated assets and liabilities include those which are held on behalf of the Company and cannot be allocated to a segment, such as taxation, investments, cash, retirement benefits obligations, bank and other loans and holding company assets and liabilities.

 Contingencies 
 In November 2018, an alleged explosion occurred at a third-party waste disposal and treatment site in Grand View, Idaho, reportedly causing property damage, personal injury, and fatality. The Company had contracted with a service company for removal and disposal of certain waste resulting from the magnesium powder manufacturing operations at the Reade facility in Manchester, New Jersey. The Company believes this service company, in turn, contracted with the third-party disposal company, at whose facility the explosion occurred, for treatment and disposal of the waste. In November 2020, we were named as a defendant in lawsuits in relation to the incident by the third-party disposal company, by the estate of the decedent, and by an injured employee of the third-party disposal company. The lawsuits were administratively consolidated and, to date, lawsuits remain ongoing. The Company believes that we are not liable for the incident, have asserted such, and, in conjunction with our insurers, continue to fully defend the Company against these lawsuits. Therefore, we do not currently expect any eventual outcome in these matters to have a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations.

 Key trends and uncertainties regarding our existing business 
 Uncertainty of demand in certain end-markets 
 Macro-economic conditions have continued to impact our general industrial end-market with demand softening for our products across all segments. We have also experienced variability of demand for certain products in our defense, first response healthcare end-market, particularly defense applications, including countermeasure flares and flameless ration heaters, although we have seen the former improve in the third quarter. We have been able to navigate these challenges through productivity and cost management initiatives resulting in improved margins. Legal recoveries and inventory management contributed to solid cash conversion and reduced net debt levels. 
 While the outlook remains uncertain there are some signs of recovery within the industrial and defense end-markets within our Elektron segment, which we are well-placed to capitalize on. 
 Operating objectives and trends 
 In 2024, we expect the following operating objectives and trends to impact our business: 
 Addressing continuing general macro uncertainty and building resilience into the outlook; 
 Ongoing focus on cost control, new product launches and productivity improvements across the business, driving margin improvement; 
 Execution of actions identified upon completion of the previously announced expanded and accelerated strategic review, including the divestiture of Graphic Arts; 
 Execution of selected capital investment projects, especially those related to clean energy, to support our strategy of profitable growth while maintaining our infrastructure; 
 Continued emphasis on operating cash generation and maintaining strong working capital performance; 
 Further improvements in ESG standing through focus on sustainability and on our values of teamworking and accountability; and 
 Focus on recruiting, developing and maintaining talent, including our new leadership development programs, while driving a high-performance culture.

Net sales 
 Adjusting for a foreign exchange tailwind of 1.8 million and 2.2 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, respectively, net sales have increased by 0.2 and decreased 7.4 respectively. 
 Revenue for the quarter was positively impacted by: 
 Elevated sales of magnesium powders, especially those used in military applications, including countermeasure flares; 
 Increased sales of MRE and chemical response kits in our Magtech division; 
 Strong sales of magnesium alloys, particularly those used in aerospace and automotive applications; and 
 Improved sales of both medical and industrial gas cylinders. 
 These increases were partially offset by: 
 Significant decrease in demand for zirconium products, particularly those used in auto-catalyst products, as well as those used by our industrial end-markets; and 
 Lower sales for our AF cylinders, off the back of strong comparative performance, coupled with weaker demand for our SCBA cylinders. 
 Further to the above, the first nine months of the year were also affected by; 
 Strong demand for SCBA cylinders in the first half of the year; and 
 Offset by significant reductions in chemical response kit and magnesium powders' sales in the first six months of the year. 
 Gross profit 
 The 7.5 and 2.4 percentage point increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 from 2023 was primarily the result of contract renegotiation and manufacturing efficiencies having a positive impact on margins within the Gas Cylinders and Elektron Divisions respectively. This has been partially offset by adverse volume and mix. 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses ("SG A") 
 SG A costs as a percentage of sales in 2024 from 2023 has increased by 0.1 percentage points and 0.3 percentage points in the quarter and first nine months respectively. This is primarily the result of movement in variable management compensation in 2024 compared to 2023. SG A costs in 2023 included 2.2 million and 4.5 million, respectively, in legal fees which did not re-occur in 2024, these predominantly related to the case described in Note 16 - Commitments and Contingencies. 
 Research and development costs 
 Research and development costs as a percentage of sales reduced by 0.2 percentage points in the third quarter although remained flat for first nine months of 2024 respectively. The slight reduction in the third quarter is a result of timing of research and development spend. 
 Restructuring charges 
 The 0.5 million and 2.3 million restructuring charge in the third quarter and first nine months respectively of 2024 predominantly relates to the execution of cost savings initiatives affecting our North American Gas Cylinders business. This amounted to 0.4 million and 1.4 million in the third quarter and first nine months of the year respectively. There was a further 0.1 million and 0.7 million in the third quarter and first nine months of the year primarily relating to site clean-up costs associated with the closure of Luxfer Gas Cylinders France, which ceased operations in 2019. Additionally, there were clean-up costs of 0.2 million in the first nine months of the year within our Elektron Division relating to the consolidation of production facilities in the Magnesium Powders operations. 
 The 1.6 million and 4.4 million restructuring charge in the third quarter and first nine months of 2023 relates predominantly to asset impairments in relation to rationalization of our North American Gas Cylinders businesses to reduce our fixed cost base. This amounted to 0.3 million in the third quarter and 2.6 million in the first nine months of the year respectively. There was an additional 0.9 million and 1.3 million of other expenses in the third quarter and first nine months of the year in relation to the aforementioned rationalization. 
 25 

Acquisition and disposal related costs 
 Acquisition and disposal related costs of 0.1 million and 9.5 million in the third quarter and first nine months respectively of 2024 were incurred in relation to the divestiture of our Graphic Arts segment. 7.5 million represents a loss on held-for-sale asset group, recognized in the first half of 2024 and 0.1 million and 2.0 million respectively, represents professional fees. No acquisition and disposal related costs were incurred during 2023. 
 Other Income 
 Other Income of 1.9 million and 7.2 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 relate to the recovery of legal costs from our insurer related to the previously disclosed US Ecology case. 
 Gain on Disposal of assets held for sale 
 The 6.1 million gain on disposal recognized in the third quarter and first nine months respectively of 2024 were in relation to the sale of previously disclosed held-for-sale land and buildings in our Elektron division. Net consideration of 7.3 million was received in the fourth quarter of 2024. 
 Net Interest Expense 
 Net interest expense of 1.4 million in the Third Quarter of 2024 decreased 12.5 from 1.6 million in the Third Quarter of 2023, due to a decrease in drawings and average lower interest rates. Interest expense of 4.1 million in the first nine months of 2024 was also lower than the 4.7 million in the first nine months of 2023. 
 Defined benefit pension credit 
 There was a defined benefit credit of 0.3 million and 0.8 million in the third quarter and first nine months respectively for the U.K. plan, consistent with 2023. 2023 was also impacted by the sale of the U.S. pension plan liability to an insurer, which included 2.3 million cash and 6.9 million in relation to the derecognition of the U.S. pension liability and reallocation of accumulated actuarial losses from other comprehensive income. In the second quarter of 2023, we received a 0.2 million contribution refund, resulting in a net cash outflow of 2.1 million and a half year charge of 9.0 million. 
 Provision for income taxes 
 The movement in the year to date statutory effective tax rate from negative 39.3 in 2023, to positive 34.2 in 2024, was primarily due to non-deductible expenses and deferred tax credit, predominantly in relation to the previously mentioned pension buy-out and impairment charges. When stripping out the impact of this, as well as other less significant adjusting items, the adjusted effective tax rate has increased to 23.4 in 2024 from 21.9 in 2023, largely as a result of the statutory tax rate increase in the U.K. from 19 to 25 , which came into effect in April 2023.

RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES TO GAAP MEASURES 
 The following tables of non-GAAP summary financial data presents a reconciliation of net income from continuing operations and diluted earnings per ordinary share from continuing operations to adjusted net income from continuing operations, adjusted EBITA from continuing operations, adjusted income from continuing operations before income taxes, adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations, adjusted earnings per ordinary share from continuing operations, adjusted provision for income taxes and adjusted effective tax rate from continuing operations, for the periods presented, being the most comparable GAAP measures. Management believes that adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted EBITA and adjusted EBITDA are key performance indicators ("KPIs") used by the investment community and that such presentation will enhance an investor s understanding of the Company's operational results. In addition, Luxfer's CEO and other senior management use these KPIs, among others, to evaluate business performance. However, investors should not consider adjusted net income from continuing operations, adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations, adjusted EBITA from continuing operations and adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations in isolation as an alternative to net income and earnings per share when evaluating Luxfer's operating performance or measuring Luxfer's profitability. In 2024, the Company initiated a process to divest the Graphic Arts business. While Graphic Arts does not meet the 'strategic shift' criteria outlined in ASC 205-20 for it to be classified as a discontinued operation, we believe that given the expectation that divestiture will be completed in the current year, it is appropriate in the the tables below to separate out the results of Graphic Arts in order to provide a more complete financial summary for the period.

SEGMENT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 The summary that follows provides a discussion of the results of operations of each of our three reportable segments (Gas Cylinders, Elektron and Graphic Arts). The three segments comprise various product offerings that serve multiple end-markets. 
 During 2023, the Graphic Arts reporting segment has been disaggregated from the Elektron segment and is being reported separately as the Graphic Arts segment. The Elektron segment's results for 2023 has been adjusted to strip out Graphic Arts' results. 
 Adjusted EBITDA represents operating income adjusted for share based compensation charges; restructuring charges; acquisition and disposal related gains and costs; depreciation and amortization. A reconciliation to net income and taxes can be found in Note 15 to the condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 
 GAS CYLINDERS 
 The net sales and adjusted EBITDA for Gas Cylinders were as follows: 
 Third Quarter / point change Year-to-date / point change In millions 2024 2023 2024 v 2023 2024 2023 2024 v 2023 Net sales 42.6 44.7 (4.7) 137.8 134.7 2.3 Adjusted EBITDA 4.6 2.8 64.3 13.6 10.2 33.3 of net sales 10.8 6.3 4.5 9.9 7.6 2.3 
 Net sales 
 The 4.7 decrease in Gas Cylinders sales in the third quarter of 2024 from 2023 was primarily the result of reduced sales of SCBA and alternative fuel cylinders, these reductions have been partially offset by increases in cylinders sold to our medical and industrial end markets. 
 The 2.3 increase in sales for the first nine months of the year was primarily the benefit from renegotiated contracts, which previously constrained inflationary cost pass through in the first six months of 2023. These increases have been partially offset by reduced sales of aluminum cylinders used in our general industrial end market. 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 The 4.5 and 2.3 percentage point increase in adjusted EBITDA for Gas Cylinders as a percentage of net sales in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 relative to 2023 is predominantly the result of pricing improvements from new sales contracts partially offset by adverse sales mix and volume.

ELEKTRON 
 The net sales and adjusted EBITDA for Elektron were as follows: 
 Third Quarter / point change Year-to-date / point change In millions 2024 2023 2024 v 2023 2024 2023 2024 v 2023 Net sales 48.8 45.6 7.0 128.5 151.0 (14.9) Adjusted EBITDA 10.8 6.0 80.0 29.6 25.0 18.4 of net sales 22.1 13.2 8.9 23.0 16.6 6.4 
 Net sales 
 The 7.0 increase in Elektron sales in the third quarter of 2024 from 2023 was primarily the result of: 
 Elevated sales of magnesium powders, especially those used in military applications, including countermeasure flares; 
 Increased sales of MRE and chemical response kits in our Magtech division; and 
 Strong sales of magnesium alloys, particularly those used in aerospace and automotive applications. 
 These increases were partially offset by a decrease in demand for zirconium products, particularly those used in auto-catalyst products, as well as those used by our industrial end-markets 
 The 14.9 decrease in Elektron sales in the first nine months of 2024 from 2023 was also impacted by the significant reduction of magnesium powders sales in the first half of 2024. 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 The 8.9 and 6.4 percentage point increase in adjusted EBITDA for Elektron as a percentage of net sales in the third quarter and first nine months respectively of 2024 from 2023 was a result of the net recovery from the previously disclosed US Ecology case in 2024 of 1.9 million and 7.2 million, compared to the net cost of 2.2 million and 4.5 million in 2023.This was partially offset by adverse price and unfavorable FX. 
 
 GRAPHIC ARTS 
 The net sales and adjusted EBITDA for Graphic Arts were as follows: 
 Third Quarter / point change Year-to-date / point change In millions 2024 2023 2024 v 2023 2024 2023 2024 v 2023 Net sales 8.0 7.1 12.7 22.2 23.4 (5.1) Adjusted EBITDA (0.1) (2.8) n/a (1.7) (3.5) (51.4) of net sales (1.3) (39.4) 38.1 (7.7) (15.0) 7.3 
 Net sales 
 The 12.7 increase and 5.1 decrease in Graphic Arts sales in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 from 2023 respectively was primarily the result of fluctuating demand for photo-engraving plates, particularly outside the North American market. 
 Adjusted EBITDA 
 Graphic Arts made a small, negative EBITDA of 0.1 million for the third quarter of 2024, compared to a loss of 2.8 million in the third quarter of 2023. For the first nine months of 2024 there was an EBITDA loss of 1.7 million, compared to a 3.5 million loss in the first nine months of 2023. 2023 was significantly impacted by material cost inflation resulting in competitive constraints. Magnesium purchase price has reduced as we progress through 2024, consistent with the improvement in adjusted EBITDA in the second and third quarter of 2024. 

31 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Our liquidity requirements arise primarily from obligations under our indebtedness, capital expenditures, acquisitions, the funding of working capital and the funding of hedging facilities to manage foreign exchange and commodity purchase price risks. We meet these requirements primarily through cash flows from operating activities, cash deposits and borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and accompanying ancillary hedging facilities and the Loan Note due in 2026. Our principal liquidity needs are: 
 funding acquisitions, including deferred contingent consideration payments; 
 capital expenditure requirements; 
 payment of shareholder dividends; 
 servicing interest on the Loan Notes, which is payable at each quarter end, in addition to interest and / or commitment fees on the Senior Facilities Agreement; 
 working capital requirements, particularly in the short term as we aim to achieve organic sales growth; and 
 hedging facilities used to manage our foreign exchange risks and aluminum purchase price risks. 
 We believe that, in the long term, cash generated from our operations will be adequate to meet our anticipated requirements for working capital, capital expenditures and interest payments on our indebtedness. In the short term, we believe we have sufficient credit facilities to cover any variation in our cash flow generation. However, any major repayments of indebtedness will be dependent on our ability to raise alternative financing or to realize substantial returns from operational sales. Also, our ability to expand operations through sales development and capital expenditures could be constrained by the availability of liquidity, which, in turn, could impact the profitability of our operations. 
 We have been in compliance with the covenants under the Loan Notes and the Senior Facilities Agreement throughout all of the quarterly measurement dates from and including September 30, 2011, to September 29, 2024. 
 
 Luxfer conducts all of its operations through its subsidiaries, joint ventures and affiliates. Accordingly, Luxfer's main cash source is dividends from its subsidiaries. The ability of each subsidiary to make distributions depends on the funds that a subsidiary receives from its operations in excess of the funds necessary for its operations, obligations or other business plans. We have not historically experienced any material impediment to these distributions, and we do not expect any local legal or regulatory regimes to have any impact on our ability to meet our liquidity requirements in the future. In addition, since our subsidiaries are wholly-owned, our claims will generally rank junior to all other obligations of the subsidiaries. If our operating subsidiaries are unable to make distributions, our growth may slow, unless we are able to obtain additional debt or equity financing. In the event of a subsidiary's liquidation, there may not be assets sufficient for us to recoup our investment in the subsidiary. 
 Our ability to maintain or increase the generation of cash from our operations in the future will depend significantly on the competitiveness of and demand for our products, including our success in launching new products. Achieving such success is a key objective of our business strategy. Due to commercial, competitive and external economic factors, however, we cannot guarantee that we will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future working capital will be available in an amount sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness or make necessary capital expenditures. 
 Cash Flows 
 Operating activities 
 Cash generated by continuing operating activities was 25.4 million inflow and 10.2 million inflow for the first nine months in 2024 and 2023 respectively. It was primarily related to net income from operating activities, net of the following non-cash items: depreciation and amortization; share-based compensation charges; pension credit / (charge); gain on disposal of held for sale assets; loss on held-for-sale asset group and net changes to assets and liabilities. Cash flow was impacted by the 5.3 million receipt arising from the reimbursement of legal costs in relation to the previously disclosed US Ecology case, the first nine months in 2023 had an equivalent outflow of 4.5 million. Also impacting the 2023 cash flow was the 2.1 million contribution the Company made in relation to the sale of the U.S. pension plan to an insurer. 
 Investing activities 
 Net cash used by continuing investing activities was 7.7 million for the first nine months of 2024, compared to net cash used by investing activities of 7.5 million in 2023, comparable quarter on quarter. 
 
 32 

Financing activities 
 In the first nine months of 2024, net cash used by financing activities was 16.3 million, (2023: 15.5 million used by financing activities). We made a net repayment on our banking facilities of 3.8 million, having repaid 2.9 million on our revolving credit facility and paid back 0.9 million of short term debt (2023: 2.5 million net repayment). Dividend payments of 10.5 million (2022: 10.5 million), equating to 0.390 per ordinary share. We paid out 0.4 million, (2023: 0.3 million) in settling share based compensation and 1.6 million, (2023: 2.2 million) in repurchasing our own shares as part of the share buyback program which equates to approximately 150,000 shares (2023: 150,000 shares). 
 Capital Resources 
 Dividends 
 We paid year-to-date dividends in 2024 of 10.5 million and declared an additional 3.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2024 (2023: 14.0 million declared year-to-date and 10.5 million paid year-to-date), or 0.390 per ordinary share (2023: 0.390). 
 Any payment of dividends is also subject to the provisions of the U.K. Companies Act, according to which dividends may only be paid out of profits available for distribution determined by reference to financial statements prepared in accordance with the Companies Act and IFRS as adopted by the E.U., which differ in some respects from GAAP. In the event that dividends are paid in the future, holders of the ordinary shares will be entitled to receive payments in U.S. dollars in respect of dividends on the underlying ordinary shares in accordance with the deposit agreement. Furthermore, because we are a holding company, any dividend payments would depend on cash flows from our subsidiaries.

Authorized shares 
 Our authorized share capital consists of 40.0 million ordinary shares with a par value of 0.50 per share.

 NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS 
 See Note 1 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for information pertaining to recently adopted accounting standards or accounting standards to be adopted in the future. 
 
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
 We have adopted various accounting policies to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Certain of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates. In our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10K, filed with the SEC on February 27, 2024, we identified the critical accounting policies which affect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in preparing our consolidated financial statements.

Item 3. Quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
 There have been no material changes in our market risk during the first nine months ended September 29, 2024. For additional information, refer to Item 7A of our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on February 27, 2024. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 We maintain a system of disclosure controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the reliability of our published financial statements and other disclosures included in this report. Our management evaluated, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the quarter ended March 31, 2024 ,pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act ). Based upon their evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective, at a reasonable assurance level, as of the quarter ended September 29, 2024. 
 Remediation of Previously Reported Material Weakness 
 As previously disclosed in Item 9A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31.2023 filed with the SEC on February 27,2024, we identified a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting as we did not properly design or maintain effective risk assessment control activities to allow for timely reassessment of the material risks of misstatement in financial reporting due to a lack of controls related to the accounting for inventory in-transit. During the first nine months of 2024, we undertook efforts to develop and design enhanced risk assessment procedures to identify and analyze changes in the business that could have a significant impact on financial reporting and determine actions necessary to mitigate new or evolving risks. We have also implemented a new period-end control over the recording of inventory in-transit and enhanced other post-closing controls. Management has operated the new risk assessment process for a sufficient period of time and have concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 Other than the changes related to the remediation activities related to the material weakness noted above, no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) occurred during the nine months or quarter ended September 29, 2024, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
