Item 2. MANAGEMENT S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION 

This section of the prospectus
includes forward-looking statements that reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance. Forward-looking
statements are often identified by words like: believe, expect, estimate, anticipate, intend, project and similar expressions, or words
which, by their nature, refer to future events. You should not place an undue certainty on these forward-looking statements, which apply
only as of the date of this prospectus. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause
actual results to differ materially from historical results or our predictions. 

PLAN OF OPERATION 

 Our plan of operations for the
next twelve months is to proceed with the implementation of our business plan. 

GOALS 
 
 PROJECT OUTCOMES 

Legal and Accounting Expenses 
 Compliance with financial reporting and internal controls 
 
 Website Design 
 Creation of our corporate website 
 
 Civil Engineer or Surveyor's Fees 
 Subdivision of lands 
 
 Architect drawings 
 Complete a set of plans for building permits 
 
 Project Consultants 
 Quality Control of construction project 
 
 Marketing and Promotion 
 Marketing and public awareness activities 
 
 Working Capital 
 Office supplies, telephone, postage and other miscellaneous expenses 

ACCOUNTING
AND LEGAL EXPENSES - Our estimate these related expenses will range from 7,500 for the next 12 months. We will be subject to the reporting
requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The Exchange
Act requires that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition. The Sarbanes-Oxley
Act requires that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls for financial reporting. 

 CREATE OUR CORPORATE
WEBSITE - It is part of our business plan to have our website. A website can convey our corporate images and services to our potential
customers. We believe our estimated cost of 1,250 will be sufficient to cover our projected expense for website design. 

 SURVEYOR'S
FEES - We are required to obtain surveyors' services related to subdivision of land. Our estimated cost for a surveyor' services will
be 4,500. The Planning Commission for the City of Houston is responsible for the review and approval of application for subdivision of
land. 

 ARCHITECT DRAWINGS -
We are required to obtain several sets of architect drawings in connection with our proposed construction projects. We estimated the cost
for architect drawings will be 5,000 to 7,500 per year. 

 PROJECT
CONSULTANTS - Once we have obtained the necessary building permits from the City of Houston, we will be ready to build our residential
homes. We will require to hire project consultants to monitor the quality control of our construction projects. We intend to spent 6,300
to 12,600 annually for project consultants. 

 MARKETING
AND PROMOTION - Our staff will distribute our promotional fliers on foot, spending afternoons knocking on the doors of residences in
targeted neighborhoods, as well as residences already in designated HOPE and Workforce areas. Speaking with potential buyers directly
is the best way to inform and engage the communities. When speaking to residents, we will explain the Houston HOPE and Workforce programs,
specifically mentioning how these programs can benefit them as future owners of our new homes and services. We will then outline in further
detail the government assistance option available to them. The government can offer up to 30,000 for down payments and unlike renting,
home ownership allows one to build up home equity. 

 The following table shows
the projection of our building activities for three years:

LIQUIDITY
AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

 On
September 30, 2023, our current assets were 121,590.00 and our total liabilities were -0- which resulted in working capital of 121,590.00
We expect to raise additional capital through, among other things, the sale of equity or debt securities, private placement offerings,
employee stock options plans, and advanced funds from our officer and director. Any deficiencies in general and administrative expenses
will be covered from funds by our director and officer. Our officer and director, Tian Su Hua, has agreed to provide us a 5,000,000 line-of-credit
at -0- interest. The management believes that an existing 1,000,000 line-of-credit agreement with our officer and director will be sufficient
to cover our operational expense for the next twelve months. The residential lot we currently own is large enough to accommodate up to
eight homes. We believe that our future expenditures for the second and third years will be covered by revenues generate from sell of
new homes and additional offerings for equity or debt securities, private placement offerings, employee options plans and funds from our
officer and director. 

 RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS 

 From December 31,
2023 to September 30, 2024.

was 75,810.00 for accumulated net loss. 

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENT 

 The Company has no material transactions,
arrangements, obligations or other relationships with entities or other persons that have or are reasonably likely to have a material
current or future impact, changes in financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, capital resources, or
significant components of revenues or expenses.
