million and incurred negative cash flows from operations of approximately million. At September 30, 2024 , we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million and an accumulated deficit of approximately million. At September 30, 2024 , we had million in current liabilities, including approximately million in convertible debt that matures over the next twelve months. In addition, a significant amount of future proceeds that we may receive from our patent enforcement and licensing programs will first be utilized to repay borrowings and legal fees and expenses under our contingent funding arrangements. These circumstances raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue to operate as a going concern for a period of one year following the issue date of these condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Approximately million in convertible notes, including accrued interest thereon, were converted by the holders into shares of our common stock subsequent to September 30, 2024, and all of our remaining convertible notes have conversion prices that are substantially below the market price of our common stock as of September 30, 2024. We anticipate that all of our outstanding convertible notes will be converted by the holders prior to their scheduled maturity dates. However, even with the anticipated conversions of our convertible debt, our current capital resources are not sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the next twelve months and we will be required to seek additional capital. Our ability to meet our liquidity needs for the next twelve months is dependent upon (i) our ability to successfully negotiate licensing agreements and/or settlements relating to the use of our technologies by others in excess of our contingent payment obligations, (ii) our ability to control operating costs, and/or (iii) our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing. We expect that proceeds received by us from patent enforcement actions and technology licenses over the next twelve months may not alone be sufficient to cover our working capital requirements. 
 
 We expect to continue to invest in the support of our patent licensing and enforcement program. The long-term continuation of our business plan is dependent upon the generation of sufficient cash flows from our technologies and/or products to offset expenses and debt obligations. In the event that we do not generate sufficient cash flows, we will be required to obtain additional funding through public or private debt or equity financing or contingent fee arrangements and/or reduce operating costs. Failure to generate sufficient cash flows, raise additional capital through debt or equity financings or contingent fee arrangements, and/or reduce operating costs will have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our long-term liquidity needs and achieve our intended long-term business objectives. 

revenue was recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 . We recognized million of revenue during the nine -month period ended September 30, 2023 from a patent license and settlement agreement with a third party for their use of our technologies. Our performance obligations were satisfied, and therefore revenue recognized, upon transfer of the licensed rights and dismissal of all patent enforcement actions between the parties.

We are currently in compliance with all the terms of the note. At September 30, 2024 , we estimate the note has an aggregate fair value of approximately million and would be categorized within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 

million were converted, at the option of the holder, into approximately million shares of our common stock. No convertible notes were repaid during the three months ended September 30, 2024, and during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 we repaid an aggregate of million of notes at maturity. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , we recognized interest expense of approximately million and million, respectively, related to the contractual interest on our convertible notes. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we elected to pay million of interest payments in shares of our common stock and issued approximately million shares of our common stock as interest-in-kind payments. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , we elected to pay million of interest payments in shares of our common stock and issued approximately million shares of our common stock as interest-in-kind payments. 
 
 At September 30, 2024 , we estimate our convertible notes have an aggregate fair value of approximately million and would be categorized within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

Borrowings 
 Repayments 
 Change in fair value 
 Secured contingent payment obligation, end of period 

Our secured contingent payment obligation consists of a secured, non-recourse note (the "Note") and a prepaid forward purchase contract (the "PPFPA") with Brickell Key Investments, LP Brickell ). The Note has a face value of million ("Face Value"), accrues simple interest at a fixed rate, and matures on August 14, 2028. Payments under the Note will be made solely from proceeds from our patent assets, net of contingent fees payable to attorneys ("Distributions"). We are obligated to pay one hundred percent of the first million in Distributions to Brickell, and thereafter will pay a percentage of Distributions, which varies depending upon the origin of the Distributions, until the Face Value of the Note, and accrued interest thereon, has been repaid in full. If the amounts payable to Brickell from Distributions are insufficient to repay the face value and interest accrued on the Note by the maturity date, our remaining repayment obligations under the Note will be reduced to zero with future payment obligations, if any, being determined under the PPFPA. The Note is secured by our patent assets and related proceeds and contains standard and customary representations, warranties and covenants. The Note contains events of default including, but not limited to, (a) failure to pay principal or interest on the Note when due; (b) breach of representations or covenants, (c) impairment in the perfection or priority of Brickell's security interests in the collateral, and (d) bankruptcy or dissolution of the Company. In the event of a default, the outstanding principal and accrued interest on the Note will become immediately due and payable. The PPFPA extends beyond the maturity date of the Note and provides that Brickell is entitled to a specified percentage of monetary recoveries resulting from our patent-related actions to the extent not already paid to Brickell under the Note, or otherwise prior to the inception of the Note. The PPFPA also contains standard and customary representations, warranties and covenants. The Note and PPFPA are collectively referred to as our secured contingent payment obligation. 
 
 We have elected to measure our secured contingent payment obligation at its estimated fair value based on probability-weighted estimated cash outflows, discounted back to present value using a discount rate determined in accordance with accepted valuation methods (see Note 11 ). The secured contingent payment obligation is remeasured to fair value at each reporting period with changes recorded in the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) until the contingency is resolved. 
 
 The underlying carrying value of the Note, which includes the Face Value plus accrued interest, was approximately million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively. The range of potential proceeds payable to Brickell is discussed more fully in Note 11. As of September 30, 2024 , we are in compliance with our obligations under the Note and the PPFPA. 

Unsecured Contingent Payment Obligations 
 
 The following table provides a reconciliation of our unsecured contingent payment obligations, measured at estimated fair value, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the year ended December 31, 2023 (in thousands): 

Change in fair value 
 Unsecured contingent payment obligations, end of period 

Our unsecured contingent payment obligations represent amounts payable to others from future patent-related proceeds including (i) a termination fee due to a litigation funder and (ii) contingent payment rights issued to accredited investors in connection with equity financings. We have elected to measure these unsecured contingent payment obligations at their estimated fair value based on probability-weighted estimated cash outflows, discounted back to present value using a discount rate determined in accordance with accepted valuation methods. The unsecured contingent payment obligations will be remeasured to fair value at each reporting period with changes recorded in the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive loss until the contingency is resolved (see Note 11 ). 

Unsecured contingent payment obligations 

Unsecured contingent payment obligations 

The fair values of our secured and unsecured contingent payment obligations were estimated using a probability-weighted income approach based on various cash flow scenarios as to the outcome of patent-related actions both in terms of timing and amount, discounted to present value using a risk-adjusted rate. We used a risk-adjusted discount rate for the secured and unsecured contingent payment obligations of and , respectively, at September 30, 2024 , based on a risk-free rate of and , respectively, as adjusted by for credit risk and for litigation inherent risk. 

The following table provides quantitative information about the significant unobservable inputs used in the measurement of fair value for both the secured and unsecured contingent payment obligations at September 30, 2024 , including the lowest and highest undiscounted payout scenarios as well as a weighted average payout scenario based on relative undiscounted fair value of each cash flow scenario. 

Duration (in years) 
 Estimated probabilities 

We evaluate the estimates and assumptions used in determining the fair value of our contingent payment obligations each reporting period and make any adjustments prospectively based on those evaluations. Changes in any of these Level 3 inputs could result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement. 

ParkerVision v. Qualcomm (Middle District of Florida-Orlando Division) - Appealed to U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit 
 On September 6, 2024, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ("CAFC") issued its opinion, ruling in our favor on each of the issues we appealed and remanding the case back to the Middle District of Florida (Orlando) where the case will be reopened. The CAFC appeal was the result of several district court rulings on pre-trial motions issued in March 2022 in our patent infringement case against Qualcomm, a case that was originally filed in May 2014. The district court granted Qualcomm motions to strike and exclude our technical expert report, essentially precluding the support of infringement testimony at trial and also issued an order granting Qualcomm's motion for summary judgment ruling that Qualcomm did not infringe the remaining three patents in the case. We appealed these rulings to the CAFC and oral arguments were heard in November 2023. In July 2024, the CAFC issued an order indicating that it did not have jurisdiction over this case as the district court had not entered a final judgement on Qualcomm's counterclaims of invalidity. The parties filed a motion with the district court requesting an order dismissing Qualcomm's counterclaims of invalidity without prejudice. On August 1, 2024, the district court issued such an order, and on August 7, 2024, the matter was transferred back to the CAFC for its decision which was then issued on September 6, 2024. On November 4, 2024, we filed a motion with the district court requesting a scheduling conference, trial setting, and identification of issues that require the court's resolution before trial. 
 
 As a result of the district court's summary judgment motion in favor of Qualcomm in 2022, Qualcomm had the right to petition the court for its fees and costs. The court granted Qualcomm's motion to delay such a petition until after the issuance of the appellate court s mandate. Given the favorable decision by the CAFC, Qualcomm is not entitled to its fees and costs in relation to the now-vacated 2022 summary judgment decision. We are represented in this case on a full contingency fee basis. 
 
 ParkerVision v. Apple and Qualcomm (Middle District of Florida-Jacksonville Division) 
 We have a patent infringement case in the Middle District of Florida against Apple Inc. Apple and Qualcomm, filed in December 2015, alleging infringement of four of our patents, which was subsequently reduced to one patent. Fact discovery has closed in this case and a jury trial was scheduled to begin in August 2020. In March 2020, as a result of the impact of COVID- 19, the parties filed a motion requesting an extension of certain deadlines in the case. In April 2020, the court stayed this proceeding pending the outcome of the infringement case against Qualcomm in the Orlando Division of the Middle District of Florida, which is currently pending an appeal. 
 
 ParkerVision v. LG (District of New Jersey) 
 In July 2017, we filed a patent infringement complaint in the District of New Jersey against LG for the alleged infringement of four patents previously asserted in the Middle District of Florida (see ParkerVision v. Apple and Qualcomm above). We elected to dismiss the case originally filed against LG in the Middle District of Florida and re-file in New Jersey as a result of a Supreme Court ruling regarding venue. In March 2018, the court stayed this case pending a final decision in ParkerVision v. Apple and Qualcomm in the Middle District of Florida. As part of this stay, LG has agreed to be bound by the final claim construction decision in that case. 
 
 ParkerVision v. Intel (Western District of Texas) 
 We filed two patent infringement complaints in the Western District of Texas against Intel Corporation ("Intel") in 2020, alleging infringement of approximately ten of our patents by Intel cellular, WiFi and Bluetooth products. The first case was scheduled for trial commencing February 6, 2023. Beginning in November 2022, the parties filed a number of pre-trial motions. The court held hearings on these pre-trial motions in January 2023. The court issued its written orders with regard to these motions immediately prior to the February 6, 2023 trial start date. As a result of the court's pre-trial rulings, the potential damages in the case decreased significantly. On February 7, 2023, the parties resolved their outstanding dispute and we dismissed all pending actions against Intel. 
 
 ParkerVision v. Realtek (Western District of Texas) 
 We filed two patent infringement actions in the Western District of Texas against Realtek Semiconductor Corp. ("Realtek"), the first in 2022 and a second in 2023 , alleging infringement of an aggregate of seven of our patents. A claim construction hearing was held in January 2024 in the first Realtek action and the court adopted the majority of our claim constructions. A jury trial for the first Realtek action is scheduled for July 2025 . A claim construction hearing was held in June 2024 in the second Realtek action, and the special master appointed by the court recommended the majority of the claim constructions in our favor. A trial date has not yet been scheduled in the second Realtek action. 

ParkerVision v. TCL (Western District of Texas) 
 We filed two patent infringement actions in the Western District of Texas in 2020 and 2021 against TCL Industries Holdings Co., Ltd, a Chinese company, TCL Electronics Holdings Ltd., Shenzhen TCL New Technology Co., Ltd, TCL King Electrical Appliances (Huizhou) Co., Ltd., TCL Moka Int'l Ltd. and TCL Moka Manufacturing S.A. DE C.V. (collectively "TCL") alleging infringement of approximately twelve of our patents. The court issued its claim construction recommendations in the first TCL case, adopting our claim constructions for nearly all of the disputed terms. In January 2023, the TCL action was stayed pending final resolution of patent infringement action filed against Realtek, the manufacturer of the integrated circuits used in TCL's alleged infringing products. 
 
 ParkerVision v. MediaTek (Western District of Texas) 
 We filed three patent infringement actions in the Western District of Texas against MediaTek Inc. and MediaTek USA Inc. (collectively, "MediaTek"), the first in 2022 and two additional cases in 2023, alleging infringement of an aggregate of ten of our patents. One of the patents was dropped from the first MediaTek case following an inter partes review (" IPR ") petition filed by MediaTek which was subsequently terminated. A claim construction hearing was held in January 2024 in the first MediaTek action and the court adopted the majority of our claim constructions. A jury trial for the first MediaTek action is currently scheduled for June 2025. A claim construction hearing was held in June 2024 in the second MediaTek action, and the special master appointed by the court recommended the majority of the claim constructions in our favor. A jury trial is scheduled for February 2026 in the second MediaTek action. No schedule has been established by the court for the third MediaTek action. 
 
 ParkerVision v. LGE (Western District of Texas) 
 We filed a patent infringement action in the Western District of Texas against LG Electronics, a South Korean company ("LGE") in 2021 , alleging infringement of ten of our patents. The court issued its claim construction recommendations in June 2022 , adopting our claim constructions for nearly all of the disputed terms. In January 2023 , the LGE action was stayed pending final resolution of patent infringement actions filed against Realtek and MediaTek as well as final resolution of IPR actions against patents in this case. 
 
 ParkerVision v. Texas Instruments (Western District of Texas) 
 We filed a patent infringement action in the Western District of Texas against Texas Instruments ("TI") in 2023, alleging infringement of three of our patents. In December 2023, TI filed a motion to change venue to the Northern District of Texas which the court denied in August 2024. A claim construction hearing was held in June 2024, and the special master appointed by the court recommended the majority of the claim constructions in our favor. A jury trial is tentatively scheduled for May 2025. 
 
 ParkerVision v. NXP Semiconductors (Western District of Texas) 
 We filed a patent infringement action in the Western District of Texas against NXP Semiconductors ("NXP") in 2023, alleging infringement of three of our patents. A claim construction hearing was held in June 2024, and the special master appointed by the court recommended the majority of the claim constructions in our favor. A jury trial is tentatively scheduled for August 2025 . 

Intel (USPTO) v. ParkerVision (PTAB) 
 We appealed an IPR action, originally filed by Intel, against our U.S. patent 8,190,108, ("the '108 Patent") which was asserted in ParkerVision v. Intel in the Western District of Texas. Following our February 2023 resolution of the infringement actions against Intel, Intel withdrew from the IPR cases; however the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office ("USPTO") has exercised its right to intervene to defend the PTAB's decisions. In June 2022, the PTAB issued its final decision for the '108 Patent, determining that the challenged claims of the '108 Patent were unpatentable. We appealed this decision to the CAFC and oral arguments were presented on May 9, 2024. On May 16, 2024, the CAFC issued its decision upholding the PTAB ruling that the challenged claims are unpatentable. 
 
 TCL and LGE v. ParkerVision (PTAB) 
 We appealed two IPR actions filed by TCL and LGE against our U.S. patent 7,292,835 the 835 Patent and U.S. patent 7,110,444 ("the 444 Patent"), both of which are asserted in the infringement cases against these parties in the Western District of Texas. Oral hearings for these IPRs were held by the PTAB in September 2022. In November 2022, the PTAB issued its written decision ruling that the challenged claims for both patents were unpatentable. We appealed these decisions to the CAFC and oral arguments for both appeals were presented to the CAFC on June 3, 2024. On June 5, 2024, the CAFC issued its final decision, in the form of a Rule 36, in both of these cases, affirming the PTAB rulings. On November 4, 2024, we submitted a petition for a Writ of Certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court challenging the CAFC's use of Rule 36 to affirm PTAB decisions without a written opinion. 
 
 MediaTek v. ParkerVision (PTAB) 
 MediaTek filed an IPR petition in November 2023 against the '835 Patent, which is one of the patents asserted in the first MediaTek infringement action. On May 23, 2024, the PTAB instituted the IPR petition. MediaTek withdrew its petition and the IPR was terminated in September 2024, following our dismissal of the '835 Patent from the patent infringement action against MediaTek. On May 21, 2024, MediaTek filed a second IPR petition against the '686 Patent which is one of the patents asserted in the second MediaTek infringement action, and on October 18, 2024, MediaTek filed a third IPR petition against our '593 Patent, one of the patents asserted in the third MediaTek action. The PTAB has not yet issued its decision regarding institution of the second and third MediaTek IPR petitions. 
 
 TI v. ParkerVision (PTAB) 
 In May 2024, TI filed IPR petitions against all three of the patents asserted in our infringement action against them. The PTAB has not yet issued its decision regarding institution of any of these IPR petitions. 
 
 NXP v. ParkerVision (PTAB) 
 In June 2024, NXP filed IPR petitions against of the three patents asserted in our infringement action against them. Both of the IPR challenges are against patents also challenged in IPR petitions filed by TI. The PTAB has not yet issued its decision regarding institution of any of these IPR petitions. 
 
 Other Contingencies 
 
 In July 2024, a public relations firm engaged by us in late 2019 threatened to file a claim against us for the collection of payment for billed and unbilled services totaling approximately million purportedly performed by them under our engagement agreement during the period from December 2019 through May 2021. In November 2024, the parties reached an agreement to resolve the disputed fees, and we have accrued our negotiated payment obligation in the consolidated financial statements for the period ended September 30, 2024. 

million to million. 

Stock Issuances 
 
 Payment for Services 
 On January 2, 2024, we entered into an agreement with a third party to provide shareholder relations services. As consideration for services provided under the twelve -month term of the agreement, we issued shares of unregistered common stock for a non-refundable retainer for services valued at approximately million. The value of the shares issued is being recognized as consulting expense over the term of the agreement. 
 
 On August 1, 2024, we entered into an agreement with a third party to provide financial advisory services with respect to future development of our intellectual property. As consideration for services provided under the twelve -month term of the agreement, we issued shares of unregistered common stock as a non-refundable retainer for services valued at approximately million. The value of the shares issued was recognized as consulting expense during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Common Stock Warrants 
 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , million warrants with an exercise price of were exercised for proceeds to us of million. As of September 30, 2024 , we had remaining outstanding warrants for the purchase of up to million shares of our common stock. The estimated grant date fair value of these warrants of million is included in additional paid-in capital in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. As of September 30, 2024 , our outstanding warrants have an average exercise price of per share and a weighted average remaining life of approximately years. 

million and 0.09 million, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , we recognized share-based compensation expense of approximately million and million, respectively. Share-based compensation is included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income. As of September 30, 2024 , there was million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to all non-vested share-based compensation awards. The cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average remaining life of approximately years. 

for each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 as we expect to be able to utilize net operating loss carryforwards not previously recognized as a tax benefit to offset any income tax expense related to income, if any, for the 2023 and 2024 tax years. 

and a September 13, 2019 note with a principal balance of , both held by Lewis Titterton, were amended to extend the maturity dates to March 15, 2026, reduce the interest rate from to and to replace the quarterly interest payments with a single payment of unpaid, accrued interest at the earlier of conversion or maturity of the notes. On September 24, 2024, Mr. Titterton converted each of these notes, including aggregate accrued interest, into an aggregate of shares of our common stock.

 Overview 
 
 We have invented and developed proprietary radio frequency RF technologies and integrated circuits based on those technologies, and we license those technologies to third parties for use in wireless communication products. We have expended significant financial and other resources to research and develop our RF technologies and to obtain patent protection for those technologies in the United States of America U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions. We believe certain patents protecting our proprietary technologies have been broadly infringed by others and therefore the primary focus of our business plan is the enforcement of our intellectual property rights through patent licensing and infringement litigation efforts. We currently have patent enforcement actions ongoing in various U.S. district courts against mobile handset, smart television, and other WiFi product providers, as well as semiconductor suppliers, for the infringement of several of our RF patents. We have made significant investments in developing and protecting our technologies, the returns on which are dependent upon the generation of future revenues for realization.

Recent Events 
 
 On September 6, 2024, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ("CAFC") issued it opinion, ruling in our favor on each of the issues we appealed and remanding the case back to the Middle District of Florida (Orlando) where the case will be reopened. 
 
 Subsequent to September 30, 2024, our convertible debt was reduced by an aggregate of approximately 0.64 million as a result of conversions, at the option of the debt holders, into shares of our common stock at conversion prices ranging from 0.10 to 0.25. In addition, we received proceeds of approximately 0.14 million from the exercise of outstanding options. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 We used cash for operations of approximately 2.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and generated cash from operations of 11.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in cash generated from operations from 2023 to 2024 is primarily due to proceeds received from the patent license and settlement agreement entered into in February 2023, net of contingent legal fees and expenses paid. 
 
 At September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately 0.8 million, an accumulated deficit of 445.5 million, and a working capital deficit of 1.5 million. At September 30, 2024, we had 2.4 million in current liabilities, including approximately 1.1 million in convertible debt that matures over the next twelve months. In addition, a significant amount of future proceeds that we may receive from our patent enforcement and licensing programs will first be utilized to repay borrowings and legal fees and expenses under our contingent funding arrangements. These circumstances raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue to operate as a going concern for a period of one year following the issue date of these condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Approximately 0.64 million in convertible notes, including accrued interest thereon, were converted by the holders into shares of our common stock subsequent to September 30, 2024, and all of our remaining convertible notes have conversion prices that are substantially below the market price of our common stock as of September 30, 2024. We anticipate that all of our outstanding convertible notes will be converted by the holders prior to their scheduled maturity dates. However, even with the anticipated conversions of our convertible debt, our current capital resources are not sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the next twelve months and we will be required to seek additional capital. Our ability to meet our liquidity needs for the next twelve months is dependent upon (i) our ability to successfully negotiate licensing agreements and/or settlements relating to the use of our technologies by others in excess of our contingent payment obligations, (ii) our ability to control operating costs, and/or (iii) our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing. We expect that proceeds received by us from patent enforcement actions and technology licenses over the next twelve months may not alone be sufficient to cover our working capital requirements. 
 
 We expect to continue to invest in the support of our patent licensing and enforcement program. The long-term continuation of our business plan is dependent upon the generation of sufficient cash flows from our technologies and/or products to offset expenses and debt obligations. In the event that we do not generate sufficient cash flows, we will be required to obtain additional funding through public or private debt or equity financing or contingent fee arrangements and/or reduce operating costs. Failure to generate sufficient cash flows, raise additional capital through debt or equity financings or contingent fee arrangements, and/or reduce operating costs will have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our long-term liquidity needs and achieve our intended long-term business objectives.

Financial Condition 
 
 Our working capital decreased approximately 1.8 million from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024. This decrease in working capital is primarily the result of cash used in operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 
 Our long-term liabilities increased 8.5 million from December 31, 2023 to September 30, 2024, primarily due to an overall increase in the estimated fair value our contingent payment obligations of 8.9 million. Refer to "Change in Fair Value of Contingent Payment Obligations" below. 
 
 Results of Operations for the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 
 
 Revenue and Cost of Sales 
 We reported no licensing revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 or the three months ended September 30, 2023. Licensing revenue was 25.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, resulting from a patent license and settlement agreement entered into in February 2023. The parties' performance obligations were met in February 2023 and we recognized revenue at that time. Cost of sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 consists of amortization expense related to the patents covered under license agreements. Revenue resulting from our patent enforcement actions is highly unpredictable with respect to the amount and timing of receipt, and there can be no assurance that we will achieve our anticipated results. 
 
 Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses 
 Selling, general, and administrative expenses consist primarily of litigation fees and expenses, personnel and related costs, including share-based compensation, for executive, Board, finance and accounting and technical support personnel for our patent enforcement program, and costs incurred for insurance and outside professional fees for accounting, legal and business consulting services. 

21

Table of Contents 

Our selling, general and administrative expenses increased by less than 0.1 million, or 8.4 , during the three months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same period in 2023. This is primarily the result of a 0.1 million increase in litigation fees and expenses. 
 
 Our selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by approximately 11.7 million, or 82.7 , during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 when compared to the same period in 2023. This is primarily the result of an 10.9 million decrease in litigation fees and expenses, a 0.4 million decrease in compensation expense, including share-based compensation, and a 0.3 million decrease in consulting expenses. 
 
 The increase in litigation fees and expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 is the result of the settlement of a contingent obligation. The decrease in litigation fees and expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is the result of contingent legal fees and expenses recognized in 2023 in conjunction with the confidential patent license and settlement agreement reached in February 2023. 
 
 The decrease in our compensation expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is the result of bonuses paid and share-based awards issued to employees and executives in 2023. As of September 30, 2024, we had 0.1 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested share-based compensation awards that is expected to be recognized over a period of approximately 0.7 years. The decrease in consulting fees for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 is primarily due to decisions not to continue or extend prior consulting arrangements as a result of changes in business strategy. 
 
 Change in Fair Value of Contingent Payment Obligations 
 
 We have elected to measure our secured and unsecured contingent payment obligations at fair value which is based on significant unobservable inputs. We estimated the fair value of our secured contingent payment obligations using a probability-weighted income approach based on the estimated present value of projected future cash outflows using a risk-adjusted discount rate. Increases or decreases in the significant unobservable inputs could result in significant increases or decreases in fair value. Generally, changes in fair value are a result of changes in estimated amounts and timing of projected future cash flows due to increases in funded amounts, passage of time, and changes in the probabilities based on the status of the funded actions. 
 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded aggregate increases in the fair value of our secured and unsecured contingent payment obligations of approximately 9.7 million and 2.9 million, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we recorded an aggregate increase in the fair value of our secured and unsecured contingent payment obligations of approximately 9.0 million compared to an aggregate decrease of 0.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The change in fair value for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily the result of changes in the estimated amounts and timing of projected future cash flows due to changes in probabilities and time frames based on the status of various patent infringement actions, particularly as a result of the favorable CAFC decision received in September 2024 that remanded the Qualcomm case back to district court. 
 
 Off-Balance Sheet Transactions, Arrangements and Other Relationships 
 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had outstanding warrants to purchase approximately 7.7 million shares of our common stock. The estimated grant date fair value of these warrants of approximately 3.2 million is included in shareholders deficit in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. The outstanding warrants have a weighted average exercise price of 0.95 per share and a weighted average remaining life of approximately 0.8 years.
