 of the outstanding shares of beneficial interest, designated as units, in the Operating Trust, or OP Units, as of September 30, 2024, and the Company is the sole trustee of the Operating Trust. As the sole trustee, the Company generally has the power under the declaration of trust of the Operating Trust to manage and conduct the business of the Operating Trust, subject to certain limited approval and voting rights of other holders of OP Units. 
 On October 2, 2024 the Company filed a definitive proxy statement, the Definitive Proxy, with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission related to a Special Meeting of Shareholders, the Special Shareholder Meeting, for the following purposes: (i) to consider and vote upon the Plan of Sale and Dissolution of the Company, the Plan of Sale, including the wind-down and complete liquidation of the Company, and the dissolution and termination of the Company, including the establishment of a Liquidating Entity (as defined in the Definitive Proxy), and (ii) on an advisory, non-binding basis, to consider and vote upon compensation that may become payable by the Company to its named executive officers in connection with the Plan of Sale. The Plan of Sale, which the Company s Board of Trustees has determined is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders, authorizes the Company to sell all of its remaining properties, wind-down the Company s affairs and distribute the net proceeds to shareholders. As disclosed in the Definitive Proxy, the Special Shareholder Meeting is scheduled to be held virtually on November 12, 2024 for shareholders of record at the close of business on October 1, 2024. If the Plan of Sale is approved by the Company's shareholders, the Company will adopt the liquidation basis of accounting which requires the Company's assets to be recognized at the estimated amounts expected to be collected and liabilities to be recognized at the estimated amounts at which they are expected to be settled. 
 At September 30, 2024, our portfolio consisted of properties buildings), with a combined million square feet, and we had billion of cash and cash equivalents.

We did repurchase any common shares under our share repurchase program during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, we had million of remaining availability under our share repurchase program, which expires on June 30, 2025. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, certain of our employees and former employees surrendered and common shares owned by them, respectively, to satisfy their statutory tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of such common shares pursuant to our equity compensation plans. 
 Common Share Distributions 
 In February 2024, the number of earned awards for recipients of the Company s restricted stock units granted in January 2021 was determined. Pursuant to the terms of such awards, we paid one-time catch-up cash distributions to these recipients in the aggregate amount of million, for distributions to common shareholders declared by our Board of Trustees during such awards performance measurement period.

 from the date of issuance of such OP Units, to cause the Operating Trust to redeem their OP Units in exchange for cash or, at the option of the Company, common shares of the Company on a -for-one basis. As sole trustee, the Company has the sole discretion to elect whether the redemption right will be satisfied by the Company in cash or the Company s common shares. As a result, the Noncontrolling interest is classified as permanent equity. As of September 30, 2024, the portion of the Operating Trust not beneficially owned by the Company is in the form of OP Units and LTIP Units (see Note 7 for a description of LTIP Units). LTIP Units may be subject to additional vesting requirements.

 Noncontrolling ownership interest in the Operating Trust 
 The carrying value of the Noncontrolling interest is allocated based on the number of OP Units and LTIP Units in proportion to the number of OP Units and LTIP Units plus the number of common shares. We adjust the Noncontrolling interest balance at the end of each period to reflect the noncontrolling partners interest in the net assets of the Operating Trust. Net income is allocated to the Noncontrolling interest in the Operating Trust based on the weighted average ownership

The earned awards vest in tranches with of the earned award vesting following the end of the performance period on the date the Compensation Committee determines the level of achievement of the performance metric and the remaining of the earned award vesting approximately thereafter, subject to the grant recipient s continued employment. Compensation expense for the RSUs is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model and is recognized ratably from the grant date to the vesting date of each tranche. 
 LTIP Units are a class of beneficial interests in the Operating Trust that may be issued to employees, officers or trustees of the Operating Trust, the Company or their subsidiaries. Time-based LTIP Units have the same general characteristics as restricted shares and market-based LTIP Units have the same general characteristics as RSUs. Each LTIP Unit will convert automatically into an OP Unit on a -for-one basis when the LTIP Unit becomes vested and its capital account is equalized with the per-unit capital account of the OP Units. Holders of LTIP Units generally will be entitled to receive the same per-unit distributions as the other outstanding OP Units in the Operating Trust, except that market-based LTIP Units will not participate in distributions until expiration of the applicable performance period, at which time any earned market-based LTIP Units generally will become entitled to receive a catch-up distribution for the periods prior to such time. 
 2024 Equity Award Activity 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, RSUs vested, and, as a result, we issued common shares, prior to certain employees surrendering their common shares to satisfy tax withholding obligations (see Note 4).

These awards equated to shares or time-based LTIP Units per Trustee, for a total of shares and time-based LTIP Units, valued at per share and unit, the closing price of our common shares on the NYSE on that day. These shares and time-based LTIP Units vest after the date of the award, on June 18, 2025.

 Outstanding Equity Awards 
 As of September 30, 2024, the estimated future compensation expense for all unvested restricted shares and time-based LTIP Units was million. Compensation expense for the restricted share and time-based LTIP Unit awards is being recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award. The weighted average period over which the future compensation expense will be recorded for the restricted shares and time-based LTIP Units is approximately years. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the estimated future compensation expense for all unvested RSUs and market-based LTIP Units was million. The weighted average period over which the future compensation expense will be recorded for the RSUs and market-based LTIP Units is approximately years.

 At September 30, 2024, we have classified 1250 H Street, NW, 206 East 9th Street and Bridgepoint Square as held for sale in accordance with ASC 360. As a result of our current estimates of market value less estimated costs to sell, it was necessary to record impairment charges of million which includes million of impairment related to non-real estate assets. We determined these impairments based on third-party offer prices, which are level 2 inputs according to the fair value hierarchy established in ASC 820. We reduced the aggregate carrying values of these properties from million to their estimated fair value less estimated costs to sell of million. We evaluated each of our properties and determined there were no additional valuation adjustments necessary at September 30, 2024. 
 
 Financial Instruments 
 Our financial instruments include our cash and cash equivalents. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the fair value of these financial instruments was not different from their carrying values.

 OVERVIEW 
 We are an internally managed and self-advised REIT primarily engaged in the ownership and operation of office properties in the United States. We were formed in 1986 under Maryland law. The Company operates as an UPREIT, conducting substantially all of its activities through the Operating Trust. As of September 30, 2024, the Company beneficially owned 99.86 of the outstanding OP Units. 
 At September 30, 2024, our portfolio consisted of four properties (eight buildings), with a combined 1.5 million square feet, and we had 2.2 billion of cash and cash equivalents. 
 We use leasing and occupancy metrics to evaluate the performance of our properties. We believe these metrics provide useful information to investors because they reflect the leasing activity and vacant space at the properties and may facilitate comparisons of our leasing and occupancy metrics with other REITs and real estate companies. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our overall portfolio was 69.7 leased. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we did not enter into any leases. 
 We have engaged CBRE, Inc., or CBRE, to provide property management services. We pay CBRE a property-by-property management fee and may engage CBRE from time-to-time to perform project management services, such as coordinating and overseeing the completion of tenant improvements and other capital projects at the properties. We reimburse CBRE for certain expenses incurred in the performance of its duties, including certain personnel and equipment costs. For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we incurred expenses of 0.8 million and 0.8 million, respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we incurred expenses of 2.4 million and 2.3 million, respectively, related to our property management agreement with CBRE, for property management fees, typically calculated as a percentage of the properties revenues, and salary and benefits reimbursements for property personnel, such as property managers, engineers and maintenance staff. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had amounts payable pursuant to these services of 0.3 million and 0.4 million, respectively. 
 Our business has been and is continuing to be impacted by economic uncertainty and an overall slowdown in the office leasing market following the COVID-19 pandemic due to a variety of factors, including tenant uncertainty regarding office

 space needs given the evolving remote and hybrid working trends and other factors impacting the demand for office space. Many of our employees and the majority of our tenants employees are currently working at least in part remotely, with many businesses reassessing their long-term demand for office space. Overall, our business has experienced a significant reduction in leasing interest and activity as well as parking revenue when compared to pre-pandemic levels. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2019, our comparable property portfolio was 69.7 and 91.5 leased, respectively. The duration of these business disruptions continues to be unknown at this time, and we currently are not able to estimate the full impact of the overall slowdown in the office leasing market on our business. 
 As previously disclosed, we had been evaluating potential investment opportunities in an effort to create long-term value for our shareholders while concurrently taking steps to facilitate the potential wind down of our business. On July 30, 2024, our Board of Trustees: (i) determined that it is advisable and in the best interests of our shareholders to proceed with the wind down of our operations and the liquidation of our assets in order to maximize shareholder value, and (ii) directed management to prepare proxy materials seeking shareholder approval of a plan of sale and dissolution. 
 On October 2, 2024 the Company filed a definitive proxy statement, the Definitive Proxy, with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission related to a Special Meeting of Shareholders, the Special Shareholder Meeting, for the following purposes: (i) to consider and vote upon the Plan of Sale and Dissolution of the Company, the Plan of Sale, including the wind-down and complete liquidation of the Company, and the dissolution and termination of the Company, including the establishment of a Liquidating Entity (as defined in the Definitive Proxy), and (ii) on an advisory, non-binding basis, to consider and vote upon compensation that may become payable by the Company to its named executive officers in connection with the Plan of Sale. The Plan of Sale, which the Company s Board of Trustees has determined is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders, authorizes the Company to sell all of its remaining properties, wind-down the Company s affairs and distribute the net proceeds to shareholders. As disclosed in the Definitive Proxy, the Special Shareholder Meeting is scheduled to be held virtually on November 12, 2024 for shareholders of record at the close of business on October 1, 2024. If the Plan of Sale is approved by the Company's shareholders, the Company will adopt the liquidation basis of accounting which requires the Company's assets to be recognized at the estimated amounts expected to be collected and liabilities to be recognized at the estimated amounts at which they are expected to be settled. 
 At September 30, 2024, we have classified 1250 H Street, NW, 206 East 9th Street and Bridgepoint Square as held for sale in accordance with ASC 360. As a result of our current estimates of market value less estimated costs to sell, it was necessary to record impairment charges of 50.2 million which includes 16.3 million of impairment related to non-real estate assets. We determined these impairments based on third-party offer prices, which are level 2 inputs according to the fair value hierarchy established in ASC 820. We reduced the aggregate carrying values of these properties from 136.9 million to their estimated fair value less estimated costs to sell of 86.7 million. We evaluated each of our properties and determined there were no additional valuation adjustments necessary at September 30, 2024.

 As of September 30, 2024, approximately 2.1 of our leased square feet and 2.1 of our annualized rental revenue, determined as set forth below, are included in leases scheduled to expire through December 31, 2024. Renewal and new leases and rental rates at which available space may be relet in the future will depend on prevailing market conditions at the times these leases are negotiated. We believe that the in-place cash rents for leases expiring for the remainder of 2024, that have not been backfilled, are approximately market. Lease expirations by year, as of September 30, 2024, are as follows (square feet and dollars in thousands):

 (1) Tenants with leases expiring in multiple years are counted in each year they expire. 
 (2) Leased Square Feet as of September 30, 2024 includes space subject to leases that have commenced for revenue recognition purposes in accordance with GAAP, space being fitted out for occupancy pursuant to existing leases, and space which is leased but is not occupied or is being offered for sublease by tenants. The Leased Square Feet Expiring corresponds to the latest-expiring signed lease for a given suite. Thus, backfilled suites expire in the year stipulated by the new lease. 
 (3) Annualized rental revenue is annualized contractual rents from our tenants pursuant to leases which have commenced as of September 30, 2024, plus estimated recurring expense reimbursements; excludes lease value amortization, straight-line rent adjustments, abated (free) rent periods and parking revenue. We calculate annualized rental revenue by aggregating the recurring billings outlined above for the most recent month during the quarter reported, adding abated rent, and multiplying the sum by 12 to provide an estimation of near-term potentially-recurring revenues. Annualized rental revenue is a forward-looking non-GAAP measure. Annualized rental revenue cannot be reconciled to a comparable GAAP measure without unreasonable efforts, primarily due to the fact that it is calculated from the billings of tenants in the most recent month at the most recent rental rates during the quarter reported, whereas historical GAAP measures include billings from a potentially different group of tenants over multiple months at potentially different rental rates.

 (1) Comparable properties consist of four properties we owned continuously from July 1, 2023 to September 30, 2024. 
 (2) Other properties consist of properties sold. 
 (3) We define net operating income, or NOI, as income from our real estate including lease termination fees received from tenants less our property operating expenses. NOI excludes amortization of capitalized tenant improvement costs and leasing commissions and corporate level expenses. For a discussion of why we consider NOI to be an appropriate supplemental measure to net income as well as a reconciliation of NOI to net income, the most directly comparable financial measure under GAAP reported on our consolidated financial statements, please see the section entitled - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Property Net Operating Income (NOI). 
 Rental revenue. Rental revenue at the comparable properties decreased 1.1 million, or 8.2 , in the 2024 period, compared to the 2023 period, primarily due to a 0.6 million decrease in base rent, a 0.2 million decrease in escalations and a 0.2 million decrease in real estate tax recoveries. 
 Operating expenses. Operating expenses increased 0.1 million, or 2.1 , at the comparable properties in the 2024 period, compared to the 2023 period, primarily due to a 0.2 million increase in maintenance and repairs, a 0.1 million increase in utility expense, a 0.1 million increase in HVAC expense and 0.1 million of expense in the 2024 period to prepare the properties for sale, partially offset by a 0.2 million decrease in real estate tax expense and a 0.2 million decrease in pre-leasing demolition costs. 
 Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization decreased 0.2 million, or 5.0 in the 2024 period, compared to the 2023 period, primarily due to acceleration of depreciation and amortization related to a lease contraction in the prior period and a decrease in occupancy. 
 General and administrative. General and administrative expenses increased 1.8 million, or 25.8 in the 2024 period, compared to the 2023 period, primarily due to a 0.9 million increase in legal expenses, 0.5 million of severance expense in the 2024 period, a 0.2 increase in share-based compensation expense and a 0.1 million increase in payroll expense. 
 Loss on asset impairment. We recorded impairment charges of 50.2 million in the 2024 period related to 1250 H Street, NW, 206 East 9th Street and Bridgepoint Square, as a result of our current estimates of market value less estimated costs to sell. 
 Interest and other income, net. Interest and other income, net increased 0.7 million, or 2.5 in the 2024 period, compared to the 2023 period, primarily due to more interest received from higher average cash balances.

 Rental revenue. Rental revenue at the comparable properties decreased 2.0 million, or 4.9 , in the 2024 period, compared to the 2023 period, primarily due to a 1.0 million decrease in escalations, a 0.9 million decrease in base rent and a 0.5 million decrease in real estate tax recoveries, partially offset by a 0.4 million increase in lease termination fees. 
 Operating expenses. Operating expenses at the comparable properties decreased 0.8 million, or 3.9 , in the 2024 period, compared to the 2023 period primarily due to a 1.1 million decrease in pre-leasing demolition costs and a 0.6 million decrease in real estate tax expense, partially offset by a 0.3 million increase in maintenance and repairs, a 0.2 million increase in utility expense, 0.2 million of expense in the 2024 period to prepare the properties for sale, a 1.0 million increase in HVAC expense and a 1.0 million increase in landscaping expense.

 General and administrative. General and administrative expenses decreased 3.9 million, or 13.3 , in the 2024 period, compared to the 2023 period, primarily due to 6.0 million of compensation expenses related to the passing of our former chairman in the 2023 period and a 0.4 million decrease in share-based compensation expense, partially offset by a 1.3 million increase in legal expenses, 0.5 million of severance expense in the 2024 period, a 0.3 million increase in payroll expense, a 0.2 million increase in professional fees and a 0.2 million increase in bonus expense. Excluding the 6.0 million of compensation expense related to the passing of our former chairman in the 2023 period, general and administrative expenses increased 2.1 million, or 8.7 , in the 2024 period, compared to the 2023 period.

 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Our Operating Liquidity and Resources 
 On July 30, 2024, our Board of Trustees: (i) determined that it is advisable and in the best interests of our shareholders to proceed with the wind down of our operations and the liquidation of our assets in order to maximize shareholder value, and (ii) directed management to prepare proxy materials seeking shareholder approval of a plan of sale and dissolution. On October 2, 2024, we filed the Definitive Proxy with the SEC and set November 12, 2024 as the date for the Special Shareholder Meeting for shareholders of record at the close of business on October 1, 2024 to vote on the proposed Plan of Sale. The vote on these matters will materially impact our long-term capital needs and our plan to meet those needs. As of September 30, 2024, we had 2.2 billion of cash and cash equivalents. We expect to use our cash balances, cash flow from our operations and proceeds of any future property sales to fund our operations, make distributions, repurchase our common shares, make investments in our existing properties, fund tenant improvements and leasing costs and for other general business purposes. We believe our cash balances and the cash flow from our operations, as well as expected proceeds from the sale of our assets, will be sufficient to fund our ordinary course activities. 
 Our future cash flows from operating activities will depend on our ability to collect rent from our current tenants under their leases. Our ability to collect rent and generate parking revenue in the near term may continue to be adversely impacted by the market disruption caused by economic uncertainty and an overall slowdown in the office leasing market following the COVID-19 pandemic, including remote and hybrid working trends and other factors impacting the demand for office space. We cannot predict the ultimate impact of the overall slowdown in the office leasing market on our results of operations. 
 Our future cash flows from operating activities will also depend upon our: 
 ability to maintain or improve the occupancy of, and the rental rates at, our properties; and 
 ability to control operating and financing expense increases at our properties. 
 In addition, our future cash flows will also depend in part on interest income earned on our invested cash balances. 
 Volatility in energy costs and real estate taxes may cause our future operating expenses to fluctuate; however, the impact of these fluctuations is expected to be partially offset by the pass through of operating expenses to our tenants pursuant to lease terms, although there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully offset these expenses or that doing so would not negatively impact our competitive position or business. 
 Net cash flows provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities were 88.5 million, (12.7) million and (11.1) million, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 86.4 million, (4.6) million and (536.3) million, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Changes in our cash flows between 2024 and 2023 are primarily related to distributions to common shareholders and repurchase and retirement of common shares. 
 Our Investment and Financing Liquidity and Resources 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we paid an aggregate of 6.0 million of distributions on our series D preferred shares. On October 16, 2024, our Board of Trustees declared a dividend of 0.40625 per series D preferred share, which will be paid on November 15, 2024 to shareholders of record on October 31, 2024. 
 On June 18, 2024, our Board of Trustees authorized the repurchase of up to 150.0 million of our outstanding common shares from July 1, 2024 through June 30, 2025. We did not repurchase any common shares under our share repurchase program during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, we had 150.0 million of remaining availability under our share repurchase program, which expires on June 30, 2025. 
 We may utilize various types of financings, including debt or equity, to fund obligations as they become due. Although we are not currently rated by the debt rating agencies, the completion and the costs of any future debt transactions will depend primarily upon market conditions and our credit ratings at such time, if any. We have no control over market conditions. Any credit ratings will depend upon evaluations by credit rating agencies of our business practices and plans and, in particular, whether we appear to have the ability to maintain our earnings, to space any debt maturities and to balance our use of debt and equity capital so that our financial performance and leverage ratios afford us flexibility to withstand any reasonably foreseeable adverse changes.

 (1) Tenant improvements include capital expenditures to improve tenants spaces. 
 (2) Leasing costs include leasing commissions and related legal expenses. 
 (3) Building improvements generally include expenditures to replace obsolete building components and expenditures that extend the useful life of existing assets. Tenant-funded capital expenditures are excluded. 
 NON-GAAP MEASURES 
 Funds from Operations (FFO) and Normalized FFO 
 We compute FFO in accordance with standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or Nareit. Nareit defines FFO as net income, calculated in accordance with GAAP, excluding real estate depreciation and amortization, gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable property, impairment of depreciable real estate, and our portion of these items related to equity investees and noncontrolling interests. Our calculation of Normalized FFO differs from Nareit s definition of FFO because we exclude certain items that we view as nonrecurring or impacting comparability from period to period. We consider FFO and Normalized FFO to be appropriate measures of operating performance for a REIT, along with net income, net income attributable to Equity Commonwealth common shareholders and cash flow from operating activities. 
 We believe that FFO and Normalized FFO provide useful information to investors because by excluding the effects of certain historical amounts, such as depreciation expense, FFO and Normalized FFO may facilitate a comparison of our operating performance between periods and with other REITs. FFO and Normalized FFO do not represent cash generated by operating activities in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to net income, net income (loss) attributable to Equity Commonwealth common shareholders or cash flow from operating activities, determined in accordance with GAAP, or as indicators of our financial performance or liquidity, nor are these measures necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of our needs. These measures should be considered in conjunction with net income, net income (loss) attributable to Equity Commonwealth common shareholders and cash flow from operating activities as presented in our condensed consolidated statements of operations and condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. Other REITs and real estate companies may calculate FFO and Normalized FFO differently than we do.

 Property Net Operating Income (NOI) 
 We use another non-GAAP measure, property net operating income, or NOI, to evaluate the performance of our properties. We define NOI as income from our real estate including lease termination fees received from tenants less our property operating expenses. NOI excludes amortization of capitalized tenant improvement costs and leasing commissions and corporate level expenses. 
 The following table includes the reconciliation of NOI to net income, the most directly comparable financial measure under GAAP reported in our consolidated financial statements. We consider NOI to be an appropriate supplemental measure to net income because it may help to understand the operations of our properties. We use NOI internally to evaluate property level performance, and we believe that NOI provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations because it reflects only those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level and may facilitate comparisons of our operating performance between periods and with other REITs. NOI does not represent cash generated by operating activities in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, net income attributable to Equity Commonwealth common shareholders or cash flow from operating activities, determined in accordance with GAAP, or as an indicator of our financial performance or liquidity, nor is this measure necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of our needs. This measure should be considered in conjunction with net income, net income (loss) attributable to Equity Commonwealth common shareholders and cash flow from operating activities as presented in our consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of cash flows. Other REITs and real estate companies may calculate NOI differently than we do.
