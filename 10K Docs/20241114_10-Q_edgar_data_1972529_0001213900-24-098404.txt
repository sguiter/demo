Overview 

We are a fast-growing U.S.-based warehousing and
logistics service provider that offers a comprehensive package of supply-chain solutions relating to warehouse management and order fulfillment. 

With the boom of e-commerce and Internet technology,
along with the development of global supply chains, a growing number of merchants are seeking to sell their products through international
e-commerce platforms, such as Amazon and eBay. These merchants, however, are confronted with major logistical challenges because of the
complexities involved in shipping goods across borders. Specifically, when a foreign consumer places an order online, it can
take a long time for the goods to be delivered from one country to another (especially for bulky items), while facing high damage rates
and congestion during peak seasons. One of the solutions to such problems is to set up overseas warehouses, which are local storage facilities
established in a foreign country where the cross-border merchants intend to sell their goods. Cross-border e-commerce merchants can export
goods in batches in advance to overseas warehouses, which can then be delivered to overseas consumers once orders are placed via e-commerce
platforms. As a result, the delivery time and the rate of damaged and lost packages may be reduced significantly, therefore enhancing
the shopping experience of consumers. 

We provide one-stop warehousing and logistics
services to cross-border e-commerce merchants outside the U.S. who seek to sell in the U.S. market. We currently operate nine
warehouses across the country, with an aggregate gross floor area of approximately 2,765,667 square feet. Aside from a nationwide footprint
and large storage space, our warehouses are equipped with automated sorting systems, heavy-duty forklifts, and pallets and trays that
are suitable for processing bulky items. As a one-stop warehousing and logistics service provider, we offer a full spectrum of services,
including (i) customs brokerage services; (ii) transportation of merchandise to U.S. warehouses; and (iii) warehouse
management and order fulfillment services, which further include (a) product storage and retrieval, (b) product packing and
labeling, (c) kitting and repackaging, (d) order assembly and load consolidation, (e) inventory management and sales forecasting,
(f) third-party distribution coordination, and (g) other value-added services. We also provide warehousing and logistics
services to our U.S.-based commercial customers, who are typically domestic e-commerce merchants seeking efficient and reliable warehousing
and logistics solutions to support their operations. In general, the warehousing and logistics services we provide to our domestic customers
are similar to those we provide to our overseas customers. This allows us to provide integrated solutions for our customers, whether they
need domestic or international warehousing and logistics support. As of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024 and 2023, we had an active
customer base of 156, 105, and 83, respectively, for our warehousing and logistics services. 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we had total revenue of 42.5 million and 41.2 million, and net loss of 4.6 million
and net income of 2.8 million, respectively. While we do not have any subsidiaries, assets, or employees in the PRC, we generate a significant
portion of our revenue from customers based in China. During the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we generated approximately
85 and 95 of our revenue from PRC-based customers, respectively.

Our revenue increased by 1.2 million, or
3.0 , to 42.5 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 41.2 million for the same period
in 2023. The increase was due to the following factors: 

1) Revenue from our transportation services decreased by 1.2 million,
or 4.2 , due to decreases in customer order volumes. Several major customers have significantly decreased serviced volume for the three months ended September 30, 2024. 

2) Revenue from our
 warehousing services increased by 2.7 million, or 23.8 , driven by the addition of new warehouses acquired in the last fiscal
 quarter. 

3) Revenue
from other services decreased by 0.2 million, or 92 . Other revenue mainly consisted of revenue from our customs brokerage services. 

Our costs of sales mainly represented the costs
incurred for the use of third-party direct freight service carriers, such as FedEx and UPS, warehouse rental expenses, costs of labor,
and trucking expenses. Costs of sales increased by 10.1 million, or 28.0 , during the three months ended September 30,
2024, compared with the same period in 2023. The increase was driven by two main factors. First , there was a rise in freight expenses
due to higher UPS shipping charges. Second , lease expenses, employee salary and benefits, and temporary labor costs increased
as we expanded our warehouse and operations team to support growth.

our costs of sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and

Our lease expenses (primarily warehouse operating
lease expenses), freight expenses, temporary labor expenses, and salary and benefits increased significantly by 2.3 million, 3.2 million,
 2.8 million, and 1.0 million, respectively, during the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period
in 2023. The increases in lease expenses are due to the additional operating leases acquired in the last fiscal quarter. The increases
in freight expenses are due to the increase of the surcharge by FedEx. The increase in temporary labor expenses and salary and benefits
is due to the expansion of the warehouse operations. 

Our overall gross profit (loss) margin
decreased from 12.7 for the for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to (8.5 for the same period in 2024,
primarily due to the increase of the surcharge by UPS and the decreases in customer order volume, as well as some of the recently
leased warehouses that are not fully utilized. 

Operating expenses 

Our operating expenses consist primarily of general
and administrative expenses. The following table sets forth a breakdown of our general and administrative expenses for the three months
ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

Our general and administrative expenses increased
by 1.8 million, from 1.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 3.7 million for the same
period in 2024, representing an increase of 92 . The increase was due to the following factors: 

1) Office
 expenses increased by 0.6 million, or 106 , mainly due to an increase in general insurance
 by 0.5 million associated with the rapid expansion of our business. 

2) 
 Repairs and maintenance expenses increased by 0.2 million, or 109 , as a result of the growth in our transportation services. 

3) 
 Professional fees increased by 0.3 million, or 485 , mainly due to
increase of audit fees. 

Income Tax 

Our income tax expense decreased by 2.5 million
for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, mainly due to the decrease in profit before
tax by 10 million during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 

Net income (loss) 

As a result of the foregoing, our net income (loss)
for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was (4.6) million, compared with the net income of 2.8 million for
the same period in 2023, representing a decrease by 7.4 million. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

In assessing our liquidity, management monitors
and analyzes our cash on-hand, our ability to generate sufficient revenue sources in the future, and our operating and capital expenditure
commitments. As of the date of this Quarterly Report, we have financed our operations primarily through cash generated by operating activities
and capital contributions from stockholders. As of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, we had cash and restricted cash of 5.0 million
and 10.0 million, respectively, which primarily consisted of cash deposited in banks. 

Our
working capital requirements mainly consist of costs of sales and general and administrative expenses. We expect that our capital requirements
will be met by cash generated from our operating activities and financing activities. We
believe that our current cash and cash generated from our operating activities will be sufficient to meet our current and anticipated
working capital requirements and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months. We may, however, need additional cash resources
in the future if we experience changes in our business conditions or other developments.

We
had a balance of cash and restricted cash of 5.0 million as of September 30, 2024, compared with a balance of
 10.0 million as of June 30, 2024. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, changes in our cashflow were mainly
due to the following activities: 

Operating Activities 

Net cash used in operating activities was 3.6
million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to net cash provided by operating activities of 3.1 million
for the same period in 2023, representing a 6.7 million decrease in the net cash inflow provided by operating activities. The decrease
was primarily due to the following: 

(i) We
had net loss of 4.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. For the three months ended September 30, 2023,
we had net income of 2.8 million, which led to a 7.4 million decrease in net cash inflow from operating activities. 

(ii) Changes
in accounts receivable and other receivables were 0.2 million cash inflow for the three months ended September 30, 2024. For
the three months ended September 30, 2023, changes in accounts receivable and other receivables were 0.6 million cash inflow,
which led to a 0.4 million decrease in net cash outflow from operating activities. 

(iii) Changes
in accounts payable and accrued liabilities used 1.9 million net cash outflow for the three months ended September 30, 2024. For
the three months ended September 30, 2023, changes in accounts payable and accrued liabilities provided net cash outflow of 2.1 million,
which led to a 0.2 million decrease in net cash outflow from operating activities. 

(iv) Changes
in tax payable provided 0.1 million net cash outflow for the three months ended September 30, 2024. For the three months
ended September 30, 2023, changes in tax payable provided net cash inflow of 0.6 million, which led to a 0.7 million decreased
in net cash inflow from operating activities. 

(v) Changes
in non-cash items provided 2.0 million net cash inflow for the three months ended September 30, 2024. For the three months
ended September 30, 2023, changes in non-cash items provided net cash inflow of 1.0 million, which led to a 1.0 million increase
in net cash inflow from operating activities. 

Investing Activities 

Net cash used in investing activities was 1.3 million
for the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily attributable to 1.4 million cash used for the purchase of property
and equipment, 1.0 million cash used for loans extended to others, and 1.0 million proceeds received from loan repayments. 

For the three months ended September 30,
2023, net cash used in investing activities was 2.2 million, primarily attributable to 1.1 million cash used for the purchase of property
and equipment and 1.0 million used for loans extended to others. 

Financing Activities 

For the three months ended September 30,
2024, we had net cash used in financing activities of 0.05 million, which was primarily attributable to the net effects of 0.05 million
used to repay finance lease liabilities. 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2023, we had net cash provided from financing activities of 1.0 million, which was primarily
attributable to the net effects of: (i) 0.5 million collected from related parties for the repayments of loans the Company
previously advanced to them; (ii) 0.5 million lent from related parties; (iii) 0.1 million used for expenses relating to
the initial public offering; (iv) 0.05 million used to repay finance lease liabilities; and (v) 0.1 million in
capital contributions from stockholders. 

26 

Commitments and Contractual Obligations 

As of September 30, 2024, we had operating and
finance leases for office space, warehouse space, and forklifts. Lease terms expire at various dates through February 2025 to July 2034
with options to renew for varying terms at our sole discretion. We have not included these options to extend or terminate in the calculation
of ROU assets or lease liabilities, as there is no reasonable certainty, as of the date of this Quarterly Report, that these options will
be exercised. 

As of September 30, 2024, maturities of lease
liabilities for each of the following fiscal years ending June 30 and thereafter were as follows:

Other than the above leases, we did not have significant

Off-balance Sheet Commitments and Arrangements 

Other than two standby letters of credit with
Eastwest Bank in the aggregate amount of 2,061,673, we did not have during the period presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance
sheet financing arrangements as defined under the rules and regulations of the SEC, or any relationships with unconsolidated entities
or financial partnerships, including entities sometimes referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, that were established
for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As of September 30,
2024, we still have unused credit of 2,061,673 with Eastwest Bank. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The preparation of consolidated financial statements
in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
contingent assets and liabilities, each as of the date of this Quarterly Report, and revenue and expenses during the periods presented.
On an ongoing basis, management evaluates their estimates and assumptions, and the effects of any such revisions are reflected in the
financial statements in the period in which they are determined to be necessary. Management bases their estimates on historical experience
and on various other factors that they believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making
judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual outcomes could differ
materially from those estimates in a manner that could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. 

Despite that management determines that there
are no critical accounting estimates, the one that requires relatively significant estimates relates to useful lives of property and equipment. 

27 

Property and equipment are recorded at cost, less
accumulated depreciation and impairment. The estimation of useful lives impacts the level of annual depreciation expenses recorded and
the estimation is a matter of judgment based on the experience of our Company and general industry practice with similar assets. The estimated
annual deprecation rates of our property and equipment are generally as follows: 

Category 
 
 Depreciation method 
 
 Depreciation rate 
 
 Furniture and fixtures 
 
 Straight-line 
 
 7 years 
 
 Auto trucks 
 
 Straight-line 
 
 5 8 years 
 
 Trailers truck chassis 
 
 Straight-line 
 
 15 17 years 
 
 Machinery equipment 
 
 Straight-line 
 
 2 7 years 
 
 Leasehold improvements 
 
 Straight-line 
 
 Shorter of lease term or 15 years 

As of September 30, 2024 and June 30, 2024, the
historical cost of property and equipment was 16,127,139 and 14,773,842, respectively. 

We recorded depreciation expenses of 578,432
and 388,929 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Specifically, 436,368 and 324,849 of the depreciation
expenses were recorded in costs of sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 142,064 and 64,080 of
the depreciation expenses were recorded in general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,
respectively. 

Our significant accounting policies are more fully
described in Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to our unaudited consolidated financial
statements. We believe that there were no critical accounting policies that affected the preparation of such financial statements.

We are not currently involved in any material
legal proceedings. From time-to-time we are, and we anticipate that we will be, involved in legal proceedings, claims, and litigation
arising in the ordinary course of our business and otherwise. The ultimate costs to resolve any such matters could have a material adverse

Item 1A. Risk Factors 

As a smaller reporting company, we are not required

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 

The following Use of Proceeds information
relates to the registration statement on Form S-1, as amended (File Number 333-274667), for our initial public offering, which was declared
effective by the SEC on May 13, 2024. In May 2024, we completed our initial public offering in which we issued and sold an aggregate of
1,600,000 shares of common stock, at a price of 5.00 per share for 8,000,000. EF Hutton LLC was the representative of the underwriters
of our initial public offering. 

We incurred approximately 3.0 million in expenses
in connection with our initial public offering, which included approximately 600,000 in underwriting discounts, approximately 25,000
in expenses paid to or for underwriters, and approximately 2.4 million in other expenses. None of the transaction expenses included payments
to directors or officers of our Company or their associates, persons owning more than 10 or more of our equity securities or our affiliates.
None of the net proceeds we received from the initial public offering were paid, directly or indirectly, to any of our directors or officers
or their associates, persons owning 10 or more of our equity securities or our affiliates. 

The net proceeds raised from the initial public
offering were 5,214,851 after deducting underwriting discounts and the offering expenses payable by us. As of the date of this Quarterly
Report, we have used approximately 4,000,000 for working capital and other general corporate purposes in support of our current business.
We intend to use the remaining proceeds from our initial public offering in the manner disclosed in our registration statement.
