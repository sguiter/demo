The
condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 have been prepared by
us without audit pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission SEC ). In the opinion
of management, all adjustments necessary to present fairly our financial position at September 30, 2024, and our results of operations,
changes in stockholders equity, and cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, have been made. Those
adjustments consist of normal and recurring adjustments. The condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023, has been
derived from the audited consolidated condensed balance sheet as of that date. We operate a single reporting segment and, accordingly,
use our consolidated net income as our measure of profit and loss and it is not presented separately here. 

Certain
information and note disclosures, including a detailed discussion about the Company s significant accounting policies, normally
included in our annual consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have been
condensed or omitted. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with a reading of the consolidated
financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, as
filed with the SEC on April 15, 2024 Form 10-K ).

(see also the discussion under Net Revenues in Results of Operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 in Part
I, Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations). 

Change
in Accounting Estimate 

In accordance with its policy, the Company periodically reviews the
stand-alone selling prices of its performance obligations under Revenue from Contracts with Customers ASC Topic 606 for use in allocating the contract prices. As a result, effective April 1, 2024, the Company updated the methodology for determining the
value of program design and consulting services from the residual method to using an adjusted market assessment approach. The effect of
this change in estimate was immaterial to the results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, but may become material
in future periods. 

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments 

Fair
value is defined as the price that would be received upon the sale of an asset or paid upon the transfer of a liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants at the measurement date and in the principal or most advantageous market for that asset or liability.
The fair value should be calculated based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, not on
assumptions specific to the entity. In addition, the fair value of liabilities should include consideration of non-performance risk including
our own credit risk. 

In
addition to defining fair value, the disclosure requirements around fair value establish a fair value hierarchy for valuation inputs,
which is expanded. The hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three levels based on the extent to which inputs used in measuring fair
value are observable in the market. Each fair value measurement is reported in one of the three levels, which is determined by the lowest
level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. These levels are: 

Level
1 Inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets. 

Level
2 Inputs are based upon significant observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for
identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions
are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. 

Level
3 Inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect management s estimates of assumptions that market participants
would use in pricing the asset or liability. The fair values are therefore determined using model-based techniques that include option
pricing models, discounted cash flow models, and similar techniques. The Company s stock options and warrants are valued using
Level 3 inputs. 

The
Company s carrying amounts of financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable,
and other current liabilities, approximate their fair values due to their short maturities.

and at September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. Amounts billed in advance
of revenue recognition are presented as deferred revenue on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. 

Revenues
are primarily generated from content delivery activities in which the Company delivers financial, clinical, or brand messaging through
a distribution network of ePrescribers and electronic health record technology providers (channel partners), directly to consumers, or
from reselling services that complement the business. This content delivery for a customer is referred to as a program. Unless otherwise
specified, revenue is recognized based on the selling price to customers. The Company s contracts are generally less than one year
and the primary performance obligation is delivery of messages, or content, but the contract may contain additional services. Additional
services may include program design, which is the design of the content delivery program, set up, and reporting. 

We
consider set up and reporting services to be complimentary to the primary performance obligation and recognized through performance of
the delivery of content. We consider program design and related consulting services to be performance obligations separate from the delivery
of messages. Revenue is recognized at the point in time when the work product is delivered to the customer. The net contract balance
for contracts in progress at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, was and , respectively. The outstanding
performance obligations are expected to be satisfied during the year ended December 31, 2024. 

In
certain circumstances, the Company will offer sales rebates to customers based on spend volume. Rebates are contracted based on a quarterly
or annual spend amount and on a volume threshold or tiered model. At the beginning of the year, the rebate percentage is estimated based
on input from the sales team and analysis of prior year sales. Thereafter, the open contract balance for the customer is assessed quarterly
to ensure the estimated rebate percentage being used for the rebate accrual remains reasonable. The estimated amount of variable consideration
will be included in the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative
revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. For the year
ended 2023 and during the first nine months of 2024, there were two contracts with customers that included a rebate clause.

Total Revenue 

Accounts receivable are reported at realizable
value, net of allowances for credit losses, which is estimated and recorded in the period the related revenue is recorded. The Company
does not seek collateral to secure its accounts receivable and amounts billed are generally due within a short period of time based on
terms and conditions normal for our industry. The Company has a standardized approach to estimate and review the collectability of its
receivables based on a number of factors, including the period they have been outstanding. Historical collection and payer reimbursement
experience is an integral part of the estimation process related to allowances for credit losses. In addition, the Company regularly assesses
the state of its billing operations in order to identify issues, which may impact the collectability of these receivables or reserve estimates.
If current or expected future economic trends, events, or changes in circumstances indicate that specific receivable balances may be impaired,
further consideration is given to the collectability of those balances and the allowance is adjusted accordingly. Past-due receivable
balances are written off when the Company s collection efforts have been exhausted.

Forward-Looking
Statements 

This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains statements that relate to future events and expectations and, as such, constitute forward-looking
statements, within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Certain statements, other than purely historical
information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to our strategies, outlook, business and financial prospects, business
plans, objectives, and expected operating results, and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, are forward-looking
statements. These forward-looking statements generally are identified by the words believes, project, 
 expects, anticipates, estimates, intends, strategy, plan, 
 may, will, would, will be, will continue, will likely result, 
and similar expressions. 

Forward-looking
statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results
to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance. Although
OptimizeRx believes that the expectations reflected in any forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, these expectations
may not be attained and it is possible that actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements
due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and changes in circumstances, many of which are beyond OptimizeRx s control. 

Forward-looking
statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those expressed in or implied by such
forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors, including: our history of losses, seasonal trends in the pharmaceutical brand
marketing industry; the inability to support our technology and scale our operations successfully, developing and implementing new and
updated applications, features and services for our solutions may be more difficult and expensive and take longer than expected; the
inability to offer high-quality customer support for our solutions; dependence on a concentrated group of customers; inability to maintain
contracts with electronic prescription platforms, agreements with electronic prescription platforms and electronic health record systems
being subject to audit; inability to attract and retain customers; inability to comply with laws and regulations that affect the healthcare
industry; competition; developments in the healthcare industry; inability to manage growth; inability to identify suitable acquisition
targets, complete acquisitions, or integrate acquisitions successfully; acquisition activities may disrupt ongoing business and may involve
increased expenses; inability to realize the financial and strategic goals contemplated at the time of a transaction; inability to realize
any synergies or other anticipated benefits of an acquisition or that such synergies or benefits may take longer than anticipated to
be realized; risk that the integration with an acquired entity may be more costly or difficult than expected; impairment charges for
goodwill or other intangible assets may be increased as we shift our focus away from our non-core businesses; inability to comply with
the restrictions in our credit agreement; inability to generate sufficient cash to service debt and fund other obligations; inability
to attract and retain senior management and other key employees; economic, political, regulatory and other risks arising from our international
operations; inability to protect our intellectual property; cybersecurity incidents; reduction in the performance, reliability and availability
of our network infrastructure; increases in costs due to inflation and other adverse economic conditions; decreases in customer demand
due to macroeconomic factors; lack of a consistent active trading market for our common stock; volatility in the market price of our
common stock; and the failure to remediate the identified material weakness or any other material weaknesses identified in the future. 

The
risks and uncertainties included here are not exhaustive. Further information concerning our business, including additional factors that
could materially affect our financial results, is included herein and in our other filings with the SEC, including our Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Moreover, we operate in a rapidly changing and competitive environment. New risk
factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors. 

Further,
it is not possible to assess the effect of all risk factors on our businesses or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors,
may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties,
investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. In addition, we disclaim any
obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that occur after the date of this report.

Overview 

We
are a digital health technology company enabling care-focused engagement between life sciences organizations, healthcare providers, and
patients at critical junctures throughout the patient care journey. Connecting over two million U.S. healthcare providers and millions
of their patients through an intelligent omnichannel technology platform embedded within a proprietary point-of-care network, as well
as mass digital communications channels, OptimizeRx helps life sciences organizations engage and support their customers. 

Historically,
our revenue was generated primarily through the facilitation of various types of messages to health care providers via their EHR systems
and ERx platforms using the OptimizeRx proprietary network to solve the ever-increasing communication barriers between pharmaceutical
representatives and healthcare providers that have presented in the rapidly changing healthcare industry. Over time, the demand for different
types of communication and marketing solutions among life sciences organizations, healthcare providers, and patients led us to expand
upon our initial solutions to increase the variety of health-related information we deliver, as well as the platforms, technology, media
distribution channels, and audiences through and to which we deliver. In addition, the October 2023 acquisition of Medicx Health provided
the Company with a significant footprint for direct-to-consumer healthcare marketing. Today, we offer diverse tech-enabled marketing
solutions through our AI-generated DAAP, using sophisticated machine-learning algorithms to find the best audiences in the correct channels
at the right time. Customers are able to execute traditional marketing campaigns on our proprietary digital point-of-care network, as
well as dynamic marketing campaigns that optimize audiences in real time to increase the value of treatment information for healthcare
professionals and patients in response to clinical care events. We employ a land and expand strategy focused on growing
our existing client base and generating greater and more consistent revenues in part through the continued shift in our business model
toward enterprise level engagements, while also broadening our omnichannel network. Our strategy for driving revenue growth is also expected
to work in tandem with our efforts to increase margin and profitability as revenue drivers such as DAAP have inherently higher margins
than most other messaging solutions we offer. 

Customer
Concentration 

Because
the pharmaceutical industry is dominated by large companies with multiple brands, our revenue is concentrated in a relatively small number
of companies. We have approximately 100 pharmaceutical companies as customers, and our revenues are concentrated in these customers.
Loss of one of more of our larger customers could have a negative impact on our operating results. Our top five customers represented
approximately 44 and 39 of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. In each of 2023 and
2022, we had one customer that each represented more than 10 of our revenues. 

Seasonality 

In
general, the pharmaceutical brand marketing industry experiences seasonal trends that affect the vast majority of participants in the
pharmaceutical digital marketing industry. Many pharmaceutical companies allocate the largest portion of their brand marketing to the
fourth quarter of the calendar year. As a result, the first quarter tends to reflect lower activity levels and lower revenue, with gradual
increases in the following quarters. We generally expect these seasonality trends to continue and our ability to effectively manage our
resources in anticipation of these trends may affect our operating results. 

Impact
of Macroeconomic Events 

Unfavorable
conditions in the economy may negatively affect the growth of our business and our results of operations. For example, macroeconomic
events including volatility of inflation and interest rates have led to economic uncertainty. In addition, high levels of employee turnover
across the pharmaceutical industry as well as a fewer number of U.S. drug approvals could create additional uncertainty within our target
customer markets. Historically, during periods of economic uncertainty and downturns, businesses may slow spending, which may impact
our business and our customers businesses. Adverse changes in demand could impact our business, collection of accounts receivable
and our expected cash flow generation, which may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.

Key Performance
Indicators 

We
monitor the following key performance indicators to help us evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting
our business and make strategic decisions. We have updated the definition of top 20 pharmaceutical manufacturers in our
key performance indicators to be based upon Fierce Pharma s most updated list of The top 20 pharma companies by 2023 revenue .
We previously used The top 20 pharma companies by 2022 revenue . As a result of this change, prior periods have been restated
for comparative purposes. 

Average
revenue per top 20 pharmaceutical manufacturer. Average revenue per top 20 pharmaceutical manufacturer is calculated by taking the
total revenue the Company recognized through pharmaceutical manufacturers listed in Fierce Pharma s The top 20 pharma companies
by 2023 revenue over the last twelve months, divided by the total number of the aforementioned pharmaceutical manufacturers that
our solutions helped support over that time period. The Company uses this metric to monitor its progress in landing and expanding 
with key customers within its largest customer vertical and believe it also provides investors with a transparent way to chart our progress
in penetrating this important customer segment. The increase in the average in twelve months ended September 30, 2024 as compared
to the twelve months ended September 30, 2023 is primarily the result of stronger DAAP related revenue streams and the Company s
October 2023 acquisition of Medicx Health, which added to 2024 revenues and was not included in the 2023 amounts (in thousands).

manufacturers included in the aforementioned list. The Company uses this metric to monitor its progress in penetrating key customers
within its largest customer vertical and believes it also provides investors with a transparent way to chart our progress in penetrating
this important customer segment. Our penetration within this core customer group stayed consistent from the twelve months ended September 30,
2023 to the twelve months ended September 30, 2024.

Net
revenue retention. Net revenue retention is a comparison of revenue generated from all customers in the previous twelve-month period
to total revenue generated from the same customers in the following twelve-month period (i.e., excludes new customer relationships for
the most recent twelve-month period). The Company uses this metric to monitor its ability to improve its penetration with existing customers
and believes it also provides investors with a metric to chart our ability to increase our year-over-year penetration and revenue with
existing customers. The retention rate in the twelve months ended September 30, 2024 was higher due to increased adoption of DAAP
year over year as well as the acquisition of Medicx Health in the fourth quarter of 2023.

twelve months divided by the average number of employees over the last twelve months (i.e., the average between the number of FTEs at
the end of the reported period and the number of FTEs at the end of the same period of the prior year). The Company uses this metric
to monitor the productivity of its workforce and its ability to scale efficiently over time and believes the metric provides investors
with a way to chart our productivity and scalability. Our revenue rate per employee increased year over year due to revenue growing at
a higher rate than the average number of FTEs over the last 12 month period (in thousands).

Net
Revenues 

Net
revenue reported for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately 21,309, an increase of approximately 30 over
the approximately 16,331 from the same period in 2023. Our net revenue reported for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was
approximately 59,811, an increase of approximately 39 over the approximately 43,153 from the same period in 2023. The increase in
net revenue was as a result of the impact of the fourth quarter 2023 acquisition of Medicx Health, which was not included in the prior
year numbers, plus growth of DAAP related sales. The increases in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 were partially
offset by a reduction of approximately 1,088 and 4,169, respectively, as a result of the disposal of our non-core Access solutions
and the sale of certain non-core solutions-related contracts in the fourth quarter of 2023. 

Net revenues of 23,852 and 68,603, as shown
in the pro forma financial consolidated statement of operations data table in Note 1 above, includes 1,088 and 4,169 related to the
Access and other non-core solutions revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to 21,309 and 59,811
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, for which no Access or other non-core solutions revenue was recorded. 

Cost
of Revenues 

Our
cost of revenues, comprised primarily of revenue share expense paid to our network partners as well as costs associated with licensing
data from third parties, was approximately 7,862 or 36.9 of net revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared
to 6,531 or 40.0 of net revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and was approximately 22,456 or 38 of net revenues
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 18,094 or 42 of net revenues for the nine months ended September 30,
2023. 

The
changes in cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues was a result of solution and channel mix. Additional discussion is included in
the Gross Margin section below. 

Gross
Margin 

Our
gross margin, which is the difference between our revenues and our cost of revenues, was approximately 13,447 or 63.1 of net revenues
for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 9,800 or 60.0 of net revenues for the three months ended September 30,
2023 and was approximately 37,355 or 62.5 of net revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 25,059 or
58.1 of net revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

22 

We
had higher third quarter revenues compared to the same year ago period due to the fourth quarter 2023 acquisition of Medicx Health and
growth in our DAAP related sales, leading to increased gross margin. Our overall margin percentage improved, compared with a year ago,
as a result of an increased delivery of higher margin revenue solutions, such as DAAP and Medicx Audience Activation MAA ),
and using more cost-effective channel partnerships. 

Operating
Expenses 

Operating expenses increased to approximately 22,009 for the three
months ended September 30, 2024 from approximately 13,353 for the same period in 2023, an increase of approximately 65 . For the
nine months ended September 30, 2024 operating expenses were approximately 54,695 compared to approximately 40,557 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2023, an increase of 35 . The detail by major category is reflected in the table below (in thousands).

Stock-based compensation decreased from approximately
 3,206 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to approximately 2,604 for the three months ended September 30, 2024,
and decreased from approximately 11,090 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to approximately 8,530 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2024. The decrease in both periods was a result of the lower grant date fair value of awards due to declines
in the Company s stock price as well as fewer equity awards made in such periods. 

Depreciation
and amortization increased from approximately 467 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to approximately 1,095 for the
three months ended September 30, 2024, and increased from approximately 1,395 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023,
to approximately 3,235 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The increase in both periods was a result of the additional
amortization associated with the identifiable intangibles arising from the Medicx Health acquisition. 

The Company recorded goodwill impairment in the
amount of 7.5 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024. This amount represents the excess of the book value of the Company s
equity over the estimated fair value. 

Other general and administrative expenses increased
from approximately 9,680 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to approximately 10,821 for the three months ended September 30,
2024, and increased from approximately 28,072 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to approximately 35,441 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2024. This increase in both periods is primarily a result of increases in compensation expense, due to
additional headcount as a result of the Medicx Health acquisition, increasing salary, bonus, and commission expense. There was also an
increase in contractors and consultants. 

Other
income (expense) 

Interest
expense was approximately 1,524 and 4,597 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and represents interest charges
on our Term Loan, which was raised to partially fund the acquisition of Medicx Health in the fourth quarter of 2023, together with the
amortization of the related issuance costs. 

Other
income was 38 and 113 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and represents a reduction in the estimated amount
due as a result of a supplier related payment contingency. 

23 

Interest income decreased from approximately 688
for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to approximately 107 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and from
approximately 2,074 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to approximately 231 for the nine months ended September 30,
2024. The decrease was a result of lower invested balances as we realized short-term investments during 2023 in order to partially fund
the acquisition of Medicx Health. 

Income tax expense 

Income tax benefit was approximately 817, or an effective rate of
8.2 , and 1,561, or an effective rate of 7.2 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. For further
information, see Part I, Item I. Financial Statements; Note 13 Income Taxes in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Net Loss 

We had a net loss of approximately 9,124 for
the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to a net loss of approximately 2,865 during the three months ended September 30,
2023 and approximately 20,032 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to 13,424 for the nine months ended September 30,
2023. The reasons and specific components associated with the change are discussed above. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Historically,
our primary sources of liquidity have been cash receipts from customers and proceeds from equity offerings, in addition, during the year
ended December 31, 2023, the Company entered into a Term loan of 40.0 million in order to partially fund the acquisition of Medicx
Health. As of September 30, 2024, the total principal balance outstanding on the Term loan was approximately 36.8 million
and we were in compliance with all of the financial covenants of the Term loan. 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had total current assets of approximately 46.9 million, compared with current liabilities of approximately
 14.5 million, resulting in working capital of approximately 32.4 million and a current ratio of approximately 3.2 to 1. This represents
a decrease from our working capital of approximately 36.4 million, whilst maintaining the same current ratio at 3.0 to 1 when compared
to December 31, 2023. This decrease in our working capital is discussed in more detail below. 

We
believe that funds generated from operations, together with existing cash, will be sufficient to finance our current operations and meet
our obligations under the Term loan for the next twelve (12) months. In addition, we believe we can generate the cash needed to operate
beyond the next 12 months from operations. However, we may seek additional debt, equity financing, or lines of credit to supplement cash
from operations to fund acquisitions or strategic partner relationships, make capital expenditures, and satisfy working capital needs. 

Cash Flows 

Following
is a table with summary data from the consolidated statements of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,
as presented (in thousands).

2023. We had a net loss of 20,032 for the first nine months of 2024, which included non-cash expenses of 18,176. This was offset by
cash generated through improved working capital management. 

24 

Cash
used by investing activities was approximately 330 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We invested in internally developed
software in the amount of 235 and spent 95 on property and equipment. Cash provided by investing activities for the same period in
the prior year was 664 as we made a net investment of 2,311 in treasury bills and invested 1,561 in internally developed software. 

Cash used for financing activities was approximately
 2,087, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. We used 587 to pay withholding taxes on behalf of employees vesting in
restricted stock units and made repayments totaling 1,500 on our Term loan. Cash used for financing activities for the same period in
prior year was 7,969, primarily related to the repurchase of 526,999 shares of our common stock for approximately 7,522. The remaining
amount arose from paying withholding taxes on behalf of employees vesting in restricted stock units, partially offset by the receipt of
funds from the exercise of stock options. 

Critical
Accounting Estimates 

We prepare our condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States GAAP ). The preparation of these financial statements
requires the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Estimates and assumptions have been made
in determining the allowance for credit losses, carrying value of assets, fair values assigned to acquired long-lived assets, depreciable
and amortizable lives of tangible and intangible assets, the carrying value of liabilities, the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets,
the timing of revenue recognition and related revenue-share expenses, and inputs used in the calculation of stock-based compensation.
Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. 

Our
significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the year ended December 31, 2023 (2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K). The accounting policies we used in preparing these financial
statements are substantially consistent with those we applied in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Goodwill 

We
evaluate goodwill for impairment during our fiscal fourth quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change. 

The use of different assumptions, estimates, or
judgments in the goodwill impairment testing process may significantly increase or decrease the estimated fair value of a reporting unit.
Generally, changes in DCF estimates would have a similar effect on the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. 

During the third quarter of 2024, the Company
experienced sustained decreases in its stock price and market capitalization. Accordingly, the Company conducted a quantitative impairment
test of its goodwill as of September 30, 2024. The Company estimated fair value by weighting the results from a market approach and an
income approach. Significant assumptions inherent in the valuation methodologies included, but are not limited to, prospective financial
information, discount rate, and comparable multiples from publicly traded companies in the same industry. The assessment resulted in a
non-cash impairment charge of 7.5 million. 

Our
critical accounting estimates are described in Management s Discussion and Analysis included in the 2023 Annual Report on Form
10-K.

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements 

In
November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07 ASU 2023-07 ), Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable
Segment Disclosures. ASU 2023-07 requires annual and interim disclosures that are expected to improve reportable segment disclosures,
primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The provisions of ASU 2023-07 are effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted.
We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2023-07. 

In

improve the effectiveness of income tax disclosures. The provisions of ASU 2023-09 are effective for annual periods beginning after December
15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2023-09. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

The
Company has contracts with various electronic health records systems and ePrescribe platforms, whereby we agree to share a portion of
the revenue we generate for eCoupons or banners through their network. From time to time, the Company enters into arrangements with a
partner to acquire minimum amounts of media, data or messaging capabilities. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had commitments
for future minimum payments of approximately 16.7 million that will be reflected in cost of revenues during the remainder of 2024 and
years 2025 through 2028. 

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

Not
applicable. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures 

We
maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in reports
filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities
and Exchange Commission s rules and forms and accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 

Our
management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation, as of the
end of the period covered by this report, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in
Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e). Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as
of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e), were not effective
at the reasonable assurance level due to a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting which was disclosed in
our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

To address the material weakness referenced above,
the Company performed additional analysis and performed other procedures in order to prepare the condensed consolidated financial statements
in accordance with GAAP. Accordingly, management believes that the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this quarterly
report on this Form 10-Q fairly present, in all material respects, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the
periods presented. 

26 

Plan
for Remediation of Material Weakness 

Management
is actively engaged in the planning for, and implementation of, remediation efforts to address the material weakness identified above.
Management intends to implement the following remediation steps: 

a. The
 Company will require each third-party service organization to provide a SOC-1, Type 2 report
 to the Company for management to review and make adjustments to the remediation plans, as
 necessary. 

b. If
 a SOC-1, Type 2 report is not available, the Company will evaluate each third-party s
 relevant system(s) and reporting directly through inquiry and substantive testing of such
 third-party s control environment. 

c. If
 the Company is unable to obtain a valid SOC-1 Type 2 report or perform substantive testing
 of such third-party service organization s control environment, the Company will implement
 a qualification and program triaging process, which would include modifying customer contracts,
 limiting the volume of activity with those third-parties and establishing other controls
 to ensure the completeness and accuracy of information received from those third-parties,
 such as performing tagging procedures where possible. 

Management
believes the measures described above will remediate the material weakness that we have identified. During the quarter ended September 30,
2024, the Company continued to engage with the third-party service organizations to discuss the reporting requirements. As management
continues to evaluate and improve our disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting, the Company
may decide to take additional measures to address control deficiencies or determine to modify certain of the remediation measures identified. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Except
as noted above, there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange
Act), that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

Limitations
on the Effectiveness of Controls 

A
control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of
the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the
benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system,
misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. The Company conducts periodic evaluations of its internal controls
to enhance, where necessary, its procedures and controls.
