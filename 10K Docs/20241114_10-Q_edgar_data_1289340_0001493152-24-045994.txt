 NOTES
TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 (Unaudited) 

Notes
to Financial Statements 

In
this report, Stereotaxis , the Company , Registrant , we , us , and
 our refer to Stereotaxis, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries. Genesis RMN , Niobe , Navigant ,
Odyssey , Odyssey Cinema , Vdrive , Vdrive Duo , V-CAS , V-Loop , V-Sono ,
QuikCAS , Cardiodrive , MAGiC , and Map-iT catheters are trademarks of Stereotaxis, Inc. All other
trademarks that appear in this report are the property of their respective owners. 

We
have arrangements with fluoroscopy system manufacturers to provide such systems in a bundled purchase offer for hospitals establishing
robotic interventional operating rooms. These are single-plane, full-power x-ray systems and include the c-arm and powered table. The
combination of RMN Systems with our partnered x-ray systems reduces the cost of acquisition, the ongoing cost of ownership, and the complexity
of installation of a robotic electrophysiology practice. 

We
promote our full suite of products in a typical hospital implementation, subject to regulatory approvals or clearances. This implementation
requires a hospital to agree to an upfront capital payment and recurring payments. The upfront capital payment typically includes equipment
and installation charges. The recurring payments typically include disposable costs for each procedure, equipment service costs beyond
the warranty period, and ongoing software updates. In hospitals where our full suite of products has not been implemented, equipment
upgrade or expansion can be implemented upon purchasing of the necessary upgrade or expansion. 

We
have received regulatory clearances and approvals necessary for us to market the Genesis RMN System in the U.S. and Europe, and
we are in the process of obtaining necessary registrations for extending our markets in other countries. The Niobe System, our
prior generation robotic magnetic navigation system, the Odyssey Solution, Cardiodrive , e-Contact, and various disposable
interventional devices have received regulatory clearances and approvals in the U.S., Europe, Canada, China, Japan and various other
countries. We have regulatory clearances and approvals that allow us to market the Vdrive and Vdrive Duo Systems with the V-CAS device
in the U.S., Canada and Europe. We are pursuing regulatory approvals for the Stereotaxis MAGiC catheter, a robotically-navigated magnetic
ablation catheter designed to perform minimally invasive cardiac ablation procedures, in various global geographies. Approval processes
can be lengthy and uncertain, submissions may require revised or additional non-clinical and clinical data, and regulatory applications
could be denied. 

We
have strategic relationships with technology leaders and innovators in the global interventional market. Through these strategic relationships
we provide compatibility between our robotic magnetic navigation system, x-ray systems, and digital imaging and 3D catheter location
sensing technology, as well as disposable interventional devices. The maintenance of these strategic relationships, or the establishment
of equivalent alternatives, is critical to our commercialization efforts. There are no guarantees that any existing strategic relationships
will continue, and efforts are ongoing to ensure the availability of compatible systems and devices and/or equivalent alternatives. We
cannot provide assurance as to the timeline of the ongoing availability of such compatible systems or our ability to obtain equivalent
alternatives on competitive terms or at all. 

On
July 31, 2024, the Company completed its acquisition of all the shares of capital stock of Access Point Technologies EP, Inc., a
Minnesota corporation APT ), from APT Holding Company, Inc., a Minnesota corporation. APT, based in Rogers, Minnesota,
designs, manufactures, and commercializes a portfolio of differentiated high-quality diagnostic catheters used during cardiac
ablation procedures that are commercially available across key global geographies. 

The integration with APT provides
in-house catheter development, manufacturing expertise and specialized knowledge that will further Stereotaxis 
innovation efforts in developing a broad family of interventional devices navigated by our robots within electrophysiology
and across a range of endovascular procedures. 

In
addition to the aforementioned macroeconomic factors, the COVID-19 pandemic negatively affected, and any resurgence of a variant of COVID-19
or any similar occurrences may in the future negatively affect demand for both our systems and our disposable products. In the past,
we have experienced business disruptions, including travel restrictions on us and our third-party distributors, which negatively affected
our complex sales, marketing, installation, distribution and service network relating to our products and services. We also experienced
reductions in demand for our disposable products as our healthcare customers (physicians and hospitals) re-prioritized the treatment
of patients and diverted resources away from non-coronavirus areas, leading to the performance of fewer procedures in which our disposable
products are used. Significant decreases to our capital or recurring revenues could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating
results, and financial condition. While we cannot reliably estimate the ultimate duration of the impact or the severity of ongoing periodic
resurgences of pandemic-related issues, we continue to anticipate periodic disruptions to our manufacturing operations, supply chains,
procedures volumes, service activities, and capital system orders and placements, any of which could have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. The impact has varied widely over time by individual geography. 

As
a result of the acquisition, we will be managing APT s ongoing business of manufacturing, commercializing, development and
sales of APT s catheters and related products and services. The manufacturing process of catheters is complex, highly
technical, and our prior experience in this field is dated. The process can be subject to periodic worldwide supply chain
disruptions, including labor shortages and inflationary pressures, and logistics delays which make it difficult for us to source
parts and ship our products. We may require a higher level of overhead than currently anticipated. Our ability to successfully
manage this new aspect of our business will depend, in part, upon management s ability to design and implement strategic
initiatives that address not only the integration of APT into us, but also the increased scope of the combined business with its
associated increased costs and complexity. We are still integrating the businesses and implementing safeguards to minimize any
negative impacts on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows post-acquisition.

million and million as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

Amortized
cost of U.S. treasury securities and marketable debt securities are based on the Company s purchase price adjusted for accrual
of discount, or amortization of premium, and recognition of impairment charges, if any. The amortized cost of securities the Company
purchases at a discount or premium will equal the face or par value at maturity or the call date, if applicable. Stated interest on investments
is reported as income when earned and is adjusted for amortization or accretion of any premium or discount. 

The
Company segments its portfolio based on the underlying risk profiles of the securities and has a zero-loss expectation for U.S. treasury
and U.S. government agency securities. The Company regularly reviews the securities using the probability of default method and analyzes
the unrealized loss positions and evaluates the current expected credit loss by considering factors such as credit ratings, issuer-specific
factors, current economic conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. 

million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and approximately million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.
Revenue from system delivery and installation represented 
and 
of revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. 

Disposables: 

Revenue
from sales of disposable products is recognized when control is transferred to the customers, which generally occurs at the time of shipment,
but can also occur at the time of delivery depending on the customer arrangement. Disposable products are covered by an assurance type warranty that provides for the return of defective products. Warranty
costs were not material for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023. Disposable revenue represented and of revenue
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. 

Royalty: 

The
Company receives royalties on the sale of various devices as provided by co-development and co-placement arrangements with various manufacturers.
Royalty revenue represented less than of revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023. 

Other
Recurring Revenue: 

Other
recurring revenue includes revenue from product maintenance plans, service-type warranties, other post warranty maintenance, and the
implied obligation to provide software enhancements if and when available for a specified period, typically one year following installation
of our systems. Revenue from services and software enhancements, service-type warranties, and the implied obligation to provide software
enhancements are deferred and amortized over the service or update period, which is typically one year. Revenue related to services performed
on a time-and-materials basis is recognized when performed. Other recurring revenue represented and of revenue for the nine months
ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. 

Disposables, service and accessories 

Total revenue 

Transaction
price allocated to remaining performance obligations relates to amounts allocated to products and services for which the revenue has
not yet been recognized. A significant portion of this amount relates to the Company s systems contracts and obligations that will
be recognized as revenue in future periods. These obligations are generally satisfied within two years after contract inception but may
occasionally extend longer. Transaction price representing revenue to be earned on remaining performance obligations on system contracts
was approximately million as of September 30, 2024. Performance obligations arising from contracts for disposables and service
are generally expected to be satisfied within one year after entering into the contract. 

Customer deposits

Deferred service and license fees 

Total deferred revenue 

Less: Long-term deferred revenue 

Total current deferred revenue 

The
Company invoices its customers based on the billing schedules in its sales arrangements. Contract assets primarily represent the difference
between the revenue that was earned but not billed on service contracts and revenue from system contracts that was recognized based on
the relative selling price of the related performance obligations and the contractual billing terms in the arrangements. Customer deposits
primarily relate to future system sales but can also include deposits on disposable sales. Deferred revenue is primarily related to service
contracts, for which the service fees are billed up-front, generally quarterly or annually, and for amounts billed in advance for system
contracts for which some performance obligations remain outstanding. For service contracts, the associated deferred revenue is generally
recognized ratably over the service period. For system contracts, the associated deferred revenue is recognized when the remaining performance
obligations are satisfied. The Company did not have any impairment losses on its contract assets for the periods presented. 

Revenue
recognized for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, that was included in the deferred revenue balance at the beginning
of each reporting period was million and million, respectively. 

million as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023. The Company did not incur any impairment losses during any of the
periods presented. 

Costs
of systems revenue include direct product costs, installation labor and other costs including estimated assurance-type warranty costs,
and initial training costs, when applicable. These costs are recognized at the time of sale. Costs of disposable revenue include direct
product costs and estimated warranty costs and are recognized at the time of sale. Cost of revenue from services and license fees are
recognized when incurred. 

; 2) expected volatility of based on the Company s historical volatility; 3)
risk-free interest rate based on the Treasury yield on the date of grant; and 4) expected term of years. The resulting compensation
expense is recognized over the requisite service period, which is generally four years. Restricted shares and units granted to employees
and non-employee directors are valued at the fair market value at the date of grant. The Company amortizes the fair market value to expense
over the service period, which is generally four years except for grants to directors which are generally earned over a period of six
months. If the shares are subject to performance objectives, the resulting compensation expense is amortized over the anticipated vesting
period and is subject to adjustment based on the actual achievement of objectives. 

For
market-based awards, stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the minimum service period regardless of whether or not the
market target is probable of being achieved. The fair value of such awards is estimated on the grant date using Monte Carlo simulations. 

Shares
purchased by employees under the 2022 Employee Stock Purchase Plans are considered to be non-compensatory.

The
Company did not include any portion of unearned restricted shares, outstanding options, stock appreciation rights, warrants or convertible
preferred stock in the calculation of diluted loss per common share because all such securities are anti-dilutive for all periods presented.
The application of the two-class method of computing earnings per share under general accounting principles for participating securities
is not applicable during these periods because those securities do not contractually participate in its losses.

rights at a weighted average exercise price of per share, shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of our

shares of its common stock (the Upfront Stock Consideration with a value of 
million. The Share Purchase Agreement obligated us to file a resale registration statement relating to the Upfront Stock
Consideration and additional Earnout Shares. The registration statement covered the 
Closing Shares and an estimated 
additional Earnout Shares. However, the exact number of shares that may be issued under the Share Purchase Agreement for
such milestones will be calculated based on the average of the closing per share price of Stereotaxis common stock immediately prior
to the dates such revenue performance and/or regulatory milestones are achieved, up to 
million in total value through September 30, 2029, not to exceed 
of the total number of shares of the Company s common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to July 31, 2024 (the Share Cap
Limitation ). In addition, the vesting of the right to receive the Earnout Shares would be accelerated in the event of a
change of control of Stereotaxis, based on a probability-weighted average estimate of the potential to achieve any remaining
milestones, discounted to its net present value taking into account expected time when earnouts related to the milestones would
become payable through September 30, 2029. The preliminary estimated fair value of the contingent consideration related to the
additional earnout shares at the acquisition date is .
The total contingent consideration including the upfront payment is preliminarily estimated to be .

The
above purchase price allocation is preliminary and subject to revision as additional information about the fair value of individual
assets and liabilities becomes available. The preliminary measurement of contingent consideration, accounts receivable, inventory,
prepaid expenses and other current assets, property and equipment, intangible assets, goodwill, accounts payable, and accrued
liabilities are subject to change. Furthermore, the Company is still evaluating the appropriate useful lives for the acquired
property and equipment and intangible assets. A change in the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired will change the amount
of the purchase price allocated to goodwill. 

For
purposes of the above allocation, we based our preliminary estimate of the fair values for contingent consideration, intangible
assets, and property and equipment on valuation studies performed by third-party valuation firms. We used various valuation methods,
including discounted cash flows, distributor method, excess earnings, and relief from royalty method to estimate the preliminary
fair value of the identified intangible assets. The preliminary fair value of the contingent consideration was determined using a
Monte Carlo simulation and probability based approaches. The Cost approach was utilized to determine the preliminary fair value of property and equipment. Goodwill
and other intangible assets reflected above were determined to meet the criteria for recognition apart from tangible assets acquired
and liabilities assumed. The goodwill is primarily attributable to APT s in-house research and development team versus using
third party developers and the expansion of manufacturing capacity. The tax basis in the acquired goodwill is zero. 

The
Company s consolidated statement of earnings for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, includes APT post-acquisition
revenue of and net loss of . Net loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, includes of expense
due to the revaluation of the contingent consideration as of the reporting date. This expense is recognized within General and Administrative expenses for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2024.

Series
A Convertible Preferred Stock and Warrants 

In
September 2016, the Company issued (i) shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (the Series A Preferred Stock ),
par value per share, with a stated value of per share, which are convertible into shares of the Company s common
stock at an initial conversion rate of per share, subject to adjustment for events such as stock splits, combinations and the like
as provided in the certificate of designations covering such Series A Preferred Stock, and (ii) (the SPA Warrants) to purchase an aggregate
of shares of common stock. The shares of Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to vote on an as-converted basis with the common
stock, subject to specified beneficial ownership issuance limitations. The Series A Preferred Stock bear dividends at a rate of six percent per annum, which are cumulative and accrue daily from the date of issuance on the stated value. Such dividends will not be
paid in cash except in connection with any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company or any redemption of the Series A Preferred
Stock. Each holder of convertible preferred shares has the right to require us to redeem such holder s shares of Series A Preferred
Stock upon the occurrence of specified events, which include certain business combinations, the sale of all or substantially all of the
Company s assets, or the sale of more than of the outstanding shares of the Company s common stock. In addition, the
Company has the right to redeem the Series A Preferred Stock in the event of a defined change of control. The Series A Preferred Stock
ranks senior to our common stock as to distributions and payments upon the liquidation, dissolution, and winding up of the Company. Since
the Series A Preferred Stock are subject to conditions for redemption that are outside the Company s control, the Series A Preferred
Stock are presently reported in the mezzanine section of the balance sheet. 

2021
CEO Performance Award Unit Grant 

On
February 23, 2021, the Company`s Board of Directors, upon recommendation of the Compensation Committee, approved the grant of the CEO
Performance Award to the Company s Chief Executive Officer. The CEO Performance award is a -year performance award of up to 
shares, tied to the achievement of market capitalization milestones and subject to minimum service requirements. 

As
detailed in the table below, the CEO Performance Award consists of ten vesting tranches. The first market capitalization milestone is
 billion, and each of the remaining nine market capitalization milestones are in additional million increments, up to billion.

The
Company received Shareholder approval at its annual meeting on May 20, 2021, for shares to be issued under the award. 

The
market capitalization requirement is considered a market condition under FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718 Compensation
 Stock Compensation and is estimated on the grant date using Monte Carlo simulations. Recognition of stock-based compensation
expense of all the tranches commenced on February 23, 2021, the date of grant, as the probability of meeting the ten market capitalization
milestones is not considered in determining the timing of expense recognition. The expense will be recognized on an accelerated basis
through 2030. Key assumptions for estimating the performance-based awards fair value at the date of grant included share price on grant
date, volatility of the Company s common stock price, risk free interest rate, and grant term. 

Total
stock-based compensation recorded as operating expense for the CEO Performance Award was million and million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2024, and 2023. As of September 30, 2024, and 2023, the Company had approximately million and million,
respectively, of total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense remaining under the CEO Performance Award assuming the grantee s
continued employment as CEO of the Company, or in a similar capacity, through 2030. As of September 30, 2024, none of the performance
milestones established by the 2021 CEO Incentive Program have been achieved, and no awards have been earned. 

Stock
Award Plans 

In
February 2022, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors adopted the 2022 Stock Incentive Plan (the Plan which
was subsequently approved by the Company s shareholders. This plan replaced the 2012 Stock Incentive Plan which expired on . The 2022 Stock Incentive Plan allows for the grant of incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation
rights, restricted shares and restricted share units to employees, non-employee directors, and third-party consultants. 

At September
30, 2024, the Company had 
remaining shares of the Company s common stock to provide for current and future grants under its various equity
plans. 

At
September 30, 2024, the total compensation cost related to options and non-vested stock granted to employees and non-employees under
the Company s stock award plans but not yet recognized was approximately million, excluding compensation not yet recognized
related to the CEO Performance Award discussed above. This cost will be amortized over a period of up to over the underlying
estimated service periods and will be adjusted for subsequent changes in actual forfeitures and anticipated vesting periods.

Overview 

Stereotaxis
designs, manufactures and markets robotic systems, instruments and information systems for the interventional laboratory. Our proprietary
robotic technology, Robotic Magnetic Navigation, fundamentally transforms endovascular interventions using precise computer-controlled
magnetic fields to directly control the tip of flexible interventional catheters or devices. Direct control of the tip of an interventional
device, in contrast to all manual hand-held devices that are controlled from their handle, can improve the precision, stability, reach
and safety of these devices during procedures. 

Our
primary clinical focus has been electrophysiology, specifically cardiac ablation procedures for the treatment of arrhythmias. Cardiac
ablation has become a well-accepted therapy for arrhythmias and a multi-billion-dollar medical device market with expectations for substantial
long-term growth. Our product strategy is to expand the clinical focus of our technology to several additional endovascular indications
including coronary, neuro, and peripheral interventions. 

There
is substantial real-world evidence and clinical literature for Robotic Magnetic Navigation in electrophysiology. Hundreds of electrophysiologists
at over one hundred hospitals globally have treated over 150,000 arrhythmia patients with our robotic technology. Clinical use of our
technology has been documented in over 500 clinical publications. Robotic Magnetic Navigation is designed to enable physicians to complete
more complex interventional procedures with greater success and safety by providing image-guided delivery of catheters through the blood
vessels and chambers of the heart to treatment sites. This is achieved using externally applied computer-controlled magnetic fields that
govern the motion of the working tip of the catheter, resulting in improved navigation. The more flexible atraumatic design of catheters
driven using magnetic fields may reduce the risk of patient harm and other adverse events. Performing the procedure from a control cockpit
enables physicians to complete procedures in a safe location protected from x-ray exposure, with greater ergonomics, and improved efficiency.
We believe these benefits can be applicable in other endovascular indications where navigation through complex vasculature is often challenging
or unsuccessful and generates significant x-ray exposure, and we are investing in research and development in these areas. 

27 

Our
primary products include the Genesis RMN System, the Odyssey Solution, and other related devices. Through our strategic
relationships with fluoroscopy system manufacturers, providers of catheters and electrophysiology mapping systems, and other parties,
we offer our customers magnetically compatible x-ray systems and other accessory devices. 

The
 Genesis RMN System is designed to enable physicians to complete more complex interventional procedures by providing image-guided
delivery of catheters through the blood vessels and chambers of the heart to treatment sites. This is achieved using externally applied
magnetic fields that govern the motion of the working tip of the catheter, resulting in improved navigation, efficient procedures, and
reduced x-ray exposure. 

The
 Odyssey Solution consolidates lab information onto one large integrated display, enabling physicians to view and control all the
key information in the operating room. This is designed to improve lab layout and procedure efficiency. The system also features a remote
viewing and recording capability called Odyssey Cinema, which is an innovative solution that delivers synchronized content for
optimized workflow, advanced care, and improved productivity. This tool includes an archiving capability that allows clinicians to store
and replay entire procedures or segments of procedures. This information can be accessed from locations throughout the hospital local
area network and over the global Odyssey Network providing physicians with a tool for clinical collaboration, remote consultation, and
training. 

We
have arrangements with fluoroscopy system manufacturers to provide such systems in a bundled purchase offer for hospitals establishing
robotic interventional operating rooms. These are single-plane, full-power x-ray systems and include the c-arm and powered table. The
combination of RMN Systems with our partnered x-ray systems reduces the cost of acquisition, the ongoing cost of ownership, and the complexity
of installation of a robotic electrophysiology practice. 

We
promote our full suite of products in a typical hospital implementation, subject to regulatory approvals or clearances. This implementation
requires a hospital to agree to an upfront capital payment and recurring payments. The upfront capital payment typically includes equipment
and installation charges. The recurring payments typically include disposable costs for each procedure, equipment service costs beyond
the warranty period, and ongoing software updates. In hospitals where our full suite of products has not been implemented, equipment
upgrade or expansion can be implemented upon purchasing of the necessary upgrade or expansion. 

We
have received regulatory clearances and approvals necessary for us to market the Genesis RMN System in the U.S. and Europe, and
we are in the process of obtaining necessary registrations for extending our markets in other countries. The Niobe System, our
prior generation robotic magnetic navigation system, the Odyssey Solution, Cardiodrive , e-Contact, and various disposable
interventional devices have received regulatory clearances and approvals in the U.S., Europe, Canada, China, Japan and various other
countries. We have regulatory clearances and approvals that allow us to market the Vdrive and Vdrive Duo Systems with the
V-CAS device in the U.S., Canada and Europe. We are pursuing regulatory approvals for the Stereotaxis MAGiC catheter, a robotically-navigated
magnetic ablation catheter designed to perform minimally invasive cardiac ablation procedures, in various global geographies. Approval
processes can be lengthy and uncertain, submissions may require revised or additional non-clinical and clinical data, and regulatory
applications could be denied. 

We
have strategic relationships with technology leaders and innovators in the global interventional market. Through these strategic relationships
we provide compatibility between our robotic magnetic navigation system, x-ray systems, and digital imaging and 3D catheter location
sensing technology, as well as disposable interventional devices. The maintenance of these strategic relationships, or the establishment
of equivalent alternatives, is critical to our commercialization efforts. There are no guarantees that any existing strategic relationships
will continue, and efforts are ongoing to ensure the availability of compatible systems and devices and/or equivalent alternatives. We
cannot provide assurance as to the timeline of the ongoing availability of such compatible systems or our ability to obtain equivalent
alternatives on competitive terms or at all.

Corporate
Developments 

On
July 31, 2024, the Company completed its acquisition of all the shares of capital stock of Access Point Technologies EP, Inc., a Minnesota
corporation APT ), from APT Holding Company, Inc., a Minnesota corporation. APT, based in Rogers, Minnesota, designs,
manufactures, and commercializes a portfolio of differentiated high-quality diagnostic catheters used during cardiac ablation
procedures that are commercially available across key global geographies. 

The
transaction was concluded, pursuant to that certain Share Purchase Agreement, dated May 11, 2024. The transaction
consideration included an upfront payment of 1,486,620 shares of Company common stock issued at closing, as well as additional contingent
payments of Company common stock based upon the achievement of specified product revenue and regulatory approval milestones through September
30, 2029. All consideration is payable in Stereotaxis common stock. 

The integration with APT provides
in-house catheter development, manufacturing expertise and specialized knowledge that will further Stereotaxis innovation efforts
in developing a broad family of interventional devices navigated by our robots within electrophysiology and across a range of endovascular
procedures. 

Risks
and Uncertainties 

Future
results of operations could be materially adversely impacted by macroeconomic and geopolitical factors. The Company continues to experience
difficulties with periodic worldwide supply chain disruptions, including shortages and inflationary pressures, and logistics delays which
make it difficult for us to source parts and ship our products. We have generally been able to conduct normal business activities albeit
in a more deliberate manner than prior to the pandemic, including taking action to increase inventory levels and engaging in discussions
with our vendors on contractual obligations, but we cannot guarantee that they will not be impacted more severely in the future. Our
suppliers and contract manufacturers have experienced, and may continue to experience, similar difficulties. If our manufacturing operations
or supply chains are materially interrupted, it may not be possible for us to timely manufacture or service our products at required
levels, or at all. Changes in economic conditions and supply chain constraints could lead to higher inflation than previously experienced
or expected, which could, in turn, lead to an increase in costs. We may be unable to raise the prices of our products sufficiently to
keep up with the rate of inflation. A material reduction or interruption in any of our manufacturing processes or a substantial increase
in costs would have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition. 

Many
of our hospital customers, for whom the purchase of our system involves a significant capital purchase which may be part of a larger
construction project at the customer site (typically the construction of a new building), may themselves be under economic pressures.
Hospitals continue to experience challenges with staffing and cost pressures as supply chain constraints and inflation drive up operating
costs. This may cause delays or cancellations of current purchase orders and other commitments and may exacerbate the long and variable
sales and installation cycles for our robotic magnetic navigation systems. Our hospital customers have also experienced challenges in
sourcing supplies, such as catheters, needed to perform procedures. Such shortages have, and may continue to, put pressure on procedures
and our disposable revenue. 

Any
disruption to the capital markets could negatively impact our ability to raise capital. If the capital markets are disrupted for an extended
period of time and we need to raise additional capital, such capital may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Disruptions
to the capital markets and other financing sources could also negatively impact our hospital customers ability to raise capital
or otherwise obtain financing to fund their operations and capital projects. Such could result in delayed spending on current projects,
a longer sales cycle for new projects where a large capital commitment is required, and decreased demand for our disposable products
as well as an increased risk of customer defaults or delays in payments for our system installations, service contracts and disposable
products. 

29 

In
addition to the aforementioned macroeconomic factors, the COVID-19 pandemic negatively affected, and any resurgence of a variant of COVID-19
or any similar occurrences may in the future negatively affect demand for both our systems and our disposable products. In the past,
we have experienced business disruptions, including travel restrictions on us and our third-party distributors, which negatively affected
our complex sales, marketing, installation, distribution and service network relating to our products and services. We also experienced
reductions in demand for our disposable products as our healthcare customers (physicians and hospitals) re-prioritized the treatment
of patients and diverted resources away from non-coronavirus areas, leading to the performance of fewer procedures in which our disposable
products are used. Significant decreases to our capital or recurring revenues could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating
results, and financial condition. While we cannot reliably estimate the ultimate duration of the impact or the severity of ongoing periodic
resurgences of pandemic-related issues, we continue to anticipate periodic disruptions to our manufacturing operations, supply chains,
procedures volumes, service activities, and capital system orders and placements, any of which could have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. The impact has varied widely over time by individual geography. 

As
a result of the acquisition, we will be managing APT s ongoing business of manufacturing, commercializing, development and sales
of APT s catheters and related products and services. The manufacturing process of catheters is complex, highly technical, and
our prior experience in this field is dated. The process can be subject to periodic worldwide supply chain disruptions, including labor
shortages and inflationary pressures, and logistics delays which make it difficult for us to source parts and ship our products. We may
require a higher level of overhead than currently anticipated. Our ability to successfully manage this new aspect of our business will
depend, in part, upon management s ability to design and implement strategic initiatives that address not only the integration
of APT into us, but also the increased scope of the combined business with its associated increased costs and complexity. We are still
integrating the businesses and implementing safeguards to minimize any negative impacts on our financial position, results of operations
and cash flows post-acquisition. 

Concentration
of Credit Risk 

Financial
instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk consist of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.
Our investments may include, at any time, a diversified portfolio of cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments in a variety
of high-quality securities, including money market funds, U.S. treasury and U.S. government agency securities, corporate notes and bonds,
commercial paper, non-U.S. government agency securities, and municipal notes. The Company s exposure to any individual corporate
entity is limited by policy. Deposits may exceed federally insured limits, and the Company is exposed to credit risk on deposits in the
event of default by the financial institutions to the extent account balances exceed the amount insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation (FDIC). The Company closely monitors events involving limited liquidity, defaults, non-performance or other adverse developments
that affect financial institutions or other companies in the financial services industry or the financial services industry generally,
including Silicon Valley Bank. On March 10, 2023, Silicon Valley Bank SVB ), where the Company maintained accounts with
a cash balance of less than 6 of the Company s total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, was closed by the California
Department of Financial Protection and Innovation and the FDIC was appointed as receiver. On March 12, 2023, the U.S. Department of the
Treasury, Federal Reserve Board, and FDIC released a joint statement announcing that the FDIC would complete its resolution of SVB in
a manner that fully protected all depositors at SVB and that depositors would have access to all of their money starting March 13, 2023.
On March 26, 2023, it was announced that First-Citizens Bank Trust Company would assume all of SVB s deposits and loans as
of March 27, 2023. During the periods presented, the Company has not experienced any losses on its deposits of cash, cash equivalents
or marketable securities. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Our
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which have been prepared
in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates
and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures. We review our
estimates and judgments on an on-going basis. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions
that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. We believe the following accounting
policies are critical to the judgments and estimates we use in preparing our financial statements. For a complete listing of our critical
accounting policies, please refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

30 

Revenue
Recognition 

We
generate revenue from the initial capital sales of systems as well as recurring revenue from the sale of our proprietary disposable devices,
from royalties paid to the Company on the sale of various devices as provided by co-development and co-placement arrangements, and from
other recurring revenue including ongoing software updates and service contracts. 

In
accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606 ASC 606 ), Revenue from Contracts with Customers, 
we account for a contract with a customer when there is a legally enforceable contract between the Company and the customer, the rights
of the parties are identified, the contract has commercial substance, and collectability of the contract consideration is probable. We
record our revenue based on consideration specified in the contract with each customer, net of any taxes collected from customers that
are remitted to government authorities. 

For
contracts containing multiple products and services the Company accounts for individual products and services as separate performance
obligations if they are distinct, which is if a product or service is separately identifiable from other items in the bundled package,
and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer. The Company recognizes
revenues as the performance obligations are satisfied by transferring control of the product or service to a customer. 

For
arrangements with multiple performance obligations, revenue is allocated to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone
selling price. Standalone selling prices are based on observable prices at which the Company separately sells the products or services.
If a standalone selling price is not directly observable, then the Company estimates the standalone selling price considering market
conditions and entity-specific factors including, but not limited to, features and functionality of the products and services and market
conditions. The Company regularly reviews standalone selling prices and updates these estimates as necessary. 

Systems: 

Contracts
related to the sale of systems typically contain separate obligations for the delivery of system(s), installation, service-type warranty,
and an implied obligation to provide software enhancements if and when available for one year following installation. Revenue is recognized
when the Company transfers control to the customer, which is generally at the point when acceptance occurs that indicates customer acknowledgment
of delivery or installation, depending on the terms of the arrangement. Revenue from service-type warranties and the implied obligation
to deliver software enhancements if and when available is included in Other Recurring Revenue and is recognized ratably typically over
the first year following installation of the system as the customer receives the service-type warranty and right to software updates
throughout the period. The Company s system contracts generally do not provide a right of return. Systems may be covered by a one-year
assurance-type warranty in lieu of a service-type warranty. Assurance-type warranty costs were less than 0.1 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2024, and approximately 0.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Disposables: 

Revenue
from sales of disposable products is recognized when control is transferred to the customers, which generally occurs at the time of shipment,
but can also occur at the time of delivery depending on the customer arrangement. Disposable products are covered by
an assurance type warranty that provides for the return of defective products. Warranty costs were not material for the nine months ended
September 30, 2024, and 2023. 

Royalty: 

The
Company receives royalties on the sale of various devices as provided by co-development and co-placement arrangements with various manufacturers.

Other
Recurring Revenue: 

Other
recurring revenue includes revenue from product maintenance plans, service-type warranties, other post warranty maintenance, and the
implied obligation to provide software enhancements if and when available for a specified period, typically one year following installation
of our systems. Revenue from services and software enhancements, service-type warranties, and the implied obligation to provide software
enhancements are deferred and amortized over the service or update period, which is typically one year. Revenue related to services performed
on a time-and-materials basis is recognized when performed. 

The
Company invoices its customers based on the billing schedules in its sales arrangements. Contract assets primarily represent the difference
between the revenue that was recognized based on the relative selling price of the related performance obligations and the contractual
billing terms in the arrangements. Customer deposits primarily relate to future system sales but can also include deposits on disposable
sales. Deferred revenue is primarily related to service contracts, for which the service fees are billed up-front, generally quarterly
or annually, and for amounts billed in advance for system contracts for which some performance obligations remain outstanding. For service
contracts, the associated deferred revenue is generally recognized ratably over the service period. For system contracts, the associated
deferred revenue is recognized when the remaining performance obligations are satisfied. See Note 2 for additional detail on deferred
revenue. The Company did not have any impairment losses on its contract assets for the periods presented. 

Assets
Recognized from the Costs to Obtain a Contract with a Customer 

The
Company has determined that sales incentive programs for the Company s sales team meet the requirements to be capitalized as the
Company expects to generate future economic benefits from the related revenue generating contracts after the initial capital sales transaction.
The costs capitalized as contract acquisition costs included in prepaid expenses and other assets in the Company s balance sheets
were 0.1 million as of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023. The Company did not incur any impairment losses during any of the
periods presented. 

Cost
of Contracts 

Costs
of systems revenue include direct product costs, installation labor and other costs including estimated assurance-type warranty costs
and initial training costs, when applicable. These costs are recognized at the time of sale. Costs of disposable revenue include direct
product costs and estimated warranty costs and are recognized at the time of sale. Cost of revenue from services and license fees are
recognized when incurred. 

Stock-Based
Compensation 

Stock
compensation expense, which is a non-cash charge, results from stock option, non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights,
and restricted share grants made to employees, non-employee directors, and third-party consultants at the fair value of the grants. For
time-based awards, the fair value of options and stock appreciation rights granted was determined using the Black-Scholes valuation method
which gives consideration to the estimated value of the underlying stock at the date of grant, the exercise price of the option, the
expected dividend yield and volatility of the underlying stock, the expected life of the option and the corresponding risk-free interest
rate. The fair value of the grants of restricted shares and units was determined based on the closing price of our stock on the date
of grant. Stock compensation expense for options, stock appreciation rights and for time-based restricted share grants and units is amortized
on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the underlying issue, generally over four years except for grants to non-employee
directors which are generally earned over a period of six months. Stock compensation expense for performance-based restricted shares,
if any, is amortized on a straight-line basis over the anticipated vesting period and is subject to adjustment based on the actual achievement
of objectives. Compensation expense is recognized only for those options expected to vest, net of actual forfeitures. Estimates of the
expected life of options have been based on the average of the vesting and expiration periods, which is the simplified method under general
accounting principles for share-based payments. Estimates of volatility utilized in calculating stock-based compensation have been prepared
based on historical data. Actual experience to date has been consistent with these estimates. 

For
market-based awards, stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the minimum service period regardless of whether or not the
market target is probable of being achieved. The fair value of such awards is estimated on the grant date using Monte Carlo simulations. 

32 

The
amount of compensation expense to be recorded in future periods may increase if we make additional grants of options, stock appreciation
rights or restricted shares. The amount of expense to be recorded in future periods may decrease if the requisite service periods are
not completed. 

Results
of Operations 

Comparison
of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2024, and 2023 

Revenue .
Revenue increased from 7.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 9.2 million for the three months ended
September 30, 2024, an increase of 18 . Revenue from the sales of systems increased to 4.4 million for the three months ended
September 30, 2024, from 3.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, driven by increased system sales volumes in the
current year period. Revenue from sales of disposable interventional devices, service, and accessories increased to approximately
 4.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 4.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an
increase of approximately 13 . The increase was primarily driven by an increase in sales of magnetically enabled devices and the two
month impact of post-acquisition non-magnetic disposable device sales recorded in the current year period. 

Cost
of Revenue. Cost of revenue increased from 3.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 5.1 million for the
three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of approximately 36 . As a percentage of our total revenue, overall gross margin
decreased to 45 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from 52 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, primarily
due to changes in product mix. Cost of revenue for systems sold increased from 2.9 million for the three months ended September 30,
2023, to 3.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, driven by increased system sales volumes in the current year
period. Gross margin for systems was 0.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, compared to 0.7 million for the
three months ended September 30, 2024. Cost of revenue for disposables, service, and accessories increased from 0.8 million for the
three months ended September 30, 2023, to 1.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Gross margin for disposables,
service, and accessories was 71 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 80 for the three months ended September
30, 2023. Gross margin for disposables, service, and accessories was depressed by acquisition related accounting which required the
valuation of acquired finished good inventory to fair value and by higher expenses incurred under service contracts in the
current period. 

Research
and Development Expenses . Research and development expenses decreased from 2.7 million for the three months ended September 30,
2023, to 2.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of approximately 8 . This decrease was primarily driven
by project timing in the current year period. 

Sales
and Marketing Expenses . Sales and marketing expenses slightly increased from 3.1 million for the three months ended September 30,
2023, to 3.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of approximately 2 . The increase was primarily driven
by third party commissions generated from new acquisition related sales channels. 

General
and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses include finance, information systems, legal, general management, and the quarterly gain or loss associated with the remeasurement of the acquisition related contingent consideration.
General and administrative expenses increased from 3.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 4.8 million for the
three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of approximately 23 . The increase was primarily driven by the remeasurement of the contingent consideration. 

Interest
Income (Expense) . Net interest income was approximately 0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, compared to
 0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease was driven by lower invested balances and lower interest
rates in the current year period. 

33 

Comparison
of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024, and 2023 

Revenue .
Revenue decreased from 22.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 20.6 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2024, a decrease of approximately 7 . Revenue from the sales of systems decreased from 8.7 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2023, to 7.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, driven by decreased system sales
volumes in the current year period. Revenue from sales of disposable interventional devices, service and accessories decreased to
 13.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from 13.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, a
decrease of approximately 1 . The decrease was primarily driven by decreased service revenue in the current year period partially
offset by higher sales of magnetically enabled disposables devices and the two months impact of post-acquisition non-magnetic
disposable device sales recorded in the current year period. 

Cost
of Revenue. Cost of revenue decreased from 10.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 9.2 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of approximately 9 . As a percentage of our total revenue, overall gross margin remained
consistent at 55 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023. Cost of revenue for systems sold decreased from 7.3 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 5.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, driven by decreased system
sales volumes in the current year period. Gross margin for systems was 1.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared
to 1.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Cost of revenue for disposables, service, and accessories increased from
 2.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 3.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, driven by acquisition related accounting which required the valuation of acquired finished good inventory to fair
value and higher
expenses incurred under service contracts in the current period. Gross margin for disposables, service and accessories was 79 for the
nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to 74 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease was driven primarily
by decreased service revenue in the current year period and acquisition related accounting requiring the valuation of acquired finished inventory at fair value. 

Research
and Development Expenses . Research and development expenses decreased from 8.1 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2023, compared to 7.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 14 . This decrease was primarily driven
by the reversal of an accrued regulatory license fee, decreased headcount and project timing in the current year period. 

Sales
and Marketing Expenses . Sales and marketing expenses decreased from 9.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to
 9.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of approximately 1 . This decrease was primarily due to lower headcount
expenses partially offset by third party commissions generated from new acquisition related sales channels in the current year period. 

General
and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses include finance, information systems, legal, general
management, and the quarterly gain or loss associated with the remeasurement of the acquisition related contingent consideration.
General and administrative expenses increased from 11.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 12.1 million for
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of approximately 10 . This increase was primarily driven by the remeasurement
of the contingent consideration, and to a lesser extent by higher administrative expenses and professional service fees in the
current period. 

Interest
Income (Expense) . Net interest income was approximately 0.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to
 0.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The decrease was driven by lower invested balances and declining interest
rates in the current year period. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Liquidity
refers to the liquid financial assets available to fund our business operations and pay for near-term obligations. These liquid financial
assets consist of cash, cash equivalents, and investments. 

As
of September 30, 2024, we had 11.0 million of cash and cash equivalents, inclusive of restricted cash. We had working capital of 8.1
million as of September 30, 2024, compared to 20.0 million as of December 31, 2023.

The
following table summarizes our cash flow by operating, investing and financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
and 2023 (in thousands):

Net
cash used in operating activities . We used approximately 9.7 million and 6.7 million of cash for operating activities during the
nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. The increase in cash used in operating activities was driven by changes
in working capital. 

Net
cash provided by investing activities . We generated approximately 0.1 million and 19.8 million of cash during the nine months
ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. The cash generated during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was from the acquisition
of Access Point Technologies EP, Inc. and during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, was from proceeds received from the maturity
of short-term investments. 

Net
cash provided by financing activities . We generated approximately 0.1 million of cash from financing activities during the nine months
ended September 30, 2024, and 2023. The cash generated in both periods was driven by the proceeds from issuance of stock from the exercise
of options, net of issuance costs, and from our employee stock purchase program. 

Capital
Resources 

As
of September 30, 2024, the Company did not have any debt. 

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements 

We
do not currently have, nor have we ever had, any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities
often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating
off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. In addition, we do not engage in trading activities
involving non-exchange traded contracts. As a result, we are not materially exposed to any financing, liquidity, market, or credit risk
that could have arisen if we had engaged in these relationships.

4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures: The Company s management, with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined
in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act )), as of the end
of the period covered by this report. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable
assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit
relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on such evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer have concluded that, as of the end of such period, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 

35 

Changes
In Internal Control Over Financial Reporting: The Company s management, with the participation of the Company s Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, also conducted an evaluation of the Company s internal control over financial reporting
to determine whether any changes occurred during the period covered by this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely
to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Based on that evaluation, there has been no such
change during the period covered by this report. 

During
the period ended September 30, 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of Access Point Technologies EP, Inc. As a result of the acquisition,
the Company is in the process of reviewing the internal control structure of this business and, if necessary, will make appropriate changes
as the Company incorporates its controls and procedures into the acquired business.

1A. RISK FACTORS 

Risks
Related to our Recently Completed Acquisition of APT 

We
may be unable to successfully integrate APT into our business and may fail to realize any or all of the anticipated benefits of the acquisition,
or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected. 

Prior
to the completion of our acquisition of APT, both companies previously operated independently and manufactured different products. The
success of the acquisition will depend, in part, on our ability to (i) successfully integrate APT s businesses into Stereotaxis,
(ii) successfully manufacture, commercialize, develop and sell APT s catheters and related products, and (iii) realize the anticipated
benefits, including synergies, cost savings, innovation opportunities and operational efficiencies, from the acquisition, all in a manner
that does not materially disrupt existing customer, supplier and employee relations. If we are unable to achieve these objectives within
the anticipated time frame, or at all, the anticipated benefits may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than
expected, and the value of our common stock may decline. 

The
integration of APT into our business may result in material challenges, including, without limitation: 

the
 diversion of management s attention from ongoing business concerns; 

developing
 and managing internal financial and disclosure processes at APT, which has been a private company not subject to SEC reporting obligations; 

managing
 a more complex combined business; 

expanding
 operations to manufacture APT s catheter products and overcoming our lack of manufacturing experience related to such products; 

maintaining
 employee morale, retaining key APT employees and the possibility that the integration process and organizational changes may adversely
 impact the ability to maintain employee relationships; 

transitioning
 and maintaining business and operational relationships of APT, including suppliers, collaboration partners, employees and other counterparties; 

risks
 related to APT s existing customer contracts and disputes with customers; 

the
 integration process not proceeding as expected, including due to a possibility of faulty assumptions or expectations regarding the
 integration process or APT s operations; 

36 

risks
 related to litigation, disputes, investigations or other events that could increase our expenses, result in liability or require
 that we take other action; 

consolidating
 corporate, administrative and compliance infrastructures and eliminating duplicative operations; 

coordinating
 geographically separate locations; 

unanticipated
 issues in integrating information technology, communications and other systems; and 

unforeseen
 expenses, costs, liabilities or delays associated with the acquisition or the integration. 

Many
of these factors are outside of our control, and any one of them could result in delays, increased costs, decreases in the amount of
expected cost savings or synergies and diversion of management s time and energy, which could materially affect our financial position,
results of operations and cash flows. 

Our
future results may be adversely impacted if we do not effectively manage APT s catheter manufacturing business following the completion
of the acquisition. 

As
a result of the acquisition, we will be managing APT s ongoing business of manufacturing, commercializing, development and sales
of APT s catheters and related products and services. The manufacturing process of catheters is complex, highly technical, and
our prior experience in this field is dated. The process can be subject to periodic worldwide supply chain disruptions, including labor
shortages and inflationary pressures, and logistics delays which make it difficult for us to source parts and ship our products. We may
require a higher level of overhead than currently anticipated. Our ability to successfully manage this new aspect of our business will
depend, in part, upon management s ability to design and implement strategic initiatives that address not only the integration
of APT into us, but also the increased scope of the combined business with its associated increased costs and complexity. There can be
no assurances that we will be successful in manufacturing catheter products or that we will realize the expected operating efficiencies,
cost savings and other benefits anticipated from the acquisition. 

The
issuance of the Earnout Consideration will result in dilution to our stockholders and may adversely affect us, including the market price
of our securities. 

At
the closing of the acquisition of APT on July 31, 2024, we issued 1,486,620 Closing Shares to the Selling Stockholder pursuant to the
Share Purchase Agreement. In addition, the Share Purchase Agreement requires us to issue additional Earnout Shares to the Selling Stockholder
upon achievement of certain global and US revenue targets for APT products as well as US and Europe regulatory approvals of certain robotically-navigated
catheters that APT will develop. 

The
Share Purchase Agreement obligated us to file a resale registration statement relating to the Upfront Stock Consideration and
additional Earnout Shares. This prospectus is a part of that resale registration statement and covers the 1,486,620 Closing Shares
and an estimated 4,613,380 additional Earnout Shares. However, the exact number of shares that may be issued under the Share
Purchase Agreement for such milestones will be calculated based on the average of the closing per share price of Stereotaxis common
stock immediately prior to the dates such revenue performance and/or regulatory milestones are achieved, up to 24 million in total
value through September 30, 2029, not to exceed 19.9 of the total number of shares of the Company s common stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to July 31, 2024 (the Share Cap Limitation ). In addition, the vesting of the right to
receive the Earnout Shares would be accelerated in the event of a change of control of Stereotaxis, based on a probability-weighted
average estimate of the potential to achieve any remaining milestones, discounted to its net present value taking into account
expected time when earnouts related to the milestones would become payable through September 30, 2029. 

37 

As
a result, the actual number of additional Earnout Shares we may be required to issue could be materially greater or less than our estimate,
depending whether and to what extent the future revenue milestones are met and/or regulatory approvals are obtained, as well as the actual
average closing price of our common stock calculated pursuant to a formula near the time such milestones are achieved and/or whether
a change of control occurs. If we are required to issue Earnout Shares under the Share Purchase Agreement, there could be significant
additional dilution to the Company s stockholders. Moreover, even if we are not required to issue any Earnout Shares, the potential
for the issuance of such shares may negatively affect the trading price of our common stock in anticipation of such potential dilution.
Sales of a substantial number of shares comprising the Closing Shares or any Earnout Shares in the public market, or the perception that
such sales may occur, could adversely affect the market price of our securities. 

Under
certain circumstances, we may take certain actions to achieve the milestones under the Purchase Agreement that we would not have undertaken
if we had not completed the acquisition, which may have an adverse effect on the historical business of Stereotaxis . 

During
the revenue earnout periods under our Purchase Agreement, which end on September 30, 2029, we agreed to operate APT and its business
in a commercially reasonable manner as conducted prior to the closing, taken as a whole, including maintaining relationships with customers,
suppliers, independent contractors, governmental entities, and others having business dealings with it consistent with APT s practice
prior to the closing. We agreed not to take any action during the revenue earnout periods which has as its intended purpose the diminution
of the earnout consideration. 

While
we retain the sole authority to operate and control APT s business and its operations, including without limitation, any and all
decisions relating various aspects of their and our combined business, we may nevertheless take certain actions related to the milestones
that we would not have undertaken if we had not completed the acquisition.
