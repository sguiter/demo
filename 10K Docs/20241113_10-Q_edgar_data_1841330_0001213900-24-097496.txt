NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS 

FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER
30, 2024 AND 2023 

5 

million of cash and cash equivalents and working capital of approximately million. The Company s major sources of
cash have been comprised of proceeds from various private offerings, the Initial Public Offering and the exercise of warrants. The
Company is dependent on obtaining additional working capital funding from the sale of equity and/or debt securities in order to continue
to execute its development plans and continue operations. Based on the foregoing, management believes that the Company will not
have sufficient working capital to meet its needs through twelve months from the date of these financial statements if additional funding
cannot be obtained. 

Going Concern Uncertainty 

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements have been prepared as if the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company has incurred significant operating
losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception. On September 30, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately
 9.4 million and an accumulated deficit of approximately million. The Company has incurred recurring losses, has experienced
recurring negative operating cash flows, and requires significant cash resources to execute its business plans. Historically, the Company s
major sources of cash have been comprised of proceeds from various public and private offerings of its capital stock. The Company is dependent
on obtaining additional working capital funding from the sale of equity and/or debt securities in order to continue to execute its development
plans and continue operations. Without additional funding, there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as
a going concern through twelve months from the date of these financial statements. 

6 

million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has not experienced losses on this account and management
believes the Company is not exposed to significant risks on such account.

non-current liabilities on the Company s consolidated balance sheets. The Company discounted the future lease payments of this lease
using the prevailing collateralized lending rate which would be extended to the Company based on its credit profile relative to the period
of inception, and the duration of the lease from inception. The interest rate used in calculating the fair value listed above was .

Company Summary 

We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company
primarily focused on the discovery, research and development of innovative treatments for CNS disorders and other diseases, including
RASopathies. 

Our primary operations, the Therapeutics segment,
are focused on developing our lead therapeutic candidate, PAS-004, a next-generation macrocyclic mitogen-activated protein kinase, or
MEK inhibitor that we believe may address the limitations and liabilities associated with existing drugs with a similar mechanism of action.
PAS-004 is a small molecule allosteric inhibitor of MEK 1 and MEK 2 for potential use in the treatment of a range of RASopathies, including
neurofibromatosis type 1 NF1 )- associated neurofibromas and a number of oncology indications, among others that we acquired
from AlloMek Therapeutics, LLC in October 2022. In December 2023, the FDA cleared our IND for PAS-004 and we received a study may proceed
letter from the FDA for our Phase 1 multicenter, open-label, dose escalation trial of PAS-004 in patients with MAPK pathway-driven advanced
tumors with a documented RAS, NF1 or RAF mutation or patients who have failed BRAF/MEK inhibition. 

We are currently conducting the Phase 1 clinical
trial at four clinical sites in the United States and plan to open an additional three sites in Eastern Europe in the fourth quarter of
2024. Our clinical development plan for PAS-004 is to begin a Phase 1/2a clinical trial in adult patients with NF1-associated plexiform
and/or cutaneous neurofibromas followed by pediatric patients and ultimately seek FDA marketing approval in these patient populations. 

Additionally, we have two programs that are in
the discovery stage, which we believe address limitations in the treatment paradigm of the indications we plan to address with these programs,
which are currently ALS for PAS-003 and schizophrenia for PAS-001. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we determined to cease further
development of our PAS-002 program for multiple sclerosis due to several factors including the significant capital, resources and time
required to develop the program, and the current and projected availability of effective treatment options for MS patients, among others. 

Our ability to generate
product revenue will depend on the successful development, regulatory approval and eventual commercialization of one or more of our product
candidates. Until such time we can generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through
the sale of equity, debt financings, or other capital sources, including potential collaborations with other companies or other strategic
transactions. Adequate funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we fail to raise capital or enter into such
agreements as and when needed, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development and commercialization of
our product candidates. 

We expect to continue to incur significant expenses
and operating losses for the foreseeable future as we advance our product candidates through all stages of development and clinical trials
and, ultimately, seek regulatory approval. In addition, if we obtain marketing approval for any of our product candidates, we expect to
incur significant commercialization expenses related to product manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution. We expect our expenses
and capital requirements will increase significantly in connection with our ongoing activities as we: 

continue
our ongoing and planned research and development of our product candidates; 

initiate
nonclinical studies and clinical trials for any additional product candidates that we may pursue; 

scale
up external manufacturing capacity with the aim of securing sufficient quantities to meet our capacity requirements for clinical trials
and potential commercialization; 

establish
a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any approved product candidates and related additional commercial
manufacturing costs; 

develop, maintain, expand, protect and enforce our intellectual property portfolio; 

acquire
or in-license product candidates and technologies; and 

add
clinical, operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our product development
and planned future commercialization efforts.

Recent Developments 

Clinical Updates 

On September 9, 2024, we announced the successful
completion of long-term chronic toxicity studies for our lead candidate PAS-004. On September 26, 2024, we announced safety, tolerability,
pharmacokinetic (PK) and preliminary efficacy data from the first two cohorts of patients in our Phase 1 clinical trial of PAS-004. 

September
2024 Offering 

On September 26, 2024, we entered into a securities
purchase agreement (the September 2024 Offering with an institutional investor,
pursuant to which we agreed to sell pre-funded warrants Pre-Funded Warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 1,219,513
shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of 0.001 per share, Series A warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 1,219,513 shares
of Common Stock at an exercise price of 3.85 per share, and Series B warrants (together with the Series A Warrants, the September
2024 PIPE Warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 1,219,513 shares of Common Stock with an exercise price of 3.85 per share.
The combined purchase price per Pre-Funded Warrant and accompanying September 2024 PIPE Warrants was 4.099. Aggregate gross proceeds
from the September 2024 Offering were approximately 4.5 million and the September 2024 Offering closed on September 30, 2024. 

Scientific Advisory Board 

On September 3, 2024, we announced that Rebecca
Brown, M.D., Ph.D., was appointed as a member of our Scientific Advisory Board. Dr. Brown is currently Director of the Neurofibromatosis
Clinic at The Mount Sinai Hospital and Assistant Professor in the Department of Neurology (Division of Neuro-Oncology), Internal Medicine,
and Neurosurgery at the institution. 

Reverse Stock Split 

On December 28, 2023,
we filed a Certificate of Amendment to our Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation reflecting a one-for-20 reverse stock
split (the Reverse Stock Split of our issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock which became effective at 12:01 a.m.
Eastern Time on January 2, 2024. As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, every 20 shares of Common
Stock issued and outstanding were converted into one share of Common Stock, with a corresponding reduction in the number of authorized
shares of Common Stock from 495,000,000 to 100,000,000. The Reverse Stock Split affected all stockholders uniformly and did not alter
any stockholder s percentage interest in our equity, except to the extent that the Reverse Stock Split resulted in some stockholders
owning a fractional share. No fractional shares were issued in connection with the Reverse Stock Split. Stockholders who were otherwise
entitled to receive a fractional share instead received a cash payment (without interest) equal to such a fraction multiplied by the
average of the closing sales prices of Common Stock on The Nasdaq Capital Market for the five consecutive trading days immediately preceding
the effective date of the Reverse Stock Split (with such average closing sales prices adjusted to give effect to the Reverse Stock Split).
All outstanding securities entitling their holders to purchase shares of Common Stock or acquire shares of Common Stock, including stock
options, convertible debt and warrants, were adjusted as a result of the Reverse Stock Split, as required by the terms of those securities. 

The accompanying condensed
consolidated financial statements reflect the Reverse Stock Split. All share and per share information data herein that relates to
our Common Stock prior to the effective date has been retroactively restated to reflect the Reverse Stock Split. 

22 

Impact of Inflation 

We have recently experienced
higher costs across our business as a result of inflation, including higher costs related to employee compensation and outside services.
We expect inflation to continue to have a negative impact throughout 2024, and it is uncertain whether we will be able to offset the impact
of inflationary pressures in the near term.

General and administrative 

General and administrative expenses consist primarily
of personnel expenses, including salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation expense, for employees and consultants in executive,
finance and accounting, legal, operations support, information technology and human resource functions. General and administrative expenses
also include corporate facility costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses, including rent, utilities, depreciation,
amortization, and maintenance, as well as legal fees related to intellectual property and corporate matters, fees for accounting and consulting
services and other expenses, including insurance, public company and corporate communications, information technology, and board fees. 

General and administrative expenses decreased
by approximately 741,000, or 34 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023.
The decrease was primarily driven by decreases in (i) legal expenses of approximately 493,000, (ii) public company and corporate communications
expenses of approximately 217,000, (iii) accounting and business development of approximately 115,000, and (iv) personnel, other income
and gain on payable of approximately 43,000 offset by an increase in (i) consulting costs of approximately 78,000, (ii) non-cash stock
based expense of approximately 28,000, and (iii) other expense and gain on disposal of assets of 21,000. 

General and administrative expenses decreased
by approximately 779,000, or 13 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023.
The decrease was primarily driven by decreases in (i) personnel costs of approximately 326,000, (ii) legal expenses of approximately
 322,000, (iii) accounting and business development of approximately 210,000, (iv) public company and corporate communications expenses
of approximately 137,000, (v) other income of approximately 117,000, and (vi) gain on payable of 18,000, offset by an increases in
(i) office expenses, including franchise taxes and insurance of approximately 152,000, (ii) consulting costs of approximately 114,000,
(iii) non-cash amortization and depreciation, stock-based compensation of approximately 80,000, and (iv) other expense of approximately
 5,000. 

We expect general and administrative expenses
to continue at lower levels in fiscal year 2024 as compared to fiscal year 2023 due to the non-recurring expenses that were incurred in
2023 related to the unsolicited, non-binding proposal to acquire all our outstanding shares from a third party and the tender offer we
completed in September 2023. 

Research and Development 

Research and development expenses relate to
activities primarily focused on the development of PAS-004 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, and PAS-004,
PAS-003, and PAS-001 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

Research and development
expenses decreased by approximately 44,000, or 3 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September
30, 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by decreases in (i) preclinical research and development expenses related to our discovery
programs of approximately 403,000 and (ii) personnel expenses and stock compensation expense of approximately 137,000 related to the
closure of our research laboratory and reduction in related workforce, offset by increases in (i) consulting expenses of approximately
 35,000, (ii) general research and development expenses of approximately 181,000, (iii) manufacturing and CMC expenses of approximately
 160,000 and (iv) clinical trial costs of approximately 120,000 related to the initiation of the Phase 1 clinical trial of PAS-004. 

Research and development expenses increased by
approximately 939,000, or 20 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The
increase was primarily driven by increases in (i) clinical trial costs of approximately 1,647,000 related to the initiation of the Phase
1 clinical trial of PAS-004, (ii) general research and development expenses of approximately 246,000, (iii) consulting costs of approximately
 137,000, (iv) stock compensation and personnel cost of approximately 182,000 and (v) manufacturing and CMC expenses of approximately
 22,000 offset by (i) preclinical research and development related to our discovery programs of approximately 1,295,000. 

We expect research and
development expenses to increase in fiscal year 2024 as compared to fiscal year 2023 primarily due to the clinical development of PAS-004
as well as PAS-004 CMC activities, offset by decreases in preclinical research and development related to the closure of our research
laboratory. 

24 

Other income,
net 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024,
other income, net decreased by approximately 172,000, or 97 , compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in
other income, net is due primarily to a decrease in the fair value of the Public Warrants and the Representative Warrants (as such terms
are defined in Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated
Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q) that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to
a larger increase in the fair value of the Public Warrants and the Representative Warrants that occurred during the three months ended
September 30, 2023. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024,
other income, net decreased by approximately 91,000, or 26 , compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in other
income, net is due primarily to an increase in the fair value of warrant liabilities of approximately 191,000, offset by dividend income
of 343,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to approximately 254,000 of dividend income during the nine months
ended September 30, 2023. See Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Unaudited Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for more information on the accounting treatment of the Public Warrants
and the Representative Warrants. 

Discontinued Operations 

During the year ended December 31, 2023, we discontinued
our support services to anti-depression clinics in the U.K. and related at-home services in New York, NY. We also discontinued our clinical
operations in Los Angeles, CA and disposed of the related property. Accordingly, we discontinued the operations of our Clinics segment
provided by our subsidiaries, and currently have one reportable segment, the Therapeutics segment, related to the research and development
of our therapeutic product candidates. As of June 30, 2023, all activity related to our discontinued subsidiaries is included in Net loss
from discontinued operations, net of tax in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.

 (6,969,883 
 (13,503,174 

Cash and cash equivalents decreased by approximately
 7.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a decrease of approximately 13.5 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2023, which was primarily attributable to cash used to fund operations and an increase in prepaid expenses. 

25 

Liquidity Capital Resources Outlook 

As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately
 9.4 million in operating bank accounts and money market funds, with working capital of approximately 9.1 million. We have incurred significant
operating losses and negative cash flows from operations. On September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately 46.4
million. We have incurred recurring losses, have experienced recurring negative operating cash flows, and require significant cash resources
to execute our business plans. Historically, our major sources of cash have been comprised of proceeds from various public and private
offerings of our capital stock. We received aggregate gross proceeds of approximately 4.5 million as a result of the September 2024 Offering.
We are dependent on obtaining additional working capital funding from the sale of equity and/or debt securities to continue to execute
our development plans and continue operations. Based on the foregoing, management believes that we will not have
sufficient working capital to meet our needs through twelve months from the issuance date of the condensed consolidated financial statements,
without raising additional capital. 

Liquidity Capital Resources Outlook 

Our primary use of cash is to fund operating expenses,
primarily general and administrative and research and development expenditures. Cash used to fund operating expenses is impacted by the
timing of when we pay these expenses, as reflected in the change in our outstanding accounts payable, accrued expenses and prepaid expenses. 

Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties
associated with research, development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products, we are unable to estimate the exact amount of
our operating capital requirements. Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to: 

the
scope, timing, progress and results of discovery, preclinical development, laboratory testing and clinical trials for our product candidates; 

the
costs of manufacturing our product candidates for clinical trials and in preparation for marketing approval and commercialization; 

the
extent to which we enter into collaborations or other arrangements with third parties in order to further develop our product candidates; 

the
costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending
intellectual property-related claims; 

the
costs and fees associated with the discovery, acquisition or in-license of additional product candidates or technologies; 

expenses
needed to attract and retain skilled personnel; 

the
costs required to scale up our clinical, regulatory and manufacturing capabilities; 

the
costs of future commercialization activities, if any, including establishing sales, marketing, manufacturing and distribution capabilities,
for any of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval; and 

revenue,
if any, received from commercial sales of our product candidates, should any of our product candidates receive marketing approval. 

We will need significant additional funds to meet
operational needs and capital requirements for clinical trials, other research and development expenditures, and business development
activities. We currently have no credit facility or committed sources of capital. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated
with the development and commercialization of our product candidates, we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays
and operating expenditures associated with our current and anticipated clinical studies.

Contractual Obligations 

See Note 9 Commitments and Contingencies
in the Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for a summary of our contractual
obligations. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

During the periods presented, we did not have
any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K promulgated under the Exchange Act. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

Our critical accounting estimates, which include
(1) revenue recognition, (2) stock-based compensation and (3) fair value measurements, are more fully described in the Notes to our Consolidated
Financial Statements included in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, as filed on March 29, 2024. During the nine
months ended September 30, 2024, there were no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates from those described
in our Form 10-K. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

See Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies in the Notes to our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q for a description
of recent accounting pronouncements applicable to our financial statements. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

Not Applicable. As a smaller reporting company, we are not required
to provide the information required by this Item. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer have evaluated the Company s disclosure controls and procedures, and have concluded, based on their evaluation as of the
end of the period covered by this report, that our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended (the Exchange Act), Rule 13a-15(e), are not effective at a reasonable assurance level due to the material weakness described
below. 

27 

Notwithstanding
the material weakness, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has concluded that
the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report present fairly, in all material respects, our financial
position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. 

Remediation of Previously
Identified Material Weakness 

A material weakness
is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility
that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a
timely basis. 

As previously disclosed
in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, as filed on March 29, 2024, management in connection with our independent auditors
identified a material weakness in our controls related to the review of the annual income tax provision prepared by a third-party firm
during the audit process related to our fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. Specifically, we did not maintain effective controls to sufficiently
review the completeness and accuracy of the annual tax provision in Note 10 to our financial statements (the Tax Provision Disclosure included in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 

In response to the material
weakness, management, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, initiated a reassessment of our processes and controls related to the Tax Provision Disclosure and developed an action plan to
remediate this matter, which included creating processes to ensure a thorough review of all materials and schedules prepared by third
parties with respect to the Tax Provision Disclosure and engaging a tax professional to prepare and review any Tax Provision Disclosures.
Management believes the involvement of the tax professional provides sufficient remediation, and the related controls will be subject
to testing as applicable during the year. 

Evaluation of Changes in Internal Control over
Financial Reporting 

Other than the remediation of the material weakness
described above, there have been no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended
September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control
over financial reporting. 

28 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 

From time to time, we may become involved in legal
proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business. We are not presently a party to any legal proceedings that, if determined
adversely to us, we believe would individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations,
financial condition or cash flows. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 

There have been no material changes to the risk
factors set forth in the section titled Risk Factors included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December
31, 2023, as filed on March 29, 2024. Our business involves significant risks. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties
described in our Form 10-K, together with all of the other information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as well as our audited consolidated
financial statements and related notes as disclosed in our Form 10-K. The risks and uncertainties described in our Form 10-K are not the
only ones we face. Additional risk and uncertainties that we are unaware of or that we deem immaterial may also become important factors
that adversely affect our business. The realization of any of these risks and uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on our
reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations, growth and future prospects as well as our ability to accomplish our
strategic objectives. In that event, the market price of our common stock and Public Warrants could decline, and you could lose part or
all of your investment. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 

None. 

Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities. 

None. 

Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures. 

Not applicable.
