 million and million, respectively, included in Other assets on Ameren s consolidated balance sheet. Any earnings or losses related to these investments are included in Other Income, Net on Ameren s consolidated statement of income and comprehensive income. Ameren is not the primary beneficiary of these investments because it does not have the power to direct matters that most significantly affect the activities of these variable interest entities. As of September 30, 2024, Ameren s maximum exposure to loss related to these variable interests is limited to its investment of million plus associated outstanding funding commitments of million. 
 As of September 30, 2024, the cash surrender value of COLI at Ameren and Ameren Illinois was million (December 31, 2023 million) and million (December 31, 2023 million), respectively, while total borrowings against the policies were million (December 31, 2023 million) at both Ameren and Ameren Illinois. Ameren and Ameren Illinois have the right to offset the borrowings against the cash surrender value of the policies and, consequently, present the net asset in Other assets on their respective balance sheets. The net cash surrender value of Ameren s COLI is affected by the investment performance of a separate account in which Ameren holds a beneficial interest.

 million. The electric rate increase request is based on a ROE, a capital structure composed of common equity, a rate base of billion, and a test year ended March 31, 2024, with certain pro-forma adjustments expected through an anticipated true-up date of December 31, 2024. Ameren Missouri also requested the continued use of the FAC and trackers for pension and postretirement benefits, uncertain income tax positions, certain excess deferred income taxes, and the utilization of production and investment tax credits or proceeds from the sale of tax credits allowed under the IRA, which the MoPSC previously authorized in earlier electric rate orders. The electric rate increase request reflects the following: 
 increased infrastructure investments made under Ameren Missouri s Smart Energy Plan, including increased cost of capital and depreciation expense. Included in these investments are megawatts of solar generation investment for the Boomtown, Cass County and Huck Finn solar projects along with investments in the Callaway nuclear energy center and other dispatchable generation to support a reliable, low-cost and cleaner mix of energy resources; 
 decreased costs resulting from the retirement of the Rush Island Energy Center; and 
 decreased costs related to the extension of the retirement date of the Sioux Energy Center from 2030 to 2032, consistent with Ameren Missouri s 2023 IRP, to ensure reliability. 
 The MoPSC proceeding relating to the proposed electric service rate changes will take place over a period of up to months, with a decision by the MoPSC expected by May 2025 and new rates effective by June 2025. Ameren Missouri cannot predict the level of any electric service rate change the MoPSC may approve, whether the requested regulatory recovery mechanisms will be continued, or whether any rate change that may eventually be approved will be sufficient for Ameren Missouri to recover its costs and earn a reasonable return on its investments when the rate change goes into effect. 
 2024 Natural Gas Delivery Service Regulatory Rate Review 
 In September 2024, Ameren Missouri filed a request with the MoPSC seeking approval to increase its annual revenues for natural gas delivery service by million. The natural gas rate increase request is based on a ROE, a capital structure composed of common equity, a rate base of million, and a test year ended March 31, 2024, with certain pro-forma adjustments expected through the true-up date of December 31, 2024. The request includes the continued use of the PGA, WNAR, and trackers for pension and other postretirement benefits and certain excess deferred taxes that the MoPSC previously authorized in earlier natural gas rate orders. The natural gas rate increase request reflects investments in our existing natural gas infrastructure to ensure the safe delivery of natural gas. 
 The MoPSC proceeding relating to the proposed natural gas delivery service rate changes will take place over a period of up to months, with a decision by the MoPSC expected by August 2025 and new rates effective by September 2025. Ameren Missouri cannot predict the level of any natural gas delivery service rate change the MoPSC may approve, whether the requested regulatory recovery mechanisms will be continued, or whether any rate change that may eventually be approved will be sufficient for Ameren Missouri to recover its costs and earn a reasonable return on its investments when the rate change goes into effect.

 (a) Anticipated in-service dates are dependent on the timing of construction completion, among other things. 
 (b) The Huck Finn Solar Project is expected to support Ameren Missouri s compliance with the state of Missouri s renewable energy standard. Investments in the project are eligible for recovery under the RESRAM. 
 (c) Ameren Missouri acquired the Cass County, Boomtown, and Huck Finn solar projects in June 2024, September 2024, and October 2024, respectively. These three acquisitions collectively represent a purchase price of approximately billion. 
 (d) The Boomtown and Cass County solar projects are expected to support Ameren Missouri s transition to renewable energy generation and serve customers under the Renewable Solutions Program. 
 (e) The development-transfer agreement included solar panels, project design, land rights, and engineering, procurement, and construction agreements. Ameren Missouri took over construction management of the project when it was acquired in June 2024. 
 (f) These projects collectively represent approximately billion of expected capital expenditures. 
 (g) These solar projects are expected to support Ameren Missouri s transition to renewable energy generation. 
 (h) For additional information see Castle Bluff Natural Gas Project CCN and Post-Construction Cost Deferral below. 
 Castle Bluff Natural Gas Project CCN and Post-Construction Cost Deferral 
 In October 2024, the MoPSC issued an order approving a nonunanimous stipulation and agreement filed by Ameren Missouri, the MoPSC staff, and other intervenors requesting a CCN for the Castle Bluff Natural Gas Project. The order also includes the use of a post-construction cost deferral related to the Castle Bluff Natural Gas Project, which allows Ameren Missouri to defer and recover depreciation expense, financing costs, and applicable income taxes incurred from the date the project is placed in service to the date when project costs are reflected in updated base rates as a result of a regulatory rate review. The period of deferral would be limited to the earlier of the time the project costs are reflected in base rates or six months. 
 Securitization of Rush Island Energy Center Costs 
 In June 2024, the MoPSC issued a financing order authorizing the issuance of securitized utility tariff bonds by a wholly owned, special purpose subsidiary of Ameren Missouri to finance approximately million of costs related to the planned accelerated retirement of the Rush Island Energy Center, which includes the expected remaining unrecovered net plant balance associated with the facility, among other costs. Ameren Missouri will collect the amounts necessary to repay the bonds over approximately years from the date of bond issuance. The financing order also includes a determination that the decision to retire the Rush Island Energy Center was reasonable and prudent. The MoPSC did not make a determination regarding the prudency of Ameren Missouri's prior actions that resulted in the adverse ruling in the NSR and Clean Air Act litigation discussed in Note 9 Commitments and Contingencies. However, claims regarding such actions could be considered in future regulatory proceedings. If future regulatory proceedings result in revenue reductions based on Ameren Missouri s prior actions that resulted in the adverse ruling in the NSR and Clean Air Act litigation, it could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial position, and liquidity of Ameren and Ameren Missouri. In September 2024, the financing order became final and unappealable. 
 MEEIA 
 In January 2024, Ameren Missouri filed a proposed customer energy-efficiency plan with the MoPSC under the MEEIA. In October 2024, Ameren Missouri, the MoOPC, and other intervenors filed a nonunanimous stipulation and agreement with the MoPSC for a three-year plan, which includes a portfolio of customer energy-efficiency and demand response programs, along with the continued use of the MEEIA rider,

million annually in 2025 and 2026 and million in 2027 in the proposed customer energy-efficiency and demand response programs. In addition, the agreement requested performance incentives applicable to each plan year to earn revenues by achieving certain spending and demand response goals. If of the goals are achieved in 2025, 2026, and 2027, Ameren Missouri would earn performance incentive revenues of million, million, and million, respectively. Ameren Missouri expects a decision by the MoPSC in the fourth quarter of 2024, but cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this regulatory proceeding. 
 MISO Long-Range Transmission Projects CCN 
 In July 2022, the MISO approved the first tranche of projects related to a preliminary long-range transmission planning roadmap of projects through 2039. A portion of these projects were assigned or awarded via a competitive bid process to various utilities, including Ameren. In July 2024, ATXI filed a request for a CCN, among other things, with the MoPSC related to a portion of the MISO long-range transmission projects that it expects to construct within the MoPSC s jurisdiction. A decision by the MoPSC is expected by mid-2025. 
 Illinois 
 MYRP 
 In December 2023, the ICC issued an order in Ameren Illinois' MYRP proceeding approving base rates for electric distribution services for 2024 through 2027 and rejecting Ameren Illinois' Grid Plan, which was addressed as part of the MYRP proceeding. Rate changes consistent with the December 2023 order became effective in January 2024 and remained effective through late June 2024, when new rates became effective pursuant to the June 2024 ICC rehearing order discussed below. The December 2023 order adopted an alternative methodology to establish a rate base and revenue requirements for the years 2024 through 2027 using Ameren Illinois previously approved 2022 year-end rate base. In January 2024, the ICC partially denied a rehearing requested by Ameren Illinois to revise the allowed ROE in the December 2023 order and granted Ameren Illinois rehearing request to reconsider the rate base for each year of the MYRP and to include a base level of investments to maintain grid reliability in each year of the MYRP. In June 2024, the ICC issued an order on Ameren Illinois rehearing request, which revised the rate bases for Ameren Illinois MYRP test years to include investments for 2023 through 2027, among other things. New rates became effective in late June 2024. For additional information on the ICC s June 2024 rehearing order, see the table below. In July 2024, Ameren Illinois filed a request for rehearing of the ICC s June 2024 rehearing order to include an asset associated with other postretirement benefits in the rate base. Subsequently, in August 2024, the ICC denied the rehearing request. Also, in January 2024, Ameren Illinois filed an appeal of the December 2023 ICC order, including the ROE, and subsequently updated the appeal filing in September 2024 to include the June 2024 rehearing order regarding the inclusion of an asset associated with other postretirement benefits in the rate base to the Illinois Appellate Court for the Fifth Judicial District. The court is under no deadline to address the appeal. 
 In September 2024, Ameren Illinois filed an update to its revised Grid Plan and revised MYRP to update the requested revenue requirements for 2024 through 2027. Related to this MYRP filing, the ICC staff submitted its recommendation, and the administrative law judges issued a proposed order in August 2024 and October 2024, respectively, each recommending ICC approval of the Grid Plan and MYRP, with various adjustments as outlined in the table below. An ICC decision on the revised Grid Plan and updated revenue requirements is expected in December 2024 with rates effective in January 2025.

 Using the 2023 revenue requirement as a starting point, the approved revenue requirements in the ICC s June 2024 rehearing order represent a cumulative four-year increase of million compared to a cumulative increase of million in Ameren Illinois September 2024 revised MYRP, a cumulative increase of million in the ICC staff s August 2024 revised MYRP recommendation, and a cumulative increase of million in the administrative law judges October 2024 proposed order. 
 Ameren Illinois cannot predict the ultimate outcome of the appeal to the Illinois Appellate Court for the Fifth Judicial District, its revised Grid Plan filing, or its request to update the associated MYRP revenue requirements for 2024 through 2027. 
 2023 Electric Distribution Revenue Requirement Reconciliation Adjustment Request 
 In April 2024, Ameren Illinois filed for a reconciliation adjustment to its 2023 electric distribution service revenue requirement with the ICC. In July 2024, Ameren Illinois filed a revised reconciliation adjustment, requesting recovery of million. The reconciliation adjustment reflects a capital structure composed of common equity and Ameren Illinois actual 2023 recoverable costs and year-end rate base. In August 2024, the ICC staff submitted its calculation of the reconciliation adjustment, recommending approval of Ameren Illinois request. An ICC decision in this proceeding is required by December 2024, and any approved adjustment would be collected from customers in 2025. This is the final revenue requirement reconciliation under the IEIMA formula framework. 
 Electric Customer Energy-Efficiency Investments 
 In May 2024, Ameren Illinois filed its annual electric energy-efficiency formula rate update to increase its rates by million with the ICC. In September 2024, the ICC staff filed a recommendation supporting Ameren Illinois requested increase. An ICC decision in this proceeding is required by December 2024, with new rates effective January 2025. 
 2023 Natural Gas Delivery Service Rate Order 
 In November 2023, the ICC issued an order in Ameren Illinois January 2023 natural gas delivery service regulatory rate review, which resulted in an increase to its annual revenues for natural gas delivery service of million based on a allowed ROE, a capital structure composed of common equity, and a rate base of approximately billion. The order reflected a reduction of approximately 
 20 

Table of Contents 

million of planned distribution and transmission capital investments included in Ameren Illinois requested revenue increase, which used a 2024 future test year. The new rates became effective on November 28, 2023. 
 In December 2023, Ameren Illinois filed a request for rehearing of the ICC s November 2023 order. The filing requested the ICC revise the order to include an allowed ROE of at least , a capital structure composed of common equity, and the reversal of the approximately million reduction of planned distribution and transmission capital investments included in the order, among other things. In January 2024, the ICC denied Ameren Illinois rehearing request. Subsequently, in January 2024, Ameren Illinois filed an appeal of the November 2023 ICC order to the Illinois Appellate Court for the Fifth Judicial District. The court is under no deadline to address the appeal. Ameren Illinois cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this appeal. 
 QIP Reconciliation Hearing 
 In March 2021, Ameren Illinois filed a request with the ICC to initiate a reconciliation proceeding to determine the accuracy and prudence of natural gas capital investments recovered under the QIP rider during 2020. In September 2024, the Illinois Attorney General s office challenged the recovery of capital investments that were made during 2020, alleging that the ICC should disallow approximately million in natural gas capital investments as improper and imprudent, and resulting in a potential over-recovery of approximately million by Ameren Illinois in 2020. In October 2023, and again in September 2024, the ICC staff filed testimony that supports the prudence and reasonableness of the capital investments made during 2020. Ameren Illinois 2020 QIP rate recovery request under review by the ICC was within the rate increase limitations allowed by law. The ICC is under no deadline to issue an order in this proceeding. Ameren Illinois cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this regulatory proceeding. 
 MISO Long-Range Transmission Projects CCN 
 In July 2022, the MISO approved the first tranche of projects related to a preliminary long-range transmission planning roadmap of projects through 2039. A portion of these projects were assigned or awarded via a competitive bidding process to various utilities, including Ameren. In February 2024, Ameren Illinois and ATXI filed a request for a CCN, among other things, with the ICC related to the portion of the MISO long-range transmission projects they will construct within the ICC s jurisdiction. A decision by the ICC is expected by mid-2025. 
 Federal 
 FERC Complaint Cases 
 Since November 2013, the allowed base ROE for FERC-regulated transmission rate base under the MISO tariff has been subject to customer complaint cases and has been changed by various FERC orders. In May 2020, the FERC issued an order, which set the allowed base ROE to and required refunds, with interest, for the periods from November 2013 to February 2015 and from late September 2016 forward. Ameren and Ameren Illinois paid these refunds, including interest, by March 31, 2022. In June and July 2020, Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois, and ATXI, as well as various customers, petitioned the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit for review of the May 2020 order, challenging certain aspects of the new ROE methodology established. The petition filed by Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois, and ATXI challenged the refunds required for the period from September 2016 to May 2020. In August 2022, the court issued a ruling that granted the customers petition for review, vacated the FERC s previous MISO ROE-determining orders, and remanded the proceedings to the FERC. The court elected not to rule on the issues raised by Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois, and ATXI. In October 2024, the FERC issued an order, which decreased the allowed base ROE from to and required refunds, with interest, for the same periods covered by the May 2020 order. 
 As a result of the October 2024 order, Ameren and Ameren Illinois recognized reductions to "Operating Revenues Electric" on their statements of income of million and million, respectively, and recognized expense of million and million, respectively, in Interest charges on their statements of income during the third quarter of 2024. As of September 30, 2024, Ameren and Ameren Illinois had recorded liabilities in "Current regulatory liabilities" on their balance sheets of million and million, respectively, to reflect the expected refunds, including interest, associated with the allowed base ROE set by the October 2024 order. The decrease in the FERC-allowed base ROE resulting from the October 2024 order is not material to Ameren Missouri s results of operations, financial position, or liquidity.

Cash collateral posted reduces gross liability balances and is included in Other current assets and Other assets on the balance sheet. 
 Credit Risk 
 In determining our concentrations of credit risk related to derivative instruments, we review our individual counterparties and categorize each counterparty into groupings according to the primary business in which each engages. As of September 30, 2024, if counterparty groups were to fail completely to perform on contracts, the Ameren Companies maximum exposure related to derivative assets, predominantly from financial institutions, would have been immaterial with or without consideration of the application of master netting arrangements or similar agreements and collateral held. 
 Certain of our derivative instruments contain collateral provisions tied to the Ameren Companies credit ratings. If our credit ratings were downgraded below investment grade, or if a counterparty with reasonable grounds for uncertainty regarding our ability to satisfy an obligation requested adequate assurance of performance, additional collateral postings might be required. The additional collateral required is the net liability position allowed under master netting arrangements or similar agreements, assuming (1) the credit risk-related contingent features underlying these arrangements were triggered and (2) those counterparties with rights to do so requested collateral.

million to million from 2024 through 2028 to comply with environmental regulations. These estimates exclude capital expenditures that may be necessary to comply with regulations issued by the EPA in 2024 relating to CO 2 emissions, MATS, effluent limitations guidelines, and CCR, which Ameren and Ameren Missouri are assessing and are discussed below. Additional capital expenditures for environmental controls beyond 2028 could be required. This estimate of capital expenditures includes surface impoundment closure and corrective action measures required by the 2015 CCR Rule and modifications to cooling water intake structures at existing power plants under Clean Water Act rules in place prior to 2024, all of which are discussed below. In addition to planned retirements of coal-fired energy centers identified in the 2023 IRP filed with the MoPSC in September 2023 and as noted below with respect to the NSR and Clean Air Act litigation and Illinois emissions standards discussed in Note 14 Commitments and Contingencies under Part II, Item 8, of the Form 10-K, Ameren Missouri s current plan for compliance with existing air emission regulations includes burning low-sulfur coal and installing new or optimizing existing air pollution control equipment. The actual amount of capital expenditures required to comply with existing environmental regulations may vary substantially from the above estimates because of uncertainty as to future permitting requirements by state regulators and the EPA, revisions to regulatory obligations, and varying cost of potential compliance strategies, among other things. 
 The following sections describe the significant environmental statutes and regulations and environmental enforcement and remediation matters that affect or could affect our operations. The EPA periodically amends and revises its regulations and proposes amendments to regulations and guidelines, which could ultimately result in the revision of all or part of such regulations. 
 Clean Air Act 
 Federal and state laws, including the CSAPR, regulate emissions of SO 2 and NO x through the reduction of emissions at their source and the use and retirement of emission allowances. In April 2022, the EPA proposed the Good Neighbor Rule of the Clean Air Act, which includes additional NO x emission reductions from power plants in Missouri, Illinois, and other states through revisions to the CSAPR. In January 2023, the EPA issued its final disapproval of Missouri s proposed state implementation plan for addressing the transport of ozone under the Good Neighbor Rule of the Clean Air Act. The disapproval of the state plan allows the EPA to implement revisions to the CSAPR through a federal implementation plan. In March 2023, the EPA announced federal implementation plan requirements, which were subsequently published to the Federal Register in June 2023, reducing the amount of NOx allowances available for state budgets and imposing NO x emission limits on electric generating units for Missouri, Illinois, and other states under the Good Neighbor Rule of the Clean Air Act. In April 2023, the Missouri Attorney General and Ameren Missouri separately filed lawsuits in the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit challenging the EPA s disapproval of the Missouri state plan and sought a stay of the EPA s disapproval of the Missouri state plan. Both the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit and the United States Supreme Court have granted applications to stay the EPA s imposition of the federal implementation plan until resolution of appellate court challenges. A decision on the Good Neighbor Rule by the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit is expected in 2025. Ameren Missouri complies with the current CSAPR requirements by minimizing emissions through the use of low-sulfur coal, operation of scrubbers at its Sioux Energy Center, and optimization of existing NO x air pollution control equipment. Reducing the amount of state budget NO x allowances for compliance with NO x emission limits could result in additional controls being required on Ameren Missouri s generating units and/or the reduction of operations. Any additional costs for compliance are expected to be recovered from customers, subject to MoPSC prudence review, through the FAC or higher base rates. 
 CO 2 Emissions Standards 
 In June 2022, the United States Supreme Court issued its decision in West Virginia v. EPA, clarifying that there are limits on how the EPA may regulate greenhouse gases absent further direction from the United States Congress. The court concluded that the EPA s proposed

million. As of September 30, 2024, Ameren and Ameren Missouri each recorded liabilities of million and million in Other current liabilities and Other deferred credits and liabilities , respectively, on their consolidated balance sheets and recorded charges of million and million in Other operations and maintenance on their consolidated statements of income in the first and third quarters of 2024, respectively, related to the cost of these programs. 
 In connection with the accelerated retirement of the Rush Island Energy Center, the MoPSC issued an order in June 2024 authorizing Ameren Missouri to finance the costs associated with the retirement, including the remaining unrecovered net plant balance associated with the facility, through the issuance of securitized utility tariff bonds pursuant to Missouri s securitization statute. Costs associated with the retirement would exclude any additional mitigation relief ordered in the NSR and Clean Air Act litigation discussed above. See Note 2 Rate and Regulatory Matters for additional information. 
 Clean Water Act 
 Among other items, the Clean Water Act requires power plant operators to evaluate cooling water intake structures and identify measures for reducing the number of aquatic organisms impinged on a power plant s cooling water intake screens or entrained through the plant s cooling water system. All of Ameren Missouri s coal-fired and nuclear energy centers are subject to this cooling water intake structures rule. Requirements of the rule are implemented by state regulators through the permit renewal process of each power plant s water discharge permit. Permits for Ameren Missouri s coal-fired and nuclear energy centers have been issued or are in the process of renewal. 
 In 2015, the EPA issued a rule to revise the effluent limitation guidelines applicable to steam electric generating units. These guidelines established national standards for water discharges, prohibit effluent discharges of certain waste streams, and impose more stringent limitations on certain water discharges from power plants by 2025. To comply with these guidelines, Ameren Missouri installed dry ash handling systems and wastewater treatment facilities at its coal-fired energy centers. In April 2024, the EPA issued new effluent limitation guidelines that established a zero discharge limit for flue gas desulfurization wastewater, bottom ash transport water, and combustion

million associated with CCR storage facilities recorded on their respective balance sheets as of September 30, 2024. This amount includes an immaterial incremental ARO related to the 2024 CCR Rule, which may be revised as additional site studies are performed. Ameren and Ameren Missouri are assessing the impacts of this rule revision and, at this time, cannot predict the final impacts on their results of operations, financial position, and liquidity. 
 Remediation 
 The Ameren Companies are involved in a number of remediation actions to clean up sites impacted by the use or disposal of materials containing hazardous substances. Federal and state laws can require responsible parties to fund remediation regardless of their degree of fault, the legality of original disposal, or the ownership of a disposal site. 
 As of September 30, 2024, Ameren Illinois has remediated the majority of the former MGP sites in Illinois with an estimated remaining obligation primarily related to three of these former MGP sites at million to million. Ameren and Ameren Illinois recorded a liability of million to represent the estimated minimum obligation for these sites, as no other amount within the range was a better estimate. Ameren cannot estimate the completion date of the estimated remaining obligation due to site accessibility, among other things. 
 The scope of the remediation activities at these former MGP sites may increase as remediation efforts continue. Considerable uncertainty remains in these estimates because many site-specific factors can influence the actual costs, including unanticipated underground structures, the degree to which groundwater is impacted, regulatory changes, local ordinances, and site accessibility. The actual costs and timing of completion may vary substantially from these estimates. 
 The ICC allows Ameren Illinois to recover MGP remediation and related litigation costs from its electric and natural gas utility customers through environmental cost riders that are subject to annual prudence reviews by the ICC. 
 Our operations or those of our predecessor companies involve the use of, disposal of, and, in appropriate circumstances, the cleanup of substances regulated under environmental laws. We are unable to determine whether such historical practices will result in future environmental commitments, including additional or more stringent cleanup standards, or will affect our results of operations, financial position, or liquidity.

 million are included in the costs used to establish electric rates for Ameren Missouri s customers. Every , the MoPSC requires Ameren Missouri to file an updated cost study and funding analysis for decommissioning its Callaway Energy Center. An updated cost study and funding analysis was filed with the MoPSC in December 2023 and is reflected within the ARO. Ameren Missouri s filing supported no change in electric service rates for decommissioning costs. There is no deadline by which the MoPSC must issue an order regarding the filing. See Note 13 Supplemental Information for more information on Ameren Missouri s AROs.

Weekly indemnity up to million for 52 weeks, which commences after the first 12 weeks of an outage, plus up to million per week for a minimum of 71 weeks thereafter for a total not exceeding the policy limit of million. Nonradiation events are limited to million. 
 The Price-Anderson Act is a federal law that limits the liability for claims from an incident involving any licensed United States commercial nuclear energy center. The limit is based on the number of licensed reactors. The limit of liability and the maximum potential annual payments are adjusted at least every for inflation to reflect changes in the Consumer Price Index. The most recent five-year inflationary adjustment became effective in October 2023. Owners of a nuclear reactor cover this exposure through a combination of private insurance and mandatory participation in a financial protection pool, as established by the Price-Anderson Act. 
 Losses resulting from terrorist attacks on nuclear facilities insured by NEIL are subject to industrywide aggregates, such that terrorist acts against one or more commercial nuclear power plants within a stated time period would be treated as a single event, and the owners of the nuclear power plants would share the limit of liability. NEIL policies have an aggregate limit of billion within a 12-month period for radiation events, or billion for events not involving radiation contamination, resulting from terrorist attacks. The EMANI policies are not subject to industrywide aggregates in the event of terrorist attacks on nuclear facilities. 
 If losses from a nuclear incident at the Callaway Energy Center exceed insurance limits, are not covered by insurance, or if coverage is unavailable, Ameren Missouri is at risk for any uninsured losses. If a serious nuclear incident were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on Ameren s and Ameren Missouri s results of operations, financial position, or liquidity.

 OVERVIEW 
 Net income attributable to Ameren common shareholders in the three months ended September 30, 2024, was 456 million, or 1.70 per diluted share, compared with 493 million, or 1.87 per diluted share, in the year-ago period. Net income attributable to Ameren common shareholders in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was 975 million, or 3.65 per diluted share, compared with 994 million, or 3.78 per diluted share, in the year-ago period. Earnings for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, were unfavorably affected by increased other operations and maintenance expenses not subject to formula rates, riders, or trackers, due to a charge recorded by Ameren Missouri related to an agreement in principle with the United States Department of Justice, which, if approved, would resolve all outstanding claims in the NSR and Clean Air Act litigation related to the Rush Island Energy Center. Earnings in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, were also unfavorably affected by increased financing costs due to higher long-term debt balances and interest rates, a lower recognized ROE under the MYRP, lower Ameren Transmission earnings resulting from the October 2024 FERC order lowering the allowed base ROE, and an increase in the weighted-average basic common shares outstanding, which reduced earnings per diluted

share. Net income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, was favorably affected by increased rate base investments at Ameren Transmission and increased deferral of financing costs associated with rate base investments at Ameren Missouri. Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was favorably affected by increased base rate revenues pursuant to the MoPSC's June 2023 electric rate order and increased retail electric sales volumes at Ameren Missouri. Earnings for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, were also favorably affected by higher base rate revenues pursuant to the ICC's November 2023 natural gas rate order, which increased earnings at Ameren Illinois Natural Gas. Net income for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was unfavorably affected by decreased retail electric sales volumes at Ameren Missouri, primarily due to milder summer temperatures in 2024. Earnings for the three months ended September 30, 2024, were favorably affected by decreased other operations and maintenance expenses not subject to formula rates, riders, or trackers, primarily at Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois Natural Gas, excluding a charge related to an increase in the cost of additional mitigation relief discussed above, largely due to lower storm costs, an increase in the cash surrender value of COLI, and disciplined cost management including lower labor costs from decreased headcount, decreased use of contractors, and lower amortization of refueling costs for the Callaway Energy Center. 
 Ameren s strategic plan includes investing in rate-regulated energy infrastructure, enhancing regulatory frameworks and advocating for responsible policies, and optimizing operating performance to capitalize on opportunities to benefit our customers, communities, shareholders, and the environment. Ameren remains focused on disciplined cost management and strategic capital allocation. Ameren invested 3.0 billion in its rate-regulated businesses in the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 In June 2024, Ameren Missouri filed a request with the MoPSC seeking approval to increase its annual revenues for electric service by 446 million. The electric rate increase request is based on a 10.25 ROE, a capital structure composed of 52 common equity, a rate base of 14 billion, and a test year ended March 31, 2024, with certain pro-forma adjustments expected through an anticipated true-up date of December 31, 2024. The MoPSC proceeding relating to the proposed electric service rate changes will take place over a period of up to 11 months, with a decision by the MoPSC expected by May 2025 and new rates effective by June 2025. 
 In June 2024, the MoPSC issued a financing order authorizing the issuance of securitized utility tariff bonds by a wholly owned, special purpose subsidiary of Ameren Missouri to finance approximately 470 million of costs related to the planned accelerated retirement of the Rush Island Energy Center, which includes the expected remaining unrecovered net plant balance associated with the facility, among other costs. Ameren Missouri will collect the amounts necessary to repay the bonds over approximately 15 years from the date of bond issuance. The financing order also includes a determination that the decision to retire the Rush Island Energy Center was reasonable and prudent. The MoPSC did not make a determination regarding the prudency of Ameren Missouri's prior actions that resulted in the adverse ruling in the NSR and Clean Air Act litigation discussed in Note 9 Commitments and Contingencies under Part I, Item 1, of this report. However, claims regarding such actions could be considered in future regulatory proceedings. If future regulatory proceedings result in revenue reductions based on Ameren Missouri s prior actions that resulted in the adverse ruling in the NSR and Clean Air Act litigation, it could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial position, and liquidity of Ameren and Ameren Missouri. In September 2024, the financing order became final and unappealable. 
 In September 2023, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri granted Ameren Missouri s request to modify a September 2019 remedy order issued by the district court in order to allow the retirement of the Rush Island Energy Center in advance of its previously expected retirement date of 2039, in lieu of installing a flue gas desulfurization system. Ameren Missouri retired the Rush Island Energy Center on October 15, 2024. The United States Department of Justice is seeking an order from the district court providing for additional mitigation relief related to prior emissions. In November 2024, Ameren Missouri and the United States Department of Justice reached an agreement in principle, which, if approved by the district court, would resolve all outstanding claims in this case and would require Ameren Missouri to fund a program to provide electric buses and charging stations to schools in the metro St. Louis area and a program to provide air purifiers to eligible Ameren Missouri electric residential customers. These programs are estimated to cost approximately 64 million. As of September 30, 2024, Ameren and Ameren Missouri recorded liabilities of 64 million and charges of 15 million and 44 million in the first and third quarters of 2024, respectively, related to the cost of these programs. 
 In 2024, the MoPSC issued orders approving requested CCNs for the Split Rail, Vandalia, Bowling Green, and Cass County solar projects. Ameren Missouri acquired the Cass County, Boomtown, and Huck Finn solar projects in June 2024, September 2024, and October 2024, respectively. These three acquisitions collectively represent a purchase price of approximately 0.9 billion. In October 2024, the MoPSC issued an order approving a nonunanimous stipulation and agreement filed by Ameren Missouri, the MoPSC staff, and other intervenors requesting a CCN for the Castle Bluff Natural Gas Project. The order also includes the use of a post-construction cost deferral related to the project, which allows Ameren Missouri to defer and recover depreciation expense, financing costs, and applicable income taxes incurred from the date the project is placed in service to the date when project costs are reflected in updated base rates as a result of a regulatory rate review. The period of deferral would be limited to the earlier of the time the project costs are reflected in base rates or six months.

In February 2024, Ameren Missouri filed an update to its Smart Energy Plan with the MoPSC, which includes a five-year capital investment overview with a detailed one-year plan for 2024. The plan is designed to upgrade Ameren Missouri s electric infrastructure and includes investments that will upgrade the grid and accommodate more renewable energy. Investments under the plan are expected to total approximately 12.4 billion over the five-year period from 2024 through 2028, with expenditures largely recoverable under the PISA. Ameren Missouri s Smart Energy Plan excludes investments in its natural gas distribution business, as well as removal costs, net of salvage. 
 In January 2024, Ameren Missouri filed a proposed customer energy-efficiency plan with the MoPSC under the MEEIA. In October 2024, Ameren Missouri, the MoOPC, and other intervenors filed a nonunanimous stipulation and agreement with the MoPSC for a three-year plan, which includes a portfolio of customer energy-efficiency and demand response programs, along with the continued use of the MEEIA rider, which allows Ameren Missouri to collect from customers its actual MEEIA program costs and related lost electric revenues. If the agreement is approved, Ameren Missouri intends to invest 51 million annually in 2025 and 2026 and 22 million in 2027 in the proposed customer energy-efficiency and demand response programs. In addition, the agreement requested performance incentives applicable to each plan year to earn revenues by achieving certain spending and demand response goals. If 100 of the goals are achieved in 2025, 2026, and 2027, Ameren Missouri would earn performance incentive revenues of 5 million, 5 million, and 2 million, respectively. Ameren Missouri expects a decision by the MoPSC in the fourth quarter of 2024, but cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this regulatory proceeding. 
 In September 2024, Ameren Missouri filed a request with the MoPSC seeking approval to increase its annual revenues for natural gas delivery service by 40 million. The natural gas rate increase request is based on a 10.25 ROE, a capital structure composed of 52 common equity, a rate base of 531 million, and a test year ended March 31, 2024, with certain pro-forma adjustments expected through the true-up date of December 31, 2024. The MoPSC proceeding relating to the proposed natural gas delivery service rate changes will take place over a period of up to 11 months, with a decision by the MoPSC expected by August 2025 and new rates effective by September 2025. 
 In April 2024, Ameren Illinois filed for a reconciliation adjustment to its 2023 electric distribution service revenue requirement with the ICC. In July 2024, Ameren Illinois filed a revised reconciliation adjustment, requesting recovery of 158 million. The reconciliation adjustment reflects a capital structure composed of 50 common equity and Ameren Illinois actual 2023 recoverable costs and year-end rate base. In August 2024, the ICC staff submitted its calculation of the reconciliation adjustment, recommending approval of Ameren Illinois request. An ICC decision in this proceeding is required by December 2024, and any approved adjustment would be collected from customers in 2025. This is the final revenue requirement reconciliation under the IEIMA formula framework. 
 In December 2023, the ICC issued an order in Ameren Illinois' MYRP proceeding approving base rates for electric distribution services for 2024 through 2027 and rejecting Ameren Illinois' Grid Plan, which was addressed as part of the MYRP proceeding. Rate changes consistent with the December 2023 order became effective in January 2024 and remained effective through late June 2024, when new rates became effective pursuant to the June 2024 ICC rehearing order discussed below. The December 2023 order adopted an alternative methodology to establish a rate base and revenue requirements for the years 2024 through 2027 using Ameren Illinois previously approved 2022 year-end rate base. In January 2024, the ICC partially denied a rehearing requested by Ameren Illinois to revise the allowed ROE in the December 2023 order and granted Ameren Illinois rehearing request to reconsider the rate base for each year of the MYRP and to include a base level of investments to maintain grid reliability in each year of the MYRP. In June 2024, the ICC issued an order on Ameren Illinois rehearing request, approving revenue requirements for electric distribution services for 2024, 2025, 2026, and 2027 of 1,196 million, 1,282 million, 1,350 million, and 1,397 million, respectively. New rates became effective in late June 2024. In July 2024, Ameren Illinois filed a request for rehearing of the ICC s June 2024 rehearing order to include an asset associated with other postretirement benefits in the rate base. Subsequently, in August 2024, the ICC denied the rehearing request. Also, in January 2024, Ameren Illinois filed an appeal of the December 2023 ICC order, including the 8.72 ROE, and subsequently updated the appeal filing in September 2024 to include the June 2024 rehearing order regarding the inclusion of an asset associated with other postretirement benefits in the rate base to the Illinois Appellate Court for the Fifth Judicial District. The court is under no deadline to address the appeal. In September 2024, Ameren Illinois filed an update to its revised Grid Plan and a request to update the associated MYRP revenue requirements for 2024, 2025, 2026, and 2027 of 1,215 million, 1,299 million, 1,385 million, and 1,444 million, respectively. An ICC decision on the revised Grid Plan and updated revenue requirements is expected in December 2024 with rates effective in January 2025. Ameren Illinois cannot predict the ultimate outcome of the appeal to the Illinois Appellate Court for the Fifth Judicial District, its revised Grid Plan filing, or its request to update the associated MYRP revenue requirements for 2024 through 2027.

In November 2023, the ICC issued an order in Ameren Illinois January 2023 natural gas delivery service regulatory rate review, which resulted in an increase to its annual revenues for natural gas delivery service of 112 million based on a 9.44 allowed ROE, a capital structure composed of 50 common equity, and a rate base of approximately 2.85 billion. The order reflected a reduction of approximately 93 million of planned distribution and transmission capital investments included in Ameren Illinois requested revenue increase, which used a 2024 future test year. The new rates became effective on November 28, 2023. In December 2023, Ameren Illinois filed a request for rehearing of the ICC s November 2023 order. The filing requested the ICC revise the order to include an allowed ROE of at least 9.89 , a capital structure composed of 52 common equity, and the reversal of the approximately 93 million reduction of planned distribution and transmission capital investments included in the order, among other things. In January 2024, the ICC denied Ameren Illinois rehearing request. Subsequently, in January 2024, Ameren Illinois filed an appeal of the November 2023 ICC order to the Illinois Appellate Court for the Fifth Judicial District. The court is under no deadline to address the appeal. Ameren Illinois cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this appeal. 
 In May 2024, Ameren Illinois filed its annual electric energy-efficiency formula rate update to increase its rates by 26 million with the ICC. In September 2024, the ICC staff filed a recommendation supporting Ameren Illinois requested increase. An ICC decision in this proceeding is required by December 2024, with new rates effective January 2025. 
 In October 2024, the FERC issued an order, which decreased the allowed base ROE for FERC-regulated transmission rate base under the MISO tariff from 10.02 to 9.98 and required refunds, with interest, for the periods from November 2013 to February 2015 and from late September 2016 forward. As a result, Ameren and Ameren Illinois recognized reductions to electric revenues of 10 million and 7 million, respectively, and recognized interest expense of 2 million and 1 million, respectively, on their statements of income during the third quarter of 2024. As of September 30, 2024, Ameren and Ameren Illinois had recorded current regulatory liabilities on their balance sheets of 12 million and 8 million, respectively, to reflect the expected refunds, including interest, associated with the allowed base ROE set by the October 2024 order. The decrease in the FERC-allowed base ROE resulting from the October 2024 order is not material to Ameren Missouri s results of operations, financial position, or liquidity. 
 In 2021, the MISO issued a report outlining a preliminary long-range transmission planning roadmap of projects through 2039, which considers the rapidly changing generation mix within MISO resulting from significant additions of renewable generation, actual and expected generation plant closures, and state mandates or goals for clean energy or carbon emissions reductions. In July 2022, the MISO approved the first tranche of projects under the roadmap. A portion of these projects were assigned to various utilities, of which Ameren was awarded projects that are estimated to cost approximately 1.8 billion, based on the MISO s cost estimate. Related to these projects, Ameren began substation upgrades in May 2024 in advance of transmission line construction, which is expected to begin in 2026, with forecasted completion dates near the end of this decade. In addition, the MISO awarded two competitive bid projects to ATXI in the fourth quarter of 2023 and one in April 2024 that represent a total estimated investment of approximately 220 million for ATXI. In February 2024, Ameren Illinois and ATXI filed a request for a CCN, among other things, with the ICC related to the portion of the MISO long-range transmission projects they will construct within the ICC s jurisdiction. A decision by the ICC is expected by mid-2025. In July 2024, ATXI filed a request for a CCN, among other things, with the MoPSC related to a portion of the MISO long-range transmission projects that it expects to construct within the MoPSC s jurisdiction. A decision by the MoPSC is expected by mid-2025. In September 2024, the MISO revised a proposed first set of second tranche projects with estimated costs of 21.8 billion, which includes projects located in our service territories of 3.6 billion, based on the MISO s cost estimate. The MISO is expected to approve this set of projects by the end of 2024. The MISO expects to begin developing an additional set of second tranche projects in 2025. 
 For further information on the matters discussed above, see Note 2 Rate and Regulatory Matters under Part I, Item 1, of this report, and the Outlook section below. 
 
 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 Our results of operations and financial position are affected by many factors. Economic conditions, energy-efficiency investments by our customers and by us, technological advances, distributed generation, and the actions of key customers can significantly affect the demand for our services. Ameren and Ameren Missouri results are also affected by seasonal fluctuations in winter heating and summer cooling demands and by weather conditions, such as storms, as well as by energy center maintenance outages. Additionally, fluctuations in interest rates and conditions in the capital and credit markets affect our cost of borrowing, our pension and postretirement benefits costs, the cash surrender value of COLI, and the asset value of Ameren Missouri s nuclear decommissioning trust fund. Almost all of Ameren s revenues are subject to state or federal regulation. This regulation has a material impact on the rates we charge customers for our services. Our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity are affected by our ability to align our overall spending, both operating and capital, with the frameworks established by our regulators. See Note 2 Rate and Regulatory Matters under Part I, Item 1, of this report and Note 2 Rate and Regulatory Matters under Part II, Item 8, of the Form 10-K for additional information regarding Ameren Missouri s, Ameren Illinois , and ATXI s regulatory mechanisms.

Although the pace of inflation has slowed recently, we are still observing elevated inflation levels that continue to put pressure on the prices of labor, services, materials, and supplies, as well as elevated interest rates. Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois are generally allowed to pass on to customers prudently incurred costs for fuel, purchased power, and natural gas supply. Additionally, for certain non-commodity cost changes, the use of trackers, riders, formula ratemaking, and future test years, as applicable, mitigates our exposure. 
 Ameren Missouri principally uses coal and enriched uranium for fuel in its electric generation operations and purchases natural gas for its customers. Ameren Illinois purchases power and natural gas for its customers. The prices for these commodities can fluctuate significantly because of the global economic and political environment, weather, supply, demand, and many other factors. We have natural gas cost recovery mechanisms for our Illinois and Missouri natural gas distribution businesses, a purchased power cost recovery mechanism for Ameren Illinois electric distribution business, and a FAC for Ameren Missouri s electric business. 
 We employ various risk management strategies to reduce our exposure to commodity risk and other risks inherent in our business. The reliability of Ameren Missouri s energy centers and our transmission and distribution systems, and the level and timing of operations and maintenance costs and capital investment, are key factors that we seek to manage in order to optimize our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity. 
 Earnings Summary 
 The following table presents a summary of Ameren s earnings for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 Three Months Nine Months 2024 2023 2024 2023 Net income attributable to Ameren common shareholders 456 493 975 994 Earnings per common share diluted 1.70 1.87 3.65 3.78 
 Net income attributable to Ameren common shareholders decreased 37 million and earnings per diluted share decreased 17 cents in the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with the year-ago period. The decrease was due to net income decreases of 30 million and 10 million at Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution, respectively, and an increase in net loss of 5 million at Ameren Illinois Natural Gas. These decreases were partially offset by a net income increase of 4 million at Ameren Transmission and a decrease in net loss of 4 million for activity not reported as part of a segment, primarily at Ameren (parent). 
 Net income attributable to Ameren common shareholders decreased 19 million and earnings per diluted share decreased 13 cents in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with the year-ago period. The decrease was due to net income decreases of 20 million and 7 million at Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution and Ameren Missouri, respectively, and an increase in net loss of 13 million for activity not reported as part of a segment, primarily at Ameren (parent). These decreases were partially offset by net income increases of 12 million and 9 million at Ameren Transmission and Ameren Illinois Natural Gas. 
 Earnings per diluted share were unfavorably affected in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the year-ago periods (except where a specific period is referenced), by: 
 a charge recorded by Ameren Missouri, included in other operation and maintenance expenses, related to an agreement in principle with the United States Department of Justice, which, if approved, would resolve all outstanding claims in the NSR and Clean Air Act litigation related to the Rush Island Energy Center, see Note 9 - Commitments and Contingencies under Part 1, Item 1, of this report for more information (13 cents and 17 cents per share, respectively); 
 increased financing costs primarily at Ameren Missouri and Ameren (parent), largely due to higher long-term debt balances and interest rates, partially offset by lower levels of short-term borrowings (5 cents and 12 cents per share, respectively); 
 lower revenue at Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution due to a lower recognized ROE under the MYRP (3 cents and 7 cents per share, respectively); 
 increased weighted-average basic common shares outstanding resulting from issuances of common shares (3 cents and 6 cents per share, respectively); 
 the result of the October 2024 FERC order reducing the allowed base ROE for FERC regulated transmission rate base under the MISO tariff, which decreased Ameren Transmission earnings (4 cents per share for both periods); 
 decreased retail electric sales volumes at Ameren Missouri, primarily due to milder summer temperatures, partially offset by increased retail electric sales volumes, excluding the estimated effects of weather and customer energy-efficiency programs (estimated at 3 cents for the three months ended September 30, 2024); 
 increased taxes other than income taxes at Ameren Missouri, largely resulting from the absence in 2024 of employee retention tax credits received under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (1 cent and 2 cents per share, respectively); and 
 absence of recovery of previously incurred expenses at Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution (2 cents per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2024).

Earnings per diluted share were favorably affected in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the year-ago periods (except where a specific period is referenced), by: 
 increased rate base investments at Ameren Transmission, which increased earnings in this segment (5 cents and 12 cents per share, respectively); 
 increased allowance for equity funds used during construction and increased base rate revenues for the inclusion of previously deferred PISA and RESRAM interest charges pursuant to the June 2023 MoPSC electric rate order effective July 9, 2023, partially offset by increased interest charges resulting from lower deferrals in the nine months ended September 30, 2024, related to infrastructure investments associated with the PISA and RESRAM, at Ameren Missouri (5 cents and 11 cents per share, respectively); 
 increased base rate revenues at Ameren Missouri effective July 9, 2023, pursuant to the June 2023 MoPSC electric rate order, partially offset by the net effect of amortization of previously deferred depreciation expense under the PISA and RESRAM, financing costs otherwise recoverable under the PISA and RESRAM, a lower base level of expenses included in trackers, and the net recovery for amounts associated with the reduction in sales volumes resulting from MEEIA programs (9 cents per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2024); 
 decreased other operations and maintenance expenses not subject to formula rates, riders, or trackers, excluding a charge related to the NSR and Clean Air Act litigation discussed above, primarily at Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois Natural Gas, largely because of lower storm costs, an increase in the cash surrender value of COLI, and disciplined cost management including lower labor costs from decreased headcount, decreased use of contractors, and lower amortization of refueling costs for the Callaway Energy Center (7 cents and 1 cent per share, respectively); 
 increased retail electric sales volumes at Ameren Missouri, primarily due to higher sales excluding customer energy-efficiency programs (estimated at 5 cents per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2024); and 
 increased base rate revenues at Ameren Illinois Natural Gas effective November 28, 2023, pursuant to the November 2023 ICC natural gas rate order, partially offset by increased depreciation and amortization expenses included in base rates (4 cents per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2024). 
 The cents per share variances above are presented based on the weighted-average basic common shares outstanding in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, and do not reflect the impact of dilution on earnings per share, unless otherwise noted. The amounts above other than variances related to income taxes have been presented net of income taxes using Ameren s 2024 blended federal and state statutory tax rate of 26 . For additional details regarding the Ameren Companies results of operations, including explanations of Operating Revenues for both Electric Revenues and Natural Gas Revenues; Fuel and Purchased Power Expenses; Other Operations and Maintenance Expenses; Depreciation and Amortization Expenses; Taxes Other Than Income Taxes; Other Income, Net; Interest Charges; and Income Taxes, see the major headings below.

Electric Revenues 
 Ameren 
 Ameren s electric revenues increased 114 million, or 6 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared with the year-ago period, primarily due to increased revenues at Ameren Missouri and Ameren Transmission, partially offset by decreased revenues at Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution, as discussed below. Ameren s electric revenues decreased 176 million, or 3 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with the year-ago period, primarily due to decreased revenues at Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution and Ameren Missouri, partially offset by increased revenues at Ameren Transmission, as discussed below. 
 Ameren Transmission 
 Amer en Transmission s electric revenues increased 22 million, or 12 , and 74 million, or 14 , for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared with the year-ago periods. Revenues were favorably affected by higher recoverable expenses 
 (+ 15 million and + 40 million, respectively), increased capital investment (+ 13 million and + 33 million, respectively), as evidenced by a 15 increase in rate base used to calculate the revenue requirement, and increased facility rental revenues (+ 4 million and + 11 million, respectively) related to ATXI s transmission operations control center, which was placed in service in December 2023. ATXI provides affiliates with access to this facility. Rental revenues associated with this facility are affiliate transactions and eliminated in consolidation for Ameren s consolidated financial statements. See Note 8 Related-party Transactions under Part I, Item 1, of this report for additional information. Revenues were unfavorably affected by a decrease in the allowed base ROE under the MISO tariff resulting from the October 2024 FERC order, which included customer refunds for certain historical periods (- 10 million and - 10 million, respectively). See Note 2 Rate and Regulatory Matters under Part I, Item 1, of this report for additional information regarding the FERC complaint cases.

 Off-system sales, capacity and FAC revenues, net decreased 135 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to lower winter and spring capacity prices, partially offset by higher summer capacity prices which were set by annual MISO auctions. Ameren Missouri s 5 exposure to net energy cost variances under the FAC is included within Off-system sales, capacity, and FAC revenues, net and Energy costs (excluding the estimated effect of weather) in fuel and purchased power. 
 Revenues associated with Cost recovery mechanisms offset in fuel and purchased power decreased 11 million and 49 million, respectively, due to decreased revenue related to the amortization of costs previously deferred under the FAC that were reflected in customer rates. The changes to Cost recovery mechanisms - offset in fuel and purchased power are fully offset by changes to Cost recovery mechanisms - offset in electric revenue in fuel and purchased power. 
 The aggregate effect of weather decreased revenues an estimated 18 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, due to milder summer temperatures as cooling degree days decreased 5 . 
 The following items had a favorable effect on Ameren Missouri s electric revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with the year-ago periods (except where a specific period is referenced): 
 Off-system sales, capacity and FAC revenues, net increased 112 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to higher summer capacity prices which were set by annual MISO auctions. Ameren Missouri s 5 exposure to net energy cost variances under the FAC is included within Off-system sales, capacity, and FAC revenues, net and Energy costs (excluding the estimated effect of weather) in fuel and purchased power. 
 Higher electric base rates, resulting from the June 2023 MoPSC electric rate order effective July 9, 2023, increased revenues an estimated 2 million and 62 million, respectively. 
 Revenues associated with other cost recovery mechanisms increased 10 million and 23 million, respectively, primarily due to an increase in RESRAM revenues in both periods and an increase in excise taxes due to increased retail sales revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Excluding the estimated effects of weather and the MEEIA customer energy-efficiency programs, electric revenues increased an estimated 6 million and 17 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , due to an increase in retail sales volumes, which were, in part, favorably affected by the absence of customer outages resulting from major storms experienced throughout the service territory in July and August 2023 and an additional day in 2024 as a result of the leap year. The increase is partially offset by lower realized prices due to changes in customer usage patterns and economic development discounts. 
 Other revenues increased by 3 million in both periods, primarily due to increased mutual assistance related to storm recovery.

Ameren Missouri 
 Ameren Missouri s natural gas revenues were comparable for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and decreased 20 million, or 16 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , compared with the year-ago periods. Revenues associated with Cost recovery mechanisms offset in natural gas purchased for resale decreased 20 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, due to lower commodity prices and the absence of amortization of natural gas costs deferred under the PGA related to the extremely cold weather in mid-February 20 21. Changes in natural gas revenues under the PGA are fully offset by corresponding changes in natural gas purchased for resale expenses. 
 Ameren Illinois Natural Gas 
 Ameren Illinois Natural Gas revenues were comparable for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and decreased 5 million, or 1 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with the year-ago periods. 
 The following items had an unfavorable effect on Ameren Illinois Natural Gas revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with the year-ago periods (except where a specific period is referenced): 
 Cost recovery mechanisms offset in natural gas purchased for resale decreased revenues 47 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, due to lower collection of natural gas costs previously deferred under the PGA. Changes in natural gas revenues under the PGA are fully offset by the decrease in natural gas purchased for resale expenses. 
 The implementation of a change in rate design pursuant to the November 2023 natural gas rate order decreased revenues an estimated 9 million and 3 million, respectively. This change in rate design concentrates more revenues in the winter heating season due to an increase in volumetric rates and a decrease in fixed customer rates. As such, the change is not expected to materially affect annual earnings comparisons. 
 The decreases in Ameren Illinois Natural Gas revenues were partially offset by estimated increases of 8 million and 43 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared with the year-ago periods, due to higher natural gas base rates as a result of the November 2023 natural gas rate order.

 The effective tax rate was lower at Ameren Illinois Electric Distribution in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared with the year-ago periods, primarily because of an increase in excess deferred tax amortization pursuant to an ICC order, which was offset by a corresponding decrease in revenues. 
 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Collections from our tariff-based revenues are our principal source of cash provided by operating activities. A diversified retail customer mix, primarily consisting of rate-regulated residential, commercial, and industrial customers, provides us with a reasonably predictable source of cash. In addition to using cash provided by operating activities, we use available cash, drawings under committed credit agreements, commercial paper issuances, and/or, in the case of Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois, short-term affiliate borrowings to support normal operations and temporary capital requirements. We may reduce our short-term borrowings with cash provided by operations or, at our discretion, with long-term borrowings, or, in the case of Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois, with capital contributions from Ameren (parent). As of September 30, 2024, there have been no material changes other than in the ordinary course of business related to cash requirements arising from the long-term commitments for fuel for generation, purchased power, and natural gas for distribution as described under Liquidity and Capital Resources in Item 7 of the Form 10-K. 
 We expect to make significant capital expenditures over the next five years, supported by a combination of long-term debt and equity, as we invest in our electric and natural gas utility infrastructure to support overall system reliability, grid modernization, renewable energy target requirements, environmental compliance, and other improvements. For additional information about our long-term debt outstanding, including maturities due within one year, and the applicable interest rates, see Note 5 Long-term Debt and Equity Financings under Part II, Item 8 of the Form 10-K and Note 4 Long-term Debt and Equity Financings under Part I, Item 1, of this report. As part of its funding plan for capital expenditures, Ameren is using newly-issued shares of common stock to satisfy requirements under the DRPlus and employee benefit plans and expects to continue to do so through at least 2028. Additionally, Ameren has an ATM program under which Ameren may offer and sell from time to time common stock, which includes the ability to enter into forward sales agreements, subject to market conditions and other factors. There were no shares issued under the ATM program during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, Ameren had multiple forward sale agreements that could be settled under the ATM program with various counterparties relating to 4.7 million shares of common stock. Ameren expects to settle approximately 230 million of the forward sale agreements with physical delivery of 2.9 million shares of common stock by December 31, 2024. Including issuances under the DRPlus and employee benefit plans, Ameren plans to issue approximately 300 million of equity in 2024 and approximately 600 million of equity each year from 2025 to 2028. As of September 30, 2024, Ameren had approximately 615 million of common stock available for sale under the ATM program, which takes into account the forward sale agreements in effect as of September 30, 2024. The Ameren Companies expect their equity to total capitalization to support solid investment-grade credit ratings. See Long-term Debt and Equity below and Note 4 Long-term Debt and Equity Financings under Part I, Item 1, of this report for additional information on the ATM program, including the forward sale agreements under the ATM program relating to common stock.

Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
 Our cash provided by operating activities is affected by fluctuations of trade accounts receivable, inventories, and accounts and wages payable, among other things, as well as the unique regulatory environment for each of our businesses. Substantially all expenditures related to fuel, purchased power, and natural gas purchased for resale are recovered from customers through rate adjustment mechanisms, which may be adjusted without a traditional regulatory rate review, subject to prudence reviews. Similar regulatory mechanisms exist for certain other operating expenses that can also affect the timing of cash provided by operating activities. The timing of cash payments for costs recoverable under our regulatory mechanisms differs from the recovery period of those costs. Additionally, the seasonality of our electric and natural gas businesses, primarily caused by seasonal customer rates and changes in customer demand due to weather, significantly affects the amount and timing of our cash provided by operating activities. 
 Ameren 
 Ameren s cash provided by operating activities decreased 85 million in the first nine months of 2024, compared with the year-ago period. The following items contributed to the decrease: 
 A 143 million increase in net collateral posted with counterparties, primarily due to changes in the market prices of power, natural gas, and other fuels. 
 A 46 million decrease due to the timing of payments for accounts payable. 
 A 45 million increase in interest payments, primarily due to an increase in the average outstanding debt and an increase in interest rates. 
 A 29 million increase in the cost of natural gas held in storage, primarily at Ameren Illinois, because of higher volumes, partially offset by lower commodity prices. 
 A 10 million increase in payroll taxes, primarily at Ameren Missouri, due to the absence of employee retention tax credits received in the year-ago period under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act. 
 A 10 million increase in medical benefit costs. 
 A 6 million increase in pension and postretirement benefit plan contributions. 
 The following items partially offset the decrease in Ameren s cash from operating activities between periods:

 A 37 million increase due to the transfer of production tax credits generated by the High Prairie Renewable and Atchison Renewable energy centers to unrelated third parties and lower income tax payments primarily due to lower taxable income compared to the year-ago period. 
 A 34 million increase due to higher purchases of materials and supplies inventories in the year-ago period to support operations as levels were increased to mitigate against potential supply disruptions. 
 A 22 million increase due to insurance proceeds received in 2024 related to workers compensation payments made in the year-ago period at Ameren Illinois.

 An 18 million increase due to higher coal purchases in the year-ago period to bring coal inventories back to targeted levels after transportation delays experienced in 2022. 
 Ameren Illinois 
 Ameren Illinois cash provided by operating activities increased 41 million in the first nine months of 2024, compared with the year-ago period. The following items contributed to the increase: 
 A 57 million increase resulting from increased customer collections primarily from base rate increases effective November 28, 2023, pursuant to the November 2023 natural gas rate order and electric transmission rate base growth, and by increased customer collections under cost recovery mechanisms. 
 A 52 million increase due to lower income tax payments to Ameren (parent), pursuant to the tax allocation agreement, primarily due to lower taxable income compared to the year-ago period. 
 A 22 million increase due to insurance proceeds received in 2024 related to workers compensation payments made in the year-ago period. 
 A 19 million increase due to workers compensation payments made in the year-ago period. 
 The following items partially offset the increase in Ameren Illinois cash from operating activities between periods: 
 A 42 million increase in net collateral posted with counterparties, primarily due to changes in the market prices of power and natural gas. 
 A 25 million increase in the cost of natural gas held in storage because of higher volumes, partially offset by lower commodity prices. 
 A 21 million decrease due to the timing of payments for accounts payable. 
 An 18 million increase in interest payments, primarily due to an increase in the average outstanding debt and an increase in interest rates. 
 
 Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
 Ameren s cash used in investing activities increased 450 million during the first nine months of 2024, compared with the year-ago period, primarily as a result of a 458 million increase in capital expenditures, largely resulting from the acquisition of the Cass County and Boomtown solar projects at Ameren Missouri, partially offset by decreased expenditures for electric transmission infrastructure upgrades at Ameren Illinois. Ameren s increase in capital expenditures was also partially offset by decreased expenditures for electric distribution infrastructure upgrades and natural gas infrastructure at Ameren Illinois due to steps taken by Ameren Illinois to align its 2024 operations with the ICC s MYRP orders and November 2023 natural gas rate order. 
 Ameren Missouri s cash used in investing activities increased 594 million during the first nine months of 2024, compared with the year-ago period, primarily as a result of a 584 million increase in capital expenditures, largely resulting from the acquisition of the Cass County and Boomtown solar projects. 
 Ameren Illinois cash used in investing activities decreased 139 million during the first nine months of 2024, compared with the year-ago period, primarily as a result of a 135 million decrease in capital expenditures, largely resulting from decreased expenditures for electric transmission infrastructure upgrades. Ameren Illinois capital expenditures also decreased as a result of reduced expenditures for electric distribution infrastructure upgrades and natural gas infrastructure due to steps taken by Ameren Illinois to align its 2024 operations with the ICC s MYRP orders and November 2023 natural gas rate order. 
 Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
 Cash provided by, or used in, financing activities is a result of our financing needs, which depend on the level of cash provided by operating activities, the level of cash used in investing activities, the level of dividends, and our long-term debt maturities, among other things.

The Credit Agreements, among other things, provide 2.6 billion of credit until maturity in December 2027. See Note 3 Short-term Debt and Liquidity under Part I, Item 1, of this report for additional information on the Credit Agreements. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, Ameren (parent), Ameren Missouri, and Ameren Illinois each issued commercial paper. Borrowings under the Credit Agreements and commercial paper issuances are based upon available interest rates at the time of the borrowing or issuance. 
 Ameren has a money pool agreement with and among its utility subsidiaries to coordinate and to provide for certain short-term cash and working capital requirements. As short-term capital needs arise, and based on availability of funding sources, Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois will access funds from the utility money pool, the Credit Agreements, or the commercial paper programs depending on which option has the lowest interest rates. 
 See Note 3 Short-term Debt and Liquidity under Part I, Item 1, of this report for additional information on credit agreements, commercial paper issuances, Ameren s money pool agreements and related borrowings, and relevant interest rates. 
 The issuance of short-term debt securities by Ameren s utility subsidiaries is subject to FERC approval under the Federal Power Act. In January 2023, the FERC issued orders authorizing Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois, and ATXI to issue up to 1 billion, 1 billion, and 300 million, respectively, of short-term debt securities through January 2025. 
 The Ameren Companies continually evaluate the adequacy and appropriateness of their liquidity arrangements for changing business conditions. When business conditions warrant, changes may be made to existing credit agreements or to other borrowing arrangements, or other arrangements may be made.

(d) In January 2023, Ameren Missouri and Audrain County mutually agreed to terminate a financing obligation agreement related to the CT energy center in Audrain County, which was scheduled to expire in December 2023. No cash was exchanged in connection with the termination of the agreement as the 240 million principal amount of the financing obligation due from Ameren Missouri was equal to the amount of bond service payments due to Ameren Missouri. 
 In October 2024, Ameren Missouri issued 450 million of 5.125 first mortgage bonds due March 2055, with interest payable semiannually on March 15 and September 15 of each year, beginning March 15, 2025. Net proceeds from this issuance were used for capital expenditures and to repay short-term debt. 
 See Note 4 Long-term Debt and Equity Financings under Part I, Item 1, of this report for additional information, including proceeds from issuances of long-term debt, the use of those proceeds, Ameren s forward equity sale agreements, the ATM program, and capital contributions received by Ameren Missouri from Ameren (parent). 
 Indebtedness Provisions and Other Covenants 
 At September 30, 2024, the Ameren Companies were in compliance with the provisions and covenants contained in their credit agreements, indentures, and articles of incorporation, as applicable, and ATXI was in compliance with the provisions and covenants contained in its note purchase agreements. See Note 3 Short-term Debt and Liquidity under Part I, Item 1, of this report and Note 4 Short-term Debt and Liquidity and Note 5 Long-term Debt and Equity Financings under Part II, Item 8, of the Form 10-K for a discussion of provisions, applicable cross-default provisions, and covenants contained in our credit agreements, in ATXI s note purchase agreements, and in certain of the Ameren Companies indentures and articles of incorporation. 
 We consider access to short-term and long-term capital and credit markets to be a significant source of funding for capital requirements not satisfied by cash provided by our operating activities. Inability to raise capital on reasonable terms, particularly during times of uncertainty in the capital and credit markets, could negatively affect our ability to maintain and expand our businesses. After assessing their respective current operating performance, liquidity, and credit ratings (see Credit Ratings below), Ameren, Ameren Missouri, and Ameren Illinois each believes that it will continue to have access to the capital and credit markets on reasonable terms. However, events beyond Ameren s, Ameren Missouri s, or Ameren Illinois control may create uncertainty in the capital and credit markets or make access to the capital and credit markets uncertain or limited. Such events could increase our cost of capital and adversely affect our ability to access the capital and credit markets. 
 
 Dividends 
 The amount and timing of dividends payable on Ameren s common stock are within the sole discretion of Ameren s board of directors. Ameren s board of directors has not set specific targets or payout parameters when declaring common stock dividends, but it considers various factors, including Ameren s overall payout ratio, payout ratios of our peers, projected cash flow and potential future cash flow requirements, historical earnings and cash flow, projected earnings, impacts of regulatory orders or legislation, and other key business considerations. Ameren expects its dividend payout ratio to be between 55 and 65 of annual earnings over the next few years. 
 See Note 4 Short-term Debt and Liquidity and Note 5 Long-term Debt and Equity Financings under Part II, Item 8, of the Form 10-K for additional discussion of covenants and provisions contained in certain of the Ameren Companies financial agreements and articles of incorporation that would restrict the Ameren Companies payment of dividends in certain circumstances. At September 30, 2024, none of these circumstances existed at Ameren, Ameren Missouri, or Ameren Illinois and, as a result, these companies were not restricted from paying dividends. 
 The following table presents common stock dividends declared and paid by Ameren Corporation to its common shareholders and by Ameren subsidiaries to their parent, Ameren Corporation, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023:

Credit Ratings 
 Our credit ratings affect our liquidity, our access to the capital and credit markets, our cost of borrowing under our credit facilities and our commercial paper programs, and our collateral posting requirements under commodity contracts. 
 The following table presents the principal credit ratings by Moody s and S P, as applicable, effective on the date of this report: 
 Moody s S P Ameren: Issuer/corporate credit rating Baa1 BBB+ Senior unsecured debt Baa1 BBB Commercial paper P-2 A-2 Ameren Missouri: Issuer/corporate credit rating Baa1 BBB+ Secured debt A2 A Senior unsecured debt Baa1 Not Rated Commercial paper P-2 A-2 Ameren Illinois: Issuer/corporate credit rating A3 BBB+ Secured debt A1 A Senior unsecured debt A3 BBB+ Commercial paper P-2 A-2 ATXI: Issuer credit rating A2 Not Rated Senior unsecured debt A2 Not Rated 
 A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities. It should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization. 
 
 Collateral Postings 
 Any weakening of our credit ratings may reduce access to capital and trigger additional collateral postings and prepayments. Such changes may also increase the cost of borrowing, resulting in an adverse effect on earnings. Cash collateral postings and prepayments made with external parties, including postings related to exchange-traded contracts were immaterial and cash collateral posted by external parties were 61 million for Ameren and Ameren Illinois at September 30, 2024. A sub-investment-grade issuer or senior unsecured debt rating (below Baa3 from Moody s or below BBB- from S P) at September 30, 2024, could have resulted in Ameren, Ameren Missouri, or Ameren Illinois being required to post additional collateral or other assurances for certain trade and contractual obligations amounting to 944 million, 870 million, and 74 million, respectively. 
 Changes in commodity prices could trigger additional collateral postings and prepayments. Based on credit ratings at September 30, 2024, if market prices were 15 higher or lower than September 30, 2024 levels in the next 12 months and 20 higher or lower thereafter through the end of the term of the commodity contracts, then Ameren, Ameren Missouri, and Ameren Illinois could be required to post an immaterial amount, compared to each company s liquidity, of collateral or provide other assurances for certain trade and contractual obligations. 
 
 OUTLOOK 
 Below are some key trends, events, and uncertainties that may reasonably affect our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity, as well as our ability to achieve strategic and financial objectives, for 2024 and beyond. For additional information regarding recent rate orders, lawsuits, and pending requests filed with state and federal regulatory commissions, including those discussed below, see Note 2 Rate and Regulatory Matters under Part I, Item 1, of this report and Note 2 Rate and Regulatory Matters under Part II, Item 8, of the Form 10-K. 
 Operations 
 The PISA permits Ameren Missouri to defer and recover 85 of the depreciation expense for investments in qualifying property, plant, and equipment placed in service and not included in base rates. Investments not eligible for recovery under the PISA include amounts related to new nuclear and natural gas generating units and service to new customer premises. Additionally, the PISA permits Ameren Missouri to earn a return at the applicable WACC on rate base that incorporates those qualifying investments, as well as changes in total accumulated depreciation excluding retirements and plant-related deferred income taxes since the previous regulatory rate review. The 
 72 

Table of Contents 

regulatory asset for accumulated PISA deferrals also earns a return at the applicable WACC until added to rate base prospectively. Ameren Missouri recognizes an offset to Interest Charges on its consolidated statement of income for its carrying cost of debt relating to each return allowed under the PISA, with the difference between the applicable WACC and its carrying cost of debt recognized in revenues when recovery of PISA deferrals is reflected in customer rates. Approved PISA deferrals are recovered over a period of 20 years following a regulatory rate review. Additionally, under the RESRAM, Ameren Missouri is permitted to recover the 15 of depreciation expense not recovered under the PISA, and earn a return at the applicable WACC for investments in renewable generation plant placed in service to comply with Missouri s renewable energy standard. Accumulated RESRAM deferrals earn carrying costs at short-term interest rates. The PISA and the RESRAM mitigate the effects of regulatory lag between regulatory rate reviews. Those investments not eligible for recovery under the PISA and the remaining 15 of certain property, plant, and equipment placed in service, unless eligible for recovery under the RESRAM, remain subject to regulatory lag. As a result of the PISA election, additional provisions of the law apply to Ameren Missouri, including limitations on electric customer rate increases. Pursuant to a Missouri law that became effective in August 2022, Ameren Missouri s PISA election was extended through December 2028 and an additional extension through December 2033 is allowed if requested by Ameren Missouri and approved by the MoPSC, among other things. This law also established a 2.5 annual limit on increases to the electric service revenue requirement used to set customer rates, compared to the revenue requirement established in the immediately preceding rate order, due to the inclusion of incremental PISA deferrals in the revenue requirement. The limitation will be effective for revenue requirements approved by the MoPSC after January 1, 2024. 
 In June 2024, Ameren Missouri filed a request with the MoPSC seeking approval to increase its annual revenues for electric service by 446 million. The MoPSC proceeding relating to the proposed electric service rate changes will take place over a period of up to 11 months, with a decision by the MoPSC expected by May 2025 and new rates effective by June 2025. Ameren Missouri cannot predict the level of any electric service rate change the MoPSC may approve, whether the requested regulatory recovery mechanisms will be continued, or whether any rate change that may eventually be approved will be sufficient for Ameren Missouri to recover its costs and earn a reasonable return on its investments when the rate change goes into effect. 
 In September 2024, Ameren Missouri filed a request with the MoPSC seeking approval to increase its annual revenues for natural gas delivery service by 40 million. The MoPSC proceeding relating to the proposed natural gas delivery service rate changes will take place over a period of up to 11 months, with a decision by the MoPSC expected by August 2025 and new rates effective by September 2025. Ameren Missouri cannot predict the level of any natural gas delivery service rate change the MoPSC may approve, whether the requested regulatory recovery mechanisms will be continued, or whether any rate change that may eventually be approved will be sufficient for Ameren Missouri to recover its costs and earn a reasonable return on its investments when the rate change goes into effect. 
 In 2018, the MoPSC issued an order approving Ameren Missouri s MEEIA 2019 plan. The plan includes a portfolio of customer energy-efficiency and demand response programs through December 2024. Ameren Missouri intends to invest 76 million in 2024. The plan includes the use of the MEEIA rider, which allows Ameren Missouri to collect from customers its actual MEEIA program costs and related lost electric revenues. In addition, the plan includes a performance incentive that provides Ameren Missouri an opportunity to earn revenues by achieving certain customer energy-efficiency goals. If the target program spending goal is achieved for 2024, the performance incentive would result in revenues of 12 million in 2024. 
 In January 2024, Ameren Missouri filed a proposed customer energy-efficiency plan with the MoPSC under the MEEIA. In October 2024, Ameren Missouri, the MoOPC, and other intervenors filed a nonunanimous stipulation and agreement with the MoPSC for a three-year plan, which includes a portfolio of customer energy-efficiency and demand response programs, along with the continued use of the MEEIA rider discussed above. If the agreement is approved, Ameren Missouri intends to invest 51 million annually in 2025 and 2026 and 22 million in 2027 in the proposed customer energy-efficiency and demand response programs. In addition, the agreement requested performance incentives applicable to each plan year to earn revenues by achieving certain spending and demand response goals. If 100 of the goals are achieved in 2025, 2026, and 2027, Ameren Missouri would earn performance incentive revenues of 5 million, 5 million, and 2 million, respectively. Ameren Missouri expects a decision by the MoPSC in the fourth quarter of 2024, but cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this regulatory proceeding. 
 Ameren Illinois and ATXI use a forward-looking rate calculation with an annual revenue requirement reconciliation for each company s electric transmission business. Based on expected rate base and the currently allowed 10.48 ROE, which includes a 50-basis-point incentive adder for participation in an RTO, the revenue requirements that will be included in 2025 rates for Ameren Illinois and ATXI s electric transmission businesses are 643 million and 232 million, respectively. These revenue requirements represent increases in Ameren Illinois and ATXI s revenue requirements of 94 million and 9 million, respectively, from the revenue requirements reflected in 2024 rates, primarily due to higher expected rate base. These rates will affect Ameren Illinois and ATXI s cash receipts during 2025, but will not determine their respective electric transmission service operating revenues, which will instead be based on 2025 actual recoverable costs, rate base, and a return on rate base at the applicable WACC as calculated under the FERC formula ratemaking framework. 
 73 

Table of Contents 

The allowed base ROE for FERC-regulated transmission rates previously charged under the MISO tariff has been the subject of pending proceedings since 2013. In October 2024, the FERC issued an order, which decreased the allowed base ROE from 10.02 to 9.98 and required refunds, with interest, for the periods from November 2013 to February 2015 and from late September 2016 forward. In March 2020, the FERC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on its transmission incentives policy, which proposed to increase the incentive ROE for participation in an RTO to 100 basis points from the current 50 basis points and revised the parameters for awarding incentives, while limiting the overall incentives to a cap of 250 basis points, among other things. In April 2021, the FERC issued a Supplemental Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, which proposed to modify the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking s incentive for participation in an RTO by limiting this incentive for utilities that join an RTO to 50 basis points and only allowing them to earn the incentive for three years, among other things. If this proposal is included in a final rule, Ameren Illinois and ATXI would no longer be eligible for the 50 basis point RTO incentive adder, prospectively. The FERC is under no deadline to issue a final rule on this matter. Ameren is unable to predict the ultimate impact of any changes to the FERC s incentives policy. A 50-basis-point change in the FERC-allowed ROE would affect Ameren s and Ameren Illinois annual net income by an estimated 16 million and 11 million, respectively, based on each company s 2024 projected rate base. 
 Pursuant to December 2022 and March 2021 ICC orders, Ameren Illinois used the IEIMA formula framework to establish annual electric distribution service rates effective through 2023, and reconciled the related revenue requirement for customer rates established for 2023. As such, Ameren Illinois 2023 revenues reflected actual recoverable costs, year-end rate base, and a return at the applicable WACC, with the ROE component based on the annual average of the monthly yields of the 30-year United States Treasury bonds plus 580 basis points. By law, the decoupling provisions extend beyond 2023, which ensures that Ameren Illinois electric distribution revenues authorized in a regulatory rate review are not affected by changes in sales volumes. In April 2024, Ameren Illinois filed for a reconciliation adjustment to its 2023 electric distribution service revenue requirement with the ICC. In July 2024, Ameren Illinois filed a revised reconciliation adjustment, requesting recovery of 158 million. An ICC decision in this proceeding is required by December 2024, and any approved adjustment would be collected from customers in 2025. This is the final revenue requirement reconciliation under the IEIMA formula framework. 
 Pursuant to the CEJA, which was enacted in September 2021, Ameren Illinois may file an MYRP with the ICC to establish base rates for electric distribution service to be charged to customers for each calendar year of a four-year period. The base rates for a particular calendar year are based on forecasted recoverable costs and an ICC-determined ROE applied to Ameren Illinois forecasted average annual rate base using a forecasted capital structure, with a common equity ratio of up to 50 being deemed prudent and reasonable by law and a higher equity ratio requiring specific ICC approval. The ROE determined by the ICC for each calendar year of the four-year period is subject to annual adjustments based on certain performance incentives and penalties. An MYRP allows Ameren Illinois to reconcile electric distribution service rates to its actual revenue requirement on an annual basis, subject to a reconciliation cap and adjustments to the ROE. Under the MYRP discussed below, Ameren Illinois 2024 electric distribution service revenues will be based on its 2024 actual recoverable costs, 2024 year-end rate base, and an ROE of 8.72 , as adjusted for any performance incentives or penalties, provided the actual revenue requirement does not exceed the reconciliation cap. If a given year s revenue amount collected from customers varies from the approved revenue requirement, an adjustment is made to electric operating revenues with an offset to a regulatory asset or liability to reflect that year s actual revenue requirement, independent of actual sales volumes. The regulatory balance is then collected from, or refunded to, customers within two years from the end of the applicable annual period. Ameren Illinois existing riders remain effective under the MYRP discussed below, and will continue to remain effective beyond 2027 whether it elects to file an MYRP or a traditional regulatory rate review. Additionally, electric distribution service revenues continue to be decoupled from sales volumes under either election.

In December 2023, the ICC issued an order in Ameren Illinois' MYRP proceeding approving base rates for electric distribution services for 2024 through 2027 and rejecting Ameren Illinois' Grid Plan, which was addressed as part of the MYRP proceeding. Rate changes consistent with the December 2023 order became effective in January 2024 and remained effective through late June 2024, when new rates became effective pursuant to the June 2024 ICC rehearing order discussed below. The December 2023 order adopted an alternative methodology to establish a rate base and revenue requirements for the years 2024 through 2027 using Ameren Illinois previously approved 2022 year-end rate base. In January 2024, the ICC partially denied a rehearing requested by Ameren Illinois to revise the allowed ROE in the December 2023 order and granted Ameren Illinois rehearing request to reconsider the rate base for each year of the MYRP and to include a base level of investments to maintain grid reliability in each year of the MYRP. In June 2024, the ICC issued an order on Ameren Illinois rehearing request, approving revenue requirements for electric distribution services for 2024, 2025, 2026, and 2027 of 1,196 million, 1,282 million, 1,350 million, and 1,397 million, respectively. New rates became effective in late June 2024. Using the 2023 revenue requirement as a starting point, the approved revenue requirements in the ICC s June 2024 rehearing order represent a cumulative four-year increase of 285 million. In July 2024, Ameren Illinois filed a request for rehearing of the ICC s June 2024 rehearing order to include an asset associated with other postretirement benefits in the rate base. Subsequently, in August 2024, the ICC denied the rehearing request. In January 2024, Ameren Illinois filed an appeal of the December 2023 ICC order and subsequently updated the appeal filing in September 2024 to include the June 2024 rehearing order regarding the inclusion of an asset associated with other postretirement benefits in the rate base to the Illinois Appellate Court for the Fifth Judicial District. The court is under no deadline to address the appeal. In September 2024, Ameren Illinois filed an update to its revised Grid Plan and a request to update the associated MYRP revenue requirements for 2024, 2025, 2026, and 2027 to 1,215 million, 1,299 million, 1,385 million, and 1,444 million, respectively. An ICC decision on the revised Grid Plan and updated revenue requirements is expected in December 2024 with rates effective in January 2025. Using the 2023 revenue requirement as a starting point, the requested revenue requirements in Ameren Illinois September 2024 revised MYRP filing represent a cumulative four-year increase of 332 million. Ameren Illinois cannot predict the ultimate outcome of the appeal to the Illinois Appellate Court for the Fifth Judicial District, its revised Grid Plan filing, or its request to update the associated MYRP revenue requirements for 2024 through 2027. Ameren Illinois has taken prudent steps to align its 2024 operations with the ICC orders, while continuing to ensure safe and adequate service is maintained. This includes reductions to Ameren Illinois capital expenditure and operations and maintenance expense plans. 
 Pursuant to Illinois law, Ameren Illinois electric energy-efficiency investments are deferred as a regulatory asset and earn a return at the applicable WACC, with the ROE component based on the annual average of the monthly yields of the 30-year United States Treasury bonds plus 580 basis points. The allowed ROE on electric energy-efficiency investments can be increased or decreased by up to 200 basis points, depending on the achievement of annual energy savings goals. While the ICC has approved a plan for Ameren Illinois to invest approximately 120 million per year in electric energy-efficiency programs through 2025, the ICC has the ability to reduce the amount of electric energy-efficiency savings goals in future program years if there are insufficient cost-effective programs available, which could reduce the investments in electric energy-efficiency programs. 
 In November 2023, the ICC issued an order in Ameren Illinois January 2023 natural gas delivery service regulatory rate review, which resulted in an increase to its annual revenues for natural gas delivery service of 112 million. The new rates became effective on November 28, 2023. In December 2023, Ameren Illinois filed a request for rehearing with the ICC to revise the approved ROE and capital structure common equity percentage, and reverse an approximately 93 million reduction of planned distribution and transmission capital investments included in the order, among other things. In January 2024, the ICC denied Ameren Illinois rehearing request. Subsequently, in January 2024, Ameren Illinois filed an appeal of the November 2023 ICC order to the Illinois Appellate Court for the Fifth Judicial District. The court is under no deadline to address the appeal. Ameren Illinois cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this appeal. Ameren Illinois has taken prudent steps to align its 2024 operations with the ICC order, while continuing to ensure safe and adequate service is maintained. This includes reductions to Ameren Illinois capital expenditure and operations and maintenance expense plans. 
 Ameren Illinois expects to file for a natural gas delivery service regulatory rate review in early 2025, with a future test year ended December 31, 2026. 
 Ameren Missouri s next refueling and maintenance outage at its Callaway energy center is scheduled for the spring of 2025. During a scheduled refueling, which occurs every 18 months, maintenance expenses are deferred as a regulatory asset and amortized until the completion of the next refueling and maintenance outage. During an outage, depending on the availability of its other generation sources and the market prices for power, Ameren Missouri s purchased power costs may increase and the amount of excess power available for sale may decrease versus non-outage years. Changes in purchased power costs and excess power available for sale are included in the FAC, which results in limited impacts to earnings. In addition, Ameren Missouri may incur increased non-nuclear energy center maintenance costs in non-outage years. 
 In September 2023, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri granted Ameren Missouri s request to modify a September 2019 remedy order issued by the district court in order to allow the retirement of the Rush Island Energy Center in advance of its previously expected retirement date of 2039, in lieu of installing a flue gas desulfurization system. Ameren Missouri retired the

Rush Island Energy Center on October 15, 2024. The United States Department of Justice is seeking an order from the district court providing for additional mitigation relief related to prior emissions. In November 2024, Ameren Missouri and the United States Department of Justice reached an agreement in principle, which, if approved by the district court, would resolve all outstanding claims in this case and would require Ameren Missouri to fund a program to provide electric buses and charging stations to schools in the metro St. Louis area and a program to provide air purifiers to eligible Ameren Missouri electric residential customers. These programs are estimated to cost approximately 64 million. As of September 30, 2024, Ameren and Ameren Missouri recorded liabilities of 64 million related to the cost of these programs. For additional information on the NSR and Clean Air Act litigation, see Note 9 Commitments and Contingencies under Part I, Item 1, of this report. 
 Pursuant to Illinois law, Ameren Missouri's natural gas-fired energy centers in Illinois are subject to annual limits on emissions, including CO 2 and NO x . Further reductions to emissions limits will become effective between 2030 and 2040, resulting in the closure of the Venice Energy Center by the end of 2029. The reductions could also limit the operations of Ameren Missouri's four other natural gas-fired energy centers located in the state of Illinois, and will result in their closure by 2040. These energy centers are utilized to support peak loads. Subject to conditions in the CEJA, these energy centers may be allowed to exceed the emissions limits in order to maintain reliability of electric utility service. 
 Although the pace of inflation has slowed recently, we are still observing elevated inflation levels that continue to put pressure on the prices of labor, services, materials, and supplies, as well as elevated interest rates. Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois are generally allowed to pass on to customers prudently incurred costs for fuel, purchased power, and natural gas supply. Additionally, for certain non-commodity cost changes, the use of trackers, riders, formula ratemaking, and future test years, as applicable, mitigates our exposure. The elevated inflation levels and elevated interest rates could impact our ability to control costs and/or make substantial investments in our businesses, including our ability to recover costs and investments, and to earn our allowed ROEs within frameworks established by our regulators, while maintaining rates that are affordable to our customers. In addition, the elevated inflation levels and elevated interest rates could adversely affect our customers usage of, or payment for, our services. 
 Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois continue to make infrastructure investments and expect to seek increases to electric and natural gas rates to recover the cost of investments and earn an adequate return. Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois will also seek new, or to maintain existing, regulatory and legislative solutions to address regulatory lag and to support investment in their utility infrastructure for the benefit of their customers. Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois continue to face cost recovery pressures, elevated inflation levels, higher cost of debt, customer conservation efforts, the impacts of additional customer energy-efficiency programs, and increased customer use of increasingly cost-effective advancements in innovative energy technologies, including private generation and energy storage. We expect a net increase in demand resulting from the electrification of the economy, including in the transportation sector. In addition, a new 250-MW data center is expected to be constructed in Ameren Missouri s service territory and is expected to be in service by 2026. Several other entities in various industries, including data center and manufacturing, are considering either locating or expanding their operations within our service territories. We expect that increased investments, including expected future investments for environmental compliance, system reliability improvements, and new generation sources, will result in rate base and revenue growth but also higher depreciation and financing costs. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 In September 2023, Ameren Missouri filed its 2023 IRP with the MoPSC, which includes Ameren Missouri s preferred plan for meeting customers projected long-term energy needs in a manner that maintains system reliability and customer affordability while transitioning to clean energy generation in an environmentally responsible manner. In connection with this plan, Ameren is continuing to target net-zero carbon emissions by 2045, as well as a 60 reduction by 2030 and an 85 reduction by 2040 based on 2005 levels. Ameren s goals include both reduction of direct emissions from operations (scope 1), as well as electricity usage at Ameren buildings (scope 2), including other greenhouse gas emissions of methane, nitrous oxide, and sulfur hexafluoride. Achieving these goals will be dependent on a variety of factors, including cost-effective advancements in innovative clean energy technologies and constructive federal and state energy and economic policies. The preferred plan includes, among other things, the following: 
 adding an 800-MW natural gas-fired simple-cycle energy center by 2027, which will be realized through the Castle Bluff Natural Gas Project discussed below, and an additional 1,200-MW natural gas-fired combined-cycle energy center by 2033; 
 adding 2,800 MWs of renewable generation by 2030, which includes the solar generation facilities discussed below, and an additional 1,900 MWs by 2036; 
 adding 400 MWs of battery storage by 2030 and an additional 400 MWs by 2035; 
 adding 1,200 MWs of other clean dispatchable generation resources by 2040 and an additional 1,200 MWs by 2043; 
 retiring all of Ameren Missouri s coal-fired energy centers by 2042; 
 accelerating the retirement date of the Rush Island coal-fired energy center, which was retired on October 15, 2024; 
 76 

Table of Contents 

extending the retirement date of the Sioux coal-fired energy center from 2030 to 2032 to ensure reliability during the transition to clean energy generation, which is subject to the approval of a change in depreciable lives of the energy center s assets by the MoPSC; 
 retiring 1,800 MWs of Ameren Missouri s natural gas-fired energy centers by 2040 to comply with Illinois law; 
 the continued implementation of customer energy-efficiency and demand response programs; and 
 the expectation that Ameren Missouri will seek and receive NRC approval for an extension of the operating license for the Callaway Energy Center beyond its current 2044 expiration date. 
 Expected capital expenditures through 2028 related to the facilities discussed above are included in Ameren s and Ameren Missouri s expected capital investments discussed below. Ameren Missouri s plan could be affected by, among other factors: Ameren Missouri s ability to obtain CCNs from the MoPSC, and any other required approvals for the addition of renewable resources or natural gas-fired generation, retirement of energy centers, and new or continued customer energy-efficiency programs; the ability to enter into agreements for renewable or natural gas-fired generation and acquire or construct that generation at a reasonable cost; the ability of suppliers, contractors, and developers to meet contractual commitments and timely complete projects, which is dependent upon the availability of necessary labor, materials, and equipment, geopolitical conflict, or government actions, among other things; changes in the scope and timing of projects; the ability to qualify for, and use or transfer, federal production or investment tax credits; the cost of wind, solar, and other renewable generation and battery storage technologies; the cost of natural gas or hydrogen CT technologies; the ability to maintain system reliability during and after the transition to clean energy generation; new and/or changes in environmental regulations, including those related to CO 2 and other greenhouse gas emissions; energy prices and demand; Ameren Missouri s ability to obtain necessary rights-of-way, easements, and transmission interconnection agreements at an acceptable cost and in a timely fashion; the ability to earn an adequate return on invested capital; and the ability to raise capital on reasonable terms. A new data center is expected to be constructed in Ameren Missouri s service territory by 2026 and several entities are considering either locating or expanding their operations within Ameren Missouri s service territory. As such, Ameren Missouri currently expects to update its 2023 IRP by February 2025, following its evaluation of potential load growth and its generation portfolio. The next integrated resource plan is required to be filed by October 2026. 
 In June 2024, the MoPSC issued a financing order authorizing the issuance of securitized utility tariff bonds by a wholly owned, special purpose subsidiary of Ameren Missouri to finance approximately 470 million of costs related to the planned accelerated retirement of the Rush Island Energy Center, which includes the expected remaining unrecovered net plant balance associated with the facility, among other costs. Ameren Missouri will collect the amounts necessary to repay the bonds over approximately 15 years from the date of bond issuance. The financing order also includes a determination that the decision to retire the Rush Island Energy Center was reasonable and prudent. The MoPSC did not make a determination regarding the prudency of Ameren Missouri's prior actions that resulted in the adverse ruling in the NSR and Clean Air Act litigation discussed in Note 9 Commitments and Contingencies under Part I, Item 1, of this report. However, claims regarding such actions could be considered in future regulatory proceedings. Base rate revenues relating to the recovery of the Rush Island Energy Center are being deferred as a regulatory liability since the October 15, 2024 retirement date of the facility. 
 Ameren Missouri, and certain subsidiaries of Ameren Missouri, are parties to agreements to acquire and/or construct various generation facilities. All regulatory approvals have been obtained. Ameren Missouri acquired the Cass County, Boomtown, and Huck Finn solar projects in June 2024, September 2024, and October 2024, respectively. These three acquisitions collectively represent a purchase price of approximately 0.9 billion. In October 2024, the MoPSC issued an order approving a nonunanimous stipulation and agreement filed by Ameren Missouri, the MoPSC staff, and other intervenors requesting a CCN for the Castle Bluff Natural Gas Project. The order also includes the use of a post-construction cost deferral related to the project which allows Ameren Missouri to defer and recover depreciation expense, financing costs, and applicable income taxes incurred from the date the project is placed in service to the date when project costs are reflected in updated base rates as a result of a regulatory rate review. The period of deferral would be limited to the earlier of the time the project costs are reflected in base rates or six months. All of the generation facilities are aligned with the 2023 IRP discussed above, and expected capital expenditures related to these facilities are included in Ameren s and Ameren Missouri s expected capital investments discussed below. 
 Through 2028, we expect to make significant capital expenditures to improve our electric and natural gas utility infrastructure, with a major portion directed to our transmission and distribution systems. We estimate that we will invest up to 22.8 billion (Ameren Missouri up to 13.5 billion; Ameren Illinois up to 7.6 billion; ATXI up to 1.7 billion) of capital expenditures during the period from 2024 through 2028. Ameren s and Ameren Missouri s estimates include 3.3 billion of renewable generation investments and 2.7 billion of dispatchable generation investments through 2028, consistent with Ameren Missouri s 2023 IRP. Ameren s and Ameren Illinois estimates include investments necessary to meet compliance requirements of the CEJA, while continuing to ensure safe and adequate service is maintained. Ameren Illinois estimates may be revised as a result of future ICC orders related to its current MYRP. 
 In 2021, the MISO issued a report outlining a preliminary long-range transmission planning roadmap of projects through 2039, which considers the rapidly changing generation mix within MISO resulting from significant additions of renewable generation, actual and 
 77 

Table of Contents 

expected generation plant closures, and state mandates or goals for clean energy or carbon emissions reductions. In July 2022, the MISO approved the first tranche of projects under the roadmap. A portion of these projects were assigned to various utilities, of which Ameren was awarded projects that are estimated to cost approximately 1.8 billion, based on the MISO s cost estimate. Related to these projects, Ameren began substation upgrades in May 2024 in advance of transmission line construction, which is expected to begin in 2026, with forecasted completion dates near the end of this decade. In addition, the MISO awarded two competitive bid projects to ATXI in the fourth quarter of 2023 and one in April 2024 that represent a total estimated investment of approximately 220 million for ATXI. In February 2024, Ameren Illinois and ATXI filed a request for a CCN, among other things, with the ICC related to the portion of the MISO long-range transmission projects they will construct within the ICC s jurisdiction. A decision by the ICC is expected by mid-2025. In July 2024, ATXI filed a request for a CCN, among other things, with the MoPSC related to a portion of the MISO long-range transmission projects that it expects to construct within the MoPSC s jurisdiction. A decision by the MoPSC is expected by mid-2025. In September 2024, the MISO revised a proposed first set of second tranche projects with estimated costs of 21.8 billion, which includes projects located in our service territories of 3.6 billion, based on the MISO s cost estimate. The MISO is expected to approve this set of projects by the end of 2024. The MISO expects to begin developing an additional set of second tranche projects in 2025. 
 Environmental regulations, including those related to CO 2 emissions, or other actions taken by the EPA or state regulators, or requirements that may result from the NSR and Clean Air Act Litigation, could result in significant increases in capital expenditures and operating costs. Regulations can be reviewed and repealed, and replacement or alternative regulations can be proposed or adopted by the regulatory agencies, including the EPA. See Note 9 Commitments and Contingencies under Part I, Item 1, of this report, for additional information on environmental matters, including the NSR and Clean Air Act litigation. The ultimate implementation of any of these new regulations, as well as the timing of any such implementation, is uncertain. However, the individual or combined effects of existing and new environmental regulations could result in significant capital expenditures, increased operating costs, or the closure or alteration of some of Ameren Missouri s coal and natural gas-fired energy centers. Ameren Missouri s operating costs and capital expenditures are subject to MoPSC prudence reviews, which could result in cost disallowances, as well as regulatory lag. The cost of Ameren Illinois purchased power and natural gas purchased for resale could increase. However, Ameren Illinois expects that these costs would be recovered from customers with no material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position, or liquidity. Ameren s and Ameren Missouri s earnings could benefit from increased investment to comply with environmental regulations if those investments are reflected and recovered on a timely basis in customer rates. 
 The Ameren Companies have multiyear credit agreements that cumulatively provide 2.6 billion of credit through December 2027, subject to a 364-day repayment term for Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois, with the option to seek incremental commitments to increase the cumulative credit provided to 3.2 billion. See Note 3 Short-term Debt and Liquidity under Part I, Item 1, of this report and Note 4 Short-term Debt and Liquidity under Part II, Item 8, of the Form 10-K for additional information regarding the Credit Agreements. See Note 5 Long-term Debt and Equity Financings under Part II, Item 8, of the Form 10-K for long-term debt maturities from 2024 to 2028 and beyond at Ameren (parent), Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois, and ATXI. See Note 4 Long-term Debt and Equity Financings under Part I, Item 1, of this report for outstanding forward sale agreements under the ATM and issuances and maturities of long-term debt in 2024 through the date of this report. The use of cash provided by operating activities and short-term borrowings to fund capital expenditures and other long-term investments at the Ameren Companies frequently results in a working capital deficit, defined as current liabilities exceeding current assets, as was the case at September 30, 2024, for Ameren, Ameren Missouri, and Ameren Illinois. Ameren, Ameren Missouri, and Ameren Illinois each believe that their liquidity is adequate given their respective expected operating cash flows, capital expenditures, and financing plans, and expect to continue to have access to the capital and credit markets on reasonable terms when needed. However, there can be no assurance that significant changes in economic conditions, disruptions in the capital and credit markets, or other unforeseen events will not materially affect their ability to execute their expected operating, capital, or financing plans. 
 Ameren expects its cash used for currently planned capital expenditures and dividends to exceed cash provided by operating activities over the next several years. As part of its funding plan for capital expenditures, Ameren is using newly-issued shares of common stock to satisfy requirements under the DRPlus and employee benefit plans and expects to continue to do so through at least 2028. Additionally, Ameren has an ATM program under which Ameren may offer and sell from time to time common stock, which includes the ability to enter into forward sales agreements, subject to market conditions and other factors. As of September 30, 2024, Ameren had multiple forward sale agreements that could be settled under the ATM program with various counterparties relating to 4.7 million shares of common stock. Ameren expects to settle approximately 230 million of the forward sale agreements with physical delivery of 2.9 million shares of common stock by December 31, 2024. Including issuances under the DRPlus and employee benefit plans, Ameren plans to issue approximately 300 million of equity in 2024 and approximately 600 million of equity each year from 2025 to 2028. As of September 30, 2024, Ameren had approximately 615 million of common stock available for sale under the ATM program, which takes into account the forward sale agreements in effect as of September 30, 2024. The Ameren Companies expect their equity to total capitalization to support solid investment-grade credit ratings. Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois expect to fund cash flow needs through debt issuances, cash provided by operating activities, and/or capital contributions from Ameren (parent).

The IRA was enacted in August 2022, and includes various income tax provisions, among other things. The law extends federal production and investment tax credits for projects beginning construction through 2024 and allows for a 10 adder to the production and investment tax credits for siting projects at existing energy communities as defined in the law, which includes sites previously used for coal-fired generation. The law also creates clean energy tax credits for projects placed in service after 2024. The clean energy tax credits will apply to renewable energy production and investments, along with certain nuclear energy production, and will be phased out beginning in 2033, at the earliest. The phase-out is triggered when greenhouse gas emissions from the electric generation industry are reduced by at least 75 from the annual 2022 emission rate or at the beginning of 2033, whichever is later. The law allows for transferability to an unrelated party for cash of up to 100 of certain tax credits generated after 2022. In addition, the new law imposes a 15 minimum tax on adjusted financial statement income, as defined in the law, for corporations whose average annual adjusted financial statement income exceeds 1 billion for three consecutive preceding tax years effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2022. Once a corporation exceeds this three-year average annual adjusted financial statement income threshold, it will be subject to the minimum tax for all future tax years. Additional regulations, interpretations, amendments, or technical corrections to or in connection with the IRA have been and are expected to be issued by the IRS or United States Department of Treasury, which may impact the timing of when the 15 minimum tax becomes applicable for Ameren as discussed below. 
 Pursuant to the IRA discussed above, Ameren expects to transfer production tax credits generated by Ameren Missouri s High Prairie Renewable and Atchison Renewable energy centers, as well as production or investment tax credits related to the solar facilities included in Ameren Missouri s 2023 IRP discussed above, to unrelated third parties from 2024 to 2028. 
 In April 2023, the IRS issued guidance providing a safe harbor method of accounting for the capitalization or deduction of certain expenditures to maintain, repair, replace, or improve natural gas distribution property. Ameren expects to adopt this guidance for the 2024 tax year, but is still evaluating its potential impact. 
 In June 2024, the IRS issued a series of private letter rulings to another taxpayer which provided guidance on applying IRS normalization rules to the calculation of tax benefits related to net operating loss carryforwards. The rulings concluded that for ratemaking purposes, net operating loss carryforwards should be reflected on a separate company basis and should not be reduced by payments received for the utilization of losses by other affiliates under a tax allocation agreement. While a private letter ruling issued to another taxpayer may not be relied on as precedent, Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois, and ATXI are evaluating this guidance and are addressing potential impacts of the private letter rulings with the MoPSC, ICC, and FERC. For Ameren Illinois and ATXI, these impacts could result in material reductions to their regulatory liabilities related to excess deferred taxes resulting from the TCJA. For Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois, these impacts could result in material increases to their accumulated deferred income tax assets for ratemaking purposes, which would result in overall increases to their rate bases. Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois, and ATXI will record the impacts, if any, upon further evaluation with their respective regulatory commissions. 
 As of September 30, 2024, Ameren had 113 million in tax benefits from federal and state income tax credit carryforwards, 41 million in tax benefits from state net operating loss carryforwards, and 24 million in tax overpayments, refunds, and receivables, which will be utilized in future periods. Future expected income tax payments are based on expected taxable income, available income tax credit and net operating loss carryforwards, and current tax law. Expected taxable income is affected by expected capital expenditures, when property, plant, and equipment is placed in-service or retired, and the timing of regulatory reviews, among other things. Based on preliminary calculations, Ameren does not expect to be subject to the 15 minimum tax on adjusted financial statement income imposed by the IRA through 2028. Ameren expects annual federal income tax payments to be immaterial through 2028. 
 The above items could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity. Additionally, in the ordinary course of business, we evaluate strategies to enhance our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity. These strategies may include acquisitions, divestitures, opportunities to reduce costs or increase revenues, and other strategic initiatives to increase Ameren s shareholder value. We are unable to predict which, if any, of these initiatives will be executed. The execution of these initiatives may have a material impact on our future results of operations, financial position, or liquidity.

 -18- 

Ameren Transmission Company of Illinois Note Purchase Agreement 

 Discounted Value means, with respect to the Called Principal of any Note, the amount obtained by discounting all Remaining Scheduled Payments with respect to such Called Principal from their respective scheduled due dates to the Settlement Date with respect to such Called Principal, in accordance with accepted financial practice and at a discount factor (applied on the same periodic basis as that on which interest on the Notes is payable) equal to the Reinvestment Yield with respect to such Called Principal. 
 Reinvestment Yield means, with respect to the Called Principal of any Note, the sum of (a) .50 plus (b) the yield to maturity implied by the Ask Yield(s) reported as of 10 00 a.m. (New York City time) on the second Business Day preceding the Settlement Date with respect to such Called Principal, on the display designated as Page PX1 (or such other display as may replace Page PX1) on Bloomberg Financial Markets for the most recently issued actively traded on-the-run U.S. Treasury securities Reported having a maturity equal to the Remaining Average Life of such Called Principal as of such Settlement Date. If there are no such U.S. Treasury securities Reported having a maturity equal to such Remaining Average Life, then such implied yield to maturity will be determined by (i) converting U.S. Treasury bill quotations to bond equivalent yields in accordance with accepted financial practice and (ii) interpolating linearly between the Ask Yields Reported for the applicable most recently issued actively traded on-the-run U.S. Treasury securities with the maturities (1) closest to and greater than such Remaining Average Life and (2) closest to and less than such Remaining Average Life. The Reinvestment Yield shall be rounded to the number of decimal places as appears in the interest rate of the applicable Note. 
 If such yields are not Reported or the yields Reported as of such time are not ascertainable (including by way of interpolation), then Reinvestment Yield means, with respect to the Called Principal of any Note, the sum of (x) .50 plus (y) the yield to maturity implied by the U.S. Treasury constant maturity yields reported, for the latest day for which such yields have been so reported as of the second Business Day preceding the Settlement Date with respect to such Called Principal, in Federal Reserve Statistical Release H.15 (or any comparable successor publication) for the U.S. Treasury constant maturity having a term equal to the Remaining Average Life of such Called Principal as of such Settlement Date. If there is no such U.S. Treasury constant maturity having a term equal to such Remaining Average Life, such implied yield to maturity will be determined by interpolating linearly between (1) the U.S. Treasury constant maturity so reported with the term closest to and greater than such Remaining Average Life and (2) the U.S. Treasury constant maturity so reported with the term closest to and less than such Remaining Average Life.
