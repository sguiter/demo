 FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 This Quarterly Report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act, including statements regarding our future results of operations and financial position, business strategy and plans and our objectives for future operations and future liquidity. The words "may," "will," "should," "could," "expect," "anticipate," "believe," "estimate," "intend," "continue" and other similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. We have based these forward-looking statements largely on current expectations and projections about future events and financial trends that we believe may affect our financial condition, results of operations, business strategy, short-term and long-term business operations and objectives, and financial needs. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in our forward-looking statements. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, our ability to execute and achieve the expected benefits of our go-forward strategy; execution of our business and marketing strategies; volatility in our operating results; challenges arising from our international operations, including fluctuations in currency exchange rates, tax, legal and regulatory developments in the jurisdictions in which we operate and geopolitical instability resulting from the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East; global economic uncertainty, including as a result of inflationary pressures; any impact from U.S. and international financial reform legislation and regulations, and any potential trade protection measures, such as new or incremental tariffs; retaining and adding high quality merchants and third-party business partners; retaining existing customers and adding new customers; competing successfully in our industry; providing a strong mobile experience for our customers; managing refund risks; retaining and attracting members of our executive and management teams and other qualified employees and personnel; customer and merchant fraud; payment-related risks; our reliance on email, Internet search engines and mobile application marketplaces to drive traffic to our marketplace; cybersecurity breaches; maintaining and improving our information technology infrastructure; reliance on cloud-based computing platforms; completing and realizing the anticipated benefits from acquisitions, dispositions, joint ventures and strategic investments; lack of control over minority investments; managing inventory and order fulfillment risks; claims related to product and service offerings; protecting our intellectual property; maintaining a strong brand; the impact of future and pending litigation; compliance with domestic and foreign laws and regulations, including the CARD Act, GDPR, CPRA, and other privacy-related laws and regulations of the Internet and e-commerce; classification of our independent contractors, agency workers, or employees; our ability to remediate our material weakness over internal control over financial reporting; risks relating to information or content published or made available on our websites or service offerings we make available; exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities; adoption of tax laws; our ability to use our tax attributes; impacts if we become subject to the Bank Secrecy Act or other anti-money laundering or money transmission laws or regulations; our ability to raise capital if necessary; risks related to our access to capital and outstanding indebtedness, including our 2026 Notes; our Common Stock, including volatility in our stock price; our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from the capped call transactions relating to our 2026 Notes; and those risks and other factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and Part II, Item 1A. Risk Factors on our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2024, June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2024, as well as in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, related notes, and the other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report and our other filings with the SEC. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks emerge from time to time. It is not possible for our management to predict all risks, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements we make. Neither the Company nor any other person assumes responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of the forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements for any reason after the date of this report to conform these statements to actual results or to future events or circumstances. Given these risks and uncertainties, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements.

 Other equity investments represent equity investments without readily determinable fair values recorded at cost adjusted for observable price changes and impairments. During the third quarter 2023, we recorded a remeasurement of our investment in SumUp, resulting in a decline of million based on a preliminary Share Purchase Agreement. This remeasurement represents non-cash investing activity. The loss was driven by a share price reduction on a Euro basis as well as a foreign currency depreciation of US dollars versus Euros.

 We classified the fair value of the 2026 Notes as a Level 3 measurement due to the lack of observable market data over fair value inputs such as our stock price volatility over the term of the 2026 Notes and our cost of debt.

 Capped Call Transactions 
 In connection with the 2026 Notes, we entered into privately-negotiated capped call transactions. The capped call transactions cover, subject to customary adjustments, the number of shares of Common Stock initially underlying the 2026 Notes. The capped call transactions are expected generally to reduce potential dilution to our Common Stock upon any conversion of the 2026 Notes and/or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted notes, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap initially equal to (which represents a premium of over the last reported sale price of our Common Stock on The Nasdaq Global Select Market on March 22, 2021), subject to certain adjustments under the terms of the capped call transactions. 
 Convertible Senior Notes due 2027 
 
 On November 12, 2024, the Company entered into privately-negotiated agreements (the Exchange and Subscription Agreements with a limited number of existing holders of the Company s currently outstanding 2026 Notes (such existing holders, the Offering Participants ). The Offering Participants are institutional accredited investors (within the meaning of Rule 501(a)(1), (2), (3) or (7) promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act )) and/or qualified institutional buyers (as defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act). 
 Pursuant to the Exchange and Subscription Agreements, the Company will (i) exchange million aggregate principal amount of 2026 Notes held by the Offering Participants for million aggregate principal amount of the Company s newly-issued Convertible Senior Secured Notes due 2027 (the 2027 Notes (the Exchange and (ii) issue and sell to certain Offering Participants million aggregate principal amount of 2027 Notes for gross cash proceeds of million (representing an issue price of (the Subscription Transactions and together with the Exchange, the Transactions ). The 2027 Notes are expected to be issued to 
 the Offering Participants in a private placement exempt from registration in reliance on Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. The Company is relying on this exemption from registration based in part on representations made by the Offering Participants in the Exchange and Subscription Agreements. 
 The initial conversion rate of the 2027 Notes will be 33.333 shares of Company common stock, par value per share Common Stock ), per 1,000 principal amount of 2027 Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately per share), subject to customary adjustments. The 2027 Notes will be convertible into Common Stock or a combination of cash and Common Stock, at the Company s election. The Company may be required to pay additional interest of per annum of the 2027 Notes in the event that it fails to pledge certain of its assets as part of the collateral for the 2027 Notes, unless such assets are sold. 
 The Transactions are expected to close on or around November 12, 2024, subject to customary closing conditions. 
 Revolving Credit Agreement 
 In February 2024, we prepaid million to terminate all commitments to access further credit under the Credit Agreement using a portion of the million in proceeds received from the Rights Offering. The Payoff Amount included million in principal, million in interest and million in fees. The terms of the Rights Offering permit the Company to use the proceeds for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of debt. We were not subject to any early termination penalties under the Credit Agreement. The payment of the Payoff Amount terminated our obligations under the Credit Agreement, except for ordinary and customary survival terms. In addition, we retained access to letters of credit, originally available under the Credit Agreement, pursuant to our pre-existing Cash Collateral Agreement. 
 Borrowings 

(1) Pursuant to the Cash Collateral Agreement, cash collateral is required for all letters of credit and treated as restricted cash on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

On October 31, 2024, we learned the highest-level court declined to hear our appeal and the related assessment became final and due during the fourth quarter. During the quarter ended June 30, 2024, we recorded a contingent liability of million in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and recognized expenses in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for million of taxes and penalties within Selling, general and administrative and million of interest expense within Other income (expense), net. We currently have a bank guarantee of million in place relating to the assessment that is classified as restricted cash in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2024. 
 In 2015, we lodged an appeal in the Portuguese courts relating to a Portugal VAT assessment for the periods from 2011 to 2012 of up to million, inclusive of penalties and interest through September 30, 2024. On October 31, 2024, we learned we received a negative ruling at the lowest level court. We expect to lodge an appeal to the second-level court and assert factual and legal challenges to the assessment. We recorded a contingent liability of million in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2024. We also recognized expenses in our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations for million of taxes and penalties within Selling, general and administrative and million of interest expense within Other income (expense), net. The Company recorded this liability after concluding that an adverse outcome is now probable, in light of the developments described above. We currently have a bank guarantee of million in place relating to the assessment that is classified as restricted cash in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2024. 
 A Groupon subsidiary in Italy, Groupon S.r.l., is presently litigating a tax dispute with the Italian tax authorities relating to a million assessment, inclusive of taxes, penalties and interest through September 30, 2024. A hearing on the second-level appeal was held on September 24, 2024. On October 1, 2024, the court issued an unfavorable ruling on the appeal in favor of the Italian tax authorities. We are awaiting the official filing of the ruling that will include the rationale for the court s decision. When the ruling of the second-level appellate court is ultimately issued, Groupon S.r.l. will have six months from that date to appeal to the Italian Supreme Court. If Groupon S.r.l. loses that appeal, Groupon S.r.l. plans to further challenge the Assessment and seek relief in an international Mutual Agreement Procedure that involves the tax authorities of Ireland and Italy. The Company continues to believe that the assessment, which primarily relates to transfer pricing on transactions occurring in 2011, is without merit. The subsidiary continues to vigorously defend itself in this matter and believes it will prevail on the merits of the case. Refer to Note 10, Income Taxes for additional information. 
 In June 2023, Groupon was granted final approval of a settlement that resolved shareholder derivative lawsuits in relation to a previously settled lawsuit that alleged that Groupon and certain of its officers made materially false and/or misleading statements or omissions regarding its business, operations and prospects, specifically as it relates to reiterating its full year guidance on November 4, 2019 and the Groupon Select program. Under the settlement, Groupon agreed to undertake certain corporate reforms. The Court awarded attorneys' fees in the amount of to Plaintiffs' counsel. That amount was covered under Groupon's insurance policies and was paid directly by Groupon's insurance carriers in July 2023. 
 In addition, third parties have from time to time claimed, and others may claim in the future, that we have infringed their intellectual property rights. We are subject to intellectual property disputes, including patent infringement claims, and expect that we will continue to be subject to intellectual property infringement claims as our services expand in scope and complexity. In the past and/or at present, we have litigated patent infringement and other intellectual property-related claims, including pending litigation or trademark disputes relating to, for example, our Goods category, some of which involved or could have involved potentially substantial claims for damages or injunctive relief. We may also become more vulnerable to third-party claims as laws such as the

 million in indemnification liabilities for certain tax and other matters upon the closing of the transactions as an adjustment to the net loss on the dispositions within discontinued operations at their fair value. We estimated the indemnification liabilities using a probability-weighted expected cash flow approach. Our remaining indemnification liabilities were million as of September 30, 2024. We estimate that the total amount of obligations that are reasonably possible to arise under the indemnifications in excess of amounts accrued as of September 30, 2024 were approximately million. 
 In the normal course of business to facilitate transactions related to our operations, we indemnify certain parties, including employees, lessors, service providers, merchants and counterparties to investment agreements and asset and stock purchase agreements with respect to various matters. We have agreed to hold certain parties harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants, or other claims made against those parties. These agreements may limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim. We are also subject to increased exposure to various claims as a result of our divestitures and acquisitions. We may also become more vulnerable to claims as we expand the range and scope of our services and are subject to laws in jurisdictions where the underlying laws with respect to potential liability are either unclear or less favorable. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers,

 As of September 30, 2024, there was million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to unvested stock options granted under the 2011 Plan. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of years. The total fair value of shares vested during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was million. 
 These stock options were granted to our Chief Executive Officer, who is based in the Czech Republic. Taxes on stock options in the Czech Republic are payable upon the sale of the underlying shares. The Company's tax liability is determined by multiplying the applicable tax rate by the difference between the value of the shares underlying the options on the date of exercise and the aggregate exercise price of the options. These taxes will be recognized in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations upon any subsequent sale of the shares acquired upon exercise of the options. 
 Performance Share Units 
 We have previously granted PSUs that vest in shares of our Common Stock upon the achievement of financial and operational targets specified in the respective award agreement. Based on our financial and operational results for the year ended December 31, 2023, shares became issuable upon vesting of PSUs following the Compensation Committee's certification in April 2024. In May 2024, we also granted the 2024 Executive PSUs. 
 The 2024 Executive PSUs may only be earned if certain stock price hurdles are met and the recipient satisfies certain service conditions. The achievement of the stock price hurdles is measured during a period that begins after the award date of May 1, 2024 and ends on May 1, 2027. The 2024 Executive PSUs have stock price hurdles: , , , and . The shares awarded under the 2024 Executive PSU award are divided equally between tranches corresponding to achievement of each stock price hurdle. Once the stock price hurdle is achieved, a service condition must also be met before the shares will vest. Specifically, the service condition for: (i) of the award will be met after the first anniversary of the award date; (ii) an additional of the award will be met after the second anniversary of the award date; and (ii) the final of the award will be met after the third anniversary of the award date. The 2024 Executive PSUs are subject to downward adjustments by the Compensation Committee. We determined these awards are subject to a

 year service condition period exceeds the derived service period and therefore we will recognize the expense over the year requisite service period. The key inputs used in the Monte Carlo simulation were the risk-free rate of , dividend yield of and our stock price volatility of . 
 In October 2024, the Compensation Committee approved a cash incentive award, which is required to be settled in cash upon vesting. The award, in the amount of PSUs, is subject to the same market and performance conditions as the 2024 Executive PSUs and is subject to continued employment through each vesting date. The cash settlement will be calculated by multiplying the closing stock price on each vesting date by the number of shares that would have otherwise vested if the award provided for equity settlement. Total compensation expense to be recognized for the award will be based on remeasurement of the award at each interim reporting period through the final vesting date. The Company's compensation plan limits cash awards to million per annum. 
 Both our PSUs and the 2024 Executive PSUs are subject to continued service through the period dictated by the award and certification by the Compensation Committee that the specified performance conditions have been achieved.

 Rights Offering 
 In November 2023, the Board approved an million fully backstopped Rights Offering to our stockholders of record of our Common Stock, as of the close of business on November 20, 2023. 
 
 The Rights Offering was made through the distribution of non-transferable subscription rights to purchase shares of Common Stock at a subscription price of per share and otherwise on such terms and subject to such conditions as may be required to comply with any applicable Nasdaq Global Market stock exchange rules and regulations. The Expiration Date for the subscription period for the Rights Offering ended on January 17, 2024. 
 
 The Rights Offering was fully backstopped by Pale Fire Capital SICAV a.s., the Backstop Party, an entity affiliated with (i) Dusan Senkypl, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and a member of the Board, and (ii) Jan Barta, a member of the Board. The Backstop Party had a binding commitment to (i) fully exercise its pro rata subscription right prior to the Expiration Date of the Rights Offering and (ii) fully purchase any and all unsubscribed shares in the Rights Offering following the Expiration Date at the same price and on the same terms and conditions as other participants in the Rights Offering. 
 
 On January 22, 2024, we announced the closing of our million fully backstopped Rights Offering for shares of our Common Stock, par value per share. 
 
 Pursuant to the terms of the Rights Offering, shares of Common Stock were purchased at per share, generating million in gross proceeds, less issuance costs incurred. As detailed below, the Rights Offering was oversubscribed, and the subscriptions, inclusive of the exercise of all over-subscription privileges, well exceeded million, the maximum aggregate offering size of the Rights Offering.

 Allowance for Expected Credit Losses on Accounts Receivable 
 Accounts receivable primarily represents the net cash due from credit card and other payment processors and from merchants and performance marketing networks for commissions earned on consumer purchases. The carrying amount of receivables is reduced by an allowance for expected credit losses that reflects management's best estimate of amounts that will not be collected. We establish an allowance for expected credit losses on accounts receivable based on identifying the following customer risk characteristics: size, type of customer and payment terms offered in the normal course of business. Receivables with similar risk characteristics are grouped into pools. For each pool, we consider the historical credit loss experience, current economic conditions, bankruptcy filings, published or estimated credit default rates, age of the receivable and any recoveries in assessing the lifetime expected credit losses.

 Income (loss) before provision (benefit) for income taxes ) ) 
 Our U.S. Federal income tax rate is 21 . The primary factor impacting the effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was the pretax losses incurred in jurisdictions that have valuation allowances against their net deferred tax assets. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we continue to maintain a full valuation allowance against all U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets. We expect that our consolidated effective tax rate in future periods will continue to differ significantly from the U.S. federal income tax rate as a result of our tax obligations in jurisdictions with profits and valuation allowances in jurisdictions with losses. 
 We are currently under audit by several foreign jurisdictions. It is likely that the examination phase of some of those audits will conclude in the next 12 months. There are many factors, including factors outside of our control, which influence the progress and completion of those audits. We are subject to claims for tax assessments by foreign jurisdictions, including a proposed assess ment for million , inclusive of estimated incremental interest from the original Assessment. The subsidiary subject to the Assessment is Groupon S.r.l., one of the Company's Italian subsidiaries with operations relating specifically to the local voucher business in Italy. In December 2023, Groupon S.r.l. received an unfavorable ruling at the lowest court level, but lodged a second-level appeal, based on what it believes to be meritorious defenses to the Assessment. The hearing was held on September 24, 2024. On October 1, 2024, the second-level court indicated that it intends to issue an unfavorable 
 ruling on the appeal and in favor of the Italian tax authorities. The court has not yet issued a full opinion with its rationale. When the decision of the second-level court is ultimately issued, Groupon S.r.l. will have six months from that date to appeal that decision to the Italian Supreme Court. The Company continues to believe that the Assessment is without merit and Groupon S.r.l. intends to pursue a prompt appeal to the Italian Supreme Court. If Groupon S.r.l. loses that appeal, Groupon S.r.l. plans to further challenge the Assessment and seek relief in an international Mutual Agreement Procedure that involves the tax authorities of Ireland and Italy. 
 Under Italian tax court procedures, taxpayers are required to deposit provisional payments while tax appeals are pending, which are held in trust by tax authorities and returned to the taxpayer if the taxpayer prevails on the appeal. At present, Groupon S.r.l. would be required to deposit provisional amounts equal to two-thirds of the assessed amount. However, Groupon S.r.l. has sought and obtained approval of installment plans whereby the provisional payments may be deposited in monthly installments over seventy-two months. To date, Groupon S.r.l. has made all monthly installment payments. However, contemporaneous with its appeal to the Supreme Court, Groupon S.r.l. intends to seek a full stay of the provisional payment obligations. 
 
 Additionally, unrelated to the tax matter above, in July 2024, Groupon S.r.l. received final assessments of approximately million related to a 2017 distribution made to its parent entity. On October 18, 2024, Groupon S.r.l. lodged an appeal to the first-tier court. We do not expect the hearing to occur in 2024. We believe this assessment is also without merit and Groupon S.r.l. intends to vigorously defend against such assessment. 
 
 No liability has been recorded for either Groupon S.r.l. tax assessment matter discussed above. In addition to any potential increases in our liabilities for uncertain tax positions from the ultimate resolution of these assessments, we believe it is reasonably possible that reductions of up to million in unrecognized tax benefits may occur within the 12 months following September 30, 2024 upon closing of income tax audits or the expiration of applicable statutes of limitations. 
 
 In general, it is our practice and intention to reinvest the earnings of our non-U.S. subsidiaries in those operations or remit such earnings in a tax-efficient manner. Additionally, an actual repatriation from our non-U.S. subsidiaries could be subject to foreign and U.S. state income taxes. Aside from limited exceptions for which the related deferred tax liabilities recognized as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 are immaterial, we do not intend to distribute earnings of foreign subsidiaries for which we have an excess of the financial reporting basis over the tax basis of our investments and therefore have not recorded any deferred taxes related to such amounts. The actual tax cost resulting from a distribution would depend on income tax laws and circumstances at the time of distribution. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to the excess of the financial reporting basis over the tax basis of our foreign subsidiaries is not practical due to the complexities associated with the calculation.

 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included under Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. This discussion contains forward-looking statements about our business and operations. Our actual results may differ materially from those we currently anticipate as a result of many factors, including those we describe under Part II, Item 1A, Risk Factors , and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. See Part I , Forward-Looking Statements, for additional information. 
 
 Overview 
 Groupon is a global scaled two-sided marketplace that connects consumers to merchants. Consumers access our marketplace through our mobile applications and our websites. We operate in two segments, North America and International, and operate in three categories, Local, Goods and Travel. See Item 1, Note 13, Segment Information, for additional information. 
 Our strategy is to be the trusted marketplace where customers go to buy local services and experiences. We plan to grow our revenue by building long-term relationships with local merchants to strengthen our inventory selection and by enhancing the customer experience through inventory curation and improved convenience in order to drive customer demand and purchase frequency. 
 We generate service revenue from Local, Goods and Travel categories. Revenue primarily represents the net commissions earned from selling goods or services on behalf of third-party merchants. Revenue is reported on a net basis as the purchase price collected from the customer less the portion of the purchase price that is payable to the third-party merchant. We also earn commissions when customers make purchases with retailers using digital coupons accessed through our websites and mobile applications. 
 We are investing significant resources in making our platform more efficient, stable and agile. By improving our technology, our customer base can enjoy a state of the art experience along with seamless execution of new product innovation, improved customer experience and customer satisfaction. 
 2022 Cost Savings Plan 
 In August 2022, we initiated the 2022 Cost Savings Plan, including the first phase in August 2022, the second January 2023 and the third July 2023, which is designed to reduce our expense structure and align with our go-forward business and financial objectives. The 2022 Cost Savings Plan included the 2022 Restructuring Plan, as well as other planned savings to be achieved through other actions, such as future reductions in our facilities footprint at natural lease terminations (or by exercising existing options in leases), renegotiating contractual arrangements with certain service providers and continuing to make elective decisions to eliminate vacant positions rather than rehire. The 2022 Restructuring Plan is expected to include an overall reduction of approximately 1,150 positions globally, with the majority of these reductions completed as of March 31, 2023 and the remainder expected to occur by the end of 2024. We have incurred total pretax charges of 21.3 million since the inception of the 2022 Restructuring Plan. A majority of the pre-tax charges have been paid in cash and relate to employee severance and compensation benefits, with an immaterial amount of charges related to other exit costs. See Item 1, Note 9, Restructuring and Related Charges , for additional information.

How We Measure Our Business 
 We use several operating and financial metrics to assess the progress of our business and make decisions on where to allocate capital, time and technology investments. Certain of the financial metrics are reported in accordance with GAAP and certain of those metrics are considered non-GAAP financial measures. As our business evolves, we may make changes to the key financial and operating metrics that we use to measure our business. For further information and reconciliations to the most applicable financial measures under GAAP, refer to our discussion under Non-GAAP Financial Measures in the Results of Operations section. 
 Operating Metrics 
 Gross billings is the total dollar value of customer purchases of goods and services. Gross billings is presented net of customer refunds, order discounts and sales and related taxes. The substantial majority of our revenue transactions are comprised of sales of vouchers and similar transactions in which we collect the transaction price from the customer and remit a portion of the transaction price to the third-party merchant who will provide the related goods or services. For these transactions, gross billings differs from Revenue reported in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations, which is presented net of the merchant's share of the transaction price. Gross billings is an indicator of our growth and business performance as it measures the dollar volume of transactions generated through our marketplaces. Tracking gross billings also allows us to monitor the percentage of gross billings that we are able to retain after payments to merchants. However, we are focused on achieving long-term gross profit and Adjusted EBITDA growth. 
 Units are the number of purchases during the reporting period, before refunds and cancellations, made either through one of our online marketplaces, a third-party marketplace, or directly with a merchant for which we earn a commission. We do not include purchases with retailers using digital coupons accessed through our websites or mobile applications in our units metric. We consider units to be an important indicator of the total volume of business conducted through our marketplaces. We report units on a gross basis prior to the consideration of customer refunds and therefore units are not always a good proxy for gross billings. 
 Active customers are unique user accounts that have made a purchase during the TTM either through one of our online marketplaces or directly with a merchant for which we earned a commission. We consider this metric to be an important indicator of our business performance as it helps us to understand how the number of customers actively purchasing our offerings is trending. Some customers could establish and make purchases from more than one account, so it is possible that our active customer metric may count certain customers more than once in a given period. We do not include consumers who solely make purchases with retailers using digital coupons accessed through our websites or mobile applications in our active customer metric, nor do we include consumers who solely make purchases of our inventory through third-party marketplaces with which we partner. 
 Our gross billings and units for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows (in thousands): 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Gross billings 373,392 418,847 1,128,145 1,208,730 Units 8,684 10,116 26,370 30,210

Financial Metrics 
 Revenue is earned through transactions on which we generate commissions by selling goods or services on behalf of third-party merchants. Revenue from those transactions is reported on a net basis as the purchase price collected from the customer for the offering less an agreed upon portion of the purchase price paid to the third-party merchant. Revenue also includes commissions we earn when customers make purchases with retailers using digital coupons accessed through our digital properties. 
 Gross profit reflects the net margin we earn after deducting our Cost of revenue from our Revenue. 
 Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that we define as Net income (loss) from operations excluding income taxes, interest and other non-operating items, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation and other special charges and credits, including items that are unusual in nature or infrequently occurring. For further information and a reconciliation to Net income (loss), refer to our discussion under Non-GAAP Financial Measures in the Results of Operations section. 
 Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that comprises Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and capitalized software. For further information and a reconciliation to Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, refer to our discussion in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section below. 
 The following table presents the above financial metrics for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands):

 Operating Expenses 
 Marketing expense consists primarily of online marketing costs, such as search engine marketing and advertising on social networking sites and affiliate programs. Additionally, compensation expense for marketing employees is classified within marketing expense. We record these costs within Marketing on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations when incurred. From time to time, we have offerings from well-known national merchants for customer acquisition and activation purposes, for which the amount we owe the merchant for each voucher sold exceeds the transaction price paid by the customer. Our gross billings from those transactions generate no revenue and our net cost (i.e., the excess of the amount owed to the merchant over the amount paid by the customer) is classified as marketing expense. We evaluate marketing expense as a percentage of gross profit because it gives us an indication of how well our marketing spend is driving gross profit performance. 
 SG A expenses include selling expenses such as sales commissions and other compensation expenses for sales representatives, as well as costs associated with supporting the sales function such as technology, telecommunications and travel. General and administrative expenses include compensation expense for employees involved in customer service, operations, technology and product development, as well as general corporate functions, such as finance, legal and human resources. Additional costs in general and administrative include depreciation and amortization, rent, professional fees, litigation costs, travel and entertainment, recruiting, maintenance, certain technology costs and other general corporate costs. We evaluate SG A expense as a percentage of gross profit because it gives us an indication of our operating efficiency. 
 Restructuring and related charges represent severance and benefit costs for workforce reductions, impairments and other facilities-related costs and professional advisory fees. See Item 1, Note 9, Restructuring and Related Charges , for additional information about our restructuring plans.

Factors Affecting Our Performance 
 Attracting and retaining local merchants. As we focus on our local experiences marketplace, we depend on our ability to attract and retain merchants who are willing to offer their experiences on our platform. Merchants can withdraw their offerings from our marketplace at any time, and their willingness to continue offering services through our marketplace depends on the effectiveness of our marketplace offering. We are focused on improving our marketplace offering and merchant value proposition by exploring opportunities to better balance the needs of merchant partners, customers and Groupon, for example, by offering flexible deal structures. 
 Acquiring and retaining customers . To acquire and retain customers to drive higher volumes on our platform from new and existing customers, we are focused on strengthening our product offering, improving the attractiveness of our offerings, and rebuilding our performance marketing campaigns. 
 Impact of macroeconomic conditions . We have been, and may continue to be, impacted by adverse consequences of the macroeconomic environment, including but not limited to, inflationary pressures, higher labor costs, labor shortages, supply chain challenges and resulting changes in consumer and merchant behavior. We will continue to monitor the impact of macroeconomic conditions on our business.

 North America gross billings, units and TTM active customers decreased by 23.9 million, 0.4 million and 0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the prior year period. The decline in our Goods and Travel categories is primarily due to an overall decline in demand. Additionally, during the three months ended September 30, 2023, we had a favorable impact in our Local category from phasing out our COVID-19 refund practices, with no comparable activity during the three months ended September 30, 2024, which contributed to the decrease in our Local category during the current period compared with the prior year period. 
 Comparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 North America gross billings and units decreased by 14.0 million and 0.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with the prior year period. These declines are primarily due to a decline in demand for our Goods category, which resulted in fewer unit sales. The decrease in gross billings is partially offset by favorable refund rates for our Local category.

 The change in Other income (expense), net for the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 is primarily related to a 34.9 million change in net foreign currency gains (losses). The remainder of the fluctuation is due to a remeasurement of our investment in SumUp in the amount of 25.8 million during the three months ended September 30, 2023 with no comparable activity during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Comparison of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 The change in Other income (expense), net for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023 is primarily related to a 18.7 million change in foreign currency gains and losses.The remainder of the fluctuation is due to a remeasurement of our investment in SumUp in the amount of 25.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 with no comparable activity during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

Consolidated Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes 
 Provision (benefit) for income taxes for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows (in thousands): 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change Provision (benefit) for income taxes 2,321 817 184.1 17,802 4,258 NM Effective tax rate 13.8 (2.0) 156.1 (5.5) 
 Comparison of the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 and 2023: 
 The effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were impacted by pretax losses incurred in jurisdictions that have valuation allowances against their net deferred tax assets. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we continue to maintain a full valuation allowance against all U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets. We expect that our consolidated effective tax rate in future periods will continue to differ significantly from the U.S. federal income tax rate as a result of our tax obligations in jurisdictions with profits and valuation allowances in jurisdictions with losses. See Item 1, Note 10, Income Taxes , for additional information relating to tax audits and assessments and regulatory and legal developments that may impact our business and results of operations in the future.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 In addition to financial results reported in accordance with GAAP, we have provided the following non-GAAP financial measures: Adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow and foreign currency exchange rate neutral operating results. Those non-GAAP financial measures are intended to aid investors in better understanding our current financial performance and prospects for the future as seen through the eyes of management. We believe that those non-GAAP financial measures facilitate comparisons with our historical results and with the results of peer companies who present similar measures (although other companies may define non-GAAP measures differently than we define them, even when similar terms are used to identify such measures). However, those non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to be a substitute for those reported in accordance with GAAP. 
 Adjusted EBITDA . Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP performance measure that we define as Net income (loss) excluding income taxes, interest and other non-operating items, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation and other special charges and credits, including items that are unusual in nature or infrequently occurring. Adjusted EBITDA is a key measure used by our management and Board to evaluate operating performance, generate future operating plans and make strategic decisions for the allocation of capital. Accordingly, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and Board. However, Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a substitute for Net income (loss). 
 We exclude stock-based compensation expense and depreciation and amortization because they are primarily non-cash in nature and we believe that non-GAAP financial measures excluding those items provide meaningful supplemental information about our operating performance and liquidity. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, special charges and credits included charges related to our 2022 and 2020 Restructuring Plans, Gain on sale of assets and Foreign VAT assessments. We exclude special charges and credits from Adjusted EBITDA because we believe that excluding those items provides meaningful supplemental information about our core operating performance and facilitates comparisons with our historical results. For the Foreign VAT assessments, we also considered the fact we ceased operations in Portugal in 2016 and it is not part of our ongoing business. Since we ceased operations, we have not engaged in any revenue-generating or payroll-related activity and do not intend to engage in these activities in Portugal in the future. 
 The following is a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the most comparable GAAP financial measure, Net income (loss), for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (in thousands): 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Net income (loss) 14,522 (40,806) (6,396) (81,423) Adjustments: Stock-based compensation 8,890 3,889 17,682 13,771 Depreciation and amortization 6,895 12,568 24,512 40,316 Restructuring and related charges

 (1) The Foreign VAT assessments adjustment excludes related interest expense of 0.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 1.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as the interest expense is included within Other (income) expense, net. See Item 1, Note 6, Commitments and Contingencies, for additional information. 
 
 (2) Includes a 25.8 million remeasurement of our investment in SumUp during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. See Item 1, Note 3, Investments, for additional information. 
 
 43 

Free cash flow . Free cash flow is a non-GAAP liquidity measure that comprises Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and capitalized software. We use free cash flow to conduct and evaluate our business because, although it is similar to cash flow, we believe that it typically represents a more useful measure of cash flows because purchases of fixed assets, software developed for internal use and website development costs are necessary components of our ongoing operations. Free cash flow is not intended to represent the total increase or decrease in our cash balance for the applicable period. 
 Free cash flow has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. In addition, free cash flow reflects the impact of the timing difference between when we are paid by customers and when we pay merchants and suppliers. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. For a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most comparable GAAP financial measure, see Liquidity and Capital Resources below. 
 Foreign currency exchange rate neutral operating results . Foreign currency exchange rate neutral operating results show current period operating results as if foreign currency exchange rates had remained the same as those in effect in the prior year period. Those measures are intended to facilitate comparisons to our historical performance. 
 The following tables represent the effect on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations from changes in exchange rates versus the U.S. dollar for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 (in thousands):

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our principal source of liquidity is our cash balance totaling 159.7 million as of September 30, 2024. The Company s cash requirements are subject to change as business conditions warrant and opportunities arise. Additionally, with the Rights Offering and debt prepayment and termination of our Credit Agreement in February 2024, we believe that the Company has sufficient liquidity to support its overall ongoing operational needs within the next 12 months. 
 We are subject to claims for tax assessments by foreign jurisdictions, including a proposed assessment for 125.4 million 112.1 million), inclusive of estimated incremental interest from the original Assessment. The subsidiary subject to the Assessment is Groupon S.r.l., one of the Company's Italian subsidiaries with operations relating specifically to the local voucher business in Italy. In December 2023, Groupon S.r.l. received an unfavorable ruling at the lowest court level, but lodged a second-level appeal, based on what it believes to be meritorious defenses to the Assessment. The hearing was held on September 24, 2024. On October 1, 2024, the second-level court indicated that it intends to issue an unfavorable ruling on the appeal and in favor of the Italian tax authorities. The court has not yet issued a full opinion with its rationale. When the decision of the second-level court is ultimately issued, Groupon S.r.l. will have six months from that date to appeal that decision to the Italian Supreme Court. The Company continues to believe that the Assessment is without merit and Groupon S.r.l. intends to pursue a prompt appeal to the Italian Supreme Court. If Groupon S.r.l. loses that appeal, Groupon S.r.l. plans to further challenge the Assessment and seek relief in an international Mutual Agreement Procedure that involves the tax authorities of Ireland and Italy. 
 Under Italian tax court procedures, taxpayers are required to deposit provisional payments while tax appeals are pending, which are held in trust by tax authorities and returned to the taxpayer if the taxpayer prevails on the appeal. At present, Groupon S.r.l. would be required to deposit provisional amounts equal to two-thirds of the assessed amount. However, Groupon S.r.l. has sought and obtained approval of installment plans (the second of which was issued on November 7, 2024) whereby the provisional payments may be deposited pro rata in monthly installments over seventy-two months. To date, Groupon S.r.l. has made all monthly installment payments. However, contemporaneous with its appeal to the Supreme Court, Groupon S.r.l. intends to seek a full stay of the provisional payment obligations. Groupon S.r.l. expects a hearing on the possible stay of provisional payments to take place in early 2025. If Groupon S.r.l. does not succeed in staying the provisional payment obligation, Groupon S.r.l. will consider its options, including making monthly installment payments up to the amount of its assets, or undertaking further restructuring actions. The total payments due in 2024 and 2025 under the terms of the installment plans are 3.4 million 3.8 million) and 13.2 million 14.7 million), respectively. Such amounts are recorded as Other non-current assets within the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets when cash is remitted. 
 The Company does not expect the tax assessment to result in financial exposure that exceeds the assets of Groupon S.r.l. as of December 31, 2023, nor do we expect any related developments to impact the ability of the Company to meet its obligations outside of Groupon S.r.l. See Item 1, Note 10, Income Taxes for additional information. 
 Our net cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were as follows (in thousands): 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Cash provided by (used in): Operating activities (16,258) (13,855) (11,069) (132,485) Investing activities (3,442) (5,469) (3,070) (16,965) Financing activities (691) 1,183 32,929 (30,953) 
 45 

Our free cash flow for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and a reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP financial measure, Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, for those periods were as follows (in thousands): 
 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities (16,258) (13,855) (11,069) (132,485) Purchases of property and equipment and capitalized software (3,408) (4,120) (11,591) (15,917) Free cash flow (19,666) (17,975) (22,660) (148,402) 
 Our revenue-generating transactions are primarily structured such that we collect cash up-front from customers and pay third-party merchants at a later date, either based upon the customer's redemption of the related voucher or fixed payment terms, which are generally biweekly, throughout the term of the merchant's offering. 
 Our cash balances fluctuate significantly throughout the year based on many variables, including changes in gross billings, the timing of payments to merchants and suppliers and the mix of transactions between Goods, Travel and Local. 
 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our net cash used in operating activities was 11.1 million as compared with net cash used in operating activities of 132.5 million in the prior period. The improved cash flow from operating activities is primarily due to our cost cutting measures as a result of the impacts of our 2022 Restructuring Plan. 
 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our net cash used in investing activities was 3.1 million as compared with net cash used in investing activities of 17.0 million in the prior period. The improved cash flow from investing activities is primarily due to 9.1 million of net proceeds from the sale intangible assets and fewer purchases of property and equipment and capitalized software during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 
 Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, our net cash provided by financing activities was 32.9 million as compared with net cash used in financing activities of 31.0 million in the prior period. The improved cash flow from financing activities is primarily due to 79.6 million of proceeds received from the Rights Offering, partially offset by an increase of 14.5 million in payments of borrowings under our revolving credit facility. 
 In January 2024, we announced the closing of our 80.0 million fully backstopped Rights Offering for shares of our Common Stock. Pursuant to the terms of the Rights Offering, 7,079,646 shares of Common Stock were purchased at 11.30 per share, generating 80.0 million in gross proceeds to the Company. See Item 1, Note 7, Stockholders' Equity (Deficit) and Compensation Arrangements , for additional information. 
 In February 2024, we prepaid 43.1 million to terminate all commitments to access further credit under the Credit Agreement using a portion of the 80.0 million in proceeds received from the Rights Offering. The terms of the Rights Offering permit the Company to use the proceeds for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of debt. We were not subject to any early termination penalties under the Credit Agreement. The payment of the Payoff Amount terminated our obligations under the Credit Agreement, except for ordinary and customary survival terms. In addition, we retained access to letters of credit, originally available under the Credit Agreement. See Item 1, Note 5, Financing Arrangements , for additional information. 
 In 2021, the Company issued the 2026 Notes in the principal amount of 230.0 million, which mature on March 15, 2026. The Company is continuously considering capital markets in order to enhance our capital structure. 
 46 

On November 12, 2024, The Company entered into the Exchange and Subscriptions Agreements with a limited number of Offering Participants. The Offering Participants are institutional accredited investors (within the meaning of Rule 501(a)(1), (2), (3) or (7) promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act )) and/or qualified institutional buyers (as defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act). 
 Pursuant to the Exchange and Subscription Agreements, the Company will (i) exchange 176.3 million aggregate principal amount of 2026 Notes held by the Offering Participants for 176.3 million aggregate principal amount of the Company s newly-issued 6.25 Convertible Senior Secured Notes due 2027 (the 2027 Notes (the Exchange and (ii) issue and sell to certain Offering Participants 21.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2027 Notes for gross cash proceeds of 20.0 million (representing an issue price of 95 (the Subscription Transactions and together with the Exchange, the Transactions ). The 2027 Notes are expected to be issued to the Offering Participants in a private placement exempt from registration in reliance on Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. The Company is relying on this exemption from registration based in part on representations made by the Offering Participants in the Exchange and Subscription Agreements. 
 The initial conversion rate of the 2027 Notes will be 33.333 shares of Company Common Stock, per 1,000 principal amount of 2027 Notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately 30 per share), subject to customary adjustments. The 2027 Notes will be convertible into Common Stock or a combination of cash and Common Stock, at the Company s election. The Company may be required to pay additional interest of 2.5 per annum of the 2027 Notes in the event that it fails to pledge certain of its assets as part of the collateral for the 2027 Notes, unless such assets are sold. 
 The Transactions are expected to close on or around November 12, 2024, subject to customary closing conditions. 
 As of September 30, 2024 , we had 59.9 million in cash held by our international subsidiaries, which is primarily denominated in Euros, British Pounds Sterling, Canadian dollars, Indian Rupees, Polish Zloty, Swiss Franc, and, to a lesser extent, Australian dollars. In general, it is our practice and intention to re-invest the earnings of our non-U.S. subsidiaries in those operations or remit such earnings in a tax-efficient manner. We have not, nor do we anticipate the need to, repatriate funds to the United States to satisfy domestic liquidity needs arising in the ordinary course of business. 
 
 47 

Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
 Our contractual obligations and commitments as of September 30, 2024, did not materially change from the amounts set forth in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, except as disclosed in Item 1, Note 6 , Commitments and Contingencies . 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 We did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2024. 
 
 Significant Accounting Policies and Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The preparation of Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and classifications of assets and liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. 
 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based upon our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Part II, Item 8, Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. In addition, refer to the critical accounting estimates under Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 48 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 We have operations both within the United States and internationally, and we are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business, including the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, interest rate changes and inflation. Information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about these market risks is set forth below. 
 Foreign Currency Exchange Risk 
 We transact business in various foreign currencies other than the U.S. dollar, principally the Euro, British Pound Sterling, Canadian dollar, Indian Rupee, Polish Zloty, Swiss Franc, and, to a lessor extent, Australian dollar, which exposes us to foreign currency risk. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, we derived approxim ately 24.1 and 22.9 of our revenue from our International segment. Revenue and related expenses generated from our international operations are generally denominated in the local currencies of the corresponding countries. The functional currencies of our subsidiaries that either operate or support these markets are generally the same as the corresponding local currencies. However, the results of operations of, and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our international operations are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Upon consolidation, as exchange rates vary, our revenue and other operating results may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains or losses on the re-measurement of intercompany balances. 
 We assess our foreign currency exchange risk based on hypothetical changes in rates utilizing a sensitivity analysis that measures the potential impact on working capital based on a 10 change (increase and decrease) in currency rates. We use a current market pricing model to assess the changes in the value of the U.S. dollar on foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities. The primary assumption used in this model is a hypothetical 10 weakening or strengthening of the U.S. dollar against those currency exposures as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 As of September 30, 2024, our net working capital deficit defined as current assets less current liabilities) from subsidiaries that are subject to foreign currency translation risk was 7.3 million. The potential increase in this working capital deficit from a hypothetical 10 adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be 0.7 million. This compares with a 21.7 million working capital deficit subject to foreign currency exposure as of December 31, 2023, for which a 10 adverse change would have resulted in a potential increase in this working capital deficit of 2.2 million. 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 Our cash balance as of September 30, 2024, consists of bank deposits so exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates is limited. The 2026 Notes have an aggregate principal amount of 230.0 million and bear interest at a fixed rate, so we have no financial statement impact from changes in interest rates. However, changes in market interest rates impact the fair value of the 2026 Notes along with other variables such as our credit spreads and the market price and volatility of our Common Stock. See Item 1, Note 5, Financing Arrangements , for additional information. We have 5.1 million of lease obligations as of September 30, 2024. Interest rates on existing leases typically do not change unless there is a modification to a lease agreement and as such, we do not believe that the interest rate risk on the lease obligations is significant. 
 Inflation Risk 
 Our business is affected by changes to our merchants' and customers' discretionary spend. We expect such discretionary spend limitations to continue, and if we do not see increased overall demand for discounted goods and services to help offset these limitations on individual merchants and customers, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted. Additionally, increased inflation could negatively impact our business by driving up our operating costs. Our costs are subject to inflationary pressures, and if those pressures become significant, we may not be able to offset such higher costs through price increases or other cost efficiency measures. Our inability or failure to do so could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 49 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of September 30, 2024. 
 Based on that evaluation and because of the previously-reported material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 Notwithstanding the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements present fairly, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows in accordance with GAAP. 
 Remediation Plan and Status 
 Management, with the oversight of the audit committee of our Board, has dedicated resources and efforts to improve our internal controls over financial reporting and has taken action to remediate such material weakness. Actions include taking steps towards the automation of certain complex accounting calculations, adding detective analytical management review controls, adding controls to reconcile source data across accounts, and enhancing review procedures within account reconciliations. While the Company has improved its control activities, the material weakness identified in the prior year remains unremediated as of September 30, 2024 and the Company s remediation efforts will continue to take place throughout 2024. 
 The material weakness cannot be considered remediated until the applicable controls have operated for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are designed and operating effectively. Accordingly, we will continue to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in the areas affected by the material weakness described above. 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 Except for the enhancements to controls to address the material weakness, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management s evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 
 In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.
