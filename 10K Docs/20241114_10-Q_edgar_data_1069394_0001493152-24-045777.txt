May 12, 1998 in the State of Nevada and in 2019 the Company redomiciled into Alberta, Canada. 

The
Company and its subsidiaries develop, manufacture and market specialty chemicals which slow the evaporation of water. One product, HEATSAVR ,
is marketed for use in swimming pools and spas where its use, by slowing the evaporation of water, allows the water to retain a higher
temperature for a longer period of time and thereby reduces the energy required to maintain the desired temperature of the water in the
pool. Another product, WATERSAVR , is marketed for water conservation in irrigation canals, aquaculture, and reservoirs where its
use slows water loss due to evaporation. In addition to the water conservation products, the Company also manufactures and markets water-soluble
chemicals utilizing thermal polyaspartate biopolymers (hereinafter referred to as TPAs ), which are beta-proteins manufactured
from the common biological amino acid, L-aspartic. TPAs can be formulated to prevent corrosion and scaling in water piping within the
petroleum, chemical, utility and mining industries. TPAs are also used as proteins to enhance fertilizers in improving crop yields and
can be used as additives for household laundry detergents, consumer care products and pesticides. The TPA division also manufactures
two nitrogen conservation products for agriculture that slows nitrogen loss from fields.

The
Company follows a five-step model for revenue recognition. The five steps are: (1) identification of the contract(s) with the customer,
(2) identification of the performance obligation(s) in the contract(s), (3) determination of the transaction price, (4) allocation of
the transaction price to the performance obligation, and (5) recognition of revenue when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied.
The Company has fulfilled its performance obligations when control transfers to the customer, which is generally at the time the product
is shipped since risk of loss is transferred to the purchaser upon delivery to the carrier. For shipments which are free-on-board shipping
point, the Company has elected to account for shipping and handling activities as a fulfillment cost rather than as an additional promised
service and performance obligation. 

Since
the Company s inception, product returns have been insignificant; therefore, no provision has been established for estimated product
returns. 

Deferred
revenues consist of products sold to distributors with payment terms greater than the Company s customary business terms due to
lack of credit history or operating in a new market in which the Company has no prior experience. The Company defers the recognition
of revenue until the criteria for revenue recognition has been met and payments become due or cash is received from these distributors. 

Loss
contingencies considered remote are generally not disclosed unless they involve guarantees, in which case the guarantees would be disclosed.
Legal fees associated with loss contingencies are expensed as incurred. The Company is not aware of any contingencies at the date of
these consolidated financial statements. 

for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 (2023 - or and for the three months ended September

ended September 30, 2024 totaled or (2023 - or ; December 31, 2023 - or ). 

The
credit risk on cash is limited because the Company limits its exposure to credit loss by placing its cash with major financial institutions.
The Company maintains cash balances at financial institutions which at times exceed federally insured amounts. The Company has not experienced
any losses in such accounts. 

The
Company is exposed to foreign risk to the extent that market value rate fluctuations materially differ for financial assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies. 

In
order to manage its exposure to foreign exchange risks, the Company closely monitors the fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange
rates and the impact on the value of cash, accounts receivable, and accounts payable and accrued liabilities. The Company has not hedged
its exposure to currency fluctuations. 

The
Company is exposed to interest rate risk to the extent that the fair value or future cash flows for financial liabilities will fluctuate
as a result of changes in market interest rates. The Company is exposed to interest rate risk on its long-term debt subject to fixed
long-term interest rates. 

In
order to manage its exposure to interest rate risk, the Company closely monitors fluctuations in market interest risks and will refinance
its long-term debt where possible to obtain more favourable rates. 

Under
the equity method of accounting, the investment is initially recorded at cost in the consolidated balance sheets under other assets and
adjusted for dividends received and the Company s share of the investee s earnings or losses together with other-than-temporary
impairments which are recorded through other income (loss), net in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income
(loss).

swimming pool blankets which save energy and water by inhibiting evaporation from the pool surface, and (ii) food-safe powdered form
of the active ingredient within the liquid blankets and which are designed to be used in still or slow moving drinking water sources. 

(b)
 Biodegradable polymers, also known as TPA s (as shown under the column heading BCPA below), used by the petroleum,
chemical, utility and mining industries to prevent corrosion and scaling in water piping. This product can also be used in detergents
to increase biodegradability and in agriculture to increase crop yields by enhancing fertilizer uptake. 

The
third product line is nitrogen conservation products used for the agriculture industry. These products decrease the loss of nitrogen
fertilizer after initial application and allows less fertilizer to be used. These products are made and sold by the Company s TPA
division.

performance based on profit or loss from operations before income taxes, not including nonrecurring gains and losses and foreign exchange

2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

Overview 

The
Company manufactures and markets biodegradable polymers which are used in the oil, gas and agriculture industries. The Company also develops,
manufactures and markets specialty chemicals that slow the evaporation of water. 

Results
of Operations 

We
have three product lines. 

The
first is a chemical EWCP used in swimming pools and spas. The product forms a thin, transparent layer on the water s
surface. The transparent layer slows the evaporation of water, allowing the water to retain a higher temperature for a longer period
of time thereby reducing the energy required to maintain the desired temperature of the water. A modified version of EWCP can also be
used in reservoirs, potable water storage tanks, livestock watering pods, canals, and irrigation ditches for the purpose of reducing
evaporation. 

The
second product, biodegradable polymers TPAs ), is used by the petroleum, chemical, utility and mining industries to prevent
corrosion and scaling in water piping. TPAs can also be used to increase biodegradability in detergents and in the agriculture industry
to increase crop yields by enhancing fertilizer uptake. 

The
third product line is nitrogen conservation products used for the agriculture industry. These products decrease the loss of nitrogen
fertilizer after initial application and allows less fertilizer to be used. These products are made and sold by the Company s TPA
division.
