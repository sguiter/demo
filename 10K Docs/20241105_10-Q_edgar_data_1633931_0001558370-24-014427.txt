 Item 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OVERVIEW TopBuild, headquartered in Daytona Beach, Florida, is a leading installer and specialty distributor of insulation and other building material products to the construction industry in the United States and Canada. We operate in two segments: Installation and Specialty Distribution. Our Installation segment installs insulation and other building products nationwide. As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 250 Installation branches located across the United States. We install various insulation applications, including fiberglass batts and rolls, blown-in loose fill fiberglass, polyurethane spray foam, and blown-in loose fill cellulose. Additionally, we install other building products including glass and windows, rain gutters, garage doors, closet shelving, and fireplaces, among other items. We handle every stage of the installation process, including material procurement supplied by leading manufacturers, project scheduling and logistics, multi-phase professional installation, and installation quality assurance. Our Specialty Distribution segment distributes building and mechanical insulation, insulation accessories, rain gutters, and other building product materials for the residential and commercial/industrial end markets. As of September 30, 2024, we had approximately 150 distribution centers located across the United States and 18 distribution centers in Canada. Our Specialty Distribution customer base consists of thousands of insulation contractors of all sizes serving a wide variety of residential and commercial/industrial industries, gutter contractors, weatherization contractors, other contractors, dealers, metal building erectors, and modular home builders. We believe that having both Installation and Specialty Distribution provides us with several distinct competitive advantages. First, the combined buying power of our two business segments, along with our scale, strengthens our ties to the major manufacturers of insulation and other building material products. This helps to ensure we are buying competitively and ensures the availability of supply to our local branches and distribution centers. The overall effect is driving efficiencies through our supply chain. Second, being a leader in both installation and specialty distribution allows us to reach a broader set of builders and contractors more effectively, regardless of their size or geographic location in the U.S. and Canada, and leverage housing and commercial/industrial construction growth wherever it occurs. Third, during housing industry downturns, many insulation contractors who buy directly from manufacturers during industry peaks return to purchasing through specialty distributors. As a result, this helps to reduce our exposure to cyclical swings in our business. For additional details pertaining to our operating results by segment, see Note 7 Segment Information to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contained in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report. For additional details regarding our strategy, material trends in our business and seasonality, please refer to Part II, Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2023 , as filed with the SEC on February 28, 2024. The following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements and should be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, the notes thereto, and the section entitled Forward-Looking Statements included in this Quarterly Report.

 THIRD QUARTER 2024 VERSUS THIRD QUARTER 2023 The following table sets forth our net sales, gross profit, operating profit, and margins, as reported in our condensed consolidated statements of operations, in thousands: 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net sales 1,373,268 1,326,120 Cost of sales 951,455 905,430 Cost of sales ratio 69.3 68.3 Gross profit 421,813 420,690 Gross profit margin 30.7 31.7 Selling, general, and administrative expense 177,820 183,198 Selling, general, and administrative expense to sales ratio 12.9 13.8 Operating profit 243,993 237,492 Operating profit margin 17.8 17.9 Other expense, net (16,094) (12,815) Income tax expense (58,939) (57,075) Net income 168,960 167,602 Net margin 12.3 12.6 Sales and Operations Net sales increased 3.6 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, from the comparable period of 2023. The increase was primarily driven by a 2.4 increase in sales from acquisitions, a 1.0 impact from higher selling prices and a 0.4 increase in sales volume, partially offset by a decline of 0.1 driven by the disposition of a non-core business. Gross profit margins were 30.7 and 31.7 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decline in gross profit margin is primarily due to higher material costs and lower benefit of sales mix compared to the same period of the prior year, partially offset by improved productivity and higher pricing. Selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were 12.9 and 13.8 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were lower primarily due to less acquisition related costs in 2024. Operating margins were 17.8 and 17.9 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in operating margins was due to higher material costs and lower benefit of sales mix, partially offset by higher selling prices, productivity initiatives, and lower acquisition related costs in 2024.

Sales increased 2.9 from acquisitions, 1.1 from higher selling prices, and 0.5 due to higher sales volume, partially offset by a decline of 0.2 driven by the disposition of a non-core business. Operating margins Operating margins in our Installation segment were 20.1 and 21.3 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decline in operating margin was driven by higher material costs and lower benefit of sales mix, which was partially offset by higher selling prices and productivity initiatives. Specialty Distribution Sales Sales in our Specialty Distribution segment increased 29.4 million, or 5.1 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. Sales increased 3.0 due to higher sales volume, 1.4 from acquisitions and 0.8 from higher selling prices. Operating margins Operating margins in our Specialty Distribution segment were 15.8 and 15.5 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

 OTHER ITEMS Other expense, net Other expense, net, increased to 16.1 million from 12.8 million in the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase was driven by 3.0 million lower interest income due to lower cash balances than the prior year. Interest and other expenses remained relatively flat compared to the prior period. Income tax expense Income tax expense was 58.9 million, an effective tax rate of 25.9 percent, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 57.1 million, an effective tax rate of 25.4 percent, for the comparable period in 2023. The tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was higher primarily related to share-based compensation. FIRST NINE MONTHS 2024 VERSUS FIRST NINE MONTHS 2023 The following table sets forth our net sales, gross profit, operating profit, and margins, as reported in our condensed consolidated statements of operations, in thousands: 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Net sales 4,017,597 3,908,620 Cost of sales 2,784,712 2,695,916 Cost of sales ratio 69.3 69.0 Gross profit 1,232,885 1,212,704 Gross profit margin 30.7 31.0 Selling, general, and administrative expense 563,992 538,679 Selling, general, and administrative expense to sales ratio 14.0 13.8 Operating profit 668,893 674,025 Operating profit margin 16.6 17.2 Other expense, net (30,824) (42,885) Income tax expense (166,005) (163,270) Net income 472,064 467,870 Net margin 11.7 12.0 Sales and Operations Net sales increased 2.8 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, from the comparable period in 2023. The increase was primarily driven by a 2.5 increase in sales from acquisitions and a 1.2 impact from higher selling prices, partially offset by a 0.5 decline in sales volume and a decline of 0.4 driven by the disposition of a non-core business. Gross profit margins were 30.7 and 31.0 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decline in gross profit margin is primarily due to higher material costs and lower benefit of sales mix compared to the same period of the prior year, partially offset by improved productivity and higher selling prices. Selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were 14.0 and 13.8 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were higher due to a 23.0 million fee paid to terminate our agreement to acquire SPI.

Table of Contents 
 Operating margins were 16.6 and 17.2 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decline in operating margins was due to higher material costs, lower benefit of sales mix, and increased selling, general, and administrative expenses from a 23.0 million fee paid to terminate our agreement to acquire SPI. These impacts were partially offset by productivity initiatives and higher selling prices. Business Segment Results The following table sets forth our net sales and operating profit margins by business segment, in thousands: 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Percent Change Net sales by business segment: Installation 2,506,076 2,397,818 4.5 Specialty Distribution 1,739,007 1,703,871 2.1 Intercompany eliminations (227,486) (193,069) Net sales 4,017,597 3,908,620 2.8 Operating profit by business segment: Installation 499,717 494,394 1.1 Specialty Distribution 261,862 247,583 5.8 Intercompany eliminations (37,076) (32,672) Operating profit before general corporate expense 724,503 709,305 2.1 General corporate expense, net (55,610) (35,280) Operating profit 668,893 674,025 (0.8) Operating profit margins: Installation 19.9 20.6 Specialty Distribution 15.1 14.5 Operating profit margin before general corporate expense 18.0 18.1 Operating profit margin 16.6 17.2 Installation Sales Sales in our Installation segment increased 108.3 million, or 4.5 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. Sales increased 3.4 from acquisitions, 1.2 from higher selling prices, and 0.6 due to higher sales volume, partially offset by a decline of 0.6 driven by the disposition of a non-core business. Operating margins Operating margins in our Installation segment were 19.9 and 20.6 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decline in operating margin was driven by higher material costs and change in sales mix which was partially offset by higher selling prices and productivity initiatives. Specialty Distribution Sales Sales in our Specialty Distribution segment increased 35.1 million, or 2.1 , for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to same period in 2023. Sales increased 1.2 from higher selling prices and 1.0 from acquisitions, partially offset by a decline of 0.2 in sales volume. Operating margins Operating margins in our Specialty Distribution segment were 15.1 and 14.5 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in operating margin was driven by productivity initiatives and higher selling prices partially offset by higher material costs.

 OTHER ITEMS Other expense, net Other expense, net, decreased to 30.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 from 42.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease was driven by 11.6 million of higher interest income due to higher levels of invested cash balances during the period. The increase in interest income was partially offset by higher interest expense of 0.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to higher interest rates on borrowings under the Credit Agreement compared to the same period in 2023. Income tax expense Income tax expense was 166.0 million, an effective tax rate of 26.0 percent, for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 163.3 million, an effective tax rate of 25.9 percent, for the comparable period in 2023. The tax rate for nine months ended September 30, 2024 was higher, driven by an increase in tax expense related to share-based compensation. Cash Flows and Liquidity Significant sources (uses) of cash and cash equivalents are summarized for the periods indicated, in thousands: 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 Changes in cash and cash equivalents: Net cash provided by operating activities 509,798 588,478 Net cash used in investing activities (142,918) (181,016) Net cash used in financing activities (957,701) (31,872) Impact of exchange rate changes on cash (402) (47) Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents (591,223) 375,543 Net cash flows provided by operating activities decreased 78.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the prior year period. Net income of 472.1 million was essentially flat to the prior year period, even considering the 23.0 million fee paid to terminate our agreement to acquire SPI, while operating profit declined by 5.1 million primarily due material cost increases. We also incurred increases in working capital accounts, leading to more cash used in operations. Net cash used in investing activities was 142.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily composed of 88.5 million for our acquisitions and 56.8 million for purchases of property and equipment, mainly vehicles, partially offset by 2.3 million proceeds received from the sale of assets. Net cash used in investing activities was 181.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily composed of 147.6 million for our acquisitions and 48.1 million for purchases of property and equipment, mainly vehicles and equipment, partially offset by 14.7 million proceeds received from the sale of assets. Net cash used in financing activities was 957.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we used 919.2 million to repurchase shares of our common stock under the 2022 and 2024 Repurchase Programs, 35.7 million for debt repayments and incurred 2.9 million net cash outflow related to exercise of share-based incentive awards and stock options. Net cash used in financing activities was 31.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

 We have access to liquidity through our cash from operations and available borrowing capacity under our Credit Agreement, which provides for borrowing and/or standby letter of credit issuances of up to 500 million under the Revolving Facility. Additional information regarding our outstanding debt and borrowing capacity is incorporated by reference from Note 5 Long-term Debt to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contained in Part 1, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report. The following table summarizes our liquidity, in thousands: 

As of September 30, December 31, 2024 2023 Cash and cash equivalents (a) 257,342 848,565 Revolving facility 500,000 500,000 Less: standby letters of credit (63,770) (63,770) Availability under Revolving facility 436,230 436,230 Total liquidity 693,572 1,284,795 

 (a) Our cash and cash equivalents consist of AAA-rated money market funds as well as cash held in our demand deposit accounts. We believe that our cash flows from operations, combined with our current cash levels and available borrowing capacity, will be adequate to support our ongoing operations and known contractual obligations including funding our debt service requirements, capital expenditures, lease obligations and working capital needs for at least the next twelve months . We also have adequate liquidity to maintain off-balance sheet arrangements for short-term leases, letters of credit, and performance and license bonds. OUTLOOK Residential New Construction Several key inflation metrics improved in the third quarter and the labor market remains strong. Demand for single-family housing has improved more gradually than anticipated as growth slowed in the second half of the year compared to the first two quarters. Demand continues to be uneven across the country. Demand for multi-family homes has declined in comparison to last year, however our 2024 multi-family sales have grown due to the strong backlog we brought into the year. We expect multi-family sales will continue to slow as we move into 2025. Multi-family housing units typically require approximately 40 of the insulation that a single-family unit requires. As a result of years of underbuilding in the United States, an overall shortage of housing across the country persists, and we continue to be optimistic about the long-term fundamentals of our business. We believe demand for homes will be supported by strengthening energy efficiency requirements, moderating interest rates and increasing household formations. Commercial and Industrial Construction Our commercial backlog is strong, and our bidding activity is active, both of which continue to support our positive view of commercial/industrial sales at our Installation and Specialty Distribution segments. Some projects have been delayed in 2024, but we have not seen an uptick in cancellations. We remain optimistic that lower interest rates in the future will unlock projects across many industries. In addition, recurring maintenance and repair work on industrial sites serves as a continued driver for our Specialty Distribution business.

 OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS We had no material off-balance sheet arrangements during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, other than short-term leases, letters of credit, and performance and license bonds, which have been disclosed in Part 1, Item 1 of this Quarterly report. We occasionally use performance bonds to ensure completion of our work on certain larger customer contracts that can span multiple accounting periods. Performance bonds generally do not have stated expiration dates; rather, we are released from the bonds as the contractual performance is completed. We also have bonds outstanding for license and insurance. The following table summarizes our outstanding performance, licensing, insurance, and other bonds, in thousands: 

As of September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Outstanding bonds: Performance bonds 152,259 145,982 Licensing, insurance, and other bonds 28,472 27,415 Total bonds 180,731 173,397 CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS There have been no material changes to our contractual obligations from those previously disclosed in our Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2023 , as filed with the SEC on February 28, 2024. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES We prepare our condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of sales and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Our critical accounting policies have not changed from those previously reported in our Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2023 , as filed with the SEC on February 28, 2024. APPLICATION OF NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS Information regarding the application of new accounting standards is incorporated by reference from Note 2 Accounting Policies to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contained in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report.

 Item 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest Rate Risk We have a Term Loan outstanding with a principal balance of 498.8 million and a revolving facility with an aggregate borrowing capacity of 500.0 million. We also have outstanding 3.625 Senior Notes with an aggregate principal balance of 400.0 million and 4.125 Senior Notes with an aggregate principal balance of 500.0 million. The 3.625 Senior Notes and 4.125 Senior Notes bear a fixed rate of interest and therefore are excluded from the calculation below as they are not subject to fluctuations in interest rates. Interest payable on both the aggregate Term Loan and Revolving Facility is based on a variable interest rate. As a result, we are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on this outstanding indebtedness. As of September 30, 2024, the applicable interest rate as of such date was 5.95 . Based on our outstanding borrowings as of September 30, 2024, a 100-basis point increase in the interest rate would result in a 4.8 million increase in our annualized interest expense. There was no outstanding balance under the Revolving Facility as of September 30, 2024. Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures As of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. C hanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There was no change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) in the most recent fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

TOPBUILD CORP. EXECUTIVE SEVERANCE PLAN (as amended effective October 28, 2024 (the Amendment Effective Date )) PREAMBLE TopBuild Corp. hereby amends this TopBuild Corp. Executive Severance Plan, effective as of the Amendment Effective Date, to further the economic interests of the Company by providing severance benefits to selected Executives. The Board recognizes that, as is the case with many publicly held corporations, the possibility of a Change in Control exists and that such possibility, and the resultant uncertainty as to an Executive s responsibilities, compensation, or continued employment, may result in the departure or distraction of the Executive, which may be detrimental to the financial performance of the Company. The Board believes that it is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to (i) assure that the Company will have the continued dedication and objectivity of selected Executives, notwithstanding the possibility, threat, or occurrence of a Change in Control, and (ii) provide selected Executives with an incentive to continue their employment prior to a Change in Control and to motivate them to maximize the value of the Company upon a Change in Control for the benefit of its stockholders. The Board also believes that it is important to the interest of the Company and its stockholders to provide selected Executives with certain severance benefits upon their termination of employment under certain non-Change in Control circumstances. The Plan is a top-hat plan within the meaning of Sections 201(2), 301(a)(3), and 401(a)(1) of ERISA. As such, this Plan is subject to limited ERISA reporting and disclosure requirements and is exempt from most other ERISA requirements. Distributions required or contemplated by this Plan, or actions required to be taken under this Plan, shall not be construed as creating a trust of any kind or a fiduciary relationship between the Company and any Executive, Participant, employee, or any other person. ARTICLE 1 REFERENCES AND DEFINITIONS Whenever used herein and capitalized, the following terms have the respective meanings indicated unless the context clearly requires otherwise. 1.1 Accrued Compensation means all of a Participant s accrued but unpaid vacation, expense reimbursements, wages, and other benefits due to the Participant under any Company-provided plans, policies, or arrangements as of the Participant s termination date. 1.2 Affiliate shall have the meaning set forth in Rule 12b-2 promulgated under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. 1.3 Base Salary means a Participant s total annual base rate of pay as in effect immediately prior to the Participant s termination of employment or, in the event of a termination during the Change in Control Period, if greater, at the level in effect immediately prior to the Change in Control. Base Salary shall not be reduced for any salary reduction contributions: (a) to cash or deferred arrangements under Code Section 401(k), (b) to a cafeteria plan under Code Section 125, or (c) to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. Base Salary shall not take into account any bonuses, commissions, reimbursed expenses, employer credits or contributions to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan (other than salary reduction contributions as described above), or any additional cash compensation or compensation payable in a form other than cash. 
 1 

1.4 Beneficial Owner or Beneficially Owned shall have the meaning set forth in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act. 1.5 Board means the board of directors of TopBuild Corp. 1.6 Cause means: (a) a Participant s material failure to perform his or her stated duties, and the Participant s continued failure to cure such failure to the reasonable satisfaction of the Company within ten (10) days following written notice of such failure to the Participant from the Committee; (b) a Participant s material violation of a Company policy (including any insider trading policy) or any written agreement or covenant with the Company; (c) a Participant s conviction of, or entry of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere to, a felony (other than motor vehicle offenses the effect of which do not materially impair the Participant s performance of his or her employment duties); (d) a willful act by a Participant that constitutes gross misconduct and which is injurious to the Company; (e) a Participant s commission of any act of fraud, embezzlement, dishonesty or any other willful misconduct that has caused or is reasonably expected to result in material injury to the Company; (f) the unauthorized use or disclosure by a Participant of any proprietary information or trade secrets of the Company or any other party to whom the Participant owes an obligation of nondisclosure as a result of the Participant s relationship with the Company; or (g) a Participant s willful failure to cooperate with an investigation by a governmental authority. The determination as to whether a Participant is being terminated for Cause will be made in good faith by the Committee and will, except as set forth below, be final and binding on all interested parties. The foregoing definition does not in any way limit the Company s ability to terminate a Participant s employment relationship at any time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, during the Change in Control Period, Cause shall mean (i) the willful and continued failure by the Participant (other than any such failure resulting from the Participant s incapacity due to physical or mental illness) to perform substantially the duties and responsibilities of the Participant s position with the Company after a written demand for substantial performance is delivered to the Participant by the Board, which demand specifically identifies the manner in which the Board believes that the Participant has not substantially performed such duties or responsibilities; (ii) the conviction of the Executive by a court of competent jurisdiction for felony criminal conduct; or (iii) the willful engaging by the Participant in fraud or dishonesty which is demonstrably and materially injurious to the Company or its reputation, monetarily or otherwise. For purposes of this paragraph, no act, or failure to act, on the Participant s part shall be deemed willful unless committed, or omitted by the Participant in bad faith and without reasonable belief that the Participant s act or failure to act was in, or not opposed to, the best interest of the Company. In addition, in the event of a dispute regarding the existence of Cause with respect to a termination during the Change in Control Period, a determination by the Committee as to the existence of Cause shall not be entitled to deference in the event of a claim described in Section 5.3(b) or 5.3(c) hereof. 1.7 Change in Control means the occurrence of any of the following events: (a) any Person is or becomes the Beneficial Owner, directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company representing more than 40 of either the then-outstanding shares of common stock of the Company or the combined voting power of the Company s then-outstanding securities, excluding any Person

Alternatively, a Participant will be deemed disabled if determined to be totally disabled by the Social Security Administration. Termination of employment resulting from Disability may only be effected after at least thirty (30) days written notice by the Company of its intention to terminate a Participant s employment. In the event that a Participant resumes the performance of substantially all of his or her duties hereunder before his or her termination becomes effective, the notice of intent to terminate based on Disability will automatically be deemed to have been revoked.

In addition, following a Change in Control, (i) a material reduction of the Participant s authority, duties or responsibilities, relative to his or her authority, duties or responsibilities in effect immediately prior to such reduction, or (ii) a material reduction in a Participant s annual incentive opportunity or the fair value of the Participant s annual long-term incentive compensation award (in each case as compared to the levels in effect immediately prior to the Change in Control) will constitute Good Reason. A Participant may not resign for Good Reason without first providing the Company with written notice within ninety (90) days of the initial existence of the Good Reason condition specifically identifying the acts or omissions constituting the grounds for Good Reason and a reasonable cure period of not less than thirty (30) days following the date of such notice. In addition, in the event of a dispute regarding the existence of Good Reason with respect to a termination during the Change in Control Period, a determination by the Committee with respect to Good Reason shall not be entitled to deference in the event of a claims described in Section 5.3(b) or 5.3(c) hereof. 1.18 Normal Retirement Age means a Participant s attainment of age sixty-two (62). 1.19 Participant means any Executive who commenced participation in the Plan as provided in Article 2 and unless otherwise specified shall include each Tier CEO Participant, Tier 1 Participant, and Tier 2 Participant. 1.20 Person shall have the meaning given in Section 3(a)(9) of the Exchange Act, as modified and used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) thereof, except that such term shall not include (i) the Company or any of its subsidiaries, (ii) a trustee or other fiduciary holding securities under an employee benefit plan of the Company or any of its Affiliates, (iii) an underwriter temporarily holding securities pursuant to an offering of such securities, or (iv) a corporation owned, directly or indirectly, by the stockholders of the Company in substantially the same proportions as their ownership of stock of the Company. 1.21 Plan means the TopBuild Corp.

ARTICLE 3 PLAN BENEFITS 3.1 Tier CEO Participants -Termination Without Cause or for Good Reason, Unrelated to a Change in Control. If the Company terminates a Tier CEO Participant s employment with the Company without Cause (excluding death or Disability) or if a Tier CEO Participant resigns from such employment for Good Reason, and, in each case, such termination occurs outside of the Change in Control Period, then subject to Article 4, the Tier CEO Participant will receive the following: (a) Accrued Compensation. The Company will pay the Tier CEO Participant all Accrued Compensation as soon as administratively feasible after termination. (b) Severance Payment. The Tier CEO Participant will receive a lump-sum payment (less applicable withholding taxes) equal to two (2) years of the Tier CEO Participant s Base Salary. Such lump-sum amount shall be payable upon the later of: (i) sixty (60) days following termination of employment, or (ii) such later date required by Section 4.3. (c) Bonus Payment. The Tier CEO Participant will receive a lump-sum payment equal to two hundred percent (200 of the Tier CEO Participant s target bonus as in effect for the fiscal year in which the Tier CEO Participant s termination of employment occurs. For avoidance of doubt, the amount paid to the Tier CEO Participant pursuant to this subsection will not be prorated based on the actual amount of time the Tier CEO Participant is employed by the Company during the fiscal year (or the relevant performance period if something different than a fiscal year) during which the termination occurs. Such lump-sum amounts shall be payable upon the later of: (i) sixty (60) days following termination of employment, or (ii) such later date required by Section 4.3. In addition to the bonus payment described above, the Tier CEO Participant will be eligible to receive a lump-sum payment equal to the bonus for the fiscal year in which his or her termination of employment occurs that the Tier CEO Participant would have earned had the termination of employment not occurred, determined based on the actual achievement of the applicable performance criteria over such fiscal year. The bonus payment to the Tier CEO Participant described in the preceding sentence shall be calculated pro rata based on the portion of the fiscal year during which the Tier CEO Participant was an active employee of the Company and shall be paid following the end of the fiscal year at the time bonus payments are made to active employees of the Company. (d) Continuation Coverage. If the Tier CEO Participant elects continuation coverage pursuant to the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended COBRA ), within the time period prescribed pursuant to COBRA for the Tier CEO Participant and his or her eligible dependents, then (without limitation of the Tier CEO Participant s rights under COBRA) the Company will provide continuation of the Tier CEO Participant s medical insurance coverage for twenty-four (24) months. These benefits shall be provided by the Company to the Tier CEO Participant beginning immediately upon the date of the Tier CEO Participant s termination of employment. Such benefits shall be provided to the Tier CEO Participant at the same coverage level and cost to the Tier CEO Participant as in effect immediately prior to the date of the Tier CEO Participant s termination of employment. Such benefits shall count as COBRA continuation coverage. Notwithstanding the above, these medical insurance benefits shall be discontinued prior to the end of the stated continuation period in the event the Tier CEO Participant receives substantially similar benefits from a subsequent employer, as determined solely by the Company in good faith. For purposes of enforcing this provision, the Tier CEO Participant shall be deemed to have a duty to keep the Company informed as to the terms and conditions of any subsequent employment and the corresponding benefits earned from such employment, and shall provide, or cause to be provided, to the Company in writing correct, complete, and timely information concerning the same. 
 6 

In addition, no later than the end of each calendar year in which such group health plan coverage is in effect, the Company will report the value of the group health plan coverage (less any amount the Tier CEO Participant pays for such coverage) as taxable income to the Tier CEO Participant. (e) Equity Awards. Notwithstanding any other provision in any applicable equity compensation plan and/or individual award agreement: (i) the Tier CEO Participant s then-outstanding and unvested stock options will become vested pro rata as of his or her termination of employment date based on the portion of the vesting period during which the Tier CEO Participant was an active employee of the Company, and the Tier CEO Participant s outstanding and vested stock options as of the Tier CEO Participant s termination of employment date will remain exercisable until the three (3) month anniversary of the termination of employment date; provided , however , that the post-termination exercise period for any individual stock option will not extend beyond the earlier of its original maximum term or the tenth (10 th anniversary of the original date of grant; (ii) the Tier CEO Participant s then-outstanding and unvested performance shares or units will become vested pro rata as of his or her termination date based on the portion of the vesting period during which the Tier CEO Participant was an active employee of the Company; provided , however , that if an outstanding performance share is to be determined based on the achievement of performance criteria, then the performance share or unit will be determined based on the actual performance and attainment of the performance criteria over the relevant performance period(s), but the performance share shall be calculated pro rata based on the portion of the performance period during which the Tier CEO Participant was an active employee of the Company and paid or delivered following the end of the relevant performance period(s) in accordance with the provisions of any applicable equity compensation plan and/or individual award agreement; and (iii) the Tier CEO Participant s then-outstanding and unvested restricted stock or units will become vested pro rata as of his or her termination date based on the portion of the vesting period during which the Tier CEO Participant was an active employee of the Company. 3.2 Tier CEO Participants - Termination Without Cause or for Good Reason, in Connection with a Change in Control. If the Company terminates a Tier CEO Participant s employment with the Company without Cause (excluding death or Disability) or if a Tier CEO Participant resigns from such employment for Good Reason, and, in each case, such termination occurs during the Change in Control Period, then subject to Article 4, the Tier CEO Participant will receive the following: (a) Accrued Compensation. The Company will pay the Tier CEO Participant the Accrued Compensation as soon as administratively feasible after termination. (b) Severance Payment. The Tier CEO Participant will receive a lump-sum payment (less applicable withholding taxes) equal to three (3) years of the Tier CEO Participant s Base Salary. Such lump-sum amount shall be payable upon the later of: (A) sixty (60) days following termination of employment, or (B) such later date required by Section 4.3. (c) Bonus Payment. The Tier CEO Participant will receive a lump-sum payment equal to three hundred percent (300 of the greater of (i) the Tier CEO Participant s target bonus as in effect for the fiscal year in which the Change in Control occurs, or (ii) the Tier CEO Participant s target bonus as in effect for the fiscal year in which his or her termination of employment occurs. For avoidance of doubt, the amount paid to the Tier CEO Participant pursuant to this subsection will not be prorated based on the actual amount of time the Tier CEO Participant is employed by the Company during the fiscal year (or the relevant performance period if something different than a fiscal year) during which the termination occurs. In addition to the bonus payment described above, the Tier CEO Participant will receive a lump-sum payment equal to one hundred percent (100 of his or her 
 7 

target bonus as in effect for the fiscal year in which his or her termination of employment occurs calculated pro rata based on the portion of the performance period during which the Tier CEO Participant was an active employee of the Company. Such lump-sum amount shall be payable upon the later of: (A) sixty (60) days following termination of employment, or (B) such later date required by Section 4.3. (d) Continuation Coverage. If the Tier CEO Participant elects continuation coverage pursuant to COBRA within the time period prescribed pursuant to COBRA for the Tier CEO Participant and his or her eligible dependents, then the Company will provide continuation of the Tier CEO Participant s medical insurance coverage for thirty-six (36) months. These benefits shall be provided by the Company to the Tier CEO Participant beginning immediately upon the date of the Tier CEO Participant s termination of employment. Such benefits shall be provided to the Tier CEO Participant at the same coverage level and cost to the Tier CEO Participant as in effect immediately prior to the date of the Tier CEO Participant s termination of employment. Such benefits shall count as COBRA continuation coverage. Notwithstanding the above, these medical insurance benefits shall be discontinued prior to the end of the stated continuation period in the event the Tier CEO Participant receives substantially similar benefits from a subsequent employer, as determined solely by the Company in good faith. For purposes of enforcing this provision, the Tier CEO Participant shall be deemed to have a duty to keep the Company informed as to the terms and conditions of any subsequent employment and the corresponding benefits earned from such employment, and shall provide, or cause to be provided, to the Company in writing correct, complete, and timely information concerning the same. Following the end of the COBRA continuation period, if such group health plan coverage is provided under a health plan that is subject to Code Section 105(h), the benefits payable under such health plan to the Tier CEO Participant shall comply with the requirements of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(i)(1)(iv) and, if necessary, the Company shall amend such health plan to comply therewith.

Similarly, no severance payable to the Participant, if any, pursuant to the Plan that otherwise would be exempt from Code Section 409A will be payable until the Participant incurs a separation from service within the meaning of Code Section 409A. (b) It is intended that, to the maximum extent permitted under Code Section 409A, none of the severance payments under the Plan will constitute Deferred Payments but rather will be exempt from Code Section 409A as a payment that would fall within the short-term deferral period as described in Section 4.3(d) below or resulting from an involuntary separation from service as described in Section 4.3(e) below. However, any severance payments or benefits under the Plan that would be considered Deferred Payments will be paid on, or, in the case of installments, will not commence until, the sixtieth (60 th day following the Participant s separation from service, or, if later, such time as required by Section 4.3(c). Except as required by Section 4.3(c), any installment payments that would have been made to the Participant during the sixty (60) day period immediately following the Participant s separation from service but for the preceding sentence will be paid to the Participant on the sixtieth (60 th day following the Participant s separation from service and the remaining payments will be made as provided in the Plan. (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Plan, if the Participant is a specified employee within the meaning of Code Section 409A at the time of the Participant s termination (other than due to death), then the Deferred Payments, if any, that are payable within the first six (6) months following the Participant s separation from service, will become payable on the first payroll date that occurs on or after the date six (6) months and one (1) day following the date of the Participant s separation from service. All subsequent Deferred Payments, if any, will be payable in accordance with the payment schedule applicable to each payment or benefit. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if the Participant dies following his or her separation from service, but before the six (6) month anniversary of the separation from service, then any payments delayed in accordance with this subsection will be payable in a lump sum as soon as administratively practicable after the date of the Participant s death and all other Deferred Payments will be payable in accordance with the payment schedule applicable to each payment or benefit. Each payment and benefit payable under the Plan is intended to constitute a separate payment under Section 1.409A-2(b)(2) of the Treasury Regulations. (d) Any amount paid under the Plan that satisfies the requirements of the short-term deferral rule set forth in Section 1.409A-1(b)(4) of the Treasury Regulations will not constitute Deferred Payments for purposes of Section 4.3(a) above. (e) Any amount paid under the Plan that qualifies as a payment made as a result of an involuntary separation from service pursuant to Section 1.409A-1(b)(9)(iii) of the Treasury Regulations that does not exceed the Code Section 409A Limit (as defined below) will not constitute Deferred Payments for purposes of Section 4.3(a) above.

5.2 Agents. The Committee may engage such legal counsel, certified public accountants and other advisers and service providers, who may be advisers or service providers for the Company or an affiliate, and make use of such agents and clerical or other personnel, as it shall require or may deem advisable for purposes of the Plan. The Committee may rely upon the written opinion of any legal counsel or accountants engaged by the Committee, and may delegate to any such agent its authority to perform any act hereunder, including, without limitation, those matters involving the exercise of discretion, provided that such delegation shall be subject to revocation at any time at the discretion of the Committee. 5.3 Claims for Benefits. Any person claiming a benefit Claimant under the Plan shall present the request in writing to the Committee. (a) Initial Claim Review. If the claim is wholly or partially denied, the Committee will, within a reasonable period of time, and within ninety (90) days of the receipt of such claim, or if the claim is a claim on account of Disability, within forty-five (45) days of the receipt of such claim, provide the Claimant with written notice of the denial setting forth in a manner calculated to be understood by the Claimant: (i) The specific reason or reasons for which the claim was denied; (ii) Specific reference to pertinent provisions of the Plan, rules, procedures or protocols upon which the Committee relied to deny the claim; (iii) A description of any additional material or information that the Claimant may file to perfect the claim and an explanation of why this material or information is necessary; (iv) An explanation of the Plan s claims review procedure and the time limits applicable to such procedure and a statement of the Claimant s right to bring a civil action under Section 502(a) of ERISA following an adverse determination upon review; and (v) In the case of an adverse determination of a claim on account of Disability, the information to the Claimant shall include, to the extent necessary, the information set forth in the Department of Labor Regulation Section 2560.503-1(g)(1)(v). If special circumstances require the extension of the forty-five (45)-day or ninety (90)-day period described above, the Claimant will be notified before the end of the initial period of the circumstances requiring the extension and the date by which the Committee expects to reach a decision. Any extension for deciding a claim will not be for more than an additional ninety (90)-day period, or if the claim is on account of Disability, for not more than two additional thirty (30)-day periods. (b) Review of Claim. If a claim for benefits is denied, in whole or in part, the Claimant may request to have the claim reviewed. The Claimant will have one hundred eighty (180) days in which to request a review of a claim regarding Disability, and will have sixty (60) days in which to request a review of all other claims. The request must be in writing and delivered to the Board, and the Board or its designee shall review the appeal appeal official ). If no such review is requested, the initial decision of the Committee will be considered final and binding. The appeal official s decision on review shall be sent to the Claimant in writing and shall include specific reasons for the decision, written in a manner calculated to be understood by the Claimant, as well as specific references to the pertinent Plan provisions, rules, procedures or protocols upon which the appeal official relied to deny the appeal. The appeal official shall consider all information submitted by the Claimant, regardless of whether the information was part of the original claim. The decision shall also include a statement of the Claimant s right to bring an action under Section 502(a) of ERISA. The appeal official s decision on review shall be made not later than sixty (60) days (forty-five (45) days in the case of a claim on account of Disability) after its receipt of the request for review, unless special 
 18 

circumstances require an extension of time for processing, in which case a decision shall be rendered as soon as possible, but not later than one hundred and twenty (120) days (ninety (90) days in the case of a claim on account of Disability) after receipt of the request for review. This notice to the Claimant shall indicate the special circumstances requiring the extension and the date by which the appeal official expects to render a decision and will be provided to the Claimant prior to the expiration of the initial forty-five (45)-day or sixty (60)-day period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of a claim on account of Disability: (i) The review of the denied claim shall be conducted by a party who is neither the individual who made the benefit determination nor a subordinate of such person; and (ii) No deference shall be given to the initial benefit determination. For issues involving medical judgment, the reviewing party must consult with an independent health care professional who may not be the health care professional who decided the initial claim. (c) Legal Proceedings Regarding Claims. Claimants must follow the claims procedures included in this Section before taking action in any other forum regarding a claim. Any suit or legal action initiated by a Claimant must be brought by the Claimant no later than one (1) year following a final decision on the claim under these claims procedures. The one (1)-year statute of limitations on suits for benefits shall apply in any forum where a Claimant initiates such suit or legal action. If a civil action is not filed within this period, the Claimant s claim will be deemed permanently waived and abandoned, and the Claimant will be precluded from reasserting it. (d) Legal Fee Reimbursement . In the event of a good faith dispute by a Participant regarding benefits under the Plan with respect to a termination occurring during the Change in Control Period, the Company shall reimburse to the Participant, promptly upon receipt of reasonable documentation (which must be submitted within the six-month period following the date upon which the expense is incurred), the Participant s reasonable legal fees incurred in connection with such dispute. 5.4 Hold Harmless. To the maximum extent permitted by law, the members of the Committee and the Board shall not be personally liable by reason of any contract or other instrument executed by such members or on such members behalf in their capacity as the administrator of the Plan nor for any mistake of judgment made in good faith, and the Company shall indemnify and hold harmless, directly from its own assets (including the proceeds of any insurance policy the premiums of which are paid from the Company s own assets), the Committee and each other officer, employee, or director of the Company or an affiliate to whom any duty or power relating to the administration or interpretation of the Plan is delegated against any cost or expense (including counsel fees) or liability (including any sum paid in settlement of a claim with the approval of the Company) arising out of any act or omission to act in connection with the Plan unless arising out of such person s own fraud, willful misconduct or bad faith. 5.5 Service of Process. The Committee or such other person designated by the Committee shall be the agent for service of process under the Plan. ARTICLE 6 AMENDMENT OR TERMINATION OF THE PLAN 6.1 Right to Amend or Terminate the Plan . (a) Prior to a Change in Control, the Committee reserves the right at any time to amend or terminate the Plan, in whole or in part, and for any reason and without the consent of any Participant or other person. Following a Change in Control, the Plan may be amended or terminated only with the prior written consent of all Participants. 
 19 

(b) In no event shall an amendment or termination modify, reduce, or otherwise affect the Company s obligations under the Plan made before the amendment or termination, as such obligations are defined under the provisions of the Plan existing immediately before such amendment or termination. 6.2 Notice of Amendment or Termination. Notice of any amendment requiring notification under Section 6.1(b) hereof, or termination of the Plan, shall be given by the Committee to each Participant and any other person entitled to a benefit hereunder. 6.3 Payment Upon Plan Termination.

Accordingly, the Company may accelerate Deferred Payments hereunder in accordance with one of the following: (a) the termination of the Plan within twelve (12) months of a corporate dissolution taxed under Code Section 331 or with the approval of a bankruptcy court pursuant to 11 U.S.C. 503(b)(1)(A), as provided in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(j)(4)(ix)(A); (b) the termination of the Plan, provided that the termination does not occur proximate to a downturn in the financial health of the Company, if all arrangements that would be aggregated with the Plan under Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(c) are terminated, and no payments other than payments that would be payable under the terms of the Plan if the termination had not occurred are made within twelve (12) months of the Plan termination, and all payments are made within twenty-four (24) months of the Plan termination, and no new arrangement that would be aggregated with the Plan under Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(c) is adopted within three (3) years following the Plan termination, as provided in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-3(j)(4)(ix)(C); or (c) such other events and conditions as the IRS may prescribe in generally applicable published regulatory or other guidance under Code Section 409A. ARTICLE 7 GENERAL PROVISIONS AND LIMITATIONS 7.1 No Right to Continued Employment. Nothing contained in the Plan shall give any person the right to be retained in the employment of the Company or affect the right of the Company to dismiss any employee. The adoption and maintenance of the Plan shall not constitute a contract between the Company and an Executive or consideration for, or an inducement to or condition of, the employment of any Executive. 7.2 Payment on Behalf of Payee. If the Committee shall find that any person to whom any amount is payable under the Plan is unable to care for such person s affairs because of illness or accident, or is a minor, or had died, then any payment due such person or such person s estate (unless a prior claim therefor has been made by a duly appointed legal representative) may, if the Committee so elects, be paid to such person s spouse, a child, a relative, an institute maintaining or having custody of such person, or any other person deemed by the Committee to be a proper recipient on behalf of such person otherwise entitled to payment hereunder. Any such payment shall be a complete discharge of the liability of the Plan and the Company therefor. 7.3 Nonalienation. No interest, expectancy, benefit, payment, claim, or right of any Participant under the Plan shall be (a) subject in any manner to any claims of any creditor of the Participant or any other person; (b) subject to the debts, contracts, liabilities or torts of the Participant or any other person; or (c) subject to alienation by anticipation, sale, transfer, assignment, bankruptcy, pledge, attachment, charge or encumbrance of any kind. If any person shall attempt to take any action contrary to this Section, such action shall be null and void and of no effect, and the Committee and the Company shall disregard such action and shall not in any manner be bound thereby and shall suffer no liability on account of its disregard thereof. If a Participant or any successor in interest hereunder shall become bankrupt or attempt to anticipate, alienate, sell, assign, 
 20 

pledge, encumber, or charge any right hereunder, then such right or benefit shall, in the discretion of the Committee, cease and terminate, and in such event the Committee may hold or apply the same or any part thereof for the benefit of the Participant or the spouse, children, or other dependents of the Participant, or any of them, in such manner and in such amounts and proportions as the Committee may deem proper. 7.4 Missing Payee. If the Committee cannot ascertain the whereabouts of any person to whom a payment is due under the Plan, and if, after five (5) years from the date such payment is due, a notice of such payment due is mailed to the last known address of such person, as shown on the records of the Committee or the Company, and within three (3) months after such mailing, such person has not made written claim therefor, the Committee may direct that such payment and all remaining payments otherwise due to such person be canceled on the records of the Plan and the amount thereof forfeited, and upon such cancellation, the Company shall have no further liability therefor, except that, in the event such person later notifies the Committee of such person s whereabouts and requests the payment or payments due to such person under the Plan, the amounts otherwise due but unpaid as of the date payment would have been made shall be paid to such person without interest or earnings accruals due to late payment. 7.5 Required Information. Each Participant shall file with the Committee such pertinent information concerning himself or herself, or such other person as the Committee may specify, and no Participant or any successor in interest shall have any rights or be entitled to any benefits under the Plan unless such information is filed by or with respect to the Participant. 7.6 Binding Effect.

All payments provided under the Plan shall be paid from the general assets of the Company and no separate fund shall be established to secure payment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may establish a grantor trust to assist it in funding Plan obligations; provided , however , that such trust shall at all times remain located within the United States. Any payments made to a Participant or other person from any such trust shall relieve the Company from any further obligations under the Plan only to the extent of such payment. Nothing herein shall constitute the creation of a trust or other fiduciary relationship between the Company and any other person. 7.9 Notices . (a) General. Notices and all other communications contemplated by the Plan will be in writing and will be deemed to have been duly given when sent electronically or personally delivered, when mailed by U.S. registered or certified mail, return receipt requested and postage prepaid, or when delivered by a private courier service such as UPS, DHL or Federal Express that has tracking capability. In the case of a Participant, notices will be sent to the e-mail address or addressed to the Participant at the home address, in either case which the Participant most recently communicated to the Company in writing. In the case of the Company, electronic notices will be sent to the e-mail address of the Chief Executive Officer or the General Counsel and mailed notices will be addressed to its corporate headquarters, and all notices will be directed to the attention of its Chief Executive Officer or General Counsel. (b) Notice of Termination.

Such notice will indicate the specific termination provision under the Plan relied upon, will set forth in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances claimed to 
 21 

provide a basis for termination under the provision so indicated, and will specify the termination date. 7.10 No Duty to Mitigate. A Participant will not be required to mitigate the amount of any payment contemplated by the Plan, nor will any such payment be reduced by any earnings that the Participant may receive from any other source. 7.11 Severability. If any provision of this Plan shall be held illegal or invalid for any reason, said illegality or invalidity shall not affect the remaining provisions hereof; instead, each provision shall be fully severable, and the Plan shall be construed and enforced as if said illegal or invalid provision had never been included herein. 7.12 Entire Plan; Construction. This document and any written amendments hereto (including any resolutions of the Company, the Committee or the Board) contain all the terms and provisions of the Plan and shall constitute the entire Plan, any other alleged terms or provisions being of no effect. Unless otherwise indicated, all references to Articles, Sections, and subsections shall be to the Plan as set forth in this document.

The parties agree that this Agreement is necessary to safeguard against the unauthorized disclosure or use of the Company s confidential information and to preserve its goodwill and ongoing business value. THEREFORE, in consideration of Executive s employment by the Company and Executive s eligibility to participate in the TopBuild Corp. Executive Severance Plan (the Plan ), subject to the terms of the Plan, the Company s willingness to disclose certain confidential information to Executive, the mutual promises contained in this Agreement and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as follows: NON-DISCLOSURE 1. Confidential Information. Executive acknowledges that the Company has certain trade secrets and other confidential and proprietary information which it has acquired and developed, and will acquire and develop, at great effort and expense. Such information includes, without limitation, confidential information, whether in tangible or intangible form, regarding the Company s products, services, marketing strategies, business plans, operations, costs, current or prospective customer information (including customer lists, requirements, creditworthiness, preferences and similar matters), product concepts, designs, specifications, research and development efforts, technical data and know-how, sales information (including pricing and other terms and conditions of sale), financial information, internal procedures, techniques, forecasts, methods, trade information, software programs, project requirements, inventions, trademarks, trade names, and all other information which is not generally known to those outside the Company (collectively, Confidential Information ). Confidential Information does not include information that is or becomes available to the public other than as a result of disclosure by Executive. 2. Restricted Use of Confidential Information. In the course of Executive s employment, Executive will have access to and may help develop Confidential Information. Except as required in the performance of Executive s duties, Executive will not, either during Executive s employment or at any time thereafter, disclose any Confidential Information to others or use the Confidential Information for Executive s own benefit or for the benefit of others. All records, files, and documents relating to the Company s business shall remain the sole property of the Company and may not be copied without written permission. Upon the termination of Executive s employment, Executive agrees to promptly return all records, files, documents and other materials relating to the Company s business, whether in hard copy or electronic format. Executive shall not retain copies of such materials.

3. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to limit Executive s right to respond accurately and fully to any question, inquiry or request for information when required by legal process or from initiating communications directly with, or responding to any inquiry from, or providing testimony before, any self-regulatory organization or state or federal regulatory authority, regarding the Company, Executive s employment, or this Agreement. Executive is not required to contact the Company regarding the subject matter of any such communications before engaging in such communications. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 1833(b), Executive understands that the Executive will not be held criminally or civilly liable under any Federal or State trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret of the Company that (i) is made (A) in confidence to a Federal, State, or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or to his attorney and (B) solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; or (ii) is made in a complaint or other document that is filed under seal in a lawsuit or other proceeding. Executive understands that if Executive files a lawsuit for retaliation by the Company for reporting a suspected violation of law, Executive may disclose the trade secret to the Executive s attorney and use the trade secret information in the court proceeding if Executive (x) files any document containing the trade secret under seal, and (y) does not disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court order. Nothing in this Agreement, or any other agreement that Executive has with the Company, is intended to conflict with 18 U.S.C. 1833(b) or create liability for disclosures of trade secrets that are expressly allowed by such section. Further, nothing in this Agreement or any other agreement that Executive has with the Company shall prohibit or restrict Executive from making any voluntary disclosure of information or documents concerning possible violations of law to any governmental agency or legislative body, or any self-regulatory organization, in each case, without advance notice to the Company. NON-SOLICITATION AND NON-COMPETITION 4. Need for Covenants. Executive understands that the Company has spent and will continue to spend substantial amounts of time, money and effort to develop its business, Confidential Information, reputation, goodwill (both associated with its trade name and geographic area of business), and its customer, supplier and employee relationships. Executive further understands that Executive will benefit from those investments and efforts. Executive acknowledges that Executive s use of any such matters to compete against the Company in an unrestricted manner would be unfair and detrimental to the Company. Executive agrees that taking advantage of any of the above-identified investments of time, money or effort expended by the Company would unfairly place the Executive at a competitive advantage over Company. Executive further acknowledges the Company s need to protect its business interests by reasonably restricting Executive s ability to compete with the Company. Finally, Executive acknowledges that the Company would not employ, or continue to employ, Executive, or extend to Executive eligibility to participate in the Plan, without Executive s agreement to be bound by the provisions of this Agreement. 5.
