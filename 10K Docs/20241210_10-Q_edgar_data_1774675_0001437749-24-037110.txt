CAUTIONARY NOTES REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this Form 10-Q includes statements that are, or may be deemed to be, forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which are intended to be covered by the safe harbors created by those laws. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements include but are not limited to, statements that address activities, events or developments that we expect or anticipate may occur in the future, including such things as our outlook, our product development and planning, future capital expenditures, financial results, the impact of regulatory changes, our current and evolving business strategies, including with respect to acquisitions and dispositions, demand for our services, our competitive strengths, the benefits of new initiatives, growth of our business and operations, the effectiveness of our products, the outcome of litigation proceedings and claims, the state and future of skilling in the workplace, our ability to successfully implement our plans, strategies, objectives, expectations and intentions are forward-looking statements. Also, when we use words such as may , will , would , anticipate , believe , estimate , expect , intend , plan , project , forecast , seek , outlook , target , "goal , probably , or similar expressions, we are making forward-looking statements. Such statements are based upon the current beliefs and expectations of Skillsoft s management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. All forward-looking disclosure is speculative by its nature, and we caution you against unduly relying on these forward-looking statements. 
 
 Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those described under Part I - Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10 K (as amended) for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024 (the 2024 Form 10-K ). These factors should not be construed as exhaustive and should be read in conjunction with the other cautionary statements included in the Annual Report and in our other periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-Q represent our estimates only as of the date of this filing and should not be relied upon as representing our estimates as of any subsequent date. While we may elect to update these forward-looking statements in the future, we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so, whether to reflect actual results, changes in assumptions, changes in other factors affecting such forward-looking statements, or otherwise, except as required by law. 
 
 Although we believe that the assumptions underlying our forward-looking statements are reasonable, any of these assumptions, and therefore also the forward-looking statements based on these assumptions, could themselves prove to be inaccurate. Given the significant uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking statements included in this document, our inclusion of this information is not a representation or guarantee by us that our objectives and plans will be achieved. Annualized, pro forma, projected and estimated numbers are used for illustrative purposes only, are not forecasts and may not reflect actual results. 
 
 INDUSTRY AND MARKET DATA 
 
 Within this Form 10-Q, we reference information and statistics regarding market share, industry data and our market position. Certain of this information has been obtained from various independent third-party sources, including independent industry publications, news reports, reports by market research firms and other independent sources. We believe that these external sources and estimates are reliable but have not independently verified them. In addition, certain of this information and statistics are based on our own internal surveys and assessments, which are developed in good faith using reasonable estimates. These data are based on the most current information available to us and our estimates regarding market position or other industry statistics included in this document or otherwise discussed by us involve risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on various factors, including as set forth above.

Refer to Note 14 Long-Term Debt in our 2024 Form 10 -K for information regarding the Company's term loan and accounts receivable facility (prior to the amendment discussed below). 
 
 We also have access to up to million of borrowings under our accounts receivable facility. In November 2024, the accounts receivable facility was amended to, among other things, extend the maturity to the earlier of (i) November 26, 2029 or (ii) 90 days prior to the maturity of any corporate debt, reduce the fixed component of the interest rate to per annum from per annum, increase the highest advance rate from 5 to , reduce the minimum outstanding balance requirement from million to million, and allow for ad hoc borrowings and repayments. Based on seasonality of billings and the characteristics of accounts receivable, some of which are not eligible for advances, we are not always able to access the full million available capacity. The reserve balance associated with the accounts receivable facility was million on October 31, 2024 and is classified as restricted cash on the condensed consolidated balance sheet. The interest rate on borrowings outstanding under the accounts receivable facility was on October 31, 2024 . As of October 31, 2024 , million was drawn under the accounts receivable facility and is classified as a current liability on the balance sheet. 

shares of Class A common stock and shares of preferred stock, with a par value each, and shares of Class A common stock were issued, and shares were outstanding. As of October 31, 2024 , the Company had shares of preferred stock or Class C common stock outstanding. Except as required by law, holders of shares of Class C common stock are not entitled to vote any such shares. 
 
 Subject to applicable law, the Company may declare dividends to be paid ratably to holders of Class A common stock out of the Company s assets that are legally available to be distributed as dividends in the discretion of the Company s board of directors. Holders of Class C common stock are generally not entitled to dividends.

 Refer to Note 16 Shareholders Equity in our 2024 Form 10 -K, for information related to the equity and liability-classified warrants. 
 
 Share Repurchase Authorization 
 
 On July 10, 2024, the Company s board of directors authorized Skillsoft to repurchase up to million of its Class A common stock, with an objective to manage potential dilution from future vesting of employee equity grants. The share repurchase authorization will terminate on July 11, 2028 and does not obligate the Company to purchase any minimum number of shares of Common Stock, and the authorization may be suspended, modified, or discontinued at any time without prior notice. As of October 31, 2024 , Class A common stock had been repurchased under the share repurchase authorization.

shares were initially made available for issuance. The 2020 Plan includes an annual increase on January 1 each year beginning on January 1, 2022, in an amount equal to of the total number of shares of common stock outstanding on December 31 of the preceding calendar year. The Compensation Committee may act prior to January 1 of a given year to provide that there will be no January 1 increase for such year or that the increase for such year will be a lesser number of shares of common stock than provided for in the 2020 Plan. As of October 31, 2024 , a total of shares of common stock were available for issuance under the 2020 Plan. 
 
 In May 2024, Skillsoft adopted the Skillsoft Corp. 2024 Employment Inducement Incentive Award Plan (the Inducement Plan ). The Inducement Plan provides for the inducement grants of nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, other equity-based awards, and cash-based incentive awards to new hires, or individuals being rehired following a bona fide period of non-employment with the Company, in compliance with Section 303A.08 of the New York Stock Exchange Listed Company Manual. As of October 31, 2024 , a total of shares of common stock were available for issuance under the Inducement Plan. 
 
 Stock Options 
 
 Under the 2020 Plan, all employees are eligible to receive incentive share options, and all employees, directors and consultants are eligible to receive non-statutory share options. The options generally vest over four years and have a term of ten years. Vested options under the plan generally expire not later than days following termination of employment or service or twelve months following an optionee s death or disability. The fair value of stock options is determined on the grant date and amortized over the vesting period on a straight-line basis. 
 
 The following summarizes the stock option activity for the nine months ended October 31, 2024 : 

Granted 
 Exercised 
 Forfeited 
 Expired 
 Outstanding, October 31, 2024 
 
 Vested and exercisable, October 31, 2024 

The total unrecognized equity-based compensation costs related to the stock options was million based on the weighted average grant date fair value of the options, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of years. 

Time-Based Restricted Stock Units 
 
 Restricted stock units RSUs represent a right to receive share of the Company s common stock that is both non-transferable and forfeitable unless and until certain conditions are satisfied. Other than RSUs granted to our non-employee directors, which vest upon the earlier of the anniversary of the grant date and the Company s next annual meeting of stockholders, RSUs generally vest ratably over a three or four -year period, subject to continued employment through each anniversary. The fair value of RSUs is determined on the grant date and is amortized over the vesting period on a straight-line basis. 
 
 The following summarizes the time-based RSU activity for the nine months ended October 31, 2024 : 

Granted

The total unrecognized stock-based compensation costs related to time-based RSUs was million, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of years. 
 
 Market-Based Restricted Stock Units 
 
 Market-based restricted stock units MBRSUs vest over a three or four -year performance period, subject to continued employment through each anniversary and achievement of market conditions, specifically the Company s stock price and an objective relative total shareholder return. The fair value of MBRSUs that include vesting based on market conditions are estimated using the Monte Carlo valuation method. Compensation cost for these awards is recognized based on the grant date fair value which is recognized over the vesting period using the accelerated attribution method.

 Liability-Classified Market-Based Awards 
 
 In the third quarter of fiscal 2025, the Company granted market-based awards, intended to be settled in cash upon vesting. These awards are classified as liabilities and remeasured at fair value using a Monte Carlo simulation, weighted for the service period completed, at each reporting date. The market-based awards potentially vest over two -year to four -year service periods, subject to continued employment and from a market perspective the appreciation of the Company s share price.

 Interest Rate Swaps 
 
 On June 17, 2022, the Company entered into two fixed-rate interest rate swap agreements to change the Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR )-based component of the interest rate on a portion of the Company s variable rate debt to a fixed rate (the Interest Rate Swaps ). The Interest Rate Swaps have a combined notional value of million and a maturity date of June 5, 2027. The objective of the Interest Rate Swaps is to eliminate the variability of cash flows in interest payments on million of variable rate debt attributable to changes in benchmark one -month SOFR interest rates. The hedged risk is the exposure to changes in interest payments, attributable to fluctuations in benchmark SOFR interest rates over the interest rate swap term. The changes in cash flows of the interest rate swap are expected to offset changes in cash flows of the variable rate debt. The Interest Rate Swaps are not designated as a cash flow hedge and changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are recorded in earnings each period. For the three and nine months ended October 31, 2024 , the Company recognized a non-cash gain (loss) of million and million attributable to the Interest Rate Swaps, respectively. For the three and nine months ended October 31, 2023 , the Company recognized a non-cash gain (loss) of million and million attributable to the Interest Rate Swaps, respectively. 
 
 The inputs for determining fair value of the Interest Rate Swaps are classified as Level 2 inputs. Level 2 fair value is based on estimates using standard pricing models. These standard pricing models use inputs which are derived from or corroborated by observable market data such as interest rate yield curves, index forward curves, discount curves, and volatility surfaces. The counterparties to these derivative contracts are highly rated financial institutions which we believe carry only a minimal risk of nonperformance. 
 
 Depending on whether the Interest Rate Swaps are in an asset or liability position as of the end of a reporting period, they are included in either the captions Other assets or Other long-term liabilities on the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
 
 Liability-Classified Market-Based Awards 
 
 The fair value of the liability-classified market-based awards are determined using a Monte Carlo simulation, weighted for the service period completed, at each reporting date. The most significant inputs for determining the fair value either originate from the grant agreement (e.g., stock price hurdles, vesting amounts, and service dates) or are derived from or corroborated by observable market data (e.g., interest rates, stock prices, equity risk, market betas, size premiums, average stock volatility); therefore we have classified the fair value measurement as Level 2. Refer to Note 9 "Stock-Based Compensation" above for additional information related to the liability-classified market-based awards. 
 
 Other Fair Value Instruments 
 
 The Company currently invests excess cash balances primarily in money market funds invested in United States Treasury securities and United States Treasury securities repurchase agreements, as well as cash deposits held at major banks. The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, trade payables and accrued liabilities, as reported on the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of October 31, 2024 , approximate their fair value because of the short maturity of those instruments. 
 
 Our long-term debt is a financial instrument, and the fair value of the Company s outstanding principal as of October 31, 2024 was million. This fair value is determined based on inputs that are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.

Subscription and Non-Subscription Revenue 
 
 Software as a service SaaS Subscription Revenue. Represents revenue generated from contracts specifying a minimum fixed fee for services delivered over the life of the contract. The initial term of enterprise contracts is generally one to three years and is usually non-cancellable for the term of the subscription. The fixed fee is commonly paid upfront on an annual basis. These contracts typically consist of subscriptions to our various offerings which provide access to our SaaS and coaching platforms, associated content and services, over the contract term. 
 
 Non-Subscription Revenue. Primarily comprised of i nstructor-led training offerings, which consist of both in-person and virtual environments. Instructor-led training, including virtual offerings, are first scheduled, then delivered later, with revenue realized on the delivery date. Non-subscription revenues also include professional services related to implementation of our products and subsequent, ongoing consulting engagements. Our non-subscription services complement our subscription business in creating strong and comprehensive customer relationships.

The total decline in revenues, when comparing the three and nine months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023, in our Global Knowledge segment was primarily due to weaker market demand, as well as a higher mix of reseller business, which is recorded in revenue net of fees. For Talent Development Solutions, when comparing the three months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023, revenues increased due to our efforts to capitalize on the market shift from learning and skills to talent development, which we discussed at the Company's July 11, 2024 Investor Day. When comparing the nine months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023, the slight reduction in our Talent Development Solutions segment total revenues was primarily the result of actions taken by us to focus on the more profitable parts of this market, mostly offset by capitalizing on the aforementioned market shift to achieve revenue growth. 
 
 Operating Expenses 
 
 For the corporate level operating expenses that we can directly attribute to our two segments, such costs are allocated accordingly between Talent Development Solutions and Global Knowledge. However, in other cases, these corporate level operating expenses are reported in the Talent Development Solutions segment. 
 
 On July 11, 2024, the Company announced a comprehensive resource reallocation plan expected to result in more than 45 million of annualized cost savings, of which we intend to reinvest up to half in strategic growth initiatives.

The decreases in courseware, instructor fees and outside services and compensation and benefits, when comparing the three and nine months ended October 31, 2024 to the same periods in 2023, were primarily attributable to the comprehensive resource reallocation plan discussed above and the decline in our Global Knowledge segment revenues as discussed in Subscription and Non-Subscription Revenue above. The decrease in facilities and utilities expenses, when comparing the three and nine months ended October 31, 2024 to the same period in 2023, was primarily attributable to cost savings from consolidation of our facilities. These decreases were partially offset by the increase in hosting and software maintenance, which were primarily due to investments in technology. 
 
 Content and software development 
 
 Content and software development expenses include costs associated with the development of new products and the enhancement of existing products, consisting primarily of employee salaries and benefits; development-related professional services; facilities costs; depreciation; and software maintenance costs.

The decreases in compensation and benefits and consulting and outside services, when comparing the nine months ended October 31, 2024 to the same periods in 2023, were primarily attributable to the comprehensive resource reallocation plan discussed above and lower stock-compensation expense due to forfeitures and lower grants of share-based payment awards. T he decrease in facilities and utilities expenses, when comparing these same periods, was primarily attributable to cost savings from consolidation of our facilities. These decreases were partially offset by the increase in software maintenance, which were primarily due to investments in technology.

The decreases in compensation and benefits, when comparing the three and nine months ended October 31, 2024 to the same periods in 2023, were primarily attributable to the comprehensive resource reallocation plan discussed above, partially offset by the result of an S M executive's forfeiture of a share-based payment award that lowered stock-compensation expense during the nine months ended October 31, 2023. The decreases in advertising and promotions and consulting and outside services, when comparing the three and nine months ended October 31, 2024 to the same periods in 2023, were primarily attributable to proactive reductions in branding initiatives and paid media spend. The decrease in facilities and utilities expenses, when comparing the three and nine months ended October 31, 2024 to the same periods in 2023, were primarily attributable to cost savings from consolidation of our facilities. These decreases were partially offset by the increase in software maintenance, which was primarily the result of investments in our go-to-market transformation activities and enablement programs.

The decreases in compensation and benefits, when comparing the three and nine months ended October 31, 2024 to the same periods in 2023, were primarily attributable to the comprehensive resource reallocation plan discussed above and lower stock-compensation expense due to forfeitures and lower grants of share-based payment awards. These decreases, when comparing the nine months ended October 31, 2024 to the same period in 2023, was partially offset by severance costs for the former Chief Executive Officer whose employment with the Company ended on May 9, 2024. T he Company's integration and restructuring activities, including cost savings from consolidation of our facilities and lower insurance, also contributed to the overall decline in G A expenses. When comparing the nine months ended October 31, 2024 to the same period in 2023, the reduction in consulting and outside services was partially captured by an increase to compensation and benefits expense, even though compensation and benefits expense declined in total as discussed above. Further, the i ncreases in software maintenance, when comparing the three and nine months ended October 31, 2024 to the same periods in 2023, primarily reflect i nvestments in technology. 
 
 Amortization of intangible assets 
 
 Intangible assets arising from business combinations are developed technology, customer-related intangibles, trade names and other identifiable intangible assets with finite lives. These intangible assets are amortized over the estimated useful lives of such assets. We also capitalize certain internal use software development costs related to our SaaS platform incurred during the application development stage. The internal use software is amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life. 
 
 The decrease in amortization of intangible assets, when comparing the three and nine months ended October 31, 2024 to the same periods in 2023 , was primarily due to certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized or written down as a result of impairment during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. 
 
 Acquisition and integration related costs 
 
 Acquisition and integration related costs consist of professional fees for legal, investment banking and other advisor costs incurred in connection with the business combinations completed in April 2022 and June 2021 and the subsequent integration related activities. The changes in acquisition and integration related costs were primarily due to the timing of these aforementioned activities. 
 
 Restructuring 
 
 As discussed above, on July 11, 2024, the Company announced a comprehensive resource reallocation plan. In connection with this plan and the acquisition integration process and our workplace flexibility policy, we continued our initiatives and commitment to reduce our costs and better align operating expenses with existing economic conditions and our operating model to improve operating efficiency, competitiveness and business profitability. These included workforce reductions and consolidation of facilities as we adopted new work arrangements for certain locations. The restructuring charges for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2024 totaling 3.1 million and 15.4 million, respectively, are substantially all related to severance costs of terminated employees and lease termination and lease impairment charges. The restructuring charges for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2023 totaling 0.9 m illion and 8.6 million, respectively, were substantially all related to severance costs of terminated employees and lease termination and lease impairment charges.

The other income (expense), net was primarily the foreign exchange gains and losses (specifically, resulting from foreign currency denominated transactions and the revaluation of foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities), which fluctuates as the U.S. dollar appreciates or depreciates against other currencies. Interest income for the nine months ended October 31, 2024 compared to the corresponding prior year period, increased primarily due to the use of money market investments to realize increased returns on cash balances. The decrease in interest expense, when comparing the three and nine months ended October 31, 2024 to the corresponding periods in 2023, was primarily due to the decision to reduce the borrowings under the accounts receivable facility during the three months ended October 31, 2024. As a result of the interest rate swaps we executed on June 17, 2022, we have a fixed cash interest rate of 8.94 on 300 million of our outstanding term loans. 
 
 Fair value adjustment of warrants 
 
 The gains attributable to warrants are primarily a result of the Company's underlying common stock performance during the three and nine months ended October 31, 2023. As of January 31, 2024, the fair value of our liability-classified warrants was insignificant, however prior to then they were marked-to-market at each balance sheet date, with gains and losses being recorded in current period earnings.

Table of Contents 

Fair value adjustment of interest rate swaps 
 
 We entered into two fixed-rate interest rate swap agreements on June 17, 2022 for a combined notional amount of 300 million and a maturity date of June 5, 2027. The objective of the interest rate swaps is to eliminate fluctuations in cash flows for interest payments on 300 million of variable rate debt attributable to changes in benchmark one-month Secured Overnight Financing Rate SOFR interest rates. The interest rate swaps are not designated for hedge accounting and are carried on the statement of financial position at their fair value. Unrealized gains and losses from changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps, which arise from variations in the forward-looking yield curve, are included in the income statement as they occur. 
 
 The gains (losses) reflected for the change in value of the interest rate swaps are primarily attributable to increases (decreases) in the expectation for one-month SOFR interest rates through June 5, 2027, during the nine months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023. 
 
 Gain on sale of business 
 
 On June 12, 2022, we entered into the Purchase Agreement to sell our SumTotal business to a third party for 200 million in cash, subject to adjustments set forth in the Purchase Agreement. The sale was completed on August 15, 2022. Net proceeds from the sale were 174.9 million, after final working capital adjustments in April 2023. In accordance with ASC 810, Consolidation ASC 810 ), we recorded a gain on sale upon completion of the transaction. The 55.9 million gain, including a loss of 0.7 million recognized in the first quarter of fiscal 2024, was calculated by measuring the difference between the fair value of consideration received less the carrying amount of assets and liabilities sold.

The effective income tax rate for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2024 and 2023 differed from the United States federal statutory rate of 21.0 due primarily to the impact of non-deductible items, foreign rate differential, changes in uncertain tax positions, and changes in the valuation allowance on the Company s deferred tax assets. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Liquidity and sources of cash 

As of October 31, 2024, we had 97.9 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand. Our investment policy is approved by the Board of Directors and reviewed annually by the Audit Committee. Our current investment policy s primary objectives when investing excess cash are, in order of importance: (1) preservation of capital and protection of principal; (2) maintenance of liquidity that is sufficient to meet cash flow needs; and (3) maximize rate of return. Pursuant to this policy, as of October 31, 2024, most of our cash and cash equivalents were held at large financial institutions with high rating agency designations and our exposure to regional banks was not significant. We have funded operations primarily through the use of cash collected from our customers and the proceeds received from the Term Loan Facility, supplemented with borrowings under our accounts receivable facility. Our cash requirements vary depending on factors such as the growth of the business, changes in working capital and capital expenditures. We expect to operate the business and execute our strategic initiatives principally with funds generated from operations and supplemented by borrowings up to a maximum of 75.0 million under our accounts receivable facility. We anticipate that we will have sufficient internal and external sources of liquidity to fund operations and anticipated working capital and other expected cash needs for at least the next twelve months, as well as for the foreseeable future with capital sources currently available. 

Term Loan 

On July 16, 2021, Skillsoft Finance II, Inc. Skillsoft Finance II ), a subsidiary of Skillsoft Corp., entered into a Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement ), by and among Skillsoft Finance II, as borrower, Skillsoft Finance I, Inc. Holdings ), the lenders party thereto and Citibank, N.A., as administrative agent and collateral agent, pursuant to which the lenders provided a 480 million term loan facility (the Term Loan Facility ). The Term Loan Facility is scheduled to mature on July 16, 2028.

In connection with the closing of the Codecademy acquisition, Skillsoft Finance II entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Credit Agreement, dated as of April 4, 2022 (the First Amendment ), among Skillsoft Finance II, Holdings, certain subsidiaries of Skillsoft Finance II, as guarantors, Citibank N.A., as administrative agent, and the financial institutions party thereto as Term B-1 Lenders, which amended the Credit Agreement (as amended by the First Amendment, the Amended Credit Agreement ).

The First Amendment provided for the incurrence of up to 160 million of Term B-1 Loans (the Term B-1 Loans under the Amended Credit Agreement. In addition, the First Amendment, among other things, (a) provided for early opt-in to SOFR subject to a 0.75 floor, for the existing term loans under the Credit Agreement (such existing term loans together with the Term B-1 Loans, the Initial Term Loans and (b) provided for the applicable margin for the Initial Term Loans at 4.25 with respect to base rate borrowings and 5.25 with respect to SOFR borrowings. 

Prior to the maturity thereof, the Initial Term Loans are subject to quarterly amortization payments of 1.6 million.

Accounts Receivable Facility 

We also have access to up to 75.0 million of borrowings under our accounts receivable facility. In November 2024, the accounts receivable facility was amended to, among other things, extend the maturity to the earlier of (i) November 26, 2029 or (ii) 90 days prior to the maturity of any corporate debt, reduce the fixed component of the interest rate to 2.61 per annum from 3.11 per annum, increase the highest advance rate from 85 to 90 , reduce the minimum outstanding balance requirement from 10 million to 1 million, and allow for ad hoc borrowings and repayments. Based on seasonality of billings and the characteristics of accounts receivable, some of which are not eligible for advances, we are not always able to access the full 75.0 million available capacity. As of October 31, 2024, 10.0 million was drawn under our accounts receivable facility.

Share Repurchase Authorization 
 
 On July 10, 2024, the Board of Directors authorized and approved a share repurchase authorization for up to 10 million of the Company s outstanding shares of Class A common stock. The share repurchase authorization commenced on July 11, 2024, and will terminate on the fourth anniversary of such date. Under the share repurchase authorization, we may purchase shares of Class A common stock in the open market, in private negotiated transactions, or by other means from time to time. We cannot predict when or if we will repurchase any shares of Class A common stock. The timing and number of shares of Class A common stock that may be purchased will depend on a variety of factors, including the share price of the Class A common stock, general market conditions, alternative uses for capital, our financial performance, and other considerations. This authorization does not obligate us to purchase any minimum number of shares of Class A common stock, and the authorization may be suspended, modified, or discontinued at any time without prior notice. As of October 31, 2024, no Class A common stock had been repurchased under the share repurchase authorization.

Cash flows from operating activities 
 
 Th e increase in cash flows from operating activities in the nine months ended October 31, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 , was primarily attributable to the comprehensive resource reallocation plan discussed above and the result of the timing of working capital settlements. 
 
 Cash flows from investing activities 
 
 Cash flows from investing activities in the nine months ended October 31, 2024 include 13.0 million of cash payments for internally developed software. 
 
 Cash flows from investing activities for the nine months ended October 31, 2023 include 8.1 million of cash payments for internally developed software and net cash transferred of 5.1 million related to the completion of the SumTotal sale. 
 
 Our purchases of property and equipment largely consist of computer hardware and software, as well as capitalized software development costs, to support content and software development activities. 
 
 The decrease in cash flows used in investing activities was primarily due to the purchase of property and equipment and the sale of our former SumTotal business during the nine months ended October 31, 2023, partially offset by our increased investment in internally developed software during the nine months ended October 31, 2024. 
 
 Cash flows from financing activities 
 
 Cash flows from financing activities consist primarily of borrowings and repayments under our debt facilities and our accounts receivable facility, and payments for share repurchases. 
 
 The increase in cash flows used in financing activities was primarily due to payments on our accounts receivable facility during the nine months ended October 31, 2024, partially offset by the acquisition of treasury stock during the nine months ended October 31, 2023.

Contingencies 
 
 From time to time, we are a party to or may be threatened with litigation in the ordinary course of our business. We regularly analyze then current information, including, as applicable, our defense and insurance coverage and, as necessary, provide accruals for probable and estimable liabilities for the eventual disposition of these matters. For information regarding legal proceedings see Note 6 - Leases, Commitments and Contingencies . 
 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 Our condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America GAAP ). The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We regularly reevaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to the following: business combinations, revenue recognition, impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, income tax assets and liabilities, and restructuring charges and accruals. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the amounts of revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, or results of operations could be impacted. 
 
 We believe the following critical accounting estimates most significantly affect the portrayal of our financial condition and involve our most difficult and subjective estimates and judgments. 
 
 Revenue recognition 
 
 The Company enters into contracts that provide customers access to a broad spectrum of learning options including cloud-based learning content, talent management solutions, virtual, on-demand and classroom training, and individualized coaching. The Company recognizes revenue that reflects the consideration that we expect to be entitled to receive in exchange for these services. We apply judgment in determining our customer s ability and intent to pay, which is based on a variety of factors, including the customer s historical payment experience, credit, or financial information. The Company is not required to exercise significant judgment in determining the timing for the satisfaction of performance obligations or the transaction price. 

24

Table of Contents 

The Company s cloud-based solutions generally do not provide customers with the right to take possession of the software supporting the platform or to download course content without continuing to incur fees for hosting services and, as a result, are accounted for as service arrangements. Access to the platform and course content represents a series of distinct services as the Company continually provides access to, and fulfills its obligation to, the end customer over the subscription term. The series of distinct services represents a single performance obligation that is satisfied over time. Accordingly, the fixed consideration related to subscription revenue is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the contract term, beginning on the date the service is made available to the customer. The Company s subscription contracts typically vary from one year to three years. The Company s cloud-based solutions arrangements are generally non-cancellable and non-refundable. 
 
 Revenue from virtual, on-demand and classroom training, and individualized coaching is recognized in the period in which the services are rendered. The Company also sells professional services related to its cloud solutions which are typically considered distinct performance obligations and are recognized over time as services are performed. For fixed-price contracts, revenue is recognized over time based on a measure of progress that reasonably reflects our advancement toward satisfying the performance obligation. 
 
 While the majority of the Company s revenue relates to SaaS subscription services where the entire arrangement fee is recognized on a ratable basis over the contractual term, the Company sometimes enters into contractual arrangements that have multiple distinct performance obligations, one or more of which have different periods over which the services or products are delivered. These arrangements may include a combination of subscriptions and non-subscription products such as professional services. The Company allocates the transaction price of the arrangement based on the relative estimated standalone selling price of each distinct performance obligation. 
 
 Reimbursements received from customers for out-of-pocket expenses are recorded as revenues, with related costs recorded as cost of revenues. The Company presents revenues net of any taxes collected from customers and remitted to government authorities. 
 
 As the Company s contractual agreements predominantly call for advanced billing, contract assets are rarely generated. 
 
 Intangible assets, including goodwill 
 
 We recognize the excess of the purchase price, plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interest in an acquiree, over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired, which includes the fair value of specifically identifiable intangible assets, as goodwill. 
 
 The Company amortizes its finite-lived intangible assets, including customer contracts and internally developed software, over their estimated useful life. The Company reviews the carrying values of intangible assets subject to amortization at least annually to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in remaining useful life. Conditions that would indicate impairment and trigger a more frequent impairment assessment include, but are not limited to, a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate that could affect the value of an asset, or an adverse action or assessment by a regulator. 
 
 In addition, the Company reviews the carrying values of its indefinite-lived intangible assets, including goodwill and certain trademarks, during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year for impairment, or more frequently if certain indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist and reassesses their classification as indefinite-lived assets. 
 
 If current discount rates rise or if relevant market-based inputs for our impairment assessment worsen, subsequent reviews of goodwill and intangibles could result in impairment. Factors that could result in an impairment include, but are not limited to, the following: 

Prolonged period of our estimated fair value of our reporting units exceeding our market capitalization; 

Lower expectations for future profitability of bookings or EBITDA, which in part, could be impacted by legislative, regulatory or tax changes that affect the cost of, or demand for, products and services as well as the loss of key personnel; 

Deterioration in key assumptions used in our income approach estimates of fair value, such as higher discount rates from higher stock market volatility; and 

Valuations of significant mergers or acquisitions of companies that provide relevant market-based inputs for our impairment assessment that could support less favorable conclusions regarding the estimated fair value of our reporting units. 

Income taxes 
 
 We provide for deferred income taxes resulting from temporary differences between the basis of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes as compared to tax purposes, using rates expected to be in effect when such differences reverse. We record valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. 
 
 We follow the authoritative guidance on accounting for and disclosure of uncertainty in tax positions which requires us to determine whether a tax position of the Company is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals of litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. For tax positions meeting the more likely than not threshold, the tax amount recognized in the financial statements is reduced to the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon the ultimate settlement with the relevant taxing authority. Interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are included in the provision for income taxes in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.

 Our recently issued accounting pronouncements are set forth in Note 2 to our condensed consolidated financial statements.

 We have exposures to market risks in the ordinary course of our business, including the effects of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations. Information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about these market risks is described below. 
 
 Interest Rate Risk 
 
 Interest rate risk is the risk of financial loss due to adverse changes in the value of assets and liabilities due to movements in interest rates. We are exposed to interest rate risk arising from our interest sensitive long-term debt and accounts receivable facility and to a lesser extent our cash and cash equivalents. 
 
 Based on the balance of our long-term debt and accounts receivable facility and taking into account the two interest rate swap agreements discussed below, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in approximately 3.0 million additional or lower pre-tax interest expense on an annualized basis, respectively. To manage our exposure to interest rate risk on our long-term debt, we entered into two fixed-rate interest rate swap agreements to change the SOFR-based component of the interest rate on 300.0 million of variable rate debt to a fixed rate. For further information regarding our long-term debt and interest rate swap agreements, see Note 7 and Note 11, respectively, to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 
 Based on the balance of our cash and cash equivalents, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an approximate ly 0 .5 m illion increase or decrease, respectively, on our interest income on an annualized basis. 
 
 Our interest rate swaps are not designated for hedge accounting and are carried on the statement of financial position at their fair value. Unrealized gains and losses from changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps are included in the statement of operations as they occur. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in an approximately 7.0 mill ion increase or decrease, respectively, on our fair value adjustment of interest rate swaps at a point in time. 
 
 Foreign Currency Risk 
 
 Our reporting currency and the functional currency of our wholly owned foreign subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may cause us to recognize transaction gains and losses in the caption Other income (expense), net in our condensed consolidated statement of operations. The Company is exposed to foreign currency fluctuations, including the Euro, pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Australian dollar, Indian rupee, Singapore dollar and related currencies. To date, we have not entered into any hedging arrangements with respect to foreign currency risk or other derivative financial instruments, although we may choose to do so in the future. A hypothetical 10 increase or decrease in current exchange rates would have resulted in an impact of approximate ly 3.0 mi llion on our pre-tax income (loss) on an annualized basis. 
 
 ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 
 Management performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of October 31, 2024. The evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer CEO and Chief Financial Officer CFO ), as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). 
 
 Based on this evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of October 31, 2024. 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
 
 As of January 31, 2025, the Company will no longer qualify as an emerging growth company and will be subject to the provisions of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for our fiscal year ending January 31, 2025. In connection with our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending January 31, 2025, our independent registered public accounting firm will formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. During fiscal 2025 we will continue to execute the enhanced review and testing across all key controls. 
 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rules 13a-15(d) and 15d 15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the three and nine months ended October 31, 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls 
 
 Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that it will prevent or detect all misstatements, due to error or fraud, from occurring in the condensed consolidated financial statements. Additionally, management is required to use judgment in evaluating controls and procedures.
