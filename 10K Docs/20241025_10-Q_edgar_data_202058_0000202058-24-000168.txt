This automatic tax accounting method change resulted in an increase to income taxes receivable and an offsetting increase in our deferred income taxes.

 million which was included in the Other current liabilities line item in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. Since the completion of the acquisition of AJRD, we have undertaken significant operational efforts to further understand the root cause of identified preexisting manufacturing and supply chain challenges resulting in delivery delays, primarily related to certain Missile Solutions programs. We have identified operational activities necessary to remedy these challenges and inefficiencies and the incremental costs required as compared to its initial estimates and actual costs incurred. The incremental forward loss provisions relate to the increased cost estimates of labor and material to remedy the underlying preexisting technical and supply chain challenges. These cost increases impacted both cost-plus and fixed-price contracts in proportions that are consistent with the ratio of the overall AJRD revenue by contract type. The forward loss provisions will be recognized as a reduction to cost of sales as we incur actual costs associated with these estimates in satisfying the associated performance obligations. There will be no net impact on our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations. We recognized million and million of amortization related to the forward loss provision in the quarter and three quarters ended September 27, 2024, respectively. 
 Off-market Customer Contracts. We have identified certain customer contractual obligations as of the acquisition date with economic returns that are higher or lower than could be realized in market transactions and have recorded assets or liabilities for the acquisition date fair value of the off-market components. The acquisition date fair value of the off-market components is a net liability of million, consisting of million and million included in the Other current liabilities and Other long-term liabilities line items in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet, respectively, and excludes any amounts already recognized in forward loss provisions (see discussion in the preceding paragraph). Additional provisions to off-market customer contracts relate to labor and material cost increases primarily associated with supply chain and manufacturing challenges and inefficiencies. These cost increases impacted both cost-plus and fixed-price contracts in proportions that are consistent with the ratio of the overall AJRD revenue by contract type. We measured the fair value of these components as the amount by which the terms of the contract with the customer deviates from the terms that a market participant could have achieved at the acquisition date. The off-market components of these contracts will be recognized as an increase to revenue as we incur costs to satisfy the associated performance obligations. We recognized million and million of amortization related to off-market contract liabilities in the quarter and three quarters ended September 27, 2024, respectively. 
 Goodwill. The million of goodwill recognized is attributable to AJRD s market presence as one of the two primary providers of advanced propulsion and power systems for nearly every major U.S. government space and missile program, the assembled workforce and established operating infrastructure. The acquired goodwill is not tax deductible. See Note E: Goodwill and Intangible Assets in these Notes for further information.

As of September 27, 2024, the fair value less remaining estimated costs to sell of the CAS Disposal Group was million, inclusive of consideration related to noncontrolling interest and accumulated other comprehensive income. Income before income taxes attributable to L3Harris Technologies, Inc. for the quarter and three quarters ended September 27, 2024 was million and million, respectively, and for the quarter and three quarters ended September 29, 2023 was million and million, respectively. The CAS Disposal Group, which is part of our IMS segment, provides integrated aircraft avionics, pilot training and data analytics services for the commercial aviation industry. The transaction is expected to close in fiscal 2024. 
 In connection with the preparation of our financial statements for fiscal 2023, we concluded that goodwill related to the CAS Disposal Group was impaired and we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of million,

During the quarter ended June 28, 2024, million of goodwill was assigned to the Antenna Disposal Group on a relative fair value basis. In connection with the preparation of our financial statements for the quarter ended June 28, 2024, we tested goodwill assigned to the Antenna Disposal Group and goodwill assigned to the retained businesses of the SAS reporting unit for impairment and concluded that goodwill related to the Antenna Disposal Group was impaired. As a result, we recorded a non-cash charge for impairment of million included in the General and administrative expenses line item in our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations for the three quarters ended September 27, 2024. 
 In connection with the sale, we recognized a pre-tax loss of million included in the General and administrative expenses line item in our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations for the three quarters ended September 27, 2024. The operating results of the Antenna Disposal Group were reported in our SAS segment through the date of divestiture.

After selling costs and purchase price adjustments, the net cash proceeds for the sale of VIS were million. The operating results of VIS were reported in the SAS segment through the date of divestiture. 
 Fair Value of Businesses 
 For purposes of allocating goodwill to the disposal groups that represent a portion of a reporting unit, we determine the fair value of each disposal group based on the respective negotiated selling price, and the fair value of the retained businesses of the respective reporting unit based on a combination of market-based and income-based valuation techniques, utilizing quoted market prices, comparable publicly reported transactions and projected discounted cash flows. These fair value determinations are categorized as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy due to their use of internal projections and unobservable measurement inputs. See Note K: Fair Value Measurements in these Notes for additional information.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
 To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of L3Harris Technologies, Inc. 
 Results of Review of Interim Financial Statements 
 We have reviewed the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet of L3Harris Technologies, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of September 27, 2024, the related condensed consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, and equity for the quarter and three quarters ended September 27, 2024 and September 29, 2023, the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the three quarters ended September 27, 2024 and September 29, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the condensed consolidated interim financial statements ). Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the condensed consolidated interim financial statements for them to be in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. 
 We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) PCAOB ), the consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of December 29, 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows and equity for the year then ended, and the related notes (not presented herein); and in our report dated February 16, 2024, we expressed an unqualified audit opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 29, 2023, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived. 
 Basis for Review Results 
 These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and the PCAOB. We conducted our review in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. A review of interim financial statements consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
 
 The following Management s Discussion and Analysis MD A is intended to assist in an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations. This MD A is provided as a supplement to, should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes. In addition, reference should be made to our audited Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements and Part II. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Fiscal 2023 Form 10-K. Except for the historical information contained herein, the discussions in this MD A contain forward-looking statements. 
 OVERVIEW 
 We are the Trusted Disruptor in the defense industry. With customers mission-critical needs always in mind, we deliver end-to-end technology solutions connecting the space, air, land, sea and cyber domains in the interest of national security. We support government customers in more than 100 countries, with our largest customers being various departments and agencies of the U.S. Government, their prime contractors and international allies. Our products and services have defense and civil government applications, as well as commercial applications. 
 U.S. and International Budget Environment 
 The percentage of our revenue that was derived from sales to U.S. Government customers, including foreign military sales funded through the U.S. Government, whether directly or through prime contractors, was 77 for the three quarters ended September 27, 2024. 
 On March 9, 2024, the President signed the first tranche of U.S. Government fiscal year GFY 2024 appropriations funding bills into law, which funded six government agencies, including funding for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the Federal Aviation Administration, through the remainder of GFY 2024 which ended on September 30, 2024. A second funding bill, signed into law on March 23, 2024, funded all remaining agencies, including the U.S. Department of Defense DoD ), through the remainder of GFY 2024. The bill provides approximately 844 billion in funding for DoD. This was in line with our expectations for 3 growth for defense over GFY 2023 levels and in line with the first year of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 FRA caps. 
 On March 11, 2024, the President s Budget Request PBR for GFY 2025 was released. The DoD requested 850 billion, a 1 topline increase consistent with the FRA caps. 
 On April 24, 2024, the President signed into law a supplemental GFY 2024 appropriations package that includes 67 billion in funding for key DoD programs, bringing the DoD funding for GFY 2024 to 911 billion. 
 Congress has not yet reached a final agreement on GFY2025 funding. A short-term Continuing Resolution CR was enacted on September 26, 2024 that will fund the U.S. Government until December 20, 2024. 
 While operating under a CR, government agencies are allocated a portion of GFY 2024 enacted funds, and DoD is prohibited from starting new programs. The 2024 election cycle complicates the budget outlook. The outcome of the election in November will determine which political party has the majority in the House and Senate, which has implications, including potential delays in Congress ability to complete GFY 2025 appropriations bills during the lame duck session, making another CR highly likely. If Congress does not enact all 12 GFY 2025 appropriations bills by April 30, 2025, a 1 automatic sequestration cut will go into effect as mandated by the FRA. 
 Further complicating the budget outlook is the need to raise the debt ceiling in 2025. Congressional inaction may lead to a default and potentially create economic instability. 
 The overall defense spending environment, both in the U.S. and internationally, reflects the continued impacts of global conflicts and geopolitical tensions, and changes to U.S. Government or international spending priorities have and could in the future impact our business. 
 See our U.S. Government funding risks and the discussion of our international business risks within Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Fiscal 2023 Form 10-K. 
 _____________________________________________________________________

Economic Environment 
 The macroeconomic environment continues to evolve, which has impacted our business and may continue to impact our future results. The ongoing uncertainty related to the impacts of inflation, as well as the interest rate environment and ongoing federal deficits, which raises the cost of borrowing for the federal government, could in the future impact U.S. Government spending priorities for our products. For a discussion of inflation-related risks, see Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Fiscal 2023 Form 10-K.

 Quarter Ended Comparison. Revenue increased 8 for the quarter ended September 27, 2024 compared with the quarter ended September 29, 2023 primarily due to higher revenue of 141 million in our AR segment from a full quarter of revenue, rather than a partial quarter of revenue for the quarter ended September 29, 2023 following the July 28, 2023 acquisition of AJRD the AR Partial Quarter and higher revenues of 127 million and 103 million in our CS and IMS segments, respectively. 
 Gross margin increased, largely due to the increase in revenue, while gross margin as a percentage of revenue remained flat for the quarter ended September 27, 2024 compared with the quarter ended September 29, 2023. 
 Three Quarters Ended Comparison. Revenue increased 12 for the three quarters ended September 27, 2024 compared with the three quarters ended September 29, 2023 primarily due to higher revenue of 1,264 million in our AR segment from the acquisition of AJRD, in addition to higher revenues of 315 million, 85 million and 66 million in our CS, SAS and IMS segments, respectively. 
 Gross margin increased, largely due to the increase in revenue, while gross margin as a percentage of revenue remained relatively flat for the three quarters ended September 27, 2024 compared with the three quarters ended September 29, 2023.

 _______________ 
 (1) Costs associated with transforming multiple functions, systems and processes to increase agility and competitiveness, including third-party consulting, workforce optimization and incremental information technology IT expenses for implementation of new systems. For more detail on our LHX NeXt initiative and implementation costs, see Note N: Restructuring and Other Exit Costs in the Notes and the Operating Environment, Strategic Priorities and Key Performance Measures section in the MD A in our Fiscal 2023 Form 10-K. 
 (2) See Note O: Acquisitions and Divestitures in the Notes. 
 (3) Includes other segment G A expenses such as payroll and benefits, outside services, facilities, insurance and other expenses and unallocated corporate expenses including a portion of management and administration, legal, environmental, compensation, retiree benefits and includes other corporate G A expenses and eliminations. 
 Quarter Ended Comparison. G A expenses increased 96 million for the quarter ended September 27, 2024 compared with the quarter ended September 29, 2023 primarily due an 80 million increase in other G A expenses, driven by a 26 million change in the fair value of our deferred compensation plan liabilities and 14 million of other G A expenses in our AR segment due to the AR Partial Quarter in 2023. Additionally, G A expenses increased from business divestiture-related losses in the quarter ended September 27, 2024. Such increases were partially offset by a decrease in merger, acquisition, and divestiture-related expenses. 
 Three Quarters Ended Comparison. G A expenses increased 390 million for the three quarters ended September 27, 2024 compared with the three quarters ended September 29, 2023 primarily due to increases in LHX NeXt implementation costs, including 56 million related to employee severance charges and 92 million for third-party consulting expenses, incremental IT expenses for implementation of new systems and other costs. G A expenses also increased from higher amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and a change in business divestiture-related losses, partially offset by a decrease in merger, acquisition, and divestiture-related expenses. Additionally, other G A expenses increased 116 million from the inclusion of 100 million of other G A expenses in our AR segment and 84 million in corporate other G A expenses, primarily from a 23 million change in the fair value of our deferred compensation plan liabilities and a 15 million increase in a legal reserve, partially offset by decreases in other G A expenses of 29 million, 20 million and 19 million in our SAS, CS and IMS segments, respectively, primarily from LHX NeXt driven cost savings.

For the quarter and three quarters ended September 27, 2024, includes 14 million of income net of related expenses from a domain name sale. 
 Interest Expense, net 
 Interest expense, net, increased for the quarter and three quarters ended September 27, 2024 compared with the quarter and three quarters ended September 29, 2023 primarily due to the issuance and sale of the March Issued 2024 Notes, AJRD Notes in July 2023 and higher average outstanding notes under our CP Program during the three quarters ended September 27, 2024, partially offset by repayment of Term Loan 2025 in March 2024. See Note G: Debt and Credit Arrangements in the Notes for further information. 
 Income Taxes 
 During interim periods, we estimate our worldwide forecasted full-year effective tax rate and apply that rate to year-to-date ordinary income in order to compute the year-to-date income tax provision. Although most items will be considered part of the forecasted full-year effective tax rate, there are a number of items that are instead required to be recorded in the interim period in which they occur; such as certain changes in uncertain tax positions, the accrual of interest and penalties, changes in tax laws or rates, and other items as prescribed by GAAP. As a result, there may be quarterly fluctuations in our effective tax rate and the results for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year or future periods. 
 Our effective tax rate ETR was 6.0 and 4.9 for the quarter and three quarters ended September 27, 2024, respectively, and 4.5 and 6.4 for the quarter and three quarters ended September 29, 2023, respectively. The ETR for all periods benefited from R D credits and tax deductions for FDII, with additional benefits from favorable adjustments recognized upon finalization of our 2023 tax returns in the quarter and three quarters ended September 27, 2024 and favorable resolution of specific audit uncertainties in the three quarters ended September 27, 2024 and the quarter and three quarters ended September 29, 2023. 
 Diluted EPS 
 Quarter Ended Comparison. Diluted EPS increased 4 for the quarter ended September 27, 2024 compared with the quarter ended September 29, 2023 primarily due to higher net income from the combined effects of reasons noted in the sections above, notably an increase in gross margin, partially offset by an increase in G A expenses. 
 Three Quarters Ended Comparison. Diluted EPS decreased 2 for the three quarters ended September 27, 2024 compared with the three quarters ended September 29, 2023 primarily due to lower net income, from the combined effects of reasons noted in the sections above, notably increases in G A expenses and interest expense, net, partially offset by an increase in gross margin.

Net cash provided by operating activities: The 123 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities in the three quarters ended September 27, 2024 compared with the three quarters ended September 29, 2023 was primarily due to decreases in transaction costs related to the AJRD acquisition, partially offset by 264 million more cash used to fund net working capital (i.e., receivables, contract assets, inventories, accounts payable and contract liabilities), primarily due to timing. 
 Net cash used in investing activities : The 6,787 million decrease in net cash used in investing activities in the three quarters ended September 27, 2024 compared with the three quarters ended September 29, 2023 was primarily due to the 6,688 million cash used for the acquisitions of Viasat, Inc. s Tactical Data Links and AJRD, in addition to an 87 million increase in net cash proceeds from sale of businesses during the three quarters ended September 27, 2024. 
 Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities : The 6,563 million change in net cash used in financing activities in the three quarters ended September 27, 2024 compared with net cash provided by financing activities in the three quarters ended September 29, 2023 was primarily due to decreases in net proceeds from borrowings and net proceeds from issuance of commercial paper of 4,742 million and 2,455 million, respectively, partially offset by the decrease in repayments of borrowings of 550 million and the increase in proceeds from exercises of employee stock options of 93 million. See Note G: Debt and Credit Arrangements in the Notes for further information. 
 Cash and Cash Equivalents 
 At September 27, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 539 million, of which 263 million was held by our foreign subsidiaries, a significant portion of which we believe can be repatriated to the U.S. with minimal tax cost. 
 Capital Structure and Resources 
 Described below are significant changes to our credit arrangements and debt during the three quarters ended September 27, 2024. 
 Credit Agreements 
 On January 26, 2024, we replaced the 2023 Credit Agreement with the 2024 Credit Agreement. At September 27, 2024, we had no outstanding borrowings under either our 2024 Credit Agreement or our 2022 Credit Agreement, and had available borrowing capacity of 2.3 billion, net of outstanding CP Program borrowings, and we re in compliance wit h all covenants under both aforementioned credit agreements. 
 CP Program 
 Under the CP Program, we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate amount of 3.0 billion. Subject to notice and certain other requirements of the CP Program, we may increase the aggregate amount available for issuance up to 3.5 billion. From time to time, we use borrowings under the CP Program for general corporate purposes, including the funding of acquisitions, debt repayment, dividend payments and repurchases of our common stock. 
 During the three quarters ended September 27, 2024, we had a maximum outstanding balance of 2.8 billion and a daily average outstanding balance of 2.3 billion under our CP Program. We expect balances under the CP Program to remain elevated as compared to historical norms through fiscal 2025. For further information about our Credit Agreements and CP Program, see Note G: Debt and Credit Arrangements in the Notes. 
 Debt 
 At September 27, 2024, we had 11.7 billion of outstanding long-term debt, net, including the current portion of long-term debt, net and financing lease obligations, the majority of which we incurred in connection with merger and acquisition activity. 
 During the three quarters ended September 27, 2024, we closed the issuance and sale of 2.25 billion aggregate principal amount of the March Issued 2024 Notes and used the proceeds to repay the entire outstanding 2.25 billion drawn on Term Loan 2025. Additionally, we repaid the 350 million aggregate principal amount of our 3.95 2024 Notes and closed the issuance and sale of 600 million aggregate principal amount of the 5.50 2054 Notes. We used net proceeds from the 5.50 2054 Notes to repay borrowings under our CP Program and intend to use such proceeds to repay the 3.832 2025 Notes upon maturity. For further information about our long-term debt, see Note G: Debt and Credit Arrangements in the Notes and Note 8: Debt and Credit Arrangements in our Fiscal 2023 Form 10-K.

Liquidity Assessment 
 Given our current cash position, outlook for funds generated from operations, credit ratings, available credit facilities, cash needs and debt structure, we have not experienced to date, and do not expect to experience, any material issues with liquidity for the next twelve months and in the longer term, although, we can give no assurances concerning our future liquidity, particularly in light of our overall level of debt. See Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Fiscal 2023 Form 10-K. 
 Based on our current business plan and revenue prospects, we believe that our existing cash, funds generated from operations, availability under our senior unsecured credit facilities and our CP Program and access to the public and private debt and equity markets will be sufficient to provide for our anticipated working capital requirements, capital expenditures and repayments of our debt securities at maturity for the next twelve months and the reasonably foreseeable future thereafter. 
 Our total additions of property, plant and equipment net of proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment for fiscal 2024 are expected to be approximately 2 of revenue. Other than operating expenses, cash uses for fiscal 2024 are expected to consist primarily of additions of property, plant and equipment, dividend payments, debt repayments, LHX NeXt implementation costs and repurchases under our share repurchase program. See Capital Structure and Resources and Material Cash Requirements and Commercial Commitments in Part II. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Fiscal 2023 Form 10-K for further information regarding our cash requirements. 
 Funding of Pension Plans 
 With respect to our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans, we intend to contribute annually no less than the required minimum funding thresholds. We do not expect to make material contributions to these plans in fiscal 2024. 
 Future required contributions primarily will depend on the actual annual return on assets and the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation at the end of each year. Depending on these factors, and the resulting funded status of our pension plans, the level of future statutory required minimum contributions could be material. We had net defined benefit plan assets of 291 million as of September 27, 2024. See Note 9: Retirement Benefits in our Fiscal 2023 Form 10-K and Note H: Retirement Benefits in the Notes for further information regarding our pension plans. 
 Common Stock Repurchases 
 During the three quarters ended September 27, 2024, we used 512 million to repurchase 2.3 million shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program at an average price per share of 220.18, including commissions of 0.02 per share. During the three quarters ended September 27, 2024, 28 million in shares of our common stock were delivered to us or withheld by us to satisfy withholding taxes on employee share-based awards. Shares repurchased by us are cancelled and retired. 
 At September 27, 2024 , we had a remaining unused authorization under our repurchase program of 3.4 billion . See Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Strategies in our Part II. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Fiscal 2023 Form 10-K and Part II. Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds of this Report for further information regarding common stock repurchases . 
 Dividends 
 On February 23, 2024, we announced that our Board of Directors Board increased the quarterly per share cash dividend rate on our common stock from 1.14 to 1.16, commencing with the dividend declared by our Board for the first quarter of fiscal 2024, for an annualized per share cash dividend rate of 4.64. See Part II. Item 5. Market for Registrant s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities in our Fiscal 2023 Form 10-K for further information regarding our dividends. 
 Material Cash Requirements and Commercial Commitments 
 The amounts disclosed in our Fiscal 2023 Form 10-K include our material cash requirements and commercial commitments. Except for the level of indebtedness under our CP Program, the issuance of the 5.50 2054 Notes and the establishment of our new 2024 Credit Facility, there were no material changes to our material cash requirements from contractual cash obligations to repay debt, to purchase goods and services or to make payments under operating leases or our commercial commitments; or in our contingent liabilities on outstanding surety bonds, standby letters of credit agreements or other arrangements with financial institutions and customers primarily relating to the guarantee of future performance on certain contracts to provide products and services to customers

or to obtain insurance policies with our insurance carriers as disclosed in our Fiscal 2023 Form 10-K. Further information about our Credit Agreements and CP Program can be found in Capital Structure and Resources in this MD A and Note G: Debt and Credit Arrangements in the Notes. 
 There can be no assurance that our business will continue to generate cash flows at current levels or that the cost or availability of future borrowings, if any, under our CP Program, credit facilities, or in the debt markets will not be impacted by any potential future credit or capital markets disruptions. If we are unable to maintain cash balances, generate cash flow from operations, borrow under our CP Program or increase the aggregate amount available under our CP Program or our credit facilities sufficient to service our obligations, we may be required to reduce capital expenditures, reduce or terminate our share repurchases, obtain additional financing or sell assets. Our ability to make principal payments or pay interest on or refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance and financial results, which, to a certain extent, are subject to general conditions affecting the defense, government and other markets we serve and to general economic, political, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors beyond our control. 
 
 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 There have been no material changes to the critical accounting estimates disclosed in Critical Accounting Estimates in Part II. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Fiscal 2023 Form 10-K, except, as set forth below. 
 Goodwill 
 We test our goodwill for impairment annually as of the first day of our fourth fiscal quarter, or under certain circumstances, more frequently, such as when events or circumstances indicate there may be impairment or when we reorganize our reporting structure such that the composition of one or more of our reporting units is affected. 
 Fiscal 2024 Impairment Tests. Information on interim impairment tests can be found in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 29, 2024 . These assessments indicated no impairment existed. 
 Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
 There have been no new accounting pronouncements which became effective during the three quarters ended September 27, 2024 that have had a material impact on our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 
 ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.
