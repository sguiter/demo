September 30, 2024. This decrease was primarily due to: a) the decrease of Media revenues for the early termination of the LNPB agreements,
and b) the decrease of European Mobility revenues driven by the Company s strategy to exit not profitable markets; partially compensated
by the increase of the Other Revenues from Related Party. 

Total Net Revenue from discontinued operations decreased by 328,
or 100 , from 329 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 1 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and decreased by
 1,116, or 65 , from 7,256 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 1,536 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. These
decreases are related to the suspension of mobility business in the United States of America and sales of Wheels electric vehicles and
occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2024. During the first six months of 2024, the Company provided e-mobility services,
either sharing or long-term rental proposal, in the following United States areas: Tampa (Florida), New York (New York), and Santa Monica
(California). 

European Mobility revenues 

Mobility revenues decreased
by 601, or 65 , from 918 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 317 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and decreased
by 2,273, or 81 , from 2,807 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 534 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The
decreases are explained by the Company s strategy to decrease the Company s operating cash which resulted in closing multiple
locations in Italy. 

We are an operator in Italy in the micro-mobility
environment. During the first nine months of 2024, the Company provided e-mobility services in the following Italian cities: Turin, Parma,
Palermo, Pisa, San Benedetto del Tronto, Modena, and Catania.

by 234, or 97 , from 241 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, to 7 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, and decreased
by 3,828, or 99 , from 3,849 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, to 26 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

The decrease is mainly explained by the early termination of
LNPB agreements.

Helbiz Serbia, the Serbian subsidiary
of micromobility.com, entered into a Business Cooperation Agreement with Everli S.p.A. (entity owned by Micrmobility.com CEO) requiring

operations decreased by 830 or 63 and by 16,441, or 92 in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with three and
nine months ended September 30, 2023. These decreases were primarily due to: a) the decrease in Media Cost of revenues for the early termination
of the LNPB agreements, and b) the decrease of Mobility activities in Europe driven by the Company s strategy to exit not profitable
markets. 

Cost of Revenue from discontinued
operations decreased by 1,859 or 96 and by 7,778, or 87 in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared with three and
nine months ended September 30, 2023. These decreases are related to the suspension of mobility business in the United States of America

shows a decrease of 584 or 81 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023, and
 5,034 or 91 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decreases are mainly
driven by the closing of multiple locations in Italy, in line with the Company s strategy to decrease the operating cash used by
the micro-mobility business. In detail, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, European Mobility Cost of Revenues are
lower than European Mobility Revenues, these results are in line with the Company strategy to focus Mobility activities only in profitable

or 62 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

The cost of revenues recorded
during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, amounting to 900, are related to payroll costs for employees hired under the IT Department
dedicated to the Company s platforms and the software services rendered to Everli S.p.A. under the Business Cooperation Agreement.
As a result, the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 shows a Other Cost of Revenues lower than Other Revenues, this result
is in line with the Company strategy to focus profitable activities. 

The cost of revenues recorded
during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, amounting to 2,356, were related to grocery business stopped during 2023, because it

Other income 

During the nine months ended
September 30, 2024, following the suspension of the mobility business in the United States the Company negotiated the exits from the
majority of the lease agreements related to warehouse facilities, including the retail store. 

 In August 2024, the Company entered into
a lease assignment agreement with a related party, for the early exit of the New York store. As a result of the aforementioned agreement,
the Company assigned all the rights and obligations under the previous lease to the new tenant, which is an entity fully-owned by the
Company s Chief Executive Officer. The Company recorded as Other income from discontinued operations a gain of 85 from
the early termination of the New York store lease; generated by the derecognition of the Right of Use of Asset, Security deposit and
Operating lease liabilities. Additionally, the Company recorded 937 as Write-off leasehold improvements from discontinued operations
 for the derecognition of leasehold improvements related to the New York store.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Since our inception, we have
financed our operations primarily with proceeds from outside sources of invested capital. We have had, and expect that we will continue
to have, an ongoing need to raise additional cash from outside sources to fund our operations and expand our business. If we are unable
to raise additional capital when desired, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be harmed. Successful transition
to attaining profitable operations depends upon achieving a level of revenues adequate to support our cost structure. 

As of September 30, 2024, our principal sources of liquidity were
cash and cash equivalents of 141. 

We plan to continue to fund
our operations through debt and equity financing, for the next twelve months. 

We may be required to seek
additional equity or debt financing. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our growth and expanded operations,
including the new business lines. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise
it on terms acceptable to us or at all.

Litigation 

The Company is from time
to time involved in legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory matters, indirect tax examinations or government inquiries and investigations
that may arise in the ordinary course of business. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate
amounts of damages. 

The Company records a liability
when the Company believes that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. If the Company
determines that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, the Company discloses the possible loss
in the consolidated financial statements. The Company reviews the developments in contingencies that could affect the amount of the provisions
that have been previously recorded. The Company adjusts provisions and changes to disclosures accordingly to reflect the impact of negotiations,
settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information. Significant judgment is required to determine both the probability
and the estimated amount of any potential losses and many of the legal proceedings are early in the discovery stage and unresolved. 

As of September 30, 2024,
and December 31, 2023, the Company concluded that certain losses on litigation were probable and reasonable estimable; as a result, the
Company recorded as Accruals for legal contingencies, included in Legal contingencies; 4,290 and 3,978 (of which 1,711 were related
to Wheels and classified as Liabilities from discontinued operations), respectively.

date ). 

 As of September 30, 2024,
the Company is involved in claims with previous investors who claimed financial losses for breaching contractual obligations. In detail,
during August 2022, the Company was named as a plaintiff in a lawsuit filed in in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of
New York and brought by Greenvision Capital Holdings LLC for breach of contract of a registration rights agreement by and between the
parties and a claim for civil conspiracy requesting a damage of 4,000. The Company s successful motion to dismiss the civil conspiracy
claim has since been adjudicated and the matter remains in discovery and a status conference with the judge in the matter is scheduled
for December 2024. While settlement discussions have occurred, no terms have been agreed upon between the parties. The Company recorded
 2,250 as Legal contingencies for this claim. 

 The range of loss for the
Company s legal contingencies accrued is between 0 to 7,120 which represents the range between the amount already settled with
the counterparts and the amount claimed deducting insurance coverage. 

 The Company is also involved
in certain claims where the losses are not considered to be reasonably estimable or probable; for these claims the range of potential
loss is between 0 to 1,250. 

Critical Accounting Estimates 

Our management s discussion
and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have
been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures
requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, costs and expenses and the disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities in our condensed consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience,
known trends and events and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the
basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We evaluate
our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 

We consider an accounting
estimate to be critical if: (1) the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the
time the accounting estimate was made, and (2) changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, or use
of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period, would have a material impact on our financial condition
or results of operations. We did not identify any critical accounting estimate as defined above. 

Emerging Growth Company Status 

Under the JOBS Act, an emerging
growth company can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This
provision allows an emerging growth company to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different transition
dates for public and private companies until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We meet the definition of an
emerging growth company and have elected to use this extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards
until the earlier of the date we (i) are no longer an emerging growth company, or (ii) affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the extended
transition period provided in the JOBS Act. As a result, our consolidated financial statements and the reported results of operations
contained therein may not be directly comparable to those of other public companies. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

The Company did not have,
during the periods presented, and it does not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in the rules and regulations
of the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market
Risks 

 Not applicable. 

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our management, with the participation of our principal
executive officer and our principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September
30, 2024. Based on such evaluation, due to a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting described below, our principal
executive officer and principal financial officer concluded our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and
15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) were not effective as of such date to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed
by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures
designed to ensure information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and
communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Material Weakness 

Our management s conclusion that our disclosure
controls and procedures were ineffective was due to the identification of a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting
in connection with the preparation of our Financial Statements. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies,
in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or
interim consolidated financial statements would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Our management identified the following
material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting: 

We have insufficiently designed and operating controls surrounding the accounting policies and controls, including standardized reconciliation schedules to ensure the company's books and records are maintained in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 

Notwithstanding the identified material weakness,
management believes that the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-Q present fairly, in all material respects,
our consolidated financial position, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated cash flows as of and for the periods presented
in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting 

 There has been no change in our internal control over
 financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) that occurred during the period covered by this report
 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. However, we
 expect to make changes to our internal control over financial reporting in the future to remediate the material weakness identified above. 

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 

From time to time, we are involved in legal proceedings
arising in the ordinary course of business, and we may continue to be involved in such legal proceedings. Currently, there are several
product liability claims against us none of which we deem material by itself. If several of these claims were to be decided against our
interest or if our product liability insurance were not to cover several of these claims, we might need to divert resources from our operations
to pay for such claims, and our results of operations would be correspondingly affected. 

On July 15, 2022, we issued an Unsecured Note
to an investor in exchange for 2 million (approximately 2.2 million) with 6.75 as interest on an annual basis. In March 2024,
we entered into a Settlement Agreement with the Note holder pursuant to which the Company s obligations under the original agreements,
amounting to 2.4 million, would be satisfied in exchange for a payment of 1.1 million to be paid by June 30, 2024. We failed to make
such payment, and consequently the Supreme Court of the State of New York issued a judgment against us for payment of the full principal,
interest and costs and disbursements, in October 2024. The Company is currently identifying and evaluating the alternative paths for facing
the judgement. As a result, we recorded an aggregate of approximately 2.5 million in our unaudited interim financial statement for the
period ended September 30, 2024 as Short-term financial liabilities, net for this Unsecured Note. 

 We have estimated the range of loss for the
legal contingencies accrued as between 0 to 7,120 million which represents the range between the amount already settled with the counterparts
and the amount claimed deducting insurance coverage. We are also involved in certain claims where the losses are not considered to be
reasonably estimable or probable; for these claims the range of potential loss is between 0 to 1,250. 

 As of September 30, 2024, we concluded that
certain losses on litigations were probable and reasonable estimable. As a result, we recorded an aggregate of approximately 4,290 in
our unaudited interim financial statement for the period ended September 30, 2024 as Accruals for legal contingencies.

Item 1A. Risk Factors 

 Although as a Smaller Reporting Company we are not
required to provide this information, we refer you to the sections of our annual report on Form 10-K filed on April 16, 2024, our quarterly

development, vehicles or other assets. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities

make payments that were due on an unsecured note issued on July 15, 2022. As a result, the Supreme Court of the State of New York issued
a judgment against us for payment of 2.5 million in principal, interest and costs and disbursements.
