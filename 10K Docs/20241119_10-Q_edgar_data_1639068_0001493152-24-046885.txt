and we had negative working capital of and an accumulated deficit of . The Company expects to incur further losses
in the development of its business, and may not be able to generate sufficient funds to sustain our operations for the next twelve months.
Accordingly, we may need to raise additional cash to fund our operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern. In the event revenues do not materialize at the expected rates, management would seek additional
financing and would attempt to conserve cash by further reducing expenses. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in achieving
these objectives. 

The
condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of any uncertainty as to
the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The condensed consolidated financial statements also do not include any adjustments
relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts, or amounts and classifications of liabilities that might
be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. Our ability to acquire new properties and increase revenues
is largely dependent on our success in raising additional capital.

Item
2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations 

You
should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the condensed consolidated
financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and with our audited financial statements
included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. In addition to historical condensed financial information,
the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could
differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. 

Overview 

We
were incorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware on March 2, 2015, and are a real estate consulting, asset management and business
acquisition company, that specializes in acquiring student housing and corporate income properties and development/business opportunities
located near the Los Angeles Metro/subway stations and within the Los Angeles area. 

Due
to high demand for houses from students, non- profit, and for-profit corporate tenants around the USC Campus and neighboring Metro/subway
stations, we have focused on acquiring multiple houses, remodeling and renting out. Rents have increased dramatically for houses in our
target areas, allowing us to target larger and higher priced houses, while factoring in current interest rates. 

With
multiple properties within a small radius, we re able to take advantage of economies of scale and benefit from property management
efficiencies. Our focus is to continue acquiring houses and expand rental operations. 

We
purchased two new properties during the third quarter of 2024, and entered into agreements to acquire two additional properties during
the fourth quarter of 2024. All properties have been purchased in conjunction with various debt financing arrangements. 

Going
Concern Uncertainty 

As
of September 30, 2024, our balance of cash on hand was 58,437, and we had negative working capital of 3,167,357 and an accumulated
deficit of 2,117,118. We expect to incur further losses in the development of its business; therefore, we may not have sufficient funds
to sustain our operations for the next twelve months and we may need to raise additional cash to fund our operations. These factors raise
substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. In the event revenues do not materialize at the expected
rates, management would seek additional financing and would attempt to conserve cash by further reducing expenses. There can be no assurance
that we will be successful in achieving these objectives. 

The
condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of any uncertainty as to
the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The condensed consolidated financial statements also do not include any adjustments
relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts, or amounts and classifications of liabilities that might
be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. Our ability to acquire new properties and increase revenues
is largely dependent on our success in raising additional capital.
