 The gross amounts of the fair value of our derivative instruments that are classified as assets or liabilities are included in other assets or other liabilities, respectively. Amounts accrued for interest payments in a net receivable position are included in other assets. Amounts accrued for interest payments in a net payable position are included in other liabilities.

 Other Administrative Tax Matters We accrue non-income tax liabilities for contingencies when management believes that a loss is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated, while contingent gains are recognized only when realized. In the event any losses are sustained in excess of accruals, they will be charged against income at that time. 
 
 In evaluating indirect tax matters, we take into consideration factors such as our historical experience with matters of similar nature, specific facts and circumstances, and the likelihood of prevailing. We reevaluate and update our accruals as matters progress over time, where there is a reasonable possibility that losses exceeding amounts already recognized may be incurred. Our estimate of additional losses is up to million at September 30, 2024.

Refer to the "Forward-Looking Statements" section of this MD A and the "Risk Factors" section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on January 30, 2024 (2023 Form 10-K), for a discussion of these risks and uncertainties. 
 Basis of Presentation 
 This MD A should be read in conjunction with the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 Except as otherwise specified, dollar amounts presented within tables are stated in millions. Certain columns and rows may not add due to rounding. Average balances are calculated using daily balances, where available. Otherwise, average balances are calculated using monthly balances. 
 
 Results of Operations 
 Key Drivers Income before income taxes was relatively flat for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Changes in the key drivers of income before income taxes include the following: 
 Finance charge income on retail finance receivables increased 844 million primarily due to an increase in the effective yield and growth in the size of the portfolio. The effective yield on our retail finance receivables increased primarily due to increased average interest rates on new loan originations. 
 Finance charge income on commercial finance receivables increased 303 million primarily due to an increase in the size of the portfolio. 
 Other income increased 159 million primarily due to higher investment income resulting from an increase in the average investment balance. 
 Equity income decreased 56 million primarily due to lower earning asset levels and increased provision for loan losses at our joint ventures in China. 
 Interest expense increased 1.1 billion primarily due to an increase in the effective rate of interest on our debt, resulting from higher benchmark rates on new issuances relative to maturing debt, as well as an increase in the average debt outstanding. 
 Provision for loan losses increased 143 million primarily due to moderating credit performance and recovery rates. 
 Non-GAAP Measure 
 Return on Average Common Equity Return on average common equity is a generally accepted accounting principle (GAAP) measure widely used to measure earnings in relation to invested capital. Our return on average common equity decreased to 15.0 for the four quarters ended September 30, 2024 from 16.4 for the four quarters ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to lower earnings. 
 Return on Average Tangible Common Equity We use return on average tangible common equity, a non-GAAP measure, to measure our contribution to General Motors Company's (GM) enterprise profitability and cash flows. Our return on average tangible common equity decreased to 16.4 for the four quarters ended September 30, 2024 from 18.0 for the four quarters ended September 30, 2023, primarily due to lower earnings.

 The following table presents our reconciliation of return on average tangible common equity to return on average common equity, the most directly comparable GAAP measure: 
 Four Quarters Ended September 30, 2024 September 30, 2023 Net income attributable to common shareholder 2,059 2,200 Average equity 15,666 15,358 Less: average preferred equity (1,969) (1,969) Average common equity 13,697 13,389 Less: average goodwill and intangible assets (1,180) (1,177) Average tangible common equity 12,517 12,212 Return on average common equity 15.0 16.4 Return on average tangible common equity 16.4 18.0 
 Our calculation of this non-GAAP measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences between companies in the method of calculation. As a result, the use of this non-GAAP measure has limitations and should not be considered superior to, in isolation from, or as a substitute for, related U.S. GAAP measures. This non-GAAP measure allows investors the opportunity to measure and monitor our performance against our externally communicated targets and evaluate the investment decisions being made by management to improve our return on average tangible common equity. Management uses this measure in its financial, investment and operational decision-making processes, for internal reporting and as part of its forecasting and budgeting processes. For these reasons, we believe this non-GAAP measure is useful to our investors.

 Average retail finance receivables increased primarily due to new loan originations in excess of principal collections and payoffs. Our penetration of GM's retail sales in the U.S. was 38.9 and 40.8 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Penetration levels vary depending on incentive financing programs available and competing third-party financing products in the market. 
 Average commercial finance receivables increased primarily due to growth in the average amount financed per dealer, resulting from increased new vehicle inventory, as well as higher floorplan penetration. Our floorplan dealer penetration in the U.S. was 47.4 and 45.0 at September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 Leased vehicles purchased increased primarily due to growth in GM sales, higher lease sales mix and higher net capitalized cost.

The effective yield on our retail finance receivables increased primarily due to increased average interest rates on new loan originations. The effective yield represents finance charges, rate subvention and fees recorded in earnings during the period as a percentage of average retail finance receivables. 
 Finance Charge Income - Commercial Finance Receivables Finance charge income on commercial finance receivables increased primarily due to an increase in the size of the portfolio. 
 Other Income Other income increased primarily due to higher investment income resulting from an increase in the average investment balance. 
 Equity Income Equity income decreased primarily due to lower earning asset levels and increased provision for loan losses at our joint ventures in China. GM continues to face intense price competition and an increasingly challenging regulatory environment in China, which negatively impacts GM s sales volume and profitability in its China operations. In addition, we face intense price competition from other auto lenders in China. As a result, the origination volume and earning assets balance have decreased at our joint ventures. GM is working with its joint venture partners and expects to have an updated business plan in China. Based on this business plan GM could record material future charges in the near term. Accordingly, while our operations in China remain overall profitable, we expect to assess the carrying value of our equity investments in light of these activities, which could also result in future charges.

 Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) 
 Unrealized Gain (Loss) on Hedges Unrealized gain (loss) on hedges included in other comprehensive income (loss) was (50) million and 80 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The change in unrealized gain (loss) was primarily due to changes in the fair value of our foreign currency swap agreements. 
 Unrealized gains and losses on cash flow hedges of our floating rate debt are reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the hedged transactions affect earnings via principal remeasurement or accrual of interest expense. 
 Foreign Currency Translation Adjustment Foreign currency translation adjustments included in other comprehensive income (loss) were 35 million and (70) million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Translation adjustments resulted from changes in the values of our international currency-denominated assets and liabilities as the value of the U.S. Dollar changed in relation to international currencies. The foreign currency translation gain for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily due to appreciating values of the Chinese Yuan Renminbi, Brazilian Real, and Canadian Dollar, partially offset by the depreciating value of the Mexican Peso in relation to the U.S. Dollar. The foreign currency translation loss for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was primarily due to depreciating values of the Brazilian Real, Canadian Dollar, and Chilean Peso in relation to the U.S. Dollar.

 24 9 23 8 
 ________________ 
 (a) Represents the number of vehicles returned to us for remarketing. 
 (b) Calculated as the number of operating leased vehicles returned divided by the number of operating leases terminated. 
 The return rate is largely dependent on the level of used vehicle values at lease termination compared to contractual residual values at lease inception. Return rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 increased compared to the same periods in 2023 due to decreased used vehicle values. The return rates continued to be lower than historical levels as used vehicle prices have generally remained higher than contractual residual values. Gains on terminations of leased vehicles were 188 million and 605 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 230 million and 664 million for the same periods in 2023. The decrease in gains is primarily due to fewer terminated leases during 2024. 
 The following table summarizes the residual value based on our most recent estimates and the number of units included in leased vehicles, net by vehicle type (units in thousands): 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Residual Value Units Percentage of Units Residual Value Units Percentage of Units Crossovers 12,937 625 67.2 12,830 648 67.5 Trucks 7,303 220 23.6 6,793 210 21.9 SUVs 2,162 53 5.7 2,304 58 6.0 Cars 599 32 3.5 734 44 4.6 Total 23,001 930 100.0 22,661 960 100.0

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 General Our primary sources of cash are finance charge income, leasing income and proceeds from the sale of terminated leased vehicles, net proceeds from credit facilities, securitizations, secured and unsecured borrowings, and collections and recoveries on finance receivables. Our expected material uses of cash are purchases and funding of finance receivables and leased vehicles, repayment or repurchases of secured and unsecured debt, funding credit enhancement requirements in connection with securitizations and secured credit facilities, interest costs, operating expenses, including investments in new initiatives, income taxes and dividend payments. 
 Typically, our purchase and funding of retail and commercial finance receivables and leased vehicles are initially financed by utilizing cash and borrowings on our secured credit facilities. Subsequently, we typically obtain long-term financing for finance receivables and leased vehicles through securitization transactions and the issuance of unsecured debt. 
 The following table summarizes our available liquidity: 
 Liquidity September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Cash and cash equivalents (a) 
 4,852 5,282 Borrowing capacity on unpledged eligible assets 25,717 21,946 Borrowing capacity on committed unsecured lines of credit 720 687 Borrowing capacity on the Junior Subordinated Revolving Credit Facility 1,000 1,000 Borrowing capacity on the GM Revolving 364-Day Credit Facility 2,000 2,000 Available liquidity 34,289 30,915 
 _________________ 
 (a) Includes 375 million and 380 million in unrestricted cash outside of the U.S. at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, of which certain amounts are considered to be indefinitely invested based on specific plans for reinvestment. 
 We generally target liquidity levels to support at least six months of our expected net cash outflows, including new originations, without access to new debt financing transactions or other capital markets activity. At September 30, 2024, available liquidity exceeded our liquidity targets. 
 Cash Flow The following table summarizes our cash flow activities. For further detail, please refer to the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 vs. 2023 2024 2023 Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities 5,114 4,862 252 Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities (10,329) (7,903) (2,426) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 4,735 4,080 655 
 Net cash provided by operating activities increased primarily due to an increase in finance charge income and a net decrease in cash used by counterparty derivative collateral posting activities, partially offset by an increase in interest paid. 
 Credit Ratings We receive ratings from four independent credit rating agencies: DBRS Limited, Fitch Rating (Fitch), Moody s Investors Service (Moody s) and Standard Poor s (S P). The credit ratings assigned to us from all the credit rating agencies are closely associated with their opinions on GM. As of October 15, 2024, all credit ratings remained unchanged since December 31, 2023. 
 Credit Facilities In the normal course of business, in addition to using our available cash, we fund our operations by borrowing under our credit facilities, which may be secured and/or structured as securitizations or may be unsecured. We repay these borrowings as appropriate under our liquidity management strategy.

 (a) Maturity dates represent legal final maturity of issued notes. The notes are expected to be paid based on amortization of the finance receivables and leases pledged. 
 (b) At historical foreign currency exchange rates at the time of issuance. 
 Our securitizations and credit facilities generally utilize special purpose entities, which are also variable interest entities that meet the requirements to be consolidated in our financial statements. Refer to Note 7 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion. 
 Unsecured Debt We periodically access the unsecured debt capital markets through the issuance of senior unsecured notes. At September 30, 2024, the aggregate principal amount of our outstanding unsecured senior notes was 57.8 billion. 
 We issue other unsecured debt through demand notes, commercial paper offerings and other bank and non-bank funding sources. At September 30, 2024, we had 3.7 billion outstanding in demand notes and 3.3 billion under the U.S. commercial paper program.

 Support Agreement - Leverage Ratio Our earning assets leverage ratio calculated in accordance with the terms of the support agreement with GM (the Support Agreement) was 8.69x and 8.32x at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and the applicable leverage ratio threshold was 12.00x. In determining our earning assets leverage ratio (net earning assets divided by adjusted equity) under the Support Agreement, net earning assets means our finance receivables, net, plus leased vehicles, net, and adjusted equity means our equity, net of goodwill and inclusive of outstanding junior subordinated debt, as each may be adjusted for derivative accounting. 
 Asset and Liability Maturity Profile We define our asset and liability maturity profile as the cumulative maturities of our finance receivables, investment in leased vehicles, net of accumulated depreciation, cash and cash equivalents and other assets less our cumulative debt maturities. We manage our balance sheet so that asset maturities will exceed debt maturities each year. The following chart presents our cumulative maturities for assets and debt at September 30, 2024: 
 2024 2025 2026 2027 and Thereafter Encumbered assets 5,956 27,798 46,064 65,437 Unencumbered assets 28,440 48,993 60,140 72,322 Total assets 34,396 76,791 106,205 137,759 Secured debt 3,966 18,512 30,676 43,577 Unsecured debt 9,636 21,914 30,975 68,836 Total debt (a)

 Critical Accounting Estimates 
 The preparation of condensed financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenue and expenses in the periods presented. Actual results could differ from those estimates, due to inherent uncertainties in making estimates, and those differences may be material. The critical accounting estimates that affect the condensed consolidated financial statements and the judgment and assumptions used are consistent with those described in Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in our 2023 Form 10-K. 
 
 Forward-Looking Statements 
 This report contains several "forward-looking statements." Forward-looking statements are those that use words such as "believe," "expect," "intend," "plan," "may," "likely," "should," "estimate," "continue," "future" or "anticipate" and other comparable expressions. These words indicate future events and trends. Forward-looking statements are our current views with respect to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to many assumptions, risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ significantly from historical results or from those anticipated by us. The most significant risks are detailed from time to time in our filings and reports with the SEC, including our 2023 Form 10-K. It is advisable not to place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to, and do not, publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, except as required by federal securities laws, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 
 The following factors are among those that may cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or from the forward-looking statements: 
 GM's ability to produce and sell new vehicles that we finance in the markets we serve; 
 dealers' effectiveness in marketing our financial products to consumers; 
 the viability of GM-franchised dealers that are commercial loan customers; 
 the sufficiency, availability and cost of sources of financing, including credit facilities, securitization programs and secured and unsecured debt issuances; 
 the adequacy of our underwriting criteria for loans and leases and the level of net charge-offs, delinquencies and prepayments on the loans and leases we purchase or originate;

 GENERAL MOTORS FINANCIAL COMPANY, INC. 

 our ability to effectively manage capital or liquidity consistent with evolving business, operational or financing needs, risk management standards and regulatory or supervisory requirements; 
 the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses on our finance receivables; 
 our ability to maintain and expand our market share due to competition in the automotive finance industry from a large number of banks, credit unions, independent finance companies and other captive automotive finance subsidiaries; 
 changes in the automotive industry that result in a change in demand for vehicles and related vehicle financing; 
 the effect, interpretation or application of new or existing laws, regulations, court decisions, legal proceedings and accounting pronouncements; 
 adverse determinations with respect to the application of existing laws, or the results of any audits from tax authorities, as well as changes in tax laws and regulations, supervision, enforcement and licensing across various jurisdictions; 
 the prices at which used vehicles are sold in the wholesale auction markets; 
 vehicle return rates, our ability to estimate residual value at lease inception and the residual value performance on vehicles we lease; 
 interest rate fluctuations and certain related derivatives exposure, including risks from our hedging activities; 
 our joint ventures in China, which we cannot operate solely for our benefit and over which we have limited control; 
 uncertainties associated with benchmark interest rates; 
 pandemics, epidemics, disease outbreaks and other public health crises; 
 our ability to secure private data, proprietary information, manage risks related to security breaches, cyberattacks and other disruptions to networks and systems owned or maintained by us or third parties and comply with enterprise data regulations in all key market regions; 
 foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and other risks applicable to our operations outside of the U.S.; 
 changes in tax regulations and earnings forecasts could prevent full utilization of available tax incentives and tax credits; 
 changes in local, regional, national or international economic, social or political conditions; and 
 impact and uncertainties related to climate-related events and climate change legislation. 
 If one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or if underlying assumptions prove incorrect, our actual results may vary materially from those expected, estimated or projected.
