 shares of common stock for net proceeds of approximately million in its initial public offering ("IPO") which closed in May 2022, and the sale of shares of common stock for net proceeds of approximately million in its underwritten public offering which closed in September 2023 (see Note 10). The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. Management is required to perform a two-step analysis over the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management must first evaluate whether there are conditions and events that raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern (Step 1). If management concludes that substantial doubt is raised, management is also required to consider whether its plans alleviate that doubt (Step 2). Management believes that it has sufficient working capital on hand to fund operations through at least the next twelve months from the date these financial statements were issued. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in acquiring additional funding, if needed, that the Company s projections of its future working capital needs will prove accurate, or that any additional funding would be sufficient to continue operations in future years.

Diluted net loss per share is computed by dividing the consolidated net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares and dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding for the period determined using the treasury-stock and if-converted methods. Potentially dilutive common stock equivalents are comprised of unvested common stock, common stock options, and contingently issuable shares under the Company's employee stock purchase plan. For all periods presented, there is no difference in the number of shares used to calculate basic and diluted shares outstanding as inclusion of the potentially dilutive common stock equivalents would be antidilutive.

At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, all available-for-sale marketable securities had contractual maturities of less than one year. As of September 30, 2024 , the Company reviewed its investment portfolio to assess the unrealized losses on its available-for-sale investments. In making this assessment, the Company considered the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, and adverse conditions specifically related to the security, among other factors. The Company also evaluated whether it intended to sell the security and whether it was more likely than not that the Company would be required to sell the security before recovering its amortized cost basis. The Company determined no portion of the unrealized losses relate to a credit loss. There have been impairments of the Company s assets measured and carried at fair value during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 .

noncancelable operating lease for a facility in Switzerland, which it determined was an operating lease at the inception of the lease contract. The lease commencement date occurred in September 2021 when the Company gained access to the facility. The Company is obligated to make monthly rental payments that periodically escalate during the lease term and is subject to additional charges for common area maintenance and other costs. an option to extend the lease for a period of which the Company is not reasonably certain to exercise. In March 2022, the Company entered into a lease for office and laboratory space located in Boston, Massachusetts (as amended, the Boston Lease ), which it determined was an operating lease at the inception of the lease contract. The Boston Lease commenced in April 2022 with base rental payments beginning in January 2023. The Boston Lease includes certain tenant improvement allowances for the reimbursement of million of costs incurred by the Company, and for the Company to extend the lease for a period of , which the Company is not reasonably certain to exercise. The Company determined that it owns the leasehold improvements related to the Boston Lease and, as such, reflected the million lease incentive as a reduction of the rental payments used to measure the operating lease liability, and, in turn, the operating lease right-of-use asset as of the lease commencement date in April 2022. Between the lease commencement date and September 30, 2024, the Company recorded increases of million to the operating lease liability as and when such lease incentives were received from the landlord. Under the terms of the Boston Lease, the Company provided the lessor with an irrevocable standby letter of credit secured by restricted cash in the amount of million. The Company completed an evaluation of the carrying value of its long-lived assets, including its operating lease right-of-use asset. This process includes evaluating the estimated remaining lives, significant changes in the use, and potential impairment charges related to its long-lived assets. The Company used market participant assumptions to determine the fair value of the operating lease right-of-use asset. Based on its evaluation, the Company determined that the operating lease right-of-use asset was impaired and recorded a million charge during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

The Company incurred an immaterial amount of expense related to short-term leases and variable lease costs during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 

Weighted-average discount rate 

As there was not an implicit rate within the leases, management estimated the incremental borrowing rate based on the rate of interest the Company would have to pay to borrow a similar amount on a collateralized basis over a similar term as well as by using a set of peer companies' incremental borrowing rates.

The Second Amendment amended the following: (i) with respect to the remaining million under Term Loan Tranche 1, modified the period during which the Company may borrow thereunder to start on January 1, 2024 and end July 19, 2024 (or such earlier date if Lenders elect in their sole discretion), (ii) with respect to Term Loan Tranche 2, modified the period during which the Company may borrow thereunder to start on January 1, 2024 and end July 19, 2024 (or such earlier date if Lenders elect in their sole discretion) and (iii) with respect to Term Loan Tranche 3, modified the period during which the Company may borrow thereunder to end on the earlier of (x) September 15, 2024 and (y) 30 days following the date the Company achieves the Tranche 3 Milestone. The Company did not incur any fees in connection with the Second Amendment. All Term Loans are subject to a minimum draw amount of million and no event of default under the Loan Agreement having occurred and is continuing. The borrowings under the Loan Agreement are collateralized by substantially all of our assets, including intellectual property and certain other assets. The Term Loans bear (a) cash interest at a floating rate of the higher of (i) the Wall Street Journal prime rate (or if less) plus , or (ii) (interest rate of as of September 30, 2024 ), and (b) additional interest ("PIK Interest") at a per annum rate equal to , with such interest being added to the outstanding principal balance of the Term Loans on a monthly basis.

. In addition, the Company is obligated to pay a final payment fee equal to the greater of (i) million and (ii) of the original principal amount of the Term Loans (which is million as of September 30, 2024 ). The final payment fee is recorded as a debt discount amortized over the life of the debt. The Company may elect to prepay all or a portion of the Term Loans prior to maturity, subject to a prepayment fee of up to of the then outstanding principal balance and the pro rata application of such payment to the final payment fee. After repayment, no Term Loan amounts may be borrowed again. The Loan Agreement contains certain customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default. The affirmative covenants include, among others, covenants requiring the Company to maintain its legal existence and governmental approvals, deliver certain financial reports, maintain insurance coverage and satisfy certain requirements regarding its operating accounts. The negative covenants include, among others, limitations on the Company s ability to incur additional indebtedness and liens, merge with other companies or consummate certain changes of control, acquire other companies or businesses, make certain investments, pay dividends, transfer or dispose of assets, amend certain material agreements, including the Takeda License, or enter into various specified transactions. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, subject to any specified cure periods, all amounts owed by the Company would begin to bear interest at a rate that is above the rate effective immediately before the event of default and may be declared immediately due and payable by Hercules, as collateral agent. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized an immaterial amount of interest expense related to the Term Loans using the effective interest method. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recognized interest expense of million related to the Term Loans using the effective interest method. Included in such expense was million related to accretion of the final payment fee to other long-term liabilities, million of PIK interest, million of coupon interest, and an immaterial amount of debt discount amortization. On July 19, 2024, the Company repaid in full the entire million of outstanding principal and interest under the Loan Agreement. The Company made a final payment of million, including a final payment fee and prepayment fee of million. The loss on extinguishment of the debt of approximately million was recorded as interest expense during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 . In connection with the repayment, the Loan Agreement and the other loan documents associated therewith were terminated and the Lenders security interests in the Company s assets and property were released.

Expected term (in years) 

Expected dividend yield 

Risk-free interest rate . The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield in effect at the time of grant for zero coupon U.S. Treasury notes with maturities similar to the expected term of the awards. Expected volatility . Given the Company's limited historical stock price volatility data, the expected volatility assumption is based on volatilities of a peer group of similar companies whose share prices are publicly available. The peer group was developed based on companies in the biotechnology industry. The Company will continue to apply this process until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of its own stock price becomes available. Expected term . The expected term represents the period of time that options are expected to be outstanding. Because the Company does not have historical exercise behavior, it determines the expected life assumption using the simplified method, for employees, which is an average of the contractual term of the option and its vesting period. Expected dividend yield . The Company bases the expected dividend yield assumption on the fact that it has never paid cash dividends and has no present intention to pay cash dividends and, therefore, used an expected dividend yield of .

 Overview 
 We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing novel vaccines. Our initial program, HIL-214, is a virus-like particle (VLP) based vaccine candidate for the prevention of moderate-to-severe acute gastroenteritis (AGE) caused by norovirus infection. It is estimated that norovirus causes nearly 700 million cases of illness and more than 200,000 deaths worldwide per year, as well as significant additional economic and social burden. To date, HIL-214 has been studied in nine clinical trials conducted by Takeda and LigoCyte, which collectively generated safety data from more than 4,500 subjects and immunogenicity data from more than 2,200 subjects, including safety and immunogenicity data from more than 800 pediatric subjects. A randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2b field efficacy trial enrolled 4,712 adult subjects, and HIL-214 was well tolerated and demonstrated clinical proof of concept in preventing moderate-to-severe cases of AGE from norovirus infection. In September 2021, an open investigational new drug (IND) application was transferred to us from Takeda, under which we initiated a Phase 2b clinical trial, NEST-IN1 (Norovirus Efficacy and Safety Trial in Infants, or NOR-212), in May 2022 to evaluate the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of HIL-214 in infants. In May 2022, we completed enrollment of the prespecified 200 subject run-in for NEST-IN1. We resumed enrollment in NEST-IN1 in August 2022, following the prespecified safety assessment by the clinical trial's data monitoring committee. In December 2022, we reported positive interim immunogenicity results for the first 200 subjects of NEST-IN1. In July 2024, we reported top-line data from NEST-IN1.The study did not meet its primary endpoint of efficacy against moderate or severe AGE events due to GI.1 or GII.4 norovirus genotypes. No clinical benefit was observed across secondary endpoints. HIL-214 exhibited a safety and immunogenicity profile consistent with what was observed in the prespecified analysis of the first 200 subjects in NEST-IN1 and in previously reported studies. We plan to discontinue further development of HIL-214 and are exploring the potential for continued development of our other norovirus vaccine candidates, as well as business development-related activities for these vaccine candidates and other strategic alternatives. On July 31, 2024 and October 15, 2024, we announced workforce reductions of approximately 41 and 15 employees, respectively, constituting approximately 55 of our workforce. We currently estimate that it will incur charges associated with the workforce reduction of approximately 4.7 million primarily related to employee severance payments, benefits and related termination costs. We expect that the reduction in force that occurred in October 2024 will be substantially complete with the majority of related charges recognized in the fourth quarter of 2024. The estimates of the 
 21 

charges and expenditures that we expect to incur in connection with the workforce reduction, and the timing thereof, are subject to several assumptions and the actual amounts incurred may differ materially from these estimates. In addition, we may incur other charges or cash expenditures not currently contemplated due to unanticipated events that may occur, including in connection with the implementation of the workforce reduction. 
 We commenced our operations in 2019 and have devoted substantially all of our resources to date to organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital, in-licensing intellectual property related to our initial vaccine candidate, HIL-214, preparing for and managing our clinical trials of HIL-214, and providing other general and administrative support for our operations. We have funded operations to date primarily through the issuance of convertible promissory notes, commercial bank debt, the sale of common stock in our initial public offering (IPO) which closed in May 2022 and the sale of common stock in our underwritten public offering which closed in September 2023. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of 189.3 million. From inception to September 30, 2024, we raised aggregate gross proceeds of 137.2 million from the issuance of convertible promissory notes, we completed our IPO in May 2022, whereby we sold 13,529,750 shares of common stock at a public offering price of 17.00 per share, for net proceeds of approximately 209.5 million, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering costs of approximately 20.5 million, we borrowed 25.0 million in commercial bank debt and we completed an underwritten public offering in September 2023, whereby we sold 9,200,000 shares of our common stock, which included the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase 1,200,000 shares, at a public offering price of 12.50 per share, for total net proceeds of approximately 107.8 million. 
 We do not have any products approved for sale, have not generated any revenue and have incurred net losses since our inception. Our net losses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were 25.8 million, 31.8 million, 113.3 million and 86.6 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of 501.9 million. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year, depending on the timing of our clinical development activities, other research and development activities and pre-commercialization activities. 
 Based on our current operating plan, we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements through at least the next 12 months. We have never generated any revenue and do not expect to generate any revenue from product sales unless and until we successfully complete development of, and obtain regulatory approval for, our norovirus vaccine candidates, which will not be for several years, if ever. Accordingly, until such time as we can generate significant revenue from sales of our norovirus vaccine candidates, if ever, we expect to finance our cash needs through equity offerings, debt financings, or other capital sources, including potential collaborations, licenses and other similar arrangements. However, we may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other arrangements when needed on favorable terms or at all. Our failure to raise capital or enter into such other arrangements when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and could force us to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market vaccine candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves. 
 Financial Operations Overview 
 Our financial statements include the accounts of HilleVax (formerly MokshaCo, Inc. and also the receiving entity), North Bridge V, Inc. (North Bridge V) and YamadaCo III, Inc. (YamadaCo III), prior to being merged into a single entity effective February 8, 2021. Our financial statements also include the accounts of our wholly-owned subsidiary HilleVax GmbH subsequent to its formation in May 2021 and our wholly-owned subsidiary HilleVax Security Corporation subsequent to its formation in December 2021. The functional currency of our Company, HilleVax GmbH and HilleVax Security Corporation is the U.S. dollar. HilleVax, North Bridge V and YamadaCo III were entities under common control of Frazier Life Sciences X, L.P. or its affiliates (Frazier), as a result of, among other things, Frazier s: (i) ownership of a majority of the outstanding capital stock of each of the companies; (ii) financing of each of the companies; (iii) control of board of directors of each of the companies; and (iv) management of each of the companies. All of the companies were formed for the purpose of identifying potential assets around which to form an operating company. As the merged entities were under common control, the financial statements report the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the merged companies for all periods presented. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 
 License Agreement with Takeda		 
 On July 2, 2021, we and Takeda Vaccines, Inc. (Takeda), a subsidiary of Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, entered into a license agreement (the Takeda License), pursuant to which we exclusively in-licensed certain intellectual property rights to commercialize HIL-214 products worldwide (excluding Japan) (the Territory). We will be responsible, at our cost, for the development, manufacture and commercialization of HIL-214 products. We are obligated to use 
 22 

commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize HIL-214 products in the Territory, and to seek regulatory approval for such products throughout the world. 
 We paid Takeda upfront consideration consisting of 840,500 shares of our common stock and a warrant to purchase 5,883,500 shares of our common stock (the Takeda Warrant). We further agreed that, in the event that Takeda s fully-diluted ownership, including the Takeda Warrant, represents less than a certain specified percentage of our fully-diluted capitalization, including shares issuable upon conversion of outstanding convertible promissory notes, calculated immediately prior to the closing of our IPO, we would issue an additional warrant to purchase shares of common stock such that Takeda would hold a certain specified percentage of the fully-diluted capitalization immediately before the closing of our IPO (the Takeda Warrant Right). The Takeda Warrant was fully exercised in November 2022. The Takeda Warrant Right expired in connection with our IPO and no additional warrant was issued. We also paid Takeda 2.5 million in cash upon the consummation of our convertible note financing in August 2021 and paid Takeda 2.5 million in March 2022 upon release of certain drug products and completion of certain regulatory activities. We are required to make to Takeda a one-time payment of 7.5 million upon achievement of a specified development milestone and commercial milestone payments of up to 150.0 million in the aggregate if certain annual sales targets for HIL-214 products are met in the Territory. We agreed to pay Takeda tiered high-single digit to low-teen percentage royalties on net sales of HIL-214 products in the Territory, subject to specified offsets and reductions, and Takeda agreed to pay us tiered mid-single digit to low-double digit percentage royalties on net sales of HIL-214 products in Japan, subject to specified offsets and reductions. Royalties will be payable, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis beginning on the first commercial sale of such product in such country, until the later of (i) the expiration of the licensed patents covering the applicable product, (ii) the expiration of regulatory exclusivity in such country, or (iii) 20 years following the first commercial sale of such product in such country. 
 Transitional Services Agreement with Takeda 
 As contemplated by the Takeda License, on December 17, 2021, we and Takeda entered into a Transitional Services Agreement (the TSA). Pursuant to the TSA, Takeda has agreed to provide, on a transitional basis following the effective date of the Takeda License, certain services related to research and development and regulatory assistance services, oversight and management of ongoing clinical and research studies, and maintenance of certain third-party vendor contracts. In consideration for the services provided under the TSA, we have agreed to pay certain specified amounts to Takeda in cash for such services and certain pass-through costs. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we incurred 36,000, 29,000, 0.1 million, and 0.2 million, respectively, of research and development expenses for Takeda s services. 
 License Agreement with Kangh 
 On January 8, 2024, we and Chengdu Kanghua Biological Products Co., Ltd. (Kangh) entered into an exclusive license agreement (the Kangh License) for rights to Kangh s hexavalent virus-like particle vaccine candidate for norovirus, referred to by us as HIL-216, outside of Greater China (the Territory). We will be responsible, at our cost, for the development, manufacture and commercialization of HIL-216 products in the Territory. We are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize HIL-216 products in the Territory, and to seek regulatory approval for such products throughout the Territory. 
 In consideration of the Kangh License, we have paid an upfront amount of 15.0 million. In addition, we have the potential to pay Kangh up to 255.5 million upon achieving certain development and sales milestones. Kangh is also eligible to receive a single-digit tiered royalty on net sales outside of Greater China. 
 Components of Results of Operations 
 Operating Expenses 
 Research and Development 
 During 2024 and 2023, our research and development expenses have primarily been related to the development of HIL-214. Research and development expenses are recognized as incurred, and payments made prior to the receipt of goods or services to be used in research and development are capitalized until the goods or services are received. 
 Research and development expenses include: 
 salaries, payroll taxes, employee benefits, and stock-based compensation charges for those individuals involved in research and development efforts; 

23 

external research and development expenses incurred under agreements with CROs and consultants to conduct and support our planned preclinical studies and clinical trials of our norovirus vaccine candidates; and 

costs related to manufacturing our vaccine candidates for our planned preclinical studies and clinical trials. 

If we continue the development of our norovirus vaccine candidates, we plan to substantially increase our research and development expenses for the foreseeable future. We cannot determine with certainty the timing of initiation, the duration or the completion costs of current or future preclinical studies and clinical trials of our norovirus vaccine candidates or any other vaccine candidates due to the inherently unpredictable nature of clinical and preclinical development. Clinical and preclinical development timelines, the probability of success and development costs can differ materially from expectations. In addition, we cannot forecast whether our norovirus vaccine candidates or any other vaccine candidates may be subject to future collaborations, when such arrangements will be secured, if at all, and to what degree such arrangements would affect our development plans and capital requirements. 
 Our future development costs may vary significantly based on factors such as: 
 the number of trials required for approval; 

the number of sites included in the trials; 

the countries in which the trials are conducted; 

the length of time required to enroll eligible subjects; 

the number of subjects that participate in the trials; 

the number of doses evaluated in the trials; 

the costs and timing of manufacturing our norovirus vaccine candidates and placebo for use in our trials; 

the drop-out or discontinuation rates of clinical trial subjects; 

potential additional safety monitoring requested by regulatory agencies;

Other income of 0.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 primarily consisted of 1.4 million of interest income on our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and 1.1 million of other income primarily related to the accretion of discounts to maturity on our marketable securities, partially offset by 1.9 million of interest expense on our term loan facility. Other income of 2.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 primarily consisted of 1.7 million of interest income on our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and 1.1 million of other income primarily related to the accretion of discounts to maturity on our marketable securities, partially offset by 0.7 million of interest expense on our term loan facility.

Research and development expenses. Research and development expenses were 72.7 million and 73.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease of 0.7 million primarily consisted of 13.8 million related to clinical development expenses related to HIL-214, partially offset by 8.0 million of personnel-related expenses, primarily related to charges associated with our workforce reduction in July 2024, 2.4 million of consulting expenses, 1.5 million of facility expenses, and 1.3 million of other expenses. 
 In-process research and development expenses. We had 15.3 million of in-process research and development expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 related to the Kangh License, which was entered into in 2024. We did not incur any in-process research and development expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses were 22.8 million and 19.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase of 3.2 million primarily consisted of 2.6 million of personnel-related expenses, primarily related to charges associated with our workforce reduction in July 2024, and 1.5 million of consulting and other expenses, partially offset by a decrease of 0.9 million related to professional service expenses. 
 Impairment charges. Impairment charges of 8.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted of 5.1 million of impairment charges on our right-of-use asset and 3.1 million of impairment charges on our property and equipment, which was triggered by the decline in our market capitalization over the subsequent release of the top-line data from our NEST-IN1 clinical study in July 2024. We did not incur any impairment charges for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. 
 Other income (expense). Other income of 5.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 primarily consisted of 5.5 million of interest income on our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and 3.7 million of other income primarily related to the accretion of discounts to maturity on our marketable securities, partially offset by 3.3 million of interest expense on our term loan facility. Other income of 6.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily consisted of 6.7 million of interest income on our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and 1.4 million of other income primarily related to the accretion of discounts to maturity on our marketable securities, partially offset by 1.7 million of interest expense on our term loan facility. 
 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 We have incurred net losses and negative cash flows from operations since our inception and anticipate we will continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future as we continue the development and potential commercialization of our norovirus vaccine candidates, and may never become profitable. We have funded our operations to date primarily through the issuance of convertible promissory notes, the net proceeds raised from our IPO, an underwritten public offering in September 2023 and borrowings under our term loan facility. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of 189.3 million.

Term Loan Facility 
 On April 18, 2022, we entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (the Existing Loan Agreement and, as amended by the First and Second Amendments (as defined below), the Loan Agreement) with Hercules Capital, Inc., as administrative and collateral agent (in such capacity, Hercules), and the lenders from time to time party thereto (the Lenders) providing for term loans (Term Loans) of up to 75.0 million. Prior to June 16, 2023, we had borrowed 15.0 million in term loans under the Existing Loan Agreement and had the right thereunder to borrow (i) an additional 15.0 million of term loans until June 30, 2023 (Term Loan Tranche 1), (ii) an additional 20.0 million of term loans until June 30, 2023 (Term Loan Tranche 2), and (iii) subject to the achievement of certain clinical development milestones by the Company, an additional 25.0 million until March 31, 2024 (Term Loan Tranche 3). 
 On June 16, 2023, we entered into a First Amendment to Loan and Security Agreement (the First Amendment) with Hercules and the Lenders party thereto, which amended the Existing Loan Agreement. In connection with the First Amendment, we borrowed 10.0 million under Term Loan Tranche 1. Additionally, the First Amendment, among other things, amended the following: (i) with respect to the remaining 5.0 million under Term Loan Tranche 1, modified the period during which the Company may borrow thereunder to start on December 1, 2023 and end May 31, 2024 (or such earlier date if Lenders elect in their sole discretion), (ii) with respect to Term Loan Tranche 2, modified the period during which we may borrow thereunder to start on December 1, 2023 and end May 31, 2024 (or such earlier date if Lenders elect in their sole discretion) and (iii) with respect to Term Loan Tranche 3, (a) added as a new condition to borrow thereunder that (x) our Phase 2b clinical trial evaluating the safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of HIL-214 in infants (NEST-IN1) has achieved the protocol-specified primary efficacy endpoint and (y) HIL-214 has demonstrated acceptable safety results in the NEST-IN1 clinical trial, and, as a result, we support the initiation of a Phase 3 registrational trial as the next immediate step in the development of HIL-214 (the Tranche 3 Milestone) and (b) modified the period during which we may borrow thereunder to start on the date we achieve the Tranche 3 Milestone and end on the earlier of (x) June 15, 2024 and (y) 30 days following the date we achieve the Tranche 3 Milestone. 
 On November 9, 2023, the Company entered into a Second Amendment to Loan and Security Agreement (the "Second Amendment") with Hercules and the Lenders party thereto, which amended the Existing Loan Agreement. The Second Amendment amended the following: (i) with respect to the remaining 5.0 million under Term Loan Tranche 1, modified the period during which the Company may borrow thereunder to start on January 1, 2024 and end July 19, 2024 (or such earlier date if Lenders elect in their sole discretion), (ii) with respect to Term Loan Tranche 2, modified the period during which the Company may borrow thereunder to start on January 1, 2024 and end July 19, 2024 (or such earlier date if Lenders elect in their sole discretion) and (iii) with respect to Term Loan Tranche 3, modified the period during which the Company may borrow thereunder to end on the earlier of (x) September 15, 2024 and (y) 30 days following the date the Company achieves the Tranche 3 Milestone. The Company did not incur any fees in connection with the Second Amendment. All Term Loans are subject to a minimum draw amount of 5.0 million and no event of default under the Loan Agreement having occurred and is continuing. The borrowings under the Loan Agreement are collateralized by substantially all of our assets, including intellectual property and certain other assets. 
 The Term Loans bear (a) cash interest at a floating rate of the higher of (i) the Wall Street Journal prime rate (or 5.00 if less) plus 1.05 , or (ii) 4.55 (interest rate of 6.05 as of September 30, 2024), and (b) additional interest (PIK Interest) at a per annum rate equal to 2.85 , with such interest being added to the outstanding principal balance of the Term Loans on a monthly basis. The monthly payments consist of interest-only through June 1, 2025 or, if prior to April 30, 2025, we achieve the Tranche 3 Milestone, subject to reasonable verification by Hercules, through June 1, 2026. Subsequent to the interest-only period, the Term Loans will be payable in equal monthly installments of principal, plus accrued and unpaid interest, through the maturity date of May 1, 2027. In addition, we are obligated to pay a final payment fee equal to the greater of (i) 2.145 million and (ii) 7.15 of the original principal amount of the Term Loans. We may elect to prepay all or a portion of the Term Loans prior to maturity, subject to a prepayment fee of up to 0.5 of the then outstanding principal balance and the pro rata application of such payment to the final payment fee. After repayment, no Term Loan amounts may be borrowed again. 
 The Loan Agreement contains certain customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default. The affirmative covenants include, among others, covenants requiring us to maintain our legal existence and governmental approvals, deliver certain financial reports, maintain insurance coverage and satisfy certain requirements regarding our operating accounts. The negative covenants include, among others, limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness and liens, merge with other companies or consummate certain changes of control, acquire other companies or businesses, make certain investments, pay dividends, transfer or dispose of assets, amend certain material agreements, including the Takeda License, or enter into various specified transactions. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, subject to any specified cure periods, all amounts owed by us would begin to bear interest at a rate that is 4.00 above the rate effective immediately before the event of default and may be declared immediately due and payable by Hercules, as collateral agent. 
 27 

On July 19, 2024, we repaid in full all outstanding indebtedness and terminated all commitments and obligations under the Loan Agreement with Hercules. We made a final payment of 28.5 million, including a final payment fee and prepayment fee of 2.3 million, under the Loan Agreement. In connection with the repayment, the Loan Agreement and the other loan documents associated therewith were terminated and the Lenders security interests in our assets and property were released. 
 At-the-Market-Offering 
 On May 12, 2023, we entered into an At-the-Market Equity Offering Sales Agreement (Sales Agreement) with Stifel, Nicolaus Company, Incorporated (the Agent), under which we may, from time to time at prevailing market prices, sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to 100.0 million in "at the market" offerings through the Agent. As of September 30, 2024, we sold an aggregate of 1,016,950 shares of common stock pursuant to the Sales Agreement for total net proceeds of approximately 14.9 million. 
 Underwritten Public Offering 
 On September 22, 2023, we completed an underwritten public offering, whereby we sold 9,200,000 shares of common stock, which included the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase 1,200,000 shares, at a public offering price of 12.50 per share for total net proceeds of 107.8 million. 
 Funding Requirements 
 Based on our current operating plan, we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements through at least the next 12 months. However, our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward-looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties, and actual results could vary materially. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could deplete our capital resources sooner than we expect. Additionally, the process of testing vaccine candidates in clinical trials is costly, and the timing of progress and expenses in these trials is uncertain. 
 Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including: 
 the initiation, type, number, scope, results, costs and timing of, preclinical studies and clinical trials of our norovirus vaccine candidates or other potential vaccine candidates we may choose to pursue in the future, including any modifications to clinical development plans based on feedback that we may receive from regulatory authorities; 

the costs and timing of manufacturing for our norovirus vaccine candidates and placebo to be used in preclinical studies and clinical trials, as well as commercial scale manufacturing, if any vaccine candidate is approved; 

the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory meetings and reviews of our norovirus vaccine candidates or any other vaccine candidates; 

any delays and cost increases that may result from any future pandemic or other disease outbreak or geopolitical events or war; 

the costs of obtaining, maintaining and enforcing our patents and other intellectual property rights; 

our efforts to enhance operational systems and hire additional personnel to satisfy our obligations as a public company, including enhanced internal controls over financial reporting; 

the costs associated with hiring additional personnel and consultants as our business grows, including additional officers and clinical development and commercial personnel; 

the terms and timing of establishing and maintaining collaborations, licenses and other similar arrangements; 

the timing and amount of the milestone, royalty or other payments we must make to Takeda and any future licensors; 

the costs and timing of establishing or securing sales and marketing capabilities if our norovirus vaccine candidates or other vaccine candidates are approved; 

28 

our ability to receive recommendations from the ACIP or other foreign NITAGs, and achieve sufficient market acceptance, coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors and adequate market share and revenue for any approved products; 

vaccine recipients willingness to pay out-of-pocket for any approved products in the absence of coverage and/or adequate reimbursement from third-party payors; and 

costs associated with any products or technologies that we may in-license or acquire. 

Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues to support our cost structure, we expect to finance our cash needs through equity offerings, debt financings, or other capital sources, including potential collaborations, licenses and other similar arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our stockholders will be or could be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our common stockholders. Debt financing and equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise funds through collaborations, or other similar arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, intellectual property, future revenue streams, research programs or vaccine candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us and/or may reduce the value of our common stock. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market our vaccine candidates even if we would otherwise prefer to develop and market such vaccine candidates ourselves.

 Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
 As of September 30, 2024, there have been no material changes outside the ordinary course of our business to the contractual obligations we reported in Management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations Contractual obligations and commitments, included in the 2023 Form 10-K. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates 
 Our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). The preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We evaluate these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
 As of September 30, 2024, there have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates from those disclosed in Management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations Critical accounting policies and estimates, included in the 2023 Form 10-K. 
 JOBS Act and Smaller Reporting Company 
 As an emerging growth company under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act), we can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This allows an emerging growth company to delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to avail ourselves of this exemption and, therefore, we will not be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. We intend to rely on other exemptions provided by the JOBS Act, including without limitation, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of Sarbanes-Oxley. As a result, our condensed consolidated financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates. 
 We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the consummation of our IPO, (ii) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least 1.235 billion, (iii) the last day of the fiscal year in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our common stock held 
 30 

by non-affiliates exceeded 700.0 million as of the last business day of the second fiscal quarter of such year, or (iv) the date on which we have issued more than 1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. 
 We are also a smaller reporting company as defined in the Exchange Act. We may continue to be a smaller reporting company even after we are no longer an emerging growth company. We may take advantage of certain of the scaled disclosures available to smaller reporting companies and will be able to take advantage of these scaled disclosures for so long as our voting and non-voting common stock held by non-affiliates is less than 250.0 million measured on the last business day of our second fiscal quarter, or our annual revenue is less than 100.0 million during the most recently completed fiscal year and our voting and non-voting common stock held by non-affiliates is less than 700.0 million measured on the last business day of our second fiscal quarter.

 PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 We are not currently subject to any material legal proceedings. From time to time, we may be involved in legal proceedings or subject to claims incident to the ordinary course of business. Regardless of the outcome, such proceedings or claims can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of resources and other factors, and there can be no assurances that favorable outcomes will be obtained.

 Use of Proceeds 
 On April 28, 2022, our registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-264159) was declared effective by the SEC for our IPO. At the closing of the offering on May 3, 2022, we sold 13,529,750 shares of common stock, which included the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase 1,764,750 additional shares, at an initial public offering price of 17.00 per share and received gross proceeds of 230.0 million, which resulted in net proceeds to us of approximately 209.5 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of approximately 16.1 million and offering-related transaction costs of approximately 4.4 million. None of the expenses associated with the initial public offering were paid to directors, officers, persons owning ten percent or more of any class of equity securities, or to their associates, or to our affiliates. J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, SVB Securities LLC, Stifel, Nicolaus Company, Incorporated and Guggenheim Securities, LLC acted as joint book-running managers for the offering. 
 There has been no material change in the planned use of proceeds from our IPO from that described in the prospectus for the IPO. As of September 30, 2024, we estimate that we have used approximately 239.4 million of the proceeds from our IPO for general corporate purposes, including to fund the clinical development of our norovirus vaccine candidates.
