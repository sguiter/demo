 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and an accumulated deficit of million as of September 30, 2024. Given the Company s projected operating requirements and its existing cash and cash equivalents, the Company is projecting insufficient liquidity to sustain its operations and meet its obligations through one year following the date that the condensed financial statements are issued. These conditions and events raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. In response to these conditions, management is currently evaluating different strategies to obtain the required funding of future operations. Financing strategies may include, but are not limited to, the public or private sale of equity, debt financing or funds from other capital sources, such as government funding, collaborations, strategic alliances, divestment of non-core assets, or licensing arrangements with third parties. There can be no assurances that the Company will be able to secure additional financing, or if available, that it will be sufficient to meet its needs or on favorable terms. Because management s plans have not yet been finalized and are not within the Company s control, the implementation of such plans cannot be considered probable. As a result, the Company has concluded that management s plans do not alleviate substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The condensed financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

All per share amounts, common shares outstanding, warrants, and stock-based compensation amounts for all periods presented have been retroactively adjusted to reflect these reverse stock splits. The shares of common stock retain a par value of per share.

The Company did t transfer any assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis to or from Level 1, Level 2 , and Level 3 during either of the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023. Fair Value Measurement of Warrant Liabilities The Company uses the Black-Scholes pricing model to determine the fair value of its warrant liabilities using Level 3 inputs. Inputs used to determine the estimated fair value of the warrant liabilities include the fair value of the underlying stock at the valuation date, the term of the warrants, and the expected volatility of the underlying stock. The significant unobservable input used in the fair value measurement of the warrant liabilities is the estimated term of the warrants.

Fair Value Measurement of the Derivative Asset The fair value of the derivative asset is determined using a binomial lattice valuation model BLM ). The application of the BLM requires the use of several inputs and significant unobservable assumptions, including volatility. Significant judgment is required in determining the expected volatility of the Company s derivative asset.

target antigens, using the Company s proprietary technology as described in the agreement. Under the agreement, Surface may purchase exclusive options, exercisable by providing a written notice to the Company, to obtain (i) an exclusive product license to make, use, sell and import products incorporating antibodies targeting the first antigen and (ii) an exclusive research tool license to use antibodies targeting the second antigen to perform research. Surface purchased the first option and exercised the second option, and we entered into an exclusive research tool license agreement with Surface in the third quarter of 2019. Under the research collaboration and license option agreement, Surface paid an upfront technology access fee of and makes milestone payments upon completion of each of designated milestones for the first target antigen specified in the agreement. For the second target antigen, Surface is obligated to make payments to the Company based on time incurred by the Company in the conduct of the work plan described in the agreement. Surface is required to reimburse the Company for expenses incurred (i) in the conduct of the work plan as detailed in the research funding budget and (ii) for patent filings and prosecution of the Company s program intellectual property as described in the agreement. The exercise of each option would also entail a license fee and annual maintenance fees, and in the case of the product license, royalties, and additional milestone payments. This agreement will expire upon the latest of the expiration of both research programs and all evaluation and testing periods. During the nine months ended September 30 , 2023, the Company recorded of revenue for achievement of a milestone event. In 2023 Surface terminated this exclusive research license agreement, for the first target, and therefore will not be required to pay the maintenance fee any longer. Surface Oncology has sublicensed this program for the second target to Coherus BioSciences, Inc. Coherus ), which is actively continuing phase 1/2 development of the second target. Coherus has assumed responsibility for the payment of the maintenance fee and other fees contemplated by the research collaboration and license option agreement for the second target. 

million in stockholders equity for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market (the Equity Standard or the alternative requirements of having a market value of listed securities of million or net income from continuing operations of in the most recently completed fiscal year or two of the last three most recently completed fiscal years (the Alternative Standards ), and may be subject to delisting. The notification letter had no immediate effect on the Company s listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market and the Company timely submitted a plan to regain compliance with the Equity Standard. On June 5, 2024, Nasdaq notified the Company that it has been provided an extension to regain and evidence compliance with the Equity Standard on or before September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, we have a stockholders' deficit of million. On October 7, 2024, the Company received a letter from the Nasdaq Listing Staff stating that the Company had not regained compliance with the Equity Standard or the Alternatives Standards and that, as a result, unless the Company timely requested an appeal of this determination to a Nasdaq Hearings Panel, Nasdaq would move to suspend trading of the Company s common stock and to have the Company s securities delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market. The Company timely appealed the determination, which automatically stayed any suspension or delisting action pending the Hearings Panel s decision and the expiration of any additional extension period granted by the Hearings Panel following the hearing set for December 5, 2024. As a result, the Company s common stock is expected to remain listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market through at least that

of our outstanding shares as of September 30, 2024, on a pre-issuance basis. Should this misunderstanding continue and a resolution be required and reached, there could be adverse impacts to the Company, including the payment of damages or the issuance of additional shares of common stock. While the Company believes that it has meritorious defenses with respect to this matter, and intends to vigorously defend its position, the process of resolving these matters is inherently uncertain and may develop over a long period of time, and so it is not possible to predict the ultimate resolution of such matter. Other Contingencies The Company is subject to claims and assessments from time to time in the ordinary course of business. The Company records a provision for a liability when it believes that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount. In the normal course of business, the Company may become involved in legal proceedings. The Company will accrue a liability for such matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. When only a range of possible loss can be established, the most probable amount in the range is accrued. If no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range, the minimum amount in the range is accrued. The accrual for a litigation loss contingency might include, for example, estimates of potential damages, outside legal fees and other directly related costs expected to be incurred. As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023 the Company was not involved in any material legal proceedings.

The Company is responsible for all maintenance, utilities, insurance, and taxes related to the facility. The Company has elected the practical expedient on not separating lease components from non-lease components. The Company accounts for its leases under ASC 842, Leases. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the condensed balance sheet. The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Right-of-use assets represent the Company s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. . The Company recognizes lease expense on a straight-line basis over the remaining lease term. As of September 30, 2024, the future minimum payments for the operating leases total , less imputed interest of , for an operating lease liability of . For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and 2023, cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities was and , respectively. Lease expense incurred under the operating lease for each of the three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was and, , respectively.

The embedded redemption features require the Company to settle the Series A Preferred Stock at the Liquidation Preference amount upon the occurrence of certain qualifying liquidation events. The holder s exercise of the embedded conversion feature when the volume weighted average price of the Common Stock for the last three trading days is greater than , as defined in the certificate of designations, settles the Series A Preferred Stock through the issuance of a variable number of Common Stock in a fixed monetary amount of per share. As these embedded features provide for settlement in nominal amounts not associated with its underlyings, the embedded features each meet the definition of a derivative. Under ASC 815, certain contractual terms that meet the accounting definition of a derivative must be accounted for separately from the financial instrument in which they are embedded (Note 2). The Company has concluded that the redemption features and the holder s option to convert when the volume weighted average price of the Common Stock for the last three trading days is greater than , as defined in the certificate of designations, constitute embedded derivative and, therefore, require bifurcation from the Series A Preferred Stock. In the event of any liquidation or deemed liquidation event, as defined in the certificate of designations, before any distribution or payment may be made to or set apart for the holders of common stock, the Series A Preferred Stock holder is entitled to receive assets from the Company equal to plus all accrued and unpaid dividends thereon, whether or not declared, per share for a total liquidation value of million as of September 30, 2024.

Upon initial issuance, the Company recorded the fair value of the embedded derivatives in the amount of thousand as a derivative asset and premium on the Series A Preferred Stock. The derivative is adjusted to fair value at each reporting period with the change in the fair value recorded in earnings. Accordingly, based upon the relative fair values of the instruments on the date of issuance, the Company allocated approximately million of the gross proceeds to the ADDF Warrants and million of the gross proceeds to the Series A Preferred Stock which is net of thousand, attributed to the derivative asset. 

, the Company sold in a public offering (i) shares of the Company s common stock together with public warrants to purchase up to shares of common stock and (ii) in lieu of shares of common stock, pre-funded warrants exercisable for shares of common stock together with public warrants

shares of common stock (the Offering ). Each public warrant had an initial exercise price equal to per share. The public warrants were immediately exercisable and had an expiration date from the date of issuance. The shares of common stock and accompanying public warrants were sold at a combined public offering price of per share and the accompanying public warrant, and the pre-funded warrants and accompanying public warrants were sold at a combined public offering price of per pre-funded warrant and accompanying public warrant, for aggregate gross proceeds of million, before deductions for placement agent and offering fees payable by the Company. The public warrants were generally subject to limitations on exercise if the aggregate number of common stock beneficially owned by the holder thereof immediately following such exercise would exceed a specified beneficial ownership limitation; provided, however, that a holder could increase or decrease the beneficial ownership limitation by giving days notice to the Company, but not to any percentage in excess of .

After delivery of a call notice, the public warrants would continue to be exercisable. Each public warrant would be canceled and no longer exercisable to the extent the holder failed to timely exercise the public warrant for the called portion thereof within trading days following the Company s issuance of a call notice. In the event of a fundamental transaction, the public warrants required the Company to make a payment based on a Black-Scholes pricing model valuation, using specific inputs that precluded the instruments from being considered indexed to the Company s own stock in accordance with ASC 815. The public warrants also contained certain terms that provided for an adjustment in response to the occurrence or nonoccurrence of a specified event that is inconsistent with an implicit assumption in a standard valuation model, which also precluded the instruments from being considered indexed to the Company s stock in accordance with ASC 815. Therefore, upon issuance, the Company accounted for the public warrants as liabilities, which were recorded at the issuance date fair value of approximately million. In March 2024, the Company entered into warrant amendment agreements with holders of approximately of the public warrants issued in the Offering to amend aforementioned terms in the public warrants.

The private placement warrants are immediately exercisable and expire from the date of issuance and the Company had the right to call any portion of the private placement warrants under the same conditions and terms as the public warrants. The private placement warrants were subject to the same beneficial ownership limitations as the public warrants and the pre-funded warrants. Upon issuance, the private placement warrants were precluded from being considered indexed to the Company s own stock in accordance with ASC 815. Therefore, at issuance, the private placement warrants were liability-classified and recorded at their respective issuance date fair values.

Upon issuance, the private placement warrants were precluded from being considered indexed to the Company s own stock in accordance with ASC 815. Therefore, at issuance, the private placement warrants were liability-classified and recorded at their issuance date fair value. In March 2024, the Company entered into warrant amendment agreements with holders of of the private placement warrants issued in November 2023 and holders of of the private placement warrants issued in the February 2024 SPA to amend the aforementioned terms in the private placement warrants. As a result, of the November 2023 and February 2024 SPA private placement warrants, as amended, were no longer precluded from being considered indexed to the Company's stock in accordance with ASC 815. The Company reclassified million of the amended private placement warrants, as equity, in the Company's condensed statements of stockholders' equity/deficit for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, based on the guidance provided under ASC 815-40. The private placement warrants, as amended, were marked to fair value on the amendment date resulting in a gain on change in fair value of warrant liabilities of million in the Company's condensed statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

The Company had the right to call any portion of these private placement warrants under the same conditions and terms as the February private placement warrants. The Company evaluated the March 2024 private placement warrants and concluded that they met the criteria to be classified within stockholders equity within additional paid-in-capital. These private placement warrants are equity classified because they (1) are freestanding financial instruments that are legally detachable and separately exercisable from the common stock, (2) are immediately exercisable, (3) do not embody an obligation for the Company to repurchase its shares, (4) permit the holder to receive a fixed number of shares of common stock upon exercise, (5) are indexed to the Company's common stock and (6) meet the equity classification criteria.

The Company revalued the Offering public warrants and the February 2024 SPA liability classified private placement warrants on September 17, 2024, resulting in a fair value of million. The decrease in the fair value of the common stock warrant liability throughout the year resulted in an offsetting gain on common stock warrant liabilities in the Statements of Operations. The exercise of the Existing Warrants resulted in the Company issuing shares of common stock and, pursuant to terms of the Existing Warrants, the pre-funding of shares of common stock underlying Existing Warrants where the applicable Holder would have exceeded a specified beneficial ownership limitation contained in the applicable Existing Warrant if shares of common stock had been issued. The gross proceeds to the Company from the exercise of the Existing Warrants and the sale of the New Warrants are approximately million, prior to deducting financial advisory fees and estimated transaction expenses.

 Company Overview 
 We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company engaged in the discovery and development of targeted biotherapeutics to treat serious diseases and conditions with unmet medical needs, including neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, and autoimmune disorders. We believe we are the leader in the field of semaphorin 4D, or SEMA4D, biology and that we are the only company targeting SEMA4D as a potential treatment for neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, and autoimmune disorders. SEMA4D is an extracellular signaling molecule that regulates the activity of immune and inflammatory cells at sites of injury, cancer, or infection. We are leveraging our SEMA4D antibody platform and our extensive knowledge of SEMA4D biology to develop our lead product candidate, pepinemab, an antibody that we believe utilizes novel mechanisms of action. We are focused on developing pepinemab for the treatment of Alzheimer s disease, Huntington s disease, head and neck cancer, and pancreatic cancer. Additionally, third party investigators are studying pepinemab in clinical trials in breast cancer, as well as in window of opportunity studies in other indications, including head and neck cancer, and melanoma. We have developed multiple proprietary platform technologies and are developing product candidates to address serious diseases or conditions that have a substantial impact on day-to-day functioning and for which treatment is not addressed adequately by available therapies. We employ our proprietary platform technologies, including through our work with our academic collaborators, to identify potential product candidates for sustained expansion of our internal product pipeline and to facilitate strategic development and commercial partnerships. 
 Our lead platform technologies include our SEMA4D antibody platform and our ActivMAb antibody discovery platform. Our lead product candidate, pepinemab, is currently in clinical development for the treatment of Alzheimer s disease, head and neck, pancreatic and breast cancer, through our efforts or through investigator-sponsored trials. Our additional product candidates, VX5 (CXCL13 Mab) and CXCR5 Mab are in earlier stages of development and were selected using our ActivMAb platform. We believe our multiple platform technologies position us well for continued pipeline expansion and partnership opportunities going forward. 
 We have generated a limited amount of service revenue from collaboration agreements but have not generated any revenue from sales of our product candidates to date. We continue to incur significant development and other expenses related to our ongoing operations. As a result, we are not and have never been profitable and have incurred losses in each period since our inception, resulting in substantial doubt in our ability to continue as a going concern. We reported a net loss of 5.7 million and 4.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and a net loss of 15.3 million and 16.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of 2.9 million and 1.5 million, respectively. We expect to continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future, and we expect these losses to increase as we continue our research and development of, and seek regulatory approvals for, our product candidates. We may also encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, 
 26 

delays, and other unknown factors which may adversely affect our business. The size of our future net losses will depend, in part, on the rate of future growth of our expenses and our ability to generate revenues, if any. 
 Our recurring net losses and negative cash flows from operations raised substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the issuance of our condensed financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Until we can generate sufficient revenue from the commercialization of our product candidates, we expect to finance our operations through the public or private sale of equity, debt financing or other capital sources, such as government funding, collaborations, strategic alliances, divestment of non-core assets, or licensing arrangements with third parties. To date, we have relied on equity and debt financing to fund its operations, in addition to capital contributions from noncontrolling interests and a limited amount of service revenue from collaboration agreements. 
 In August 2024, we called for cancellation the public warrants and the private placement warrants pursuant to terms of the warrants permitting us to call the warrants for cancellation following the announcement of a statistically significant increase in FDG-PET signal in patients in our SIGNAL-AD trial of pepinemab for the treatment of Alzheimer s disease. All of the public warrants and private placement warrants not exercised pursuant to the Inducement Letter Agreements were thereafter canceled in September 2024. As of September 30, 2024, none of the private placement warrants or the public warrants were outstanding. A holder of certain of the warrants that we called for cancellation has notified us that it believes that the warrants it held are still outstanding. The number of shares represented by these canceled warrants represents approximately 8 of our outstanding shares as of September 30, 2024, on a pre-issuance basis. Should this misunderstanding continue and a resolution be required and reached, there could be adverse impacts to the Company, including the payment of damages or the issuance of additional shares of common stock. 
 On September 17, 2024, we entered into the Inducement Letter Agreements with the Holders of the Existing Warrants. Pursuant to the Inducement Letter Agreements, the Holders agreed to exercise for cash the Existing Warrants at a reduced exercise price of 5.636 per share in consideration of our agreement to issue the New Warrants to purchase up to 1,601,238 shares of common stock, which were issued and sold in a private placement at a price of 0.125 per New Warrant. Each New Warrant had an initial exercise price equal to 5.636 per share, was immediately exercisable, and expires September 18, 2029. The gross proceeds to us from the exercise of the Existing Warrants and the sale of the New Warrants were approximately 6.2 million, prior to deducting financial advisory fees and estimated transaction expenses. FCMI Parent Co. FCMI ), which is controlled by Albert D. Friedberg, the chairman of our board of directors, and Vaccinex (Rochester) L.L.C., which is majority owned and controlled by Dr. Maurice Zauderer, our President, Chief Executive Officer, and a member of our board of directors, participated in the transactions contemplated by the Inducement Letter Agreements. 
 On March 28, 2024, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with Alzheimer s Drug Discovery Foundation pursuant to which we sold shares of a newly designated series of convertible preferred stock, our Series A Preferred Stock, and warrants to purchase up to 229,057 shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of 1.75 million. 
 On March 27, 2024, we entered into a securities purchase agreement pursuant to which we issued and sold 193,000 shares of our common stock in a public offering together with warrants to purchase up to 193,000 shares of common stock in a concurrent private placement at a combined price of 7.77 per share and accompanying warrant for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 1.5 million. Separately on March 27, 2024, we entered into a securities purchase agreement in a different form pursuant to which we sold 159,683 shares of common stock and warrants to purchase up to 159,683 shares of common stock in a private placement at a combined price of 7.77 per share and accompanying warrant for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 1.25 million. FCMI and Vaccinex (Rochester) L.L.C. purchased shares of our common stock and accompanying warrants in the latter transaction. 
 On February 6, 2024, we entered into a securities purchase agreement pursuant to which we issued and sold 274,182 shares of our common stock together with warrants to purchase up to 274,182 shares of common stock at a combined price of 10.15 per share and accompanying warrant and (ii) pre-funded warrants to purchase up to 90,363 shares of common stock together with warrants to purchase up to 90,363 shares of our common stock at a combined price of 10.1486 per pre-funded warrant and accompanying warrant, for aggregate gross proceeds of 
 27 

approximately 3.7 million. FCMI and Vaccinex (Rochester) L.L.C. purchased 118,227 and 29,557 shares of our common stock and accompanying warrants, respectively, in the February 2024 offering for an aggregate purchase price of 1.5 million. 
 
 Our cash and cash equivalents were 2.9 million and total current assets were 4.8 million at September 30, 2024, which will be insufficient to fund our planned operations through one year of the date that these condensed financial statements are available for issuance. See Note 1 of our unaudited condensed financial statements. There can be no assurances that we will be able to secure additional financing when needed, or if available, that it will be sufficient to meet our needs or on favorable terms. 
 Nasdaq Deficiency Notice 
 On April 11, 2024, the Company received a letter from the Listing Qualifications staff of Nasdaq notifying the Company that based on the financial statements contained in its Form 10-K for the year-ended December 31, 2023, it no longer complies with the requirement under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) to maintain a minimum of 2.5 million in stockholders equity for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market (the Equity Standard or the alternative requirements of having a market value of listed securities of 35.0 million or net income from continuing operations of 500,000 in the most recently completed fiscal year or two of the last three most recently completed fiscal years (the Alternative Standards , and may be subject to delisting. The notification letter had no immediate effect on the Company s listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market and the Company timely submitted a plan to regain compliance with the Equity Standard. 
 On June 5, 2024, Nasdaq notified the Company that it has been provided an extension to regain and evidence compliance with the Equity Standard on or before September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, we had a stockholders' deficit of 1.3 million. On October 7, 2024, the Company received a letter from the Nasdaq Listing Staff stating that the Company had not regained compliance with the Equity Standard or the Alternatives Standards and that, as a result, unless the Company timely requested an appeal of this determination to a Nasdaq Hearings Panel, Nasdaq would move to suspend trading of the Company s common stock and to have the Company s securities delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market. The Company timely appealed the determination, which automatically stayed any suspension or delisting action pending the Hearings Panel s decision and the expiration of any additional extension period granted by the Hearings Panel following the hearing set for December 5, 2024. As a result, the Company s common stock is expected to remain listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market through at least that time. However, there can be no assurance that the Hearings Panel will grant the Company s request for continued listing or that the Company will be able to demonstrate compliance with the Equity Standard or the Alternative Standards within any additional compliance period that may be granted by the Hearings Panel. 
 Clinical Update 
 Alzheimer's Disease 
 The Company initiated a randomized, placebo-controlled, multi-center phase 1/2a clinical study of pepinemab in AD, or the SIGNAL-AD trial, in 2021. On March 28, 2024, we entered into a second agreement with Alzheimer s Drug Discovery Foundation pursuant to which we sold shares of a newly designated series of convertible preferred stock, our Series A Preferred Stock, and warrants to purchase up to 229,057 shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of 1.75 million. This trial is based on evidence from the SIGNAL clinical trial in HD that showed treatment with pepinemab reduced cognitive decline and induced a sharp increase in glucose metabolism in the brain during HD disease progression as detected by conventional FDG-PET imaging. Previous studies in AD have shown that decline in glucose metabolism correlates with cognitive decline. In April 2023, we reached our enrollment target for the Phase 1b/2 SIGNAL-AD study evaluating pepinemab as a potential treatment for people with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) or mild dementia due to AD. On April 25, the Company provided an update regarding plans for analysis of biomarkers and clinical outcome measures during a presentation at 12th Annual Alzheimer s Parkinson s Drug Development Summit. All 50 participants have completed 12-months of treatment on June 30, 2024, and SIGNAL-AD topline data was reported by Eric Siemers, MD, Principal Investigator of the SIGNAL-AD trial at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference in Philadelphia on July 31, 2024. Additional efficacy data for SIGNAL-AD was reported by Elizabeth Evans, PhD, Senior VP Discovery and 
 28 

Translational Research and Chief Operating Officer on October 31, 2024, at the Clinical Trials on Alzheimer s Disease Conference in Madrid, Spain. 
 An important secondary endpoint of the study was to determine whether pepinemab prevents decline in brain metabolic activity consistent with blocking astrocyte reactivity as evidenced by an increase in FDG-PET imaging signal in a major brain region known to be affected by disease progression. This was determined over the course of 12-months of treatment with pepinemab relative to placebo. Pepinemab treatment resulted in a statistically significant increase (p=0.0297) in FDG-PET signal in the medial temporal cortex of patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) due to AD. The medial temporal region of brain includes hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, known to be affected during early disease progression in many patients with MCI. A similar significant result of pepinemab treatment on brain metabolic activity was previously shown in our phase 2 study of HD, which we believe highlights mechanistic similarities in the pathology of these two neurodegenerative diseases. 
 Although the present study was not sufficiently powered to detect cognitive effects or changes in some additional secondary endpoints with statistical significance, we previously reported that, in a larger study that enrolled approximately 90 HD patients/arm with early symptoms of cognitive deficits, seemingly similar to MCI in AD, pepinemab treatment improved performance on key cognitive and psychological measures. 
 We believe that results of the SIGNAL-AD study demonstrate that pepinemab has a similar effect in Alzheimer s to those we previously described for a key outcome in Huntington s disease, preventing the characteristic disease-related decline of brain metabolic activity in a brain region known to be affected early in disease progression. This positive data release suggests that pepinemab has the potential to benefit patients with MCI due to AD. AD and HD share important pathological features and clinical symptoms, and we believe that our approach of confirming similar treatment effects of pepinemab in these two different neurodegenerative diseases is strongly supportive of pepinemab as a potentially well-tolerated and effective treatment for both Alzheimer s and Huntington s disease. 
 Our study indicates that pepinemab may be most effective in patients with early stage symptoms, e.g., Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) or Mild Dementia due to AD. This suggests that a promising treatment strategy would be to identify people with MCI as early as possible and to treat with pepinemab to keep them from progressing for as long as possible. We believe that, to date, no disease modifying therapy has been shown to be effective in later stages of AD dementia. 
 The Alzheimer s Association estimates that 12 to 18 of people age 60 or older are living with MCI due to AD and that about one-third of these patients will develop dementia within five years. A drug that can slow progression of MCI could significantly extend a rewarding and productive life for people at risk. 
 Pepinemab has been well-tolerated in clinical trials that enrolled a total of more than 600 patients primarily in neurological indications, AD, HD, and MS. Current concerns about the limitations of treatment with approved anti-A amyloid antibodies such as Leqembi (Eisai and Biogen) and Kisunla (Eli Lilly) might make pepinemab, if approved, attractive as either an alternative for patients at high risk for adverse events related to treatment with Leqembi or Kisunla, and could also be a complementary treatment to enhance benefit of such anti-A antibodies to patients. 
 Cancer 
 As prespecified in the study protocol, the Company analyzed interim data from the first 36 patients in the open-label, single-arm, Phase 2 KEYNOTE B-84 study (NCT04815720) evaluating pepinemab and KEYTRUDA in immunotherapy na ve patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). The study was based on preclinical and clinical studies demonstrating that antibody blockade of semaphorin 4D (SEMA4D) in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) promotes infiltration of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells and inhibits the recruitment and function of myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) in tumors, enabling enhanced ICI efficacy. The study results showed that pepinemab in combination with KEYTRUDA resulted in an approximately 2X increase in objective responses (ORR) and median progression free survival (PFS) in patients with hard-to-treat PD-L1-low tumors, those with combined positive score 
 29 

of 5.79 months, which is almost 2X that of historical response to checkpoint monotherapy in this population, ORR 11.9 and PFS 2.2 months. In contrast, patients in the CPS > 20 subgroup (n=17) responded similarly to historical ICI monotherapy data. Biopsy data suggest that treatment-induced formation of highly organized lymphoid aggregates, tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS), correlate with disease control. TLS are characterized by a high density of B cells, antigen-presenting dendritic cells and activated T cells including stem-like TCF-1+, PD-1+, CD8+ T cells whose expansion and differentiation has previously been shown to be central for response to checkpoint inhibitors. The safety of pepinemab in combination with KEYTRUDA is regularly reviewed by an independent safety committee and has to date been found to be well tolerated. 
 
 In January and March 2024, the Company and its collaborators presented posters at the ASCO Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium and the Society for Surgical Oncology Annual Meeting, respectively: 
 Phase 1b/2 PDAC Study : The team from University of Rochester Cancer Center and Wilmot Cancer Institute presented the plan for the single-arm, open-label study to evaluate pepinemab in combination with BAVENCIO (avelumab) as second line combination immunotherapy for patients with metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC, TPS4195 , NCT05102721). The Company-sponsored study will employ a Bayesian Optimal Interval (BOIN) Design in the Phase 1b segment and a Simon two stage assessment in the Phase 2 segment and is expected to enroll 40 subjects. The trial rationale is supported by data from prior studies suggesting that pepinemab may reduce immune suppression in the TME, rendering cold tumors such as PDAC to become hot and enhancing efficacy of ICIs such as avelumab. The study is being conducted with grant support from the Gateway Discovery Award. 

Financial Overview 
 Revenue 
 To date, we have not generated any revenue from sales of our product candidates. The Company recorded service revenue of 52,000 and 20,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company recorded service revenue of 388,000 and 70,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 500,000 in revenue related to the achievement of a contractual milestone during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 from our collaboration agreement with Surface Oncology. 
 
 Our ability to generate revenue and become profitable depends on our ability to successfully obtain marketing approval of and commercialize our product candidates. We do not expect to generate product revenue in the foreseeable future as we continue our development of, and seek regulatory approvals for, our product candidates, and potentially commercialize approved products, if any. 
 Operating Expenses 
 Research and Development. Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs for our clinical trials and activities related to regulatory filings, employee compensation-related costs, supply expenses, equipment depreciation and amortization, consulting, and other miscellaneous costs. The following table sets forth the components of our research and development expenses and the amount as a percentage of total research and development expenses for the periods indicated.

We expense research and development costs as incurred. We record costs for certain development activities, such as clinical trials, based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using data such as patient enrollment. We do not allocate employee-related costs, depreciation, rental and other indirect costs to specific research and development programs because these costs are deployed across multiple product programs under research and development. 
 Our current research and development activities primarily relate to clinical development in the following indications: 
 Alzheimer s Disease. We initiated a randomized, placebo-controlled, multi-center phase 1/2a clinical study of pepinemab in AD, or the SIGNAL-AD trial, in 2021. This trial is based on evidence from the SIGNAL clinical trial in HD that showed treatment with pepinemab reduced cognitive decline and induced a sharp increase in glucose metabolism in the brain during HD disease progression as detected by conventional FDG-PET imaging. Previous studies in AD have shown that decline in glucose metabolism correlates with cognitive decline. In April 2023, we reached our enrollment target for the Phase 1b/2 SIGNAL-AD study evaluating pepinemab as a potential treatment for people with mild dementia due to AD. As of June 6, 2024, the last patient completed their last visit in the SIGNAL-AD Phase 1b/2 study of pepinemab treatment for Alzheimer s disease. SIGNAL-AD topline data was reported by Eric Siemers, MD, Principal Investigator of the SIGNAL-AD trial at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference in Philadelphia on July 31, 2024. Additional efficacy data for SIGNAL-AD was reported by Elizabeth Evans, PhD, Senior VP Discovery and Translational Research and Chief Operating Officer on October 31, 2024 at the Clinical Trials on Alzheimer s Disease Conference in Madrid, Spain. 

Cancer Studies. We and others have shown that SEMA4D, the target of pepinemab, is highly expressed in head and neck cancer where it impedes recruitment and activation of cytotoxic T cells that can attack the tumor while also inducing differentiation of myeloid derived suppressor cells that inhibit any remaining tumoricidal immune activity. Head and neck cancer is, therefore, a cancer in which immunotherapy with pepinemab in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor such as KEYTRUDA could be uniquely effective. We have entered into a collaboration with Merck, Sharp Dohme, who is supplying KEYTRUDA, for first-line treatment of head and neck cancer patients and have analyzed interim data from the first 36 patients in the study. In a similar arrangement, we are collaborating with Merck KGaA (EMD Serono in the U.S.), who is supplying Bavencio, another checkpoint inhibitor, for combination with pepinemab in pancreatic cancer. Pepinemab is also being evaluated by third parties in investigator-sponsored trials, or ISTs, for breast cancer, and in multiple window of opportunity studies in additional cancer indications. 

Huntington s Disease. We have currently paused our research efforts for HD. We evaluated pepinemab for the treatment of HD in our Phase 2 SIGNAL trial. Topline data for this trial, consisting of 265 subjects, was reported in late September 2020. Although the study did not meet its prespecified primary endpoints, it provided important new information, including evidence of cognitive benefit and a reduction in brain atrophy and increase in brain metabolic activity in patients with manifest disease symptoms. An improved study design would focus on patients with early signs of cognitive or functional deficits since they appeared to derive the greatest treatment benefit. The Company is evaluating its development strategy in terms of business opportunity and other near-term clinical activities. To advance planning for a potential phase 3 study of pepinemab in HD, we requested a Type C meeting with the FDA to discuss details of the study design and key endpoints. We received requested clarifications regarding suitable endpoints for regulatory review from the FDA, and these will be incorporated in a possible future phase 3 study.

 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 To date, we have not generated any revenue from sales of our product candidates. Our recurring net losses and negative cash flows from operations raised substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the issuance of our unaudited condensed financial statements. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and the year-ended December 31, 2023, we have generated a limited amount of revenue through the achievement of contractually stated milestones as well as grants, and the performance of services from collaboration agreements, including through our ActivMAb platform. See Note 1 of our unaudited condensed financial statements. Since our inception in 2001, we have relied on public and private sales of equity and debt financing to fund our operations, in addition to capital contributions from noncontrolling interests and limited-service revenue from collaboration agreements. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company sold 208 shares of the Company s common stock at a weighted average price per share of 10.30 through the Open Market Sale Agreement, for net proceeds of 2,077, respectively. 
 Additionally, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 the Company received aggregate gross proceeds of approximately 14.1 million from (i) private placements of 433,865 shares of common stock, 90,363 pre-funded warrants and 717,228 warrants to purchase shares of common stock (ii) a public offering of 193,000 shares of common stock (iii) sale of 10 shares of our Series A Preferred Stock, and warrants to purchase up to 229,057 shares of our common stock, and (iv) exercise of warrants. 
 Series A Preferred Stock 
 On March 28, 2024, we sold shares of a newly designated series of our preferred stock, the Series A Preferred Stock. Our Series A Preferred Stock is convertible at the election of the holder at any time after the public announcement by the Company of top-line data from its SIGNAL-AD Alzheimer s disease study (the Data Release into shares of common stock at a conversion price equal to the greater of (a) 7.77 per share of common 
 33 

stock and (b)(i) the volume weighted average price of the common stock for the last three trading days prior to delivery of the conversion notice if the common stock is traded on a trading market or if its prices are reported on OTCQB or OTCQX, (ii) the most recent bid price of the common stock if it is then traded on The Pink Open Market, or (iii) in all other cases the fair market value of the common stock as determined by an independent appraiser, which conversion right is subject to termination on the last full day preceding the proposed effective date for exercise of the Company s redemption right or the date fixed for redemption upon a Deemed Liquidation Event (generally defined to include certain fundamental transactions involving the company including a merger or sale of substantially all of the Company s assets) or on a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company. 
 The Series A Preferred Stock is non-voting, has no mandatory redemption, and carries an annual 5 cumulative dividend, increasing by 2 each year, which dividend rate shall not exceed 12 . The Series A Preferred Stock will also participate on an as-converted basis in any regular or special dividends paid to holders of our common stock. 
 In addition, the Series A Preferred Stock has a liquidation preference equal to the greater of (i) 175,000 per share, subject to appropriate adjustment in the event of any stock dividend, stock split, combination or other similar recapitalization with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock (the Original Share Price ), plus any accrued but unpaid dividends thereon, whether or not declared, together with any other dividends declared but unpaid thereon, or (ii) such amount per share as would have been payable had all shares of Series A Preferred Stock been converted into common stock immediately prior to such liquidation, dissolution, winding up or Deemed Liquidation Event. 
 The Company also agreed that so long as the Series A Preferred Stock is outstanding, the Company will not, without the written consent of the holders of 50.1 of the Series A Preferred Stock, (i) amend, alter, or repeal any provision of the Company s certificate of incorporation or bylaws in a manner adverse to the Series A Preferred Stock or (ii) until March 29, 2026, incur any indebtedness for borrowed money in excess of 1.0 million. 
 The Company has the right to redeem the Series A Preferred Stock at a price equal to the Original Share Price per share at any time after a public announcement of an increase in pepinemab-treated patients relative to placebo-treated patients, with statistical significance having a p-value of less than or equal to 0.05, in the change of the FDG-PET standard uptake value ratio for brain metabolism between baseline and month 12 as assessed by [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET in the resting state following administration of 40 mg/kg pepinemab or placebo, as applicable, as described in the protocol for the Company s SIGNAL-AD Alzheimer s disease study and the associated Statistical Analysis Plan, provided that (i) the holder is not in possession of any material nonpublic information that was provided by the Company or any of its directors, directors, employees, agents, or affiliates and (ii) there is an effective resale registration statement on file covering the underlying common stock. 
 The holders of outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock have no voting rights with respect to such shares of Series A Preferred Stock on any matter presented to the Company s stockholders, except as required by law or as specifically set forth in the Certificate of Designation of Series A Preferred Stock. 
 Operating Capital Requirements 
 Our primary uses of capital are, and we expect will continue to be, compensation and related expenses, third-party research services and amounts due to vendors for research supplies. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our principal source of liquidity was cash and cash equivalents in the amount of 2.9 million and 1.5 million, respectively. Given our projected operating requirements, our existing cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, we will seek to complete an additional financing transaction or transactions in order to continue operations. 
 Since our inception in 2001, we have incurred significant net losses and negative cash flows from operations. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we reported a net loss of 15.3 million and 16.9 million, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we reported cash used in operations of 12.3 million and 13.6 million, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had an accumulated deficit of 355.2 million and 339.9 million, respectively. We anticipate that we will continue to generate losses for the foreseeable future, and we expect the losses to increase as we continue the development of, and seek regulatory approvals for, our product candidates. We are subject to risks associated with the development of new 
 34 

biopharmaceutical products, and we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays, and other unknown factors, which may adversely affect our business. 
 Our recurring net losses and negative cash flows from operations, as well as forecast of continued losses and negative cash flows from operations, raised substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the issuance of our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023. Until we can generate a sufficient amount of revenue from the commercialization of our product candidates, we expect to finance our operations through the public or private sale of equity, debt financing, or other capital sources, such as government funding, collaborations, strategic alliances, divestment of non-core assets, or licensing arrangements with third parties. Our cash and cash equivalents were 2.9 million and total current assets were 4.8 million at September 30, 2024, which the Company is projecting will be insufficient to sustain its operations through one year following the date that the financial statements are issued. 
 Financing strategies we may pursue include, but are not limited to, the public or private sale of equity, debt financing or funds from other capital sources, such as government funding, collaborations, strategic alliances, or licensing arrangements with third parties. There can be no assurances additional capital will be available to secure additional financing, or if available, that it will be sufficient to meet our needs on favorable terms. If we are unable to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development of one or more of our product candidates. If we raise additional funds through the public or private sale of equity or debt financing, it could result in dilution to our existing stockholders or increased fixed payment obligations and these securities may have rights senior to those of our common stock and could contain covenants that would restrict our operations and potentially impair our competitiveness, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, limitations on our ability to acquire, sell or license our intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. Any of these events could significantly harm our business, financial condition, and prospects. 
 Cash Flows 
 The following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented: 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 

2024 

2023 

(in thousands) 

Cash used in operating activities 

(12,254) 

(13,642) 

Cash used in investing activities

(67) 

Cash provided by financing activities 

13,647 

7,445 

Operating Activities. We have historically experienced negative cash flows as we have developed our product candidates and continued to expand our business. Our net cash used in operating activities primarily results from our net loss adjusted for non-cash expenses and changes in working capital components as we have continued our research and development and is influenced by the timing of cash payments for research related expenses. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are compensation and related expenses, employee-related expenditures, third-party research services and amounts due to vendors for research supplies. Our cash flows from operating activities will continue to be affected principally by the extent to which we increase spending on personnel, research and development and other operating activities as our business grows. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, operating activities used 12.3 million and 13.6 million, respectively, in cash, primarily as a result of our continued efforts of discovery and development of targeted biotherapeutics to treat serious diseases and conditions with unmet medical needs without any product revenue, resulting in a net loss of 15.3 million and 16.9 million, respectively. 
 Investing Activities. The investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, were due to purchases of property and equipment. 
 Financing Activities. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, financing activities provided 14.1 million, from the private placement of common stock and pre-funded warrants, with accompanying warrants, the 
 35 

public offering of common stock and private placement of accompanying warrants, the sale of Series A Preferred Stock and accompanying warrants, and the exercise of warrants. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, financing activities provided a net of 7.4 million, of which 6.3 million was due to private placements of common stock, 1.0 million through an award from the Alzheimer s Drug Discovery Foundation in the form of an investment in our common stock and 0.2 million was due to the issuance of the Company s common stock pursuant to the Open Market Sale Agreement. 
 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Our unaudited condensed financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these condensed financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, expenses, and related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates. 
 There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and significant judgments during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, other than those discussed in Note 2 of our unaudited condensed financial statements as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, included elsewhere in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. 
 Impact of Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
 For a discussion on the impact of recent accounting pronouncements on our business, see Note 2 to our unaudited condensed financial statements.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitati ve Disclosures about Market Risk 
 
 As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide the information required by this item. 
 Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 
 Our Chief Executive Officer (our principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (our principal financial officer), with the participation of our management evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, as of September 30, 2024, the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
 Changes in internal control over financial reporting 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rules 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Part II - OTHER INFORMATION 
 Item 1A. Ri sk Factors 
 An investment in our stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks set forth in this section, and in Part I, Item 1A of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 (the "Annual Report"), and all of the other information set forth in this Report, the Annual Report, and in the other reports we file with the SEC. If any of the risks contained in those reports actually occur, our business, results of operation, financial condition, and liquidity could be harmed, the value of our securities could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes from risk factors disclosed in the Annual Report on Form 10-K. See the discussion of the Company s risk factors under Part I, Item 1A. of the Annual Report. 
 We are currently not in compliance with the continued listing standards of the Nasdaq Capital Market, and if we are unable to regain compliance, our common stock will be delisted from the exchange. 
 Our common stock is currently listed for trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol VCNX." The continued listing of our common stock on Nasdaq is subject to our compliance with a number of listing standards, including Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(1) to maintain a minimum of 2.5 million in stockholders equity (the Equity Standard or the alternative requirements of having a market value of listed securities of 35 million or net income from continuing operations of 500,000 in the most recently completed fiscal year or two of the last three most recently completed fiscal years (the Alternative Standards ). On April 11, 2024, Nasdaq informed us that based on the financial statements contained in our Form 10-K for the year-ended December 31, 2023, the Company is no longer in compliance with the Equity Standard or the Alternative Standards and we may be subject to delisting. The notification letter had no immediate effect on the Company s listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market and the Company timely submitted a plan to regain compliance with the Equity Standard. 
 On June 5, 2024, Nasdaq notified the Company that it has been provided an extension to regain and evidence compliance with the Equity Standard on or before September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, we had a stockholders' deficit of 1.3 million. On October 7, 2024, the Company received a letter from the Nasdaq Listing Staff stating that the Company had not regained compliance with the Equity Standard or the Alternatives Standards and that, as a result, unless the Company timely requested an appeal of this determination to a Nasdaq Hearings Panel, Nasdaq would move to suspend trading of the Company s common stock and to have the Company s securities delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market. The Company timely appealed the determination, which automatically stayed any suspension or delisting action pending the Hearings Panel s decision and the expiration of any additional extension period granted by the Hearings Panel following the hearing set for December 5, 2024. As a result, the Company s common stock is expected to remain listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market through at least that time. However, there can be no assurance that the Hearings Panel will grant the Company s request for continued listing or that the Company will be able to demonstrate compliance with the Equity Standard or the Alternative Standards within any additional compliance period that may be granted by the Hearings Panel. 
 A delisting or even notification of failure to comply with such requirements would likely have a negative effect on the price of our common stock and would impair your ability to sell or purchase our common stock when you wish to do so. In addition, the delisting of our common stock could lead to a number of other negative implications such as a loss of media and analyst coverage, a determination that our common stock is a penny stock which will require brokers trading in our common stock to adhere to more stringent rules and likely result in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our securities, and materially adversely impact our ability to raise capital on acceptable terms or at all. Delisting from Nasdaq could also have other negative results, including the potential loss of confidence by our current or prospective third-party providers and collaboration partners, the loss of institutional investor interest, and fewer licensing and partnering opportunities. In the event of a delisting, we would take actions to restore our compliance with Nasdaq s listing requirements, but we can provide no assurance that any such action would allow our common stock to become listed again, stabilize the market price or improve the liquidity of our common stock, prevent our common stock from dropping below the Nasdaq minimum bid price requirement or prevent future non-compliance with Nasdaq s listing requirements. 
 38 

If our common stock were no longer listed on Nasdaq, investors might only be able to trade on one of the over-the-counter markets, if at all. There is no assurance that prices for our common stock would be quoted on one of these other trading systems or that an active trading market for our common stock would exist, which would materially and adversely impact the market value of our common stock and your ability to sell our common stock. 
 The Series A Preferred Stock ranks senior to the Company s common stock with respect to rights on the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution and winding up. 
 The Series A Preferred Stock has a liquidation preference before our common stockholders equal to the greater of (i) 175,000 per share for a total of 1.75 million, subject to appropriate adjustment in the event of any stock dividend, stock split, combination or other similar recapitalization with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock (the Original Share Price ), plus any accrued but unpaid dividends thereon, whether or not declared, together with any other dividends declared but unpaid thereon, or (ii) such amount per share as would have been payable had all shares of Series A Preferred Stock been converted into common stock immediately prior to such liquidation, dissolution, winding up or Deemed Liquidation Event. As of September 30, 2024, the holder of the shares of Series A preferred stock were entitled to a liquidation preference of 1.75 million, in the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company. Further, upon the occurrence of Deemed Liquidation Event (generally defined to include certain fundamental transactions involving the Company including a merger or sale of substantially all of the Company s assets) or other liquidation of the Company, the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock will receive a distribution of the Company s assets per their liquidation preference before any holders of common stock receive a distribution. As a result, in the event of a liquidation of the Company the proceeds received by the common stockholder may be reduced. 
 Shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of our Series A Preferred Stock will be dilutive to our existing shareholders upon conversion and adversely affect the market price of our common stock. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we had outstanding 10 shares of Series A Preferred Stock with an aggregate liquidation preference of 1.75 million. No shares of the outstanding Series A Preferred Stock are convertible before the public announcement by the Company of top-line data from its study SEMA4D Blockade Safety and Brain Metabolic Activity in Alzheimer s Disease (AD) (the Data Release ). The Data Release was made on July 31, 2024, but no shares of Series A Preferred Stock have to date been converted into shares of common stock. The issuance of common stock upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock would result in immediate dilution to existing holders of our common stock. 
 The Alzheimer s Drug Discovery Foundation may be able to sell shares of our common stock in the public market, which may cause the market price of our common stock to decrease, and therefore make it more difficult to raise equity financing or issue equity as consideration in an acquisition. 
 Our registration rights agreement with the Alzheimer s Drug Discovery Foundation requires us to register all shares of common stock held by the Alzheimer s Drug Discovery Foundation issuable upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock and upon the exercise of certain warrants issued in connection with the Series A Preferred Stock under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The registration rights for the Alzheimer s Drug Discovery Foundation allows it to sell its shares without compliance with the volume and manner of sale limitations under Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act and facilitates the resale of such securities into the public market. The market value of our common stock could decline as a result of sales by the Alzheimer s Drug Discovery Foundation from time to time. In particular, the future sale of a substantial number of the shares of our common stock by the Alzheimer s Drug Discovery Foundation within a short period of time, or the perception that such sale might occur, could cause our stock price to decrease, make it more difficult for us to raise funds through future offerings of our common stock or acquire other businesses in the future using our common stock as consideration for the purchase price.
