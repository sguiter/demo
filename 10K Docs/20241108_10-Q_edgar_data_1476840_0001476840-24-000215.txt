 Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements about us and our industry that involve substantial risks and uncertainties. All statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including statements regarding our strategy, future financial condition, future operations, projected costs, prospects, plans, objectives of management and expected market growth, are forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as may, will, shall, should, expects, plans, anticipates, could, intends, target, projects, contemplates, believes, estimates, predicts, potential, goal, objective, seeks, or continue or the negative of these words or other similar terms or expressions that concern our expectations, strategy, plans, or intentions. There are a number of risks, uncertainties, and other important factors, many of which are beyond our control, that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Such risks, uncertainties and other important factors include, among others: 
 our expectations regarding our financial performance and future operating performance; 
 our ability to attract and retain members, expand usage of our platform, sell subscriptions to our platform and convert individuals and organizations into paying customers; 
 the timing and success of new features, integrations, capabilities and enhancements by us, or by competitors to their products, or any other changes in the competitive landscape of our market; 
 the amount and timing of operating expenses and capital expenditures that we may incur to maintain and expand our business and operations to remain competitive; 
 the sufficiency of our cash, cash equivalents and investments to meet our liquidity needs; 
 our ability to make required payments under and to comply with the various requirements of our current and future indebtedness; 
 our cash flows, the prevailing stock prices, general economic and market conditions and other considerations that could affect the specific timing, price and size of repurchases under our stock repurchase program or our ability to fund any stock repurchases; 
 geopolitical tensions, including the war in Ukraine and the conflict in Israel, Gaza and surrounding areas; 
 the impact of inflation on us and our members; 
 our borrowing costs have and may continue to increase as a result of increases in interest rates; 
 our ability to effectively manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;

 the safety, affordability and convenience of our platform and our offerings; 
 our ability to successfully defend litigation brought against us; 
 our ability to successfully identify, manage and integrate any existing and potential acquisitions of businesses, talent, technologies or intellectual property; 
 general economic conditions in either domestic or international markets, and geopolitical uncertainty and instability, including as a result of the 2024 United States presidential election; 
 our ability to protect against security incidents, technical difficulties, or interruptions to our platform; 
 our ability to maintain, protect and enhance our intellectual property; and 
 the other risks and uncertainties identified under Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. We have based the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q primarily on our current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about future events and trends that we believe may affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. Although we believe that we have a reasonable basis for each forward-looking statement contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we cannot guarantee that the future results, levels of activity, performance, or events and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements will be achieved or occur at all. The outcome of the events described in these forward-looking statements is subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors described in the section titled Risk Factors and elsewhere in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, and any subsequent filings, as well as those identified in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all risks and uncertainties that could have an impact on the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The results, events and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements may not be achieved or occur, and actual results, events or circumstances could differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. 
 The forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q relate only to events as of the date on which the statements are made. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or to reflect new information or the occurrence of unanticipated events, except as required by law. If we update one or more forward-looking statements, no inference should be drawn that we will make additional updates with respect to those or other forward-looking statements. We may not actually achieve the plans, intentions, or expectations disclosed in our forward-looking statements, and you should not place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements do not reflect the potential impact of any future acquisitions, mergers, dispositions, joint ventures, or investments we may make. 
 In addition, statements that we believe and similar statements reflect our beliefs and opinions on the relevant subject. These statements are based upon information available to us as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and while we believe such information forms a reasonable basis for such statements, such information may be limited or incomplete, and our statements should not be read to indicate that we have conducted an exhaustive inquiry into, or review of, all potentially available relevant information. These statements are inherently uncertain, and you are cautioned not to unduly rely upon these statements. Unless otherwise indicated or unless the context requires otherwise, all references in this document to Expensify, the Company, we, us, our or similar references are to Expensify, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. Capitalized terms used and not defined above are defined elsewhere within this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

million amortizing term mortgage agreement with Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce ("CIBC") for the Company's commercial building located in Portland, Oregon. The agreement required principal and interest payments to be made each month over a period. Interest accrued at a fixed rate of per year until August 2024, at which point the remaining outstanding principal balance on the amortizing term mortgage was due in full . The borrowings were secured by the building. The outstanding balance of the amortizing term mortgage was million a s of December 31, 2023. The then-outstanding balance of million and an immaterial amount of accrued interest on the amortizing term mortgage were repaid in full on August 29, 2024. 
 Loan and Security Agreement 
 In September 2021, the Company amended and restated its loan and security agreement with CIBC (the "2021 Amended Loan and Security Agreement") which consisted of a million initial term loan, the option to enter into an additional million delayed term loan that expired in March 2023, and a monthly revolving line of credit of million. Under the 2021 Amended Loan and Security Agreement, the initial term loan of million was payable over a period with principal and accrued interest payments due each quarter, commencing on September 30, 2021. The 2021 Amended Loan and Security Agreement amortized in equal quarterly installments of million through September 30, 2024, million beginning October 1, 2024 and million beginning October 1, 2025, with any remaining principal balance due and payable on maturity in September 2026. The amounts borrowed accrued interest at the bank s reference rate plus beginning on September 30, 2021 and continued on a quarterly basis through maturity of the term loan. The borrowings were secured by substantially all the Company s assets. The then-outstanding balance of million and million of accrued interest on the term loan were repaid in full on October 12, 2023. 
 In February 2024, the Company entered into a Second Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement (as amended by the First Amendment described below, and as may be further amended from time to time, the "2024 Amended Loan and Security Agreement") with CIBC. The 2024 Amended Loan and Security Agreement amends and restates the 2021 Amended Loan and Security Agreement, to extend the maturity date of the revolving line of credit from September 2024 to September 2025, remove certain provisions related to the term loan that was repaid in full in October 2023 and make certain changes to the positive and negative covenants intended to better align with the operations of the Company. The 2024 Amended Loan and Security Agreement continues to provide for a million revolving credit facility. Borrowings under the revolving line of credit accrue interest at CIBC s reference rate plus as of September 30, 2024) and are secured by substantially all of the Company's assets. In May 2024, the Company entered into a First Amendment to the 2024 Amended Loan and Security Agreement, which amended the covenant restricting the amount of repurchases of common stock to allow for certain additional repurchase activity and provided a waiver for the Company's non-compliance during prior periods with the previous version of such covenant. 
 The Company incurred an immaterial amount of costs in connection with entering into the 2024 Amended Loan and Security Agreement. These debt issuance costs are reflected as a deferred asset within Other current assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and are being amortized to interest expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the agreement. As of September 30, 2024, the unamortized debt issuance costs included within Other current assets was immaterial.

The Letter of Credit was issued in the amount of million for the benefit of Bancorp and expires on March 20, 2025. No amounts have been drawn on the Letter of Credit as of September 30, 2024.

 shares of common stock. In January 2018, the Company increased the number of shares of common stock reserved under the 2009 Stock Plan by shares to shares. In April 2019, the Board of Directors approved the adoption of the 2019 Stock Plan ("2019 Stock Plan", and together with the 2009 Stock Plan, "Stock Plans"). The 2019 Stock Plan permitted the Company to grant up to additional shares, increasing the overall common stock reserved for grant under the Stock Plans to shares. In September 2021, the Board of Directors approved the grant of restricted stock units under the 2019 Stock Plan, covering an aggregate of shares of each of Class A and LT50 common stock effective immediately prior to the effectiveness of the Company's IPO Registration Statement on Form S-1 ("IPO Registration Statement") on November 9, 2021. On November 9, 2021, the Board of Directors amended and restated the 2019 Stock Plan to, among other things, increase the common stock reserved for issuance under the 2019 Stock Plan to an aggregate of shares of Class A and LT50 common stock. 
 Following the completion of the initial public offering of the Company s Class A common stock ("IPO"), the Company did not and does not intend to make any further grants under the Stock Plans. However, the Stock Plans will continue to govern the terms and conditions of the outstanding awards granted under the Stock Plans. Upon the expiration, forfeiture, cancellation, withholding of shares upon exercise or settlement of an award to satisfy the exercise price or tax withholding, or repurchase of any shares of Class A common stock underlying outstanding stock-based awards granted under the 2009 Stock Plan or of Class A or LT50 common stock underlying outstanding stock-based awards granted under the 2019 Stock Plan, an equal number of shares of Class A common stock will become available for grant under the 2021 Incentive Award Plan ("2021 Plan") and the Company's 2021 Stock Purchase and Matching Plan ("Matching Plan" and together with the 2021 Plan, "2021 Incentive Plans"). 
 2021 Incentive Plans 
 In November 2021, the Board of Directors adopted, and its stockholders approved, the 2021 Incentive Plans, which both became effective immediately before the effectiveness of the IPO Registration Statement and use a combined share reserve. Under the 2021 Incentive Plans, shares of Class A common stock were initially reserved for issuance pursuant to a variety of stock-based awards, including incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units ("RSUs"), and other forms of equity and cash compensation under the 2021 Plan and purchase rights and matching awards under the Matching Plan. The number of shares initially reserved for issuance or transfer pursuant to awards under the 2021 Incentive Plans will be increased upon the expiration, forfeiture, cancellation, withholding of shares upon exercise or settlement of an award to satisfy the exercise price or tax withholding, or repurchase of any shares of Class A common stock underlying outstanding stock-based awards granted under the 2009 Stock Plan or of Class A or LT50 common stock underlying outstanding stock-based awards granted under the 2019 Stock Plan. The number of shares of Class A common stock reserved and available for issuance under the 2021 Incentive Plans as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was shares and shares, respectively. The number of shares will automatically increase each subsequent January 1 through January 1, 2031, by the lesser of (A) of the aggregate number of shares of all classes of common stock outstanding on the immediately preceding calendar year end, or (B) such lesser number of shares as determined by the Company s Board of Directors or compensation committee; provided, however, that no more than shares of Class A common stock may be issued upon the exercise of incentive stock options.

RSUs granted to Service Providers on November 9, 2021 that were approved in September 2021 vest upon the satisfaction of both a performance and service condition. The performance condition was satisfied immediately prior to the effectiveness of the IPO Registration Statement. The service condition is satisfied over with 1/8 of the grant having vested on September 15, 2022 and quarterly vesting of 1/32 of the grant every December 15, March 15, June 15 and September 15 (each, a "Specified Quarterly Date") thereafter until fully vested, in each case subject to continued service to the Company. All RSUs granted to Service Providers after the IPO, under the 2021 Plan, have a service condition only, which is satisfied over from the vesting commencement date corresponding to one of the Specified Quarterly Dates nearest the date of grant, with 1/8 of each grant vesting on the first anniversary of the vesting commencement date and 1/32 of each grant vesting in equal quarterly installments thereafter until fully vested, in each case, subject to continued service to the Company.

 Stock Options 
 The Stock Plans and the 2021 Plan provide for the grant of incentive and nonstatutory stock options to Service Providers. Under the Stock Plans and the 2021 Plan, the exercise price of incentive stock options must be equal to at least of the fair market value of the common stock on the grant date for a ten-percent holder or of the fair market value of the common stock on the grant date for any other participant. The exercise price of nonstatutory options granted must be equal to at least of the fair market value of the Company s common stock on the date of grant. 
 The Company has only granted options under the Stock Plans. Options typically vest over and are exercisable at any time after the grant date, provided that Service Providers exercising unvested options receive restricted common stock that is subject to repurchase at the original exercise price upon termination of service. The repurchase right lapses in accordance with the vesting schedule of the exercised option . Early exercises of options prior to vesting are not deemed to be substantive exercises for accounting purposes and accordingly, amounts received for early exercises of unvested options are recorded as a liability. These repurchase terms are considered to be a forfeiture provision and do not result in variable accounting. There was an amount of exercised restricted common stock repurchased during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 . 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were and shares subject to repurchase, respectively, related to unvested stock options that had been early exercised .

 The rights, including the liquidation and dividend rights, of the holders of Class A, LT10 and LT50 common stock are identical, except with respect to voting, conversion and transfer rights. Each share of Class A common stock is entitled to vote per share, each share of LT10 common stock is entitled to votes per share and each share of LT50 common stock is entitled to votes per share. Each share of LT10 and LT50 common stock is convertible into share of Class A common stock voluntarily at the option of the holder after the satisfaction of certain requirements, which includes a notice period for LT10 common stock and a -month notice period for LT50 common stock to convert to Class A common stock, or automatically upon certain events. The Class A common stock has no conversion rights.

Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and with our audited consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 ("2023 Annual Report"). This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current plans, expectations and beliefs involving risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under Part I, Item 1A. "Risk Factors" in our 2023 Annual Report and included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. See "Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements." 
 
 OVERVIEW 
 Expensify is a cloud-based expense management software platform that helps the smallest to the largest businesses simplify the way they manage money. Every day, people from all walks of life in organizations around the world use Expensify to scan and reimburse receipts from flights, hotels, coffee shops, office supplies and ride shares. Since our founding in 2008, we have added over 15 million members to our community and processed and automated 1.7 billion expense transactions on our platform as of September 30, 2024, freeing people to spend less time managing expenses and more time doing the things they love. For the quarter ended September 30, 2024, an average of 684,000 paid members across an average of 46,300 companies and over 200 countries and territories used Expensify to make money easy. 
 
 RECENT DEVELOPMENTS 
 Since 2020, when we launched the Expensify Card, it has operated under one card program (the Legacy Card Program ). In February 2024, we launched a new card program (the "Updated Card Program"). The Legacy Card Program operates under an agreement with the payment processor, Marqeta, Inc. ("Marqeta"), and relies on Marqeta to manage the relationship with the issuing bank, Sutton Bank, and the card network, Visa, in authorizing and settling transactions. The Updated Card Program operates under an agreement with a new issuing bank, The Bancorp Bank, N.A. ("Bancorp"), to issue Expensify Cards to customers and authorize and settle transactions on the Visa card network. 
 All new Expensify Cards issued subsequent to the launch of the Updated Card Program will operate under such program. Our transition of cardholders from the Legacy Card Program to the Updated Card Program has commenced, with a significant portion of card users migrated as of September 30, 2024. We currently expect full completion of this transition by December 31, 2024.

Components of Results of Operations 
 Revenue 
 We generate revenue from subscription fees based on the usage of our cloud-based expense management software platform under arrangements paid monthly in arrears that are either (i) month-to-month and can be terminated by either party without penalty at any time or (ii) annual arrangements based on a minimum number of monthly members. Annual subscription customers who wish to terminate their contracts before the end of the term are required to pay the remaining obligation in full plus any fees or penalties set forth in the agreement. We charge our customers subscription fees for access to our platform based on the number of monthly active members and level of service. The contractual price is based on either negotiated fees or rates published on our website. We generate most of our revenue from customers who have a credit card or debit card on file with us that is automatically charged each month. Virtually all of our customers have a standard terms of service contract, with the few exceptions for customers on bespoke service contracts. 
 Our contracts with our customers include two performance obligations: access to the hosted software service, inclusive of all features available within the platform, and the related customer support. We account for the platform access and the support as a combined performance obligation because they have the same pattern of transfer over the same period and are therefore delivered concurrently. We satisfy our performance obligation over time each month as we provide platform access and support services to customers and as such recognize revenue over time. We recognize revenue net of applicable taxes imposed on the related transaction. 
 We offer a cashback rewards program to all customers based on volume of Expensify Card transactions and Software as a Service ("SaaS") subscription tier. Cashback rewards are earned on a monthly basis and are applied against outstanding customer receivables or are paid out the following month. We consider our cashback rewards as consideration payable to a customer, and they are recorded as contra revenue within Revenue on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. Cashback rewards applied against outstanding customer receivables are reflected as a reduction to Accounts receivable, net on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Cashback rewards liability is recorded within Accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The cashback rewards fluctuate over time as customers meet eligibility requirements in conjunction with the applicable SaaS subscription tier of each customer and the timing of payments made to customers. 
 As of September 30, 2024 , the Expensify Card consisted of two card programs operating concurrently: the Legacy Card Program and the Updated Card Program. All new Expensify Cards issued subsequent to the launch of the Updated Card Program operate under that program. 
 Under the Updated Card Program, we generate revenue from the authorization and settlement of Expensify Card transactions and are contractually entitled to all interchange generated on Expensify Card transactions based on our agreement with the issuing bank. Under the Updated Card Program, we are the principal in the transaction (i.e. we control the services) and recognize interchange as revenue on a gross basis within Revenue on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. Interchange revenue was 3.7 million and 4.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. 
 Cost of Revenue, Net 
 Cost of revenue, net primarily consists of expenses related to hosting our service, including the costs of data center capacity, credit card processing fees, third-party software license fees, outsourcing costs to support customer service and outsourcing costs to support our patented scanning technology SmartScan, net of consideration from a vendor. Additional costs include amortization of finance right-of-use assets, amortization expense on capitalized software development costs and personnel-related expenses, including stock-based compensation and employee costs attributable to supporting our customers and maintenance of our platform.

Table of Contents 

Consideration from a vendor is related to the Expensify Card under the Legacy Card Program, where we use a third-party vendor to issue Expensify Cards and process the related transactions. The vendor is contractually entitled to the interchange through its relationships with the card network and card issuing bank. The vendor keeps a portion of the interchange for their services, and our agreement with the vendor results in us receiving the remainder of the interchange (our remainder portion, "Expensify interchange amount"). The vendor also charges us fees ("vendor fees") for the services it provides to us. Due to the nature of the vendor agreement, we do not record the Expensify interchange amount as revenue under the Legacy Card Program. Instead, the net of the Expensify interchange amount and vendor fees are paid to us, which we record as "Consideration from a vendor, net," a contra expense in Cost of revenue, net on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. The following summarizes these various amounts for each of the periods presented: 
 Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 2024 2023 (in thousands) Expensify interchange amount 876 3,090 7,932 8,008 Vendor fees (78) (281) (805) (724) Consideration from a vendor, net 798 2,809 7,127 7,284 
 OPERATING EXPENSES 
 Research and Development 
 Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel-related expenses, including stock-based compensation, and external contributor costs incurred related to the planning and preliminary project stage and post-implementation stage of new products or enhancing existing products or services. We capitalize certain software development costs that are attributable to developing or adding significant functionality to our internal-use software during the application development stage of the projects. All research and development expenses, excluding capitalized software development costs, are expensed as incurred. 
 We believe delivering new functionality is critical to attract new customers and expand our relationships with existing customers. We expect to continue to make investments in and expand our product and service offerings to enhance our customers experience and satisfaction and to attract new customers. 
 General and Administrative 
 General and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel-related expenses, including stock-based compensation, for any employee time allocated to administrative functions, including finance and accounting, legal and human resources. In addition to personnel-related expenses, general and administrative expenses consist of rent, utilities, depreciation on property and equipment, amortization of operating right-of-use assets, information technology and external professional services, including finance and accounting, audit, tax, legal and compliance, and human resources. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 Sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of personnel-related expenses, including stock-based compensation, advertising expenses, depreciation on property and equipment, outsourcing costs for sales and product demos, branding and public relations expenses and referral fees for strategic partners and other benefits that we provide to our referral and affiliate partners.

 Revenue decreased by 1.1 million, or 3 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to (i) a decrease in billable activity across our user base, including a decrease in pay-per-use billable activity which has a higher average fee per member than our annual members, and (ii) an increase in contra revenue related to cashback payments driven by the increased adoption and spend captured from members using the Expensify Card. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in interchange revenue driven primarily by a shift in cardholder spend from the Legacy Card Program to the Updated Card Program.

 Cost of revenue, net decreased by 0.5 million, or 3 , for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. Cost of revenue, net decreased primarily due to a decrease in total employee and employee related expenses subject to allocation. This was partially offset by a decrease in Consideration from a vendor, net driven primarily by a shift in cardholder spend from the Legacy Card Program to the Updated Card Program. 
 Gross margin remained consistent at 52 for both the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023.

 Key Business Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 We supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") with certain business metrics and non-GAAP financial measures which we regularly review to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business plans and make strategic decisions. Accordingly, we believe that these key business metrics and non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our results of operations in the same manner as our management team. These key business metrics and non-GAAP financial measures are presented for supplemental informational purposes only, should not be considered a substitute for our financial information presented in accordance with GAAP and may be different from similarly titled metrics or measures presented by other companies. 
 KEY BUSINESS METRICS 
 Paid Members 
 We believe that our ability to increase the number of paid members on our platform will drive our success as a business. Our customers pay for subscriptions on behalf of employees and contractors who use the platform, whom we refer to as paid members. We define paid members as the average number of users (employees, contractors, volunteers, team members, etc.) who are billed on Collect or Control plans during any particular quarter. For small and medium businesses ("SMBs") or sole proprietors with only one employee, the business owner may also be the only paid member. 
 The following table sets forth the average number of paid members for each of the periods presented (in thousands):

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES 
 Limitations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as substitutes for financial information presented under GAAP. There are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP financial measures versus comparable financial measures determined under GAAP. For example, other companies in our industry may calculate these non-GAAP financial measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance. All of these limitations could reduce the usefulness of these non-GAAP financial measures as analytical tools. Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and to not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business. 
 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin 
 We define adjusted EBITDA as net loss from operations excluding provision for income taxes, other income (expenses), net, depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation. We define adjusted EBITDA margin as adjusted EBITDA divided by total revenue for the same period. We are focused on profitable growth and we consider adjusted EBITDA to be an important measure because it helps illustrate underlying trends in our business that could otherwise be masked by the effect of the income or expenses that are not indicative of the core operating performance of our business.

 Non-GAAP Net Income and Non-GAAP Net Income Margin 
 We define non-GAAP net income as net loss from operations in accordance with GAAP excluding stock-based compensation. We define non-GAAP net income margin as non-GAAP net income divided by total revenue for the same period. We are focused on profitable growth and we consider non-GAAP net income to be an important measure because it helps illustrate underlying trends in our business that could otherwise be masked by the effect of stock-based compensation expense, which is not considered indicative of the core operating performance of our business.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Since our inception, we have financed our operations primarily through our cash flow from operations, sales of our equity securities and borrowings under our credit facilities. In November 2021, upon completion of our IPO, we received aggregate net proceeds of approximately 57.5 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of approximately 4.9 million and offering costs of approximately 8.0 million. As of September 30, 2024, we had 39.2 million in cash and cash equivalents, with no outstanding indebtedness and 24.0 million of capacity available for additional borrowings under the revolving line of credit. 
 Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including revenue growth and costs incurred to support growth in our business and our need to respond to business opportunities, challenges or unforeseen circumstances. We believe that our existing cash resources will be sufficient to finance our continued operations and growth strategy for the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future. 
 CASH FLOWS 
 The following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated: 
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 2023 (in thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities 16,475 2,102 Net cash used in investing activities (6,699) (4,833) Net cash used in financing activities (21,180) (10,371) Net decrease in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash (11,404) (13,102) 
 CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES 
 Net cash provided by operating activities was 16.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to 2.1 million for the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to a decrease in marketing event and advertising spend, and a decrease in outsourcing activities related to sales and product demos, partially offset by a decrease in revenue. 
 CASH FLOWS FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES 
 Net cash used in investing activities was 6.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily consisting of software development costs. 
 Net cash used in investing activities increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to an increase in employee and external contributor software development costs. 
 CASH FLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES 
 Net cash used in financing activities was 21.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily consisting of the repayment of the revolving line of credit and the amortizing term mortgage, and the repurchase and retirement of common stock, which was partially offset by proceeds from common stock purchased under the Matching Plan. 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, net cash used in financing activities primarily consisted of principal payments on the term loan, the repurchase and retirement of common stock, and payments for employees taxes withheld from stock-based awards, which was partially offset by proceeds from common stock purchased under the Matching Plan.

CREDIT FACILITIES 
 Amortizing Term Mortgage 
 In August 2019, we entered into an 8.3 million amortizing term mortgage agreement with Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce ("CIBC") for our commercial building located in Portland, Oregon. The agreement required principal and interest payments due each month over a five-year period. Interest accrued at a fixed rate of 5.00 per year until August 2024, at which point the remaining outstanding principal balance on the amortizing term mortgage was due in full . The borrowings were secured by the building. On August 29, 2024, we repaid in full the then-outstanding balance of 7.6 million and an immaterial amount of accrued interest on the amortizing term mortgage and terminated the associated mortgage agreement with CIBC and secured promissory note. See Note 4 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information. 
 Loan and Security Agreement 
 In September 2021, we amended and restated our loan and security agreement with CIBC (the "2021 Amended Loan and Security Agreement") which consisted of a 45.0 million initial term loan, the option to enter into an additional 30.0 million delayed term loan that expired in March 2023, and a monthly revolving line of credit of 25.0 million. Under the 2021 Amended Loan and Security Agreement, the initial term loan of 45.0 million was payable over a 60-month period with principal and accrued interest payments due each quarter, commencing on September 30, 2021. The 2021 Amended Term Loan and Security Agreement amortized in equal quarterly installments of 0.1 million through September 30, 2024, 0.2 million beginning October 1, 2024 and 0.6 million beginning October 1, 2025, with any remaining principal balance due and payable on maturity in September 2026. The amounts borrowed accrued interest at the bank s reference rate plus 2.25 beginning on September 30, 2021 and continued on a quarterly basis through maturity of the term loan. The borrowings were secured by substantially all our assets. The then-outstanding balance of 36.0 million and 0.1 million of accrued interest on the term loan were repaid in full on October 12, 2023. 
 In February 2024, we entered into a Second Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement (as amended by the First Amendment described below, and as may be further amended from time to time, the "2024 Amended Loan and Security Agreement") with CIBC. The 2024 Amended Loan and Security Agreement amends and restates the 2021 Amended Loan and Security Agreement, to extend the maturity date of the revolving line of credit from September 2024 to September 2025, remove certain provisions related to the term loan that was repaid in full in October 2023, and make certain changes to the positive and negative covenants intended to better align with our operations. The 2024 Amended Loan and Security Agreement continues to provide for a 25.0 million revolving credit facility. Borrowings under the revolving line of credit accrue interest at CIBC s reference rate plus 1.00 (9.00 as of September 30, 2024) and are secured by substantially all our assets. In May 2024, we entered into a First Amendment to the 2024 Amended Loan and Security Agreement, which amended the covenant restricting the amount of repurchases of common stock to allow for certain additional repurchase activity and provided a waiver for our non-compliance during prior periods with the previous version of such covenant. 
 We incurred an immaterial amount of costs in connection with entering into the 2024 Amended Loan and Security Agreement. These debt issuance costs are reflected as a deferred asset within Other current assets on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and are being amortized to interest expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the agreement. As of September 30, 2024, the unamortized debt issuance costs included within Other current assets was immaterial. 
 On April 24, 2024, we entered into an irrevocable standby letter of credit (the "Letter of Credit") issued under the 2024 Amended Loan and Security Agreement to reduce cash collateral requirements in connection with the Updated Card Program. The Letter of Credit was issued in the amount of 1.0 million for the benefit of Bancorp and expires on March 20, 2025. No amounts have been drawn on the Letter of Credit as of September 30, 2024.

Table of Contents 

On August 29, 2024, we entered into a Second Amendment to the 2024 Amended Loan and Security Agreement, described below. 
 The then-outstanding balance of 15.0 million and an immaterial amount of accrued interest on the revolving line of credit were repaid in full on July 10, 2024. See Note 4 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information. 
 Certain Covenants 
 We are subject to customary covenants under the 2024 Amended Loan and Security Agreement, which, unless waived by CIBC, restrict our and our subsidiaries' ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, create or incur liens, permit a change of control, merge or consolidate with other companies, sell or transfer assets, pay dividends or make distributions, make acquisitions, investments or loans, or payments and prepayments of subordinated indebtedness, subject to certain exceptions. We must also maintain certain financial covenants: a total liquidity ratio, as defined in the 2024 Amended Loan and Security Agreement, tested each quarter, of not less than 1.10 to 1.00 from the quarter ending March 31, 2024, not less than 1.20 to 1.00 from the quarter ending June 30, 2024 and each quarter thereafter, and a total EBITDA net leverage ratio, as defined in the 2024 Amended Loan and Security Agreement, tested each quarter, of not less than 2.50 to 1.00 from the quarter ended March 31, 2025 and each quarter thereafter. 
 Upon full repayment of the amortizing term mortgage on August 29, 2024 , we entered into a Second Amendment to the 2024 Amended Loan and Security Agreement, which permits our wholly-owned subsidiary, 401 SW 5th Ave LLC, to remain an excluded subsidiary provided that the subsidiary does not engage in any operations or activities except to maintain legal existence and ownership of the real property or any related activities thereto, does not hold assets other than real estate assets, and does not incur any indebtedness except for intercompany liabilities permitted under the agreement or grant any liens. 
 If we fail to perform our obligations under these and other covenants, CIBC s credit commitments could be terminated and any outstanding borrowings, together with accrued interest, under the credit or loan agreements could be declared immediately due and payable. 
 As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all debt covenants. 
 
 Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
 As of September 30, 2024, there have been no material changes in our contractual obligations and commitments as disclosed in our 2023 Annual Report. 
 
 Indemnification Agreements 
 In the ordinary course of business, we enter into agreements of varying scope and terms whereby we agree to indemnify customers, issuing banks, card networks, vendors and other parties with respect to certain matters, including, but not limited to, losses arising out of the breach of such agreements, services to be provided by us or from intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and certain officers and employees that will require us, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors, officers or employees. No demands have been made upon us to provide indemnification under such agreements and there are no claims that we are aware of that could have a material effect on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets, Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations, Condensed Consolidated Statements of Changes in Stockholders Equity, or Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

 EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ("Exchange Act")), as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures, and is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's ("SEC") rules and forms. Based on such evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level.

CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rules 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 LIMITATIONS OF EFFECTIVENESS OF CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.

Part II - Other Information 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
 On November 29, 2023, a putative securities class action (the Putative Class Action was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Oregon captioned Wilhite v. Expensify, Inc., et al., Case No. 3:23-cv-01784-JR, naming us, two of our executive officers and two of our former directors as defendants (collectively, the "Defendants"). The lawsuit is purportedly brought on behalf of all those who purchase or acquired our stock pursuant or traceable to our initial public offering IPO ). The complaint alleges claims under Sections 11 and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 based on allegedly false or misleading statements in the offering documents filed in connection with our IPO. The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages and other relief. On January 29, 2024, three shareholders moved to be appointed lead plaintiff in the Putative Class Action. The court appointed a lead plaintiff and lead counsel on March 11, 2024. Pursuant to the parties' stipulation, the lead plaintiff's amended complaint was filed May 10, 2024, naming six of our current board members as additional defendants (together with the Defendants, the "Amended Defendants"). Amended Defendants' motion to dismiss the amended complaint was filed on July 9, 2024. The lead plaintiff's opposition was filed September 6, 2024, and the Amended Defendants' reply was filed October 18, 2024. The court has not yet scheduled a hearing on the Amended Defendants' motion to dismiss. The Amended Defendants deny the allegations of wrongdoing and will continue to vigorously defend against the claims in the Putative Class Action. 
 On May 10, 2024, a shareholder derivative lawsuit (the "Derivative Action") was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Oregon captioned O'Halloran v. Barrett et al., Case No. 3:24-cv-00775, naming us, all of our current board members and executive officers and two of our former directors as defendants (collectively, the "Derivative Defendants"). On August 14, 2024, the Court stayed the Derivative Action pending resolution of any and all motion(s) to dismiss the Putative Class Action. The case remains stayed. The Derivative Defendants deny the allegations of wrongdoing and will continue to vigorously defend against the claims in the Derivative Action. 
 In addition to the matters described above, from time to time, we are involved in various legal proceedings arising from the normal course of business activities. We are not presently a party to any litigation the outcome of which, we believe, if determined adversely to us, would individually or taken together have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, cash flows or financial condition. We have received, and may in the future continue to receive, claims from third parties asserting, among other things, infringement of their intellectual property rights. Defending such proceedings is costly and can impose a significant burden on management and employees. We may receive unfavorable preliminary or interim rulings in the course of litigation, and there can be no assurances that favorable final outcomes will be obtained. The results of any current or future litigation cannot be predicted with certainty, and regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources, and other factors. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors 
 Except to the extent updated below or previously updated, or to the extent additional factual information disclosed elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q relates to such risk factors (including, without limitation, the matters discussed in Part I, Item 2 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation ), there have been no material changes to the risk factors set forth in Part I, Item IA. "Risk Factors" of our 2023 Annual Report. You should carefully read and consider the risks and uncertainties, together with all of the other information included in the 2023 Annual Report and this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including the section titled Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes, and other documents that we file with the SEC.

We use third-party artificial intelligence technologies in our business, and the deployment, use, and maintenance of these technologies involve technological and legal risks. 
 We use third-party artificial intelligence AI ), machine learning, and automated decision-making technologies (collectively, AI Technologies throughout our business, and are making significant investments in this area. 
 For example we use AI Technologies to optimize our internal processes, including analyzing and processing receipts and drafting personalized marketing communications. 
 We expect that increased investment will be required in the future to continuously improve our use of AI Technologies. As with many technological innovations, there are significant risks involved in developing, maintaining and deploying these technologies and there can be no assurance that the usage of or our investments in such technologies will always enhance our products or services or be beneficial to our business, including our efficiency or profitability. 
 In particular, if the models underlying our AI Technologies are: incorrectly implemented; reliant on incomplete, inadequate, inaccurate, biased or otherwise poor quality data; used without sufficient oversight and governance to ensure their responsible use; and/or adversely impacted by unforeseen defects, technical challenges, cybersecurity threats or material performance issues, the performance of our products, services and business, as well as our reputation, could suffer or we could incur liability resulting from the violation of laws or contracts to which we are a party or civil claims. 
 We use third-party AI Technologies and infrastructure which may pose operational and data security risks. 
 We use AI Technologies licensed from third parties, such as OpenAI, in our technologies and our ability to continue to use such technologies at the scale we need may be dependent on access to OpenAI s software and infrastructure. While we believe that there are alternative third-party AI Technologies which would be suitable, we cannot control the availability or pricing of such third-party AI Technologies, especially in a highly competitive environment, and we may be unable to negotiate favorable economic terms with the applicable providers. If any such third-party AI Technologies become incompatible with our solutions or unavailable for use, or if the providers of such models unfavorably change the terms on which their AI Technologies are offered or terminate their relationship with us, our solutions may become less appealing to our customers and our business will be harmed. In addition, to the extent any third-party AI Technologies are used as a hosted service, any disruption, outage, or loss of information through such hosted services could disrupt our operations or solutions, damage our reputation, cause a loss of confidence in our solutions, or result in legal claims or proceedings, for which we may be unable to recover damages from the affected provider. 
 Additionally, our reliance on third-party AI Technologies, such as those licensed from OpenAI, involves certain data and security risks. While we seek to obtain contractual commitments from the applicable providers that prohibit the use of our data to train or refine their AI models, we may not be able to implement technical measures to prevent such providers from doing so in contravention to their contractual obligations. 
 The use of generative AI Technologies may produce inaccurate or infringing content, leading to reputational damage and legal challenges. 
 There is a risk that generative AI Technologies could produce inaccurate or misleading content or other discriminatory or unexpected results or behaviors, such as hallucinatory behavior that can generate irrelevant, nonsensical, or factually incorrect results, all of which could harm our reputation, business, or customer relationships. While we take measures designed to ensure the accuracy of such AI generated content and to monitor for potential inaccuracies, those measures may not always be successful, and in some cases, we may need to rely on end users to report such inaccuracies.\

The regulatory framework governing the use of AI Technologies is rapidly evolving, and we cannot predict how future legislation and regulation will impact our ability to offer products or services that we develop which leverage AI Technologies. 
 The regulatory framework for AI Technologies is rapidly evolving as many federal, state and foreign government bodies and agencies have introduced or are currently considering additional laws and regulations. Additionally, existing laws and regulations may be interpreted in ways that would affect the operation of our AI Technologies. As a result, implementation standards and enforcement practices are likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future, and we cannot yet determine the impact future laws, regulations, standards, or market perception of their requirements may have on our business and may not always be able to anticipate how to respond to these laws or regulations. 
 Already, certain existing legal regimes (e.g., relating to data privacy) regulate certain aspects of AI Technologies, and new laws regulating AI Technologies have been enacted in China and are expected to enter into force in the United States and the EU in 2024. In the United States, the Biden administration issued a broad Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence (the 2023 AI Order ), that sets out principles intended to guide AI design and deployment for the public and private sector and signals the increase in governmental involvement and regulation over AI Technologies. The 2023 AI Order instructed several other federal agencies to promulgate additional regulations within specific timeframes regarding the use and development of AI Technologies. Already agencies such as the Department of Commerce and the Federal Trade Commission have issued proposed rules governing the use and development of AI Technologies. Additional legislation related to AI Technologies has also been introduced at the federal level and is advancing at the state level. In September 2024, California enacted seventeen new bills that further regulate use of AI Technologies and provide consumers with additional protections around companies use of AI Technologies, such as requiring companies to disclose certain uses of generative AI. These new bills may affect how we use AI Technologies in our business. For example, AB 1008 amends the CCPA to clarify that AI Technologies can generate output that is considered personal information, which would mean that California consumers have a right to request that such personal information generated by AI Technologies be deleted or corrected, pursuant to their rights under the CCPA. Such additional regulations may impact our ability to develop, use and commercialize AI Technologies in the future. 
 In Europe, on August 1, 2024, the EU Artificial Intelligence Act (the EU AI Act entered into force, and establishes a comprehensive, risk-based governance framework for AI in the EU market. The majority of the substantive requirements will apply from August 2, 2026. The EU AI Act applies to companies that develop, use and/or provide AI in the EU and includes requirements around transparency, conformity assessments and monitoring, risk assessments, human oversight, security, accuracy, general purpose AI and foundation models, and fines for breach of up to 7 of worldwide annual turnover. In addition, on September 28, 2022, the European Commission proposed two Directives seeking to establish a harmonized civil liability regime for AI in the EU. Once fully applicable, the EU AI Act and the Liability Directives will have a material impact on the way AI is regulated in the EU. Further, in Europe we are subject to the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (the GDPR ), which regulates our use of personal data for automated decision making that results in a legal or similarly significant effect on an individual, and provides rights to individuals in respect of that automated decision making. Recent case law from the Court of Justice of the European Union CJEU has taken an expansive view of the scope of the GDPR s requirements around automated decision making and introduced uncertainty in the interpretation of these rules. The EU AI Act, together with developing guidance and/or decisions in this area, may affect our use of AI Technologies and our ability to provide, improve or commercialize our services, require additional compliance measures and changes to our operations and processes, result in increased compliance costs and potential increases in civil claims against us, and could adversely affect our business, operations and financial condition. 
 It is possible that further new laws and regulations will be adopted in the United States and in other non-U.S. jurisdictions, or that existing laws and regulations, including competition and antitrust laws, may be interpreted in ways that would limit our ability to use AI Technologies for our business, or require us to 
 45

change the way we use AI Technologies in a manner that negatively affects the performance of our products, services, and business and the way in which we use AI Technologies. We may need to expend resources to adjust our products or services in certain jurisdictions if the laws, regulations, or decisions are not consistent across jurisdictions. Further, the cost to comply with such laws, regulations, or decisions and/or guidance interpreting existing laws, could be significant and would increase our operating expenses (such as by imposing additional reporting obligations regarding our use of AI Technologies). Such an increase in operating expenses, as well as any actual or perceived failure to comply with such laws and regulations, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
