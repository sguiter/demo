 (1) "Receivables" 
 (2) "Prepaid expenses and other current assets" 
 (3) "Other Assets" 
 (4) "Accounts payable and accrued expenses" 
 
 The increase in contract liabilities for customer deposits in the current period was driven by project timing in the hospitality customer channel. 
 
 Contract liabilities for customer deposits paid to the Corporation prior to the satisfaction of performance obligations are recognized as revenue upon completion of the performance obligations. The contract liability balance related to customer deposits was million as of December 30, 2023, of which million was recognized as revenue in the nine-month period ended September 28, 2024.

Of these expenses, corporate costs of million and workplace furnishings costs of million were incurred in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2023, and are included in "Selling and administrative expenses" in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Additionally, acquisition-related financing costs of million and million were recorded to the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets in "Long-term Debt" and "Other Assets," respectively, while million of acquisition-related stock issuance costs were recorded to "Additional paid-in capital." 
 
 The acquired assets and assumed liabilities and results of Kimball International's operations are included in the Corporation's workplace furnishings reportable segment. The acquisition was accounted for using the acquisition method pursuant to ASC 805, with goodwill being recorded as a result of the purchase price exceeding the fair value of identifiable tangible and intangible assets and liabilities. Goodwill, which is not tax-deductible, is primarily attributable to the assembled workforce of Kimball International and anticipated synergies.

 The aggregate carrying value of the Corporation s variable-rate, long-term debt obligations under the revolving credit and term loan facilities at September 28, 2024 was million, which approximated fair value. The fair value of the fixed-rate notes was estimated based on a discounted cash flow method (Level 2) to be million at September 28, 2024. 
 
 As of September 28, 2024, the Corporation s revolving credit facility borrowings were incurred under the amended and restated credit agreement entered into on June 14, 2022, as further amended on March 14, 2023 and June 1, 2023 with a scheduled maturity of June 14, 2027. The Corporation deferred the related debt issuance costs, which are classified as assets, and is amortizing them over the term of the credit agreement. The current portion of debt issuance costs of million is the amount to be amortized over the next twelve months, based on the current credit agreement and is reflected in "Prepaid expenses and other current assets" in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The long-term portion of debt issuance costs of million is reflected in "Other Assets" in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 
 As of September 28, 2024, million of borrowings were outstanding under the million revolving credit facility. The entire amount drawn under the revolving credit facility is considered long-term as the Corporation assumes no obligation to repay any of the amounts borrowed in the next twelve months. Based on consolidated EBITDA, as defined in the credit agreement, for the last four fiscal quarters, the Corporation can access the full million of borrowing capacity available under the revolving credit facility, which includes the million currently outstanding, and maintain compliance with the financial covenants under the facility described below. 
 
 In addition to cash flows from operations, the revolving credit facility under the credit agreement is the primary source of daily operating capital for the Corporation and provides additional financial capacity for capital expenditures, repurchases of common stock, and strategic initiatives, such as acquisitions. 
 
 As of September 28, 2024, the Corporation had million principal amount of borrowings outstanding under a term loan agreement entered into on March 31, 2023, as amended on May 25, 2023. The initial million of proceeds from the term loan were used to support funding of the Corporation's acquisition of Kimball International on June 1, 2023. In May 2024 and September 2024, the Corporation separately executed an aggregated million of early repayments of the outstanding principal balance on the term loan. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility were used to finance the early repayments. 
 
 15 

million related to the agreement is reflected in "Long-Term Debt" in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 
 As of September 28, 2024, the Corporation also had million principal amount of borrowings outstanding under private placement note agreements entered into on May 31, 2018. Under the agreements, the Corporation issued million of fixed-rate notes with an interest rate of percent, due May 31, 2025, and million of fixed-rate notes with an interest rate of percent, due May 31, 2028. The principal amounts due on May 31, 2025 are classified as "Current maturities of debt" and the principal amounts due May 31, 2028 are classified as "Long-Term Debt" in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Corporation deferred the debt issuance costs related to the private placement note agreements, which are classified as reductions of current maturities of debt and long-term debt based on note maturity, and is amortizing them over the terms of the private placement note agreements. The deferred debt issuance costs do not reduce the amount owed by the Corporation under the terms of the private placement note agreements. As of September 28, 2024, the remaining deferred debt issuance costs related to the private placement note agreements were not material, with the current portion reflected in "Current maturities of debt" and the long term portion reflected in "Long-Term Debt" in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of September 28, 2024, due to current market rates, the Corporation would not owe any amounts to the note holders on early payment under a make-whole provision. 
 
 The revolving credit facility, term loan credit facility, and private placement notes all contain financial and non-financial covenants. Non-compliance with covenants under the agreements could prevent the Corporation from being able to access further borrowings, require immediate repayment of all amounts outstanding, and/or increase the cost of borrowing. The covenants under all the agreements are substantially the same. In the event the private placement notes are repaid by the Corporation, the revolving credit facility and term loan credit facility include certain fall-away provisions to allow for modification of the covenant measures whereby the Corporation would have increased financial flexibility. In such an event, the definitions of consolidated EBITDA and the maximum leverage under the consolidated leverage ratio would adjust to a more flexible definition while the interest coverage ratio would no longer be an included measure. 
 
 The Corporation is subject to financial covenants requiring it to maintain the following financial ratios as of the end of any fiscal quarter: 
 
 a consolidated interest coverage ratio (as defined in the credit agreements) of not less than to 1.0, based upon the ratio of (a) consolidated EBITDA for the last four fiscal quarters to (b) the sum of consolidated interest charges; and 
 
 a consolidated leverage ratio (as defined in the credit agreements) of not greater than to 1.0, based upon the ratio of (a) the quarter-end consolidated funded indebtedness to (b) consolidated EBITDA for the last four fiscal quarters. 
 
 The more restrictive of the financial covenants is the consolidated leverage ratio requirement of to 1.0. Under the credit agreements, consolidated EBITDA is defined as consolidated net income before interest expense, income taxes, and depreciation and amortization of intangibles, as well as non-cash items that increase or decrease net income. As of September 28, 2024, the Corporation was in compliance with the financial covenants.

Note 8. 

Income taxes Effective tax rate 
 
 The Corporation s income tax expense increased in the current periods relative to the comparable prior-year periods driven by higher profit. The variation in the effective tax rate quarter-over-quarter was primarily due to favorable year-to-date adjustments recorded in the third quarter of 2023 related to the Kimball International acquisition. The significantly higher tax rate in the prior-year-to-date period was driven by non-deductible transaction costs incurred in 2023 in connection with the acquisition.

 Interest Rate Swap 
 During the normal course of business, the Corporation is subjected to market risk associated with interest rate movements. Interest rate risk arises from variable interest debt obligations. Interest rate swap derivative instruments are periodically held and used by the Corporation as a tool for managing interest rate risk. They are not used for trading or speculative purposes. 
 
 In November 2023, the Corporation entered into an interest rate swap transaction to hedge million of outstanding variable-rate term loan borrowings against future interest rate volatility. Under the terms of this interest rate swap, the Corporation pays a fixed rate of percent and receives one-month Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) on a million notional value expiring June 14, 2027. As of September 28, 2024, the fair value of the Corporation s interest rate swap liability was million. See "Note 9. Fair Value Measurements of Financial Instruments." The unrecognized change in value of the interest rate swap is reported net of tax as ) million in "Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)" in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

 The year-to-date increase in shares outstanding compared to last year is primarily due to the issuance of million shares in June 2023 as part of the consideration to acquire Kimball International. See "Note 3. Acquisition and Divestitures" for further information. 

Note 12. 

In the current quarter, management's estimate of cumulative profitability in connection with various tranches of performance stock units was reduced, resulting in a decrease to the aggregate expense recognized. On a year-to-date basis, the increase in compensation cost compared to prior year was driven by additional members participating in stock-based incentive plans as a result of the Kimball International acquisition. 

20 

Performance stock units 
 
 The decrease in the fair value of restricted stock units granted compared to the prior-year period was driven by replacement awards issued in the second quarter of 2023 in connection with the Kimball International acquisition. See "Note 3. 
 Acquisitions and Divestitures" for further information.

 million to back certain insurance policies and payment obligations. Additionally, the Corporation periodically utilizes trade letters of credit and banker's acceptances to guarantee certain payments to overseas suppliers. As of September 28, 2024, there were outstanding amounts related to these types of guarantees. The letters of credit, bonds, and banker's acceptances reflect fair value as a condition of their underlying purpose and are subject to competitively determined fees. 
 
 The Corporation periodically guarantees borrowing arrangements involving certain workplace furnishings dealers and third-party financial institutions. The remaining terms of outstanding guarantees are less than and generally require the Corporation to make payments directly to the financial institution in the event that the dealer is unable to repay its borrowings in accordance with the stated terms. The aggregate amount guaranteed by the Corporation in connection with these agreements is approximately million as of September 28, 2024. The Corporation has determined the likelihood of making future payments under these guarantees is not probable and therefore no liability has been accrued. 
 
 The Corporation has contingent liabilities which have arisen in the ordinary course of its business, including liabilities relating to pending litigation, environmental remediation, taxes, and other claims. It is the Corporation s opinion, after consultation with legal counsel, that liabilities, if any, resulting from these matters are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Corporation s financial condition, cash flows, or quarterly or annual operating results when resolved in a future period.

The residential building products segment manufactures and markets a full array of gas, wood, electric, and pellet-fueled fireplaces, inserts, stoves, facings, outdoor fire pits and fire tables, and accessories. 
 
 For purposes of segment reporting, intercompany sales between segments are not material, and operating profit is income before income taxes exclusive of certain unallocated corporate expenses. These unallocated general corporate expenses include the net costs of the Corporation s corporate operations. Management views interest income and expense as corporate financing costs and not as a reportable segment cost. In addition, management applies an effective income tax rate to its consolidated income before income taxes so income taxes are not reported or viewed internally on a segment basis.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
 
 The following discussion of the Corporation s historical results of operations and of its liquidity and capital resources should be read in conjunction with the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of the Corporation and related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and with the Corporation s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2023 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "2023 Form 10-K"). All dollar amounts presented are in millions, except per share data or where otherwise indicated. Amounts may not sum due to rounding. Statements that are not historical are forward-looking and involve risks and uncertainties. See "Forward-Looking Statements" at the end of this section for further information about forward-looking statements. 
 
 References in this management discussion and analysis to "HNI" and the "Corporation" are to HNI and its consolidated subsidiaries. 

Overview 
 
 The Corporation has two reportable segments: workplace furnishings and residential building products. The Corporation is a leading global designer and provider of commercial furnishings, and a leading manufacturer and marketer of hearth products. The Corporation utilizes a multi-faceted go-to-market business model to deliver value to customers via various brands and selling models. The Corporation is focused on growing its existing businesses while seeking out and developing new opportunities for expansion. 
 
 See "Note 3. Acquisitions and Divestitures" in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about the Kimball International acquisition, which affects the comparability of results between the current and prior-year periods. 
 
 In the current period, the Corporation maintained focus on its strategic priorities. In workplace furnishings, ongoing integration of the Kimball International business and related synergies, expanded utilization of the new factory in Mexico, and the previously announced manufacturing facility optimization initiative are enabling the segment's profit transformation plan, despite continued near-term revenue pressure resulting from macroeconomic and U.S. election uncertainties. The residential building products business continued to navigate cyclical housing market softness and inconsistent demand trends resulting from interest rate volatility, ongoing inflation, and affordability issues. In spite of these headwinds, the business remained solidly profitable and committed to investing in capabilities to support long-term growth. 
 
 Consolidated net sales for the third quarter of 2024 were 672.2 million, a decrease of 5.5 percent compared to net sales of 711.6 million in the prior-year quarter. The change was due to a 5.9 percent decrease in net sales in the workplace furnishings segment, and a 4.4 percent decrease in net sales in the residential building products segment. The divestiture of Kimball International's Poppin business in the third quarter of 2023 decreased year-over-year sales by 7.7 million. 
 
 Net income attributable to the Corporation in the third quarter of 2024 was 47.5 million compared to a net income of 37.8 million in the third quarter of 2023. The year-over-year increase in net income was driven by improved net productivity, costs incurred in the prior-year quarter related to the acquisition of Kimball International and the divestiture of Poppin, lower variable compensation, and reduced interest expense, partially offset by lower sales volume.

 Results of Operations - Three Months Ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 
 
 Net Sales 
 
 Consolidated net sales for the third quarter of 2024 decreased 5.5 percent compared to the same quarter last year. The change was driven by lower volume in both the workplace furnishings and residential building products segments, as well a 7.7 million decrease in net sales from the divestiture of Poppin in the third quarter of 2023. These factors were partially offset by price realization across most customer channels. 
 
 Gross Profit 
 
 Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased 140 basis points in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same quarter last year, driven by improved operational productivity, partially offset by lower sales volume, impacts from the exit of Poppin in the prior year, and higher restructuring charges recorded to cost of sales as a result of factory consolidation initiatives in the workplace furnishings segment. 

25 

Selling and Administrative Expenses 
 
 Selling and administrative expenses ("SG A") as a percentage of net sales decreased 40 basis points in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same quarter last year. The decrease was driven by 2.8 million of Kimball International acquisition-related fees and expenses incurred in the prior-year quarter, favorable impacts from the divestiture of Poppin in the prior year, and lower variable compensation, partially offset by lower sales volume. 
 
 Restructuring and Impairment Charges 
 
 In the third quarter of 2024, the Corporation recorded charges of 1.6 million primarily in connection with reorganization actions in the residential building products segment and factory consolidation initiatives in the workplace furnishings segment. Charges of 5.3 million were incurred in the same quarter last year, mainly related to the exit of the Poppin business. 
 
 Operating Income 
 
 In the third quarter of 2024, operating margin increased 220 basis points compared to the same quarter last year, driven by improved net productivity, non-repeating costs incurred in the prior-year quarter mainly related to the Kimball International acquisition and the divestiture of Poppin, and lower variable compensation, partially offset by lower sales volume. 
 
 Interest Expense, Net 
 
 Interest expense, net for the third quarter of 2024 was 7.1 million, compared to 9.4 million in the same quarter last year, driven by lower average outstanding borrowings. See "Note 7. Debt" in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 
 The Corporation s income tax provision for the third quarter of 2024 was 14.3 million of expense on income before taxes of 61.8 million, or an effective tax rate of 23.1 percent. For the third quarter of 2023, the Corporation s income tax provision was 9.6 million of expense on income before taxes of 47.4 million, or an effective tax rate of 20.3 percent. The variation in the effective tax rates was primarily due to favorable year-to-date adjustments recorded in the third quarter of 2023 in connection with the acquisition of Kimball International. 
 
 Net Income Attributable to HNI Corporation 
 
 Net income attributable to the Corporation was 47.5 million, or 0.98 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2024, compared to net income of 37.8 million, or 0.80 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2023. 
 
 Results of Operations - Nine Months Ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 
 
 Net Sales 
 
 Consolidated net sales for the first nine months of 2024 increased 7.4 percent compared to the same period last year. The change was driven by 228.0 million of favorable impact from the acquisition of Kimball International in the second quarter of 2023, as well as price realization in both the workplace furnishings and residential building products segments. These factors were partially offset by lower volume in the legacy HNI businesses and an 11.1 million decrease in net sales from the divestiture of Poppin in the third quarter of 2023. 
 
 Gross Profit 
 
 Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased 250 basis points in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period last year, driven by improved operational productivity, favorable price-cost, and the impact of the Kimball International acquisition, partially offset by lower volume in the legacy HNI businesses. 
 
 Selling and Administrative Expenses 
 
 Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 150 basis points in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the same period last year. The decrease was driven by 37.5 million of Kimball International acquisition-related 
 
 26 

fees and expenses incurred in the prior-year period and favorable impacts from the acquisition of Kimball International, partially offset by lower volume in the legacy HNI businesses. 
 
 Restructuring and Impairment Charges 
 
 In the first nine months of 2024, the Corporation recorded charges of 3.7 million primarily in connection with factory optimization initiatives in the workplace furnishings segment. Charges of 13.4 million were incurred in the same period last year mainly related to the exit of the Poppin business. 
 
 Operating Income 
 
 In the first nine months of 2024, operating margin increased 470 basis points compared to the same period last year, driven by improved net productivity, favorable price-cost, the benefit of a full nine months of ownership of Kimball International in the current-year period, acquisition-related costs incurred in the prior-year period, and lower restructuring and impairment charges incurred in the current-year period, partially offset by lower volume in the legacy HNI businesses. 
 
 Interest Expense, Net 
 
 Interest expense, net for the first nine months of 2024 was 22.1 million, compared to 17.5 million in the same period last year, driven by higher average outstanding borrowings resulting from indebtedness incurred in June 2023 to fund the acquisition of Kimball International and higher interest rates in the current period on the Corporation's variable-rate revolving debt obligations. 
 
 Income Taxes 
 
 The Corporation s income tax provision for the first nine months of 2024 was 28.6 million of expense on income before taxes of 129.8 million, or an effective tax rate of 22.0 percent. For the first nine months of 2023, the Corporation s income tax expense was 15.6 million on income before taxes of 42.1 million, or an effective tax rate of 37.1 percent. The variation in the effective tax rates was primarily due to non-deductible transaction costs incurred in 2023 in connection with the acquisition of Kimball International. 
 
 Net Income Attributable to HNI Corporation 
 
 Net income attributable to the Corporation was 101.2 million, or 2.09 per diluted share, in the first nine months of 2024, compared to net income of 26.5 million, or 0.60 per diluted share, in the first nine months of 2023. 

Workplace Furnishings 
 
 The following table presents summarized results of operations in the workplace furnishings segment: 
 Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 Change September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 Change Net sales 505.1 536.8 (5.9) 1,425.1 1,249.5 14.1 Operating income 57.7 47.3 22.1 138.3 59.2 134 Operating income 11.4 8.8 260 bps 9.7 4.7 500 bps 
 
 Three Months Ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 
 
 Third quarter 2024 net sales for the workplace furnishings segment decreased 5.9 percent compared to the same quarter last year, driven by lower volume in the contract office customer channel, partially offset by higher volume in the hospitality channel and price realization. In addition, the divestiture of Poppin in the third quarter of 2023 decreased year-over-year sales by 7.7 million. 
 
 Operating income as a percentage of net sales in the third quarter of 2024 improved 260 basis points compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was driven by improved net productivity and costs associated with the exit of Poppin incurred in the prior-year quarter, partially offset by lower sales volume and restructuring charges in the current quarter related to manufacturing optimization initiatives. 
 
 27 

Nine Months Ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 
 
 Net sales for the first nine months of 2024 for the workplace furnishings segment increased 14.1 percent compared to the same period last year. The acquisition of Kimball International in the second quarter of 2023 increased net sales by 228.0 million compared to the prior-year period, while the divestiture of Poppin in the third quarter of 2023 decreased year-over-year sales by 11.1 million. Excluding the impact of these transactions, segment sales decreased year-over-year, driven by lower volume in the contract office customer channel, partially offset by higher volume in the hospitality channel and price realization. 
 
 Operating income as a percentage of net sales in the first nine months of 2024 improved 500 basis points compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was driven by improved net productivity, favorable price-cost, the benefit of a full nine months of Kimball International ownership in the current-year period, favorable impacts from the exit of Poppin in the prior-year period, and Kimball International acquisition-related costs and Poppin exit-related costs in the prior-year period. These factors were partially offset by lower volume in the legacy HNI workplace businesses. 

Residential Building Products 
 
 The following table presents summarized results of operations in the residential building products segment: 
 Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 Change September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 Change Net sales 167.1 174.8 (4.4) 458.8 504.7 (9.1) Operating income 29.9 30.9 (3.1) 71.0 74.5 (4.7) Operating income 17.9 17.7 20 bps 15.5 14.8 70 bps 
 
 Three Months Ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 
 
 Third quarter 2024 net sales for the residential building products segment decreased 4.4 percent compared to the same quarter last year. The decline was driven by lower volume in the existing home channel due to reduced home remodeling activity, partially offset by a modest increase in the new construction channel. 
 
 Operating income as a percentage of net sales increased 20 basis points in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same quarter last year, driven by favorable price-cost and improved net productivity, partially offset by lower sales volume and restructuring charges incurred in the current quarter. 
 
 Nine Months Ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 
 
 Net sales for the first nine months of 2024 for the residential building products segment decreased 9.1 percent compared to the same period last year. The decline was driven by lower volume in both the existing home and new construction channels. Demand pressure from a soft housing market and reduced home remodeling activity was partially offset by price realization versus the prior-year period. 
 
 Operating income as a percentage of net sales in the first nine months of 2024 increased 70 basis points compared to the same period last year driven by improved net productivity, favorable price-cost and product mix, and lower variable compensation, partially offset by lower sales volume. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, coupled with cash flow from future operations, borrowing capacity expected to be available under the Corporation's existing credit agreements, and the ability to access capital markets, are expected to be adequate to fund operations and satisfy cash flow needs for at least the next twelve months. Based on current performance, the Corporation can access the full 425 million of borrowing capacity available under its revolving credit facility, which includes the 46 million of borrowings currently outstanding, and maintain compliance with applicable covenants. 

28 

Cash Flow Operating Activities 
 Operating cash flows were 175.5 million for the first nine months of 2024 compared to 162.5 million for the first nine months of 2023. In the prior-year period, net income included costs associated with the acquisition of Kimball International, which did not recur in the current-year period. Additionally, the net income benefits from owning Kimball International for the entire period combined with improved financial performance in the remaining HNI businesses drove improvement to net income. The increase in income was mostly offset by higher usage of working capital. Working capital was a use of cash during the current-year period, compared to a source of cash in the prior-year period. The current-year working capital cash usage was consistent with normal historical patterns. The comparable prior-year period did not follow the normal seasonal pattern due to the impacts and timing of the acquisition of Kimball International. 
 
 Cash Flow Investing Activities 
 Capital Expenditures - Capital expenditures, including capitalized software, for the first nine months of 2024 were 43.2 million compared to 62.8 million in the same period last year. In the prior-year period, the Corporation had higher expenditures related to a manufacturing facility expansion, which did not recur in the current period. The current-year expenditures are primarily focused on machinery, equipment, and tooling required to support new products, continuous improvements, and cost savings initiatives in manufacturing processes. Additionally, in support of the Corporation s long-term strategy to create effortless winning experiences for customers, the Corporation continues to invest in technology and digital assets. For the full year 2024, capital expenditures are expected to be approximately 60 to 70 million. 
 
 Acquisition and Divestitures - Investing activities in the first nine months of 2023 included 369.7 million of cash outflows related to the acquisition of Kimball International, and 3.1 million received from the sale of Poppin (net of costs to sell). See "Note 3. Acquisitions and Divestitures" in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. 
 
 Cash Flow Financing Activities 
 Debt - The Corporation maintains a revolving credit facility as the primary source of committed funding from which the Corporation finances its planned capital expenditures, strategic initiatives, and seasonal working capital needs. Cash flows included in financing activities for the current and prior periods presented include periodic borrowings and repayments under the revolving credit facility. 
 
 Additionally, in the second quarter of 2023, the Corporation borrowed 300 million in connection with a term loan agreement entered into on March 31, 2023, as amended on May 25, 2023, to support funding of the acquisition of Kimball International. In the second quarter of 2024, the Corporation executed a 50 million early repayment of the outstanding principal balance on this term loan, with an additional early repayment of 50 million in the third quarter of 2024. As a result, no additional principal amortization is due prior to maturity of the facility in March 2028. See "Note 7. Debt" in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. 
 
 Dividend - The Corporation is committed to maintaining or modestly increasing the quarterly dividend rate. Cash dividends declared and paid per common share were as follows: 
 Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 September 28, 2024 September 30, 2023 Dividends per common share 0.33 0.32 0.98 0.96 
 
 During the third quarter of 2024, the Board of Directors declared the regular quarterly cash dividend at the rate of 0.33 per share on August 12, 2024. The dividend was paid on September 12, 2024, to shareholders of record as of August 23, 2024. 
 
 Stock Repurchase - The Corporation s capital strategy related to stock repurchase is focused on offsetting the dilutive impact of issuances of common stock pursuant to equity awards granted for various compensation-related matters. The Corporation also may elect to opportunistically purchase additional shares based on excess cash generation and/or share price considerations. During the nine months ended September 28, 2024, the Corporation spent 24.8 million to repurchase 0.5 million shares of its common stock. As of September 28, 2024, 208.2 million was authorized and available for repurchase of shares by the Corporation. See "Note 10. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) and Shareholders Equity" in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. 
 
 Sales of Stock - The Corporation records cash flows received from the sale of its common stock held in treasury, primarily in connection with stock option exercises and the HNI Corporation Members Stock Purchase Plan. The increase in cash proceeds 
 
 29 

in the current-year period was due to a significant uptick in stock options exercised, driven by growth in the market value per share of the Corporation's common stock. See "Note 10. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) and Shareholders Equity" and "Note 12. Stock-Based Compensation" in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. 

Cash Requirements 
 
 Various commitments and obligations associated with ongoing business and financing activities will result in cash payments in future periods. A summary of the amounts and estimated timing of these future cash payments is presented in the 2023 Form 10-K. There were no material changes outside the ordinary course of business in the Corporation s contractual obligations or the estimated timing of the future cash payments during the first nine months of 2024, except as previously disclosed related to the early repayment of term loan principal. 

Commitments and Contingencies 
 
 See "Note 13. Guarantees, Commitments, and Contingencies" in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 
 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based upon the Consolidated Financial Statements, prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on a variety of other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Senior management has discussed the development, selection, and disclosure of these estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. A summary of the more significant accounting policies requiring the use of estimates and assumptions in preparing the financial statements is provided in the 2023 Form 10-K. 

Recently Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted 
 
 In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures . ASU 2023-07 enhances disclosures regarding segment performance, including information about the chief operating decision maker and measures used to assess performance. The ASU becomes effective for the Corporation beginning with its annual period ending December 2024, and interim periods beginning with first quarter of 2025. The ASU will not impact the financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows of the Corporation. The Corporation is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on the notes to the consolidated financial statements, and expects additional disclosures will be required on adoption. 
 
 In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. ASU 2023-09 enhances transparency of income tax disclosures by requiring consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation, and disaggregation of income taxes paid by jurisdiction. Additionally, the ASU requires disclosure of pretax income (or loss) and income tax (or benefit) disaggregated by domestic and foreign operations. Finally, the ASU removes the requirement of certain disclosures related to unrecognized tax benefits. The ASU becomes effective for the Corporation beginning with its annual period ending December 2025. The ASU will not impact the financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows of the Corporation. The Corporation is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on the notes to the consolidated financial statements, and expects additional disclosures will be required on adoption. 

Looking Ahead 
 
 The Corporation continues to navigate near-term uncertainty driven by macroeconomic conditions. However, management remains optimistic about the long-term prospects in the workplace furnishings and residential building products markets. Management believes the Corporation continues to compete well and remains confident the investments made in the business will continue to generate strong returns for shareholders.
