NOTE 1 

We maintain a million senior secured floating-rate revolving credit facility (the HBB Facility that expires on June 30, 2025, within one year after the issuance of these financial statements.

These increases were partially offset by decreased revenue in the Latin American, Canadian Consumer, and Global Commercial markets. 
 
 Gross profit - As a percentage of revenue, gross profit margin increased to 28.0 compared to 26.1 in the prior year primarily due to a favorable product mix and lower product costs.

 Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG A) - Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by 7.7 million compared to the third quarter of 2023.

 Pension termination expense - During the third quarter of 2024, a one-time non-cash expense of 7.6 million was incurred in connection with the termination of the Company s U.S. defined benefit pension plan related to the reclassification of historical unrecognized losses from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income.

The effective tax rate was higher in the three months ended September 30, 2024 due to a valuation allowance on foreign losses in the current year and a tax benefit on foreign income in the prior year that did not recur.

 The following table identifies the components of the change in revenue: 
 Revenue 2023 418,975 Increase (decrease) from: Unit volume and product mix 46,765 Average sales price (24,249) Foreign currency (307) 2024 441,184 
 
 Revenue - Revenue increased by 22.2 million compared to the prior year due to increased unit volume and a more favorable product mix primarily driven by increased revenue in the US Consumer, Mexico Consumer, and Latin American markets. Additionally, the acquisition of HealthBeacon added a new revenue stream during the year and contributed 2.6 million in revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. These increases were partially offset by decreased revenue in the Canadian Consumer market and Global Commercial market. 
 16 

Table of Contents 

 Gross profit - Gross profit margin increased to 25.9 from 21.1 primarily due to lower product costs and a favorable product mix. 
 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG A) - Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 16.4 million compared to 2023. The increase is primarily due to the addition of 5.6 million of HealthBeacon SG A expenses, higher employee-related costs, including 4.2 million of increased non-cash equity incentive compensation due to stock price appreciation, an increase in outside services and non-recurring items, which include 1.3 million of HealthBeacon transaction costs and the absence of a 0.9 million insurance recovery that occurred in the prior year. 
 
 Interest expense, net - Interest expense, net decreased 2.3 million due to decreased average borrowings outstanding under the HBB Facility, and lower interest rates compared to 2023. 
 
 Pension termination expense - During the third quarter of 2024, a one-time non-cash expense of 7.6 million was incurred in connection with the termination of the Company s U.S. defined benefit pension plan related to the reclassification of historical unrecognized losses from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income. 
 
 Other expense (income), net - Other expense (income), net includes currency losses of 0.8 million in the current year compared to currency gains of 0.1 million in the prior year. 
 
 Income tax expense (benefit) - The effective tax rate was 34.7 compared to 19.7 in the prior year. The effective tax rate was higher for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 due to a valuation allowance on foreign losses in the current year and tax benefits on foreign income and credits in the prior year that did not recur. 
 
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Liquidity 
 
 Our cash flows are provided by dividends paid or distributions made by HBB. The only material assets held by us are the investment in our consolidated subsidiary. As a result, certain statutory limitations or regulatory or financing agreements could affect the levels of distributions allowed to be made by our subsidiary. We have not guaranteed any of the obligations of HBB. 
 
 Our principal sources of cash to fund liquidity needs are: (1) cash generated from operations and (2) borrowings available under the HBB Facility. Our primary use of funds consists of working capital requirements, operating expenses, payment of dividends, repurchase of shares, capital expenditures, payments of principal and interest on debt and acquisitions. 
 
 The HBB Facility expires on June 30, 2025, within one year after the issuance of these financial statements. We have not yet completed our refinancing of the HBB Facility and, accordingly, all amounts outstanding have been classified as current liabilities. Based on the status of the refinancing and our history of successfully refinancing our debt, we believe that it is probable that the HBB Facility will be refinanced before its maturity. We believe funds available from cash on hand, the HBB Facility and operating cash flows will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our operating needs and commitments arising during the next twelve months. 
 
 The following table presents selected cash flow information: 
 NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30 2024 2023 Net cash provided by (used for) operating activities 35,177 68,683 Net cash provided by (used for) investing activities (13,038) (2,436) Net cash provided by (used for) financing activities (14,593) (65,669) 
 
 Operating activities - Net cash provided by operating activities was 35.2 million, representing more normalized post-pandemic working capital, compared to 68.7 million in the prior year, which benefited from significant excess inventory reduction activities. Net working capital provided cash of 20.3 million in 2024 compared to cash provided of 64.3 million in 2023. The 2024 period benefited from the Company's continued focus on working capital management which led to improvements in days sales outstanding and days payable outstanding. The change in net cash provided by operating activities reflects the net working capital changes partially offset by adjustments to net income for the non-cash stock compensation and pension termination expenses. 
 17 

Table of Contents 

 Investing activities - Net cash used for investing activities in 2024 increased compared to 2023 related primarily to the acquisition of HealthBeacon offset by the extinguishment of our secured loan to HealthBeacon in the first quarter of 2024 which provided net cash of 1.6 million. Additionally, the Company used excess cash on hand to invest in a six-month U.S. Treasury bill during the third quarter of 2024. 
 Financing activities - Net cash used for financing activities was 14.6 million in 2024 compared to net cash used for financing activities of 65.7 million in 2023. The change is due to a decrease in HBB s net borrowing activity on the HBB Facility. This decrease was partially offset by increased purchases of treasury stock. 
 
 Capital Resources 
 
 The HBB Facility expires on June 30, 2025. The entire outstanding balance has been classified as a current liability due to the fact the facility expires within one year and has not yet been refinanced. The Company does not expect to make voluntary repayments under the HBB Facility as the rate of return to invest excess cash exceeds the average interest rate of the HBB Facility. A material decrease in interest rates could cause us to re-evaluate. 
 
 The obligations under the HBB Facility are secured by substantially all of HBB s assets. As of September 30, 2024, the borrowing base under the HBB Facility was 148.5 million and borrowings outstanding were 50.0 million. As of September 30, 2024, the excess availability under the HBB Facility was 98.5 million. 
 
 The maximum availability under the HBB Facility is governed by a borrowing base derived from advance rates against eligible trade receivables, inventory and trademarks of the borrowers, as defined in the HBB Facility. Borrowings bear interest at a floating rate, which can be a base rate, SOFR or bankers acceptance rate, as defined in the HBB Facility, plus an applicable margin. The applicable margins, effective September 30, 2024, for base rate loans and SOFR loans denominated in U.S. dollars were 0.0 and 1.55 , respectively. The applicable margins, effective September 30, 2024, for base rate loans and bankers acceptance loans denominated in Canadian dollars were 0.0 and 1.55 , respectively. The HBB Facility also requires a fee of 0.25 per annum on the unused commitment. The margins and unused commitment fee under the HBB Facility are subject to quarterly adjustment based on average excess availability. The weighted average interest rate applicable to the HBB Facility for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 3.18 including the floating rate margin and the effect of the interest rate swap agreements described below. 
 
 To reduce the exposure to changes in the market rate of interest, we have entered into interest rate swap agreements for a portion of the HBB Facility. Terms of the interest rate swap agreements require us to receive a variable interest rate and pay a fixed interest rate. We have interest rate swaps with notional values totaling 50.0 million as of September 30, 2024 at an average fixed interest rate of 1.59 . 
 
 The HBB Facility includes restrictive covenants, which, among other things, limit the payment of dividends, subject to achieving availability thresholds. Dividends are not to exceed 7.0 million during any calendar year to the extent that for the thirty days prior to the dividend payment date, and after giving effect to the dividend payment, HBB maintains excess availability of at least 18.0 million. Dividend amounts are discretionary to the extent that for the thirty days prior to the dividend payment date, and after giving effect to the dividend payment, HBB maintains excess availability of at least 30.0 million. The HBB Facility also requires the Company to achieve a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio in certain circumstances, as defined in the HBB Facility. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with all financial covenants in the HBB Facility. 
 In December 2015, the Company entered into an arrangement with a financial institution to sell certain U.S. trade receivables on a non-recourse basis. See Note 2 of the unaudited consolidated financial statements.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
 
 The statements contained in this Form 10-Q that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. These forward-looking statements are made subject to certain risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those presented. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly revise these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that arise after the date hereof. Such risks and uncertainties include, without limitation: (1) uncertain or unfavorable global economic conditions and impacts from global military conflicts; (2) the Company s ability to source and ship products to meet anticipated demand; (3) the Company s ability to successfully manage constraints throughout the global transportation supply chain; (4) changes in the sales prices, product mix or levels of consumer purchases of small electric and specialty housewares appliances; (5) changes in consumer retail and credit markets, including the increasing volume of transactions made through third-party internet sellers; (6) bankruptcy of or loss of major retail customers or suppliers; (7) changes in costs, including transportation costs, of sourced products; (8) delays in delivery of sourced products; (9) changes in or unavailability of quality or cost effective suppliers; (10) exchange rate fluctuations, changes in the import tariffs and monetary policies and other changes in the regulatory climate in the countries in which the Company operates or buys and/or sells products; (11) the impact of tariffs on customer purchasing patterns; (12) product liability, regulatory actions or other litigation, warranty claims or returns of products; (13) customer acceptance of, changes in costs of or delays in the development of new products; (14) increased competition, including consolidation within the industry; (15) changes in customers inventory management strategies; (16) shifts in consumer shopping patterns, gasoline prices, weather conditions, the level of consumer confidence and disposable income as a result of economic conditions, unemployment rates or other events or conditions that may adversely affect the level of customer purchases of the Company s products; (17) changes mandated by federal, state and other regulation, including tax, health, safety or environmental legislation; (18) the Company s ability to identify, acquire or develop, and successfully integrate, new businesses or new product lines; and (19) other risk factors, including those described in the Company s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including, but not limited to, the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Furthermore, the future impact of unfavorable economic conditions, including inflation, changing interest rates, availability of capital markets and consumer spending rates remains uncertain. In uncertain economic environments, we cannot predict whether or when such circumstances may improve or worsen, or what impact, if any, such circumstances could have on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial position. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 
 INTEREST RATE RISK 
 
 We enter into certain financing arrangements that require interest payments based on floating interest rates. As such, our financial results are subject to changes in the market rate of interest. There is an inherent rollover risk for borrowings as they mature and are renewed at current market rates. The extent of this risk is not quantifiable or predictable because of the variability of future interest rates and business financing requirements. To reduce the exposure to changes in the market rate of interest, we have entered into interest rate swap agreements for a portion of our floating rate financing arrangements. We do not enter into interest rate swap agreements for trading purposes. Terms of the interest rate swap agreements require us to receive a variable interest rate and pay a fixed interest rate. 
 
 For the purpose of risk analysis, we use sensitivity analysis to measure the potential loss in fair value of financial instruments sensitive to changes in interest rates. We assume that a loss in fair value is an increase in our receivables. The fair value of the Company s interest rate swap agreements was an asset of 2.9 million as of September 30, 2024. A hypothetical 10 relative decrease in interest rates would cause a decrease of 0.2 million in the fair value of interest rate swap agreements. Additionally, a hypothetical 10 relative increase in interest rates would cause an increase of 0.2 million in the fair value of interest rate swap agreements. Neither would have a material impact to the Company s interest expense, net of 0.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

Table of Contents 

 FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISK 
 
 We operate internationally through our foreign operating subsidiaries and enters into transactions denominated in foreign currencies, principally the Canadian dollar, the Mexican peso and, to a lesser extent, the Chinese yuan, Brazilian real and the European Union euro. As such, our financial results are subject to the variability that arises from exchange rate movements. The fluctuation in the value of the U.S. dollar against other currencies affects the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities. The potential impact of currency fluctuation increases as international expansion increases. 
 
 We use forward foreign currency exchange contracts to partially reduce risks related to transactions denominated in foreign currencies and not for trading purposes. These contracts generally mature within twelve months and require us to buy or sell the functional currency in which the applicable subsidiary operates and buy or sell U.S. dollars at rates agreed to at the inception of the contracts. 
 
 For the purpose of risk analysis, we use sensitivity analysis to measure the potential loss in fair value of financial instruments sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange spot rates. We assume that a loss in fair value is either a decrease to our assets or an increase to our liabilities. The fair value of our foreign currency exchange contracts was a net receivable of 0.5 million as of September 30, 2024. Assuming a hypothetical 10 weakening of the U.S. dollar as of September 30, 2024, the fair value of foreign currency-sensitive financial instruments, which represents forward foreign currency exchange contracts, would be decreased by 1.2 million compared with its fair value as of September 30, 2024. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Company management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 
 Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
 There were no changes, except as noted below, in the Company s internal control over financial reporting identified during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, in connection with the evaluation by the Company s management required by paragraph (d) of Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
 On February 2, 2024, we acquired HealthBeacon, as discussed in Note 8: Acquisitions in Part I, Item 1 in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We are currently integrating HealthBeacon into our operations and internal control processes, and, as permitted by the SEC rules and regulations, we have not yet included HealthBeacon in our assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We anticipate HealthBeacon will be included in management s evaluation of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2025.
