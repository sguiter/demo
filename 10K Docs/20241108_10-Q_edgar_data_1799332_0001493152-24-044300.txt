all relevant gaming authorities. The Company anticipates that this will take some time, and that the closing of the Merger may not occur
until early 2025. 

On
February 13, 2024, the Company held a special general meeting of the shareholders of the Company to consider and vote upon the
Merger Agreement, at which meeting the shareholders approved the Merger Agreement. Also, the waiting period under applicable antitrust
laws expired on June 6, 2024, and on June 27, 2024, the Company received clearance under CFIUS.

million, with cash of million and
liabilities to users of 
million. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had a net income of 
million and net loss of 
million, respectively. The Company generated 
million of cash provided by operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. In April 2022, a subsidiary of the Company
entered into a 
million term credit facility with net proceeds of 
million (the Credit Facility ). 

Additionally,
the Company s current financial condition, liquidity resources, and planned near-term cash flows from operations are sensitive
to changes in macro-economic conditions, and the substantial variability inherent in the Company s wager-based revenues streams.
These factors, when considered together with potential covenant breaches under the Company s Credit Facility indicate uncertainty
related to the ability of the Company to meet its current obligations as they come due. 

On
April 13, 2023, a subsidiary of the Company executed agreements to amend the Credit Facility and increase the principal balance from
 million to million (forming the Amended Credit Facility ). The Amended Credit Facility contains a financial
covenant, among other covenants, requiring minimum liquidity of million. Refer to Note 6 Debt for further details. Management
believes the executed Amended Credit Facility and the Company s intent and ability to complete the remaining cost mitigation plans
alleviate uncertainty regarding the ability to meet its current obligations as they come due for at least one year from the issuance
of the consolidated financial statements. The Company was in compliance with all financial covenants associated with its Credit Facility
as of September 30, 2024, however given the Company s cash flow and net losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, historical
performance, and reasonably estimable near-term future cash flows, it is possible that the Company could violate a financial covenant
in the future which could trigger an acceleration of all amounts due and the termination of commitments under the Credit Facility. We
expect to maintain compliance for at least one year from the issuance of the consolidated financial statements. 

To
the extent that the Company s current resources, including its ability to generate operating cash flows, are insufficient to satisfy
its cash requirements, the Company may seek additional equity or debt financing. The Company s ability to do so depends on prevailing
economic conditions and other factors, many of which are beyond management s control. The Company does not currently have any such
credit facilities or similar debt arrangements in place, outside of the Amended Credit Facility described above, and cannot provide any
assurance as to the availability or terms of any additional future financing that it may require to support its operations. If the needed
financing is not available, or if the terms of financing are less desirable than expected, the Company may be forced to decrease its
level of investment in new products and technologies, discontinue further expansion of the business, or scale back its existing operations,
any of which could have an adverse impact on the Company and its financial prospects.

million,
which are subject to local banking laws and may bear higher or lower risk than cash deposited in the United States. Cash held in the
United States is maintained in a major financial institution in excess of federally insured limits. As part of our cash management processes,
the Company performs periodic evaluations of the credit standing of the financial institutions and we have not historically sustained
any credit losses from instruments held at these financial institutions. However, during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the Company
determined that there was a credit risk with a certain payment service provider PSP servicing the B2C segment in the
amount of million which has been classified as other current assets at September 30, 2024. 

The
Company maintains an allowance for potential credit losses, but historically has not experienced any significant losses related to individual
customers or groups of customers in any particular geographic area. 

million, of which 

The
Company s promise to provide the RMiG SaaS platform and content licensing services on the hosted software is a single performance
obligation. This performance obligation is recognized over time, as the Company provides services to its customers in its delivery of
services to the player end user. The Company s customers simultaneously receive and consume the benefits provided by the Company
as it delivers services to its customers. Usage based fees are considered variable consideration as the service is to provide unlimited
continuous access to its hosted application and usage of the hosted system is primarily controlled by the player end user. The transaction
price includes fixed and variable consideration and is billed monthly with the amount due generally thirty days from the date of the
invoice. Variable consideration is allocated entirely to the period in which consideration is earned as the variable amounts relate specifically
to the customer s usage of the platform that day and allocating the usage-based fees to each day is consistent with the allocation
objective, primarily that the change in amounts reflect the changing value to the customer. The Company s internet gaming system,
game content, support and marketing services are provided equally throughout the term of the contract. These services are made up of
a daily requirement to provide access and use of the internet gaming system and optional support and marketing services to the customer
over the same period of time. The series of distinct services represents a single performance obligation that is satisfied over time. 

Purchases
of virtual credits within a transaction period on the SIM platform, generally a monthly convention, are earned over time, and are typically
billed monthly upon the close of the respective period as the credit has no monetary value, cannot be redeemed, exchanged, transferred
or withdrawn, represents solely a device for tracking game play during the month, does not obligate the Company to provide future services
and the arrangements with the customer and player end user have no substantive termination penalty. In certain service agreements with
its SIM customers, the fees collected by the Company from third-party payment processors for the purchases of in-game virtual credits
made by end-users include the SIM customer s portion. The Company records the SIM customer s portion as a liability as cash
is collected and remits payment to the SIM customer for their share of the SIM revenues monthly. At September 30, 2024 and December 31,
2023, the Company recorded a liability due to its customers for their share of the fees of and , respectively, within other
current liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheets.

The
Company uses third-party content providers in supplying game content in its performance of providing game content on its platform to
its customers. A customer has access to the Company s propriety and licensed game content and additionally, the customer can direct
the Company to procure third-party game content on its behalf. The Company has determined it acts as the principal for providing the
game content when the Company controls the game content, and therefore presents the revenue on a gross basis in the condensed consolidated
statements of operations. When the customer directs the Company to procure third-party game content, the Company determined it is deemed
an agent for providing such game content, and therefore, records the revenue, net of the costs of content license fees, in the condensed
consolidated statements of operations. 

The
Company also provides ongoing development services involving updates to the RMiG platforms for enhanced functionality or customization.
Ongoing development services are typically billed monthly, at a daily rate, for services performed. Revenue from RMiG platform development
services that are identified as distinct performance obligations and enhance or create an asset the customer controls as the Company
performs the services are recognized over time as services are performed. This revenue is measured using an input method based on effort
expended, which uses direct labor hours incurred. These services have primarily related to post-launch development of third-party application
integration software in the customer s environment. Separately, the revenue generated from customers for development services that
are distinct performance obligations and the customer benefits from the integrated SaaS offering are deferred over the license service
term. These services have primarily related to enhancements to the Company s platforms that do not enhance or create an asset the
customer controls. In customer contracts that require a portion of the consideration to be received in advance or at the commencement
of the contract, such amounts are recorded as a contract liability. 

Other
services include the resale of third-party computer hardware, such as servers and other related hardware devices, upon which the GameSTACK
software is installed for its customers. These products are not required to be purchased to access the GameSTACK platform but are sold
as a convenience to the customer. The Company procures the computer hardware on the customer s behalf for a fee determined based
on the cost of the computer hardware plus a markup. The Company charges a hardware deployment fee which is a one-time fee for installation,
testing and certification of the computer hardware at the gaming hosting facility. Revenue is recognized at the point in time when control
of the hardware transfers to the customer. Control is transferred after the hardware has been procured, delivered, installed at the customer s
premises and configured to allow for remote access. 

The
Company has determined that it is acting as the principal in providing computer hardware and related services as it assumes responsibility
for procuring, delivering, installing and configuring the hardware at the customer s location and takes control of the hardware,
prior to transfer. Revenue is presented at the gross amount of consideration to which it is entitled from the customer in exchange for
the computer hardware and related services.

Contracts
with Multiple Performance Obligations 

For
customer contracts that have more than one performance obligation, the transaction price is allocated to the performance obligations
in an amount that depicts the relative stand-alone selling prices of each performance obligation. Judgment is required in determining
the stand-alone selling price for each performance obligation. In determining the allocation of the transaction price, an entity is required
to maximize the use of observable inputs. When the stand-alone selling price of a good or service is not directly observable, an entity
is required to estimate the stand-alone selling price. Contracts with its customers may include platform and licensing of game content
services, as well as development services and computer hardware services. The variable consideration generated from the platform and
the licensing of game content is allocated entirely to the performance obligations for platform and licensing of game content services
and the remaining fixed fees for development services and computer hardware would be allocated to each of the remaining performance obligation
based on their relative stand-alone selling prices. The variable consideration relates entirely to the effort to satisfy the platform
and licensing game content services and the fixed consideration relates to the remaining performance obligations which is consistent
with the allocation objective. 

Revenue
from B2C Gaming Operations 

The
Company operates the B2C gaming site www.coolbet.com outside of the U.S., which contains proprietary software and includes the following
product offerings: sportsbook, poker, casino, live casino and virtual sports. 

The
Company manages an online sportsbook allowing users to place various types of wagers on the outcome of sporting events conducted around
the world. The Company operates as the bookmaker and offers fixed odds wagering on such events. When a user s wager wins, the Company
pays the user a pre-determined amount known as fixed odds. Revenue from online sportsbook is reported net after deduction of player winnings
and bonuses. Revenue from wagers is recognized when the outcome of the event is known. 

The
Company offers live casino through its digital online casino offering in select markets, allowing users to place a wager and play games
virtually at retail casinos. The Company offers users a catalog of over 8,100 third-party iGaming products such as digital slot machines
and table games such as blackjack and roulette. Revenue from casino games is reported net after deduction of winnings, jackpot contribution
and customer bonuses. 

Peer-to-peer
poker offerings allow users to play poker against one another on the Company s online poker platform for prize money. Revenue is
recognized as a percentage of the reported rake. Additionally, the Company offers tournament poker which allows users to buy-in for a
fixed price for prize money. For tournament play, revenue is recognized for the difference between the entry fees collected and the amounts
paid out to users as prizes and winnings. 

In
each of the online gaming products, a single performance obligation exists at the time a wager is made to operate the games and award
prizes or payouts to users based on a particular outcome. Revenue is recognized at the conclusion of each contest, wager, or wagering
game hand. Additionally, certain incentives given to users, for example, that allow the user to make an additional wager at a reduced
price, may provide the user with a material right which gives rise to a separate performance obligation. 

The
Company allocates a portion of the user s wager to incentives that create material rights that are redeemed or expired in the future.
The allocated revenue for gaming wagers is primarily recognized when the wagers occur because all such wagers settle immediately. 

The
Company applies a practical expedient by accounting for revenue from gaming on a portfolio basis because such wagers have similar characteristics,
and the Company reasonably expects the effects on the financial statements of applying the revenue recognition guidance to the portfolio
to not differ materially from that which would result if applying the guidance to an individual wagering contract.

maturity date of , and was fully guaranteed by the Company. There were no scheduled principal payments due under the
Credit Facility until maturity. Interest payments were payable in arrears in the last business day of each calendar quarter and at the
maturity date. 

The
Company incurred million in debt issuance costs during the year ended December 31, 2022, in connection with the Credit Facility,
which was recorded as a direct reduction against the debt and amortized over the life of the associated debt as a component of interest
expense using the effective interest method. The net funds received from the Credit Facility, after deducting debt issuance costs, was

Subsequent
Amendments 

On
April 13, 2023, a subsidiary of the Company executed agreements to amend the Credit Facility to waive all events of default, amend certain
financial covenants, assign the rights to the Credit Facility from its existing lender to a third party, and increase the principal balance
from million to million with accrued paid in-kind PIK interest of per year (together, forming the Amended
Credit Facility ). The Amended Credit Facility became effective upon cash settlement of payments completed on April 14, 2023, and
represented a cure of any events of default under the Credit Facility and thereby prevent any amounts from becoming due and payable under
the Credit Facility s subjective acceleration clause. 

The
Amended Credit Facility matures on the third anniversary of its effective date and is fully guaranteed by the Company. There are no scheduled
principal payments due under the Amended Credit Facility until maturity. The principal balance, accrued PIK interest, and an exit fee

issuance costs in connection with the Amended Credit Facility. The Amended Credit Facility contains customary negative covenants, a financial
covenant requiring minimum liquidity of million, as well as other financial covenants to be tested solely in the event the Company
raises junior debt during the term of the Amended Credit Facility. 

Debt
Covenants 

The
Credit Facility contained affirmative and negative covenants, including certain financial covenants associated with the Company s
financial results. The negative covenants included restrictions regarding the incurrence of liens and indebtedness, certain merger and
acquisition transactions, asset sales and other dispositions, other investments, dividends, share purchases and payments affecting subsidiaries,
changes in nature of business, fiscal year or organizational documents, transactions with affiliates, and other matters. 

The
Credit Facility contained customary events of default, including, among others: non-payments of principal and interest; breach of representations
and warranties; covenant defaults; the existence of bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings; certain events under ERISA; gaming license
revocations in material jurisdictions; material judgments; and a change of control. If an event of default occurred and was not cured
within any applicable grace period or was not waived, the administrative agent and the lender were entitled to take various actions,
including, without limitation, the acceleration of all amounts due and the termination of commitments under the Credit Facility.

Share
option awards generally vest .
During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Board of Directors approved the issuance of options to purchase ordinary
shares to employees under the 2020 Plan, all of which were share options granted with an exercise price of per share to certain
European-based employees in lieu of restricted share units. The value of these options are based on the market value of the Company s
ordinary shares at the date of the grant. As all such options are in-the-money, the Company determined that utilizing an option pricing
model to estimate the fair value of these options was not necessary. The weighted average grant date fair value of options granted was
 and for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and and for the nine months ended September
30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

For
options granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the fair value of each share option award is estimated on the date of
grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model that uses the assumptions noted above. Estimating the grant date fair values for employee
share options requires management to make assumptions regarding expected volatility of the value of those underlying shares, the risk-free
rate of the expected life of the share options and the date on which share-based compensation is expected to be settled. Expected volatility
is determined by reference to volatility of certain identified peer group share trading information and share prices on the Nasdaq stock
exchange. The risk-free interest rate for the expected term of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the
time of grant. The expected term of the options is based on historical data and represents the period of time that options granted are
expected to be outstanding. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, volatility, term, and risk-free interest
rate were not meaningful inputs as all outstanding options were per share for the Company s European based employees. 

Restricted
Share Units 

Restricted
share units are issued to non-employee directors and employees. For equity-classified restricted share units, the fair value of restricted
share units is valued based on fair market value of the Company s ordinary shares on the date of grant and is amortized on a straight-line
basis over the vesting period.

During
the first and second quarter of 2024, there were no issuances of restricted share units to its non-employee directors or employees. 

During
the third quarter of 2024, the Board of Directors approved the issuance of restricted share units to its employees. The restricted
share units vest over from the date of grant. The terms of the awards stipulate that vesting of any outstanding share units
will be pro-rated for employees if their employment terminates after the first anniversary of the grant date. 

The
Company withholds a portion of the restricted share units granted to its officers and non-employee directors upon vesting in order to
remit a cash payment to the officers and directors equal to their tax expense. The liabilities are recorded in accrued compensation and

The
Company has four types of liabilities related to contracts with customers: (i) cash consideration received in advance from customers
related to development services not yet performed or hardware deliveries not yet completed, (ii) incentive program obligations, which
represents the deferred allocation of revenue relating to incentives in the online gaming operations, (iii) user balances, which are
funds deposited by customers before gaming play occurs and (iv) unpaid winnings and wagers contributed to jackpots. Contract-related
liabilities are expected to be recognized as revenue within one year of being purchased, earned or deposited. Such liabilities are recorded
in liabilities to users and other current liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. 

In
August 2023, WSI US, LLC WynnBet notified the Company of its intent to modify its multi-state revenue contract with the
Company and, in November 2023, the Company completed its negotiations with WynnBet (the WynnBet modification ). The results
of renegotiations were primarily to amend performance obligations such that (i) obligations in certain states that had not launched at
the modification date were formally terminated, (ii) obligations in certain states that launched prior to the modification date had the
term reduced, and (iii) obligations in certain states such as Nevada, Massachusetts and New York would continue under more favorable
commercial terms. The total consideration allocated to these modifications was million, which was paid in November 2023. 

The
Company determined that the remaining performance obligations related to each state that either already launched or would launch under
the modified agreement and allocated the million consideration based on the estimated value attributable to each remaining performance
obligation to be recognized over the remaining term. 

WynnBet
further agreed to terms for the state of Michigan governed by a separate revenue arrangement that provided WynnBet with an optional
performance obligations for either migrations services or termination rights, at their choosing, of 
million. In June 2024, WynnBet completed its sale of its Michigan business to Caesars Entertainment, Inc. Caesars and the Company entered into an agreement with Caesars to perform the migration services and added one performance obligation for
the duration of the migration period, both of which were expected to be completed by September 2024. The Company performed the
migration services and recognized revenue in the amount of 
million and 
million in the second quarter ended June 30, 2024 and the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, respectively, which represented the proportional effort completed relative to the total migration services. The
Company completed migration services in October 2024 and recognized the remaining 
million. 

In
 August 2024, WynnBet terminated its operations in the state of New York. The Company received and recognized 
 million in consideration for the termination, and recognized an additional 
 million related to the allocation of the 
 million consideration received in November 2023. 

Additional
consideration was provided related to the Company s right of first refusal to obtain WynnBet s operation in the state of
Michigan amounting to 
million. WynnBet exercised this option in the quarter ended March 31, 2024. The Company recognized revenue in the amount of 
million and million in the second quarter ended June 30, 2024 and the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, respectively.

Chile
Operations 

Coolbet s
B2C casino and sports-betting platform is accessible in Chile. Since June 1, 2020, foreign digital service suppliers that provide services
to individuals in Chile have been required to register for value-added tax VAT purposes. On September 20, 2021, the Company
submitted an inquiry to the Chilean Internal Revenue Service SII for clarification on the basis to apply VAT. In December
2021, the SII issued a general resolution as a response to another iGaming platform operator stating the Tax Administration s position
that fees paid by users for entertainment services provided through online gaming and betting platforms are subject to VAT in Chile.
The SII clarified its interpretation that the VAT tax rate of shall be applied to fees paid by the users , specifically
gross customer deposits on the iGaming platform. This was further reiterated by the SII in June 2022 through a public response to an
unnamed ruling request on the matter. 

On
May 13, 2022, the SII issued a resolution stating that unregistered foreign digital service providers will be subject to withholding
on payments through enforcement to issuers of credit cards, debit cards, and other forms of payment, effective August 1, 2022. The SII
issued its noncompliant list of unregistered foreign digital service providers to enact enforcement of this withholding on a quarterly
basis, with the most recent list issued on December 28, 2022. As of September 30, 2024 and through the date of filing, the Company has
not registered for the Chilean VAT but has not been listed on the SII s list for which this withholding should be applied, and
the Company has not received formal notification of any VAT liability due to the SII. 

On
March 14, 2023, the SII issued a resolution stating that, although the SII lacks the power to qualify an activity as legal or illegal
(which had been noted in previous SII resolutions), the SII is not empowered to register taxpayers for the simplified VAT regime who
carry out activities that have been declared illegal by other State authorities that do have the power to qualify an activity as legal
or illegal. It then notes that the SII has been informed by the Superintendency of Gambling Casinos that the offering of games of chance
is only expressly authorized in certain instances under Chilean law, and thus taxpayers without domicile or residence in Chile that offer
them are doing so illegally. As a result, the SII has excluded these taxpayers from the simplified VAT regime, effectively contradicting
past guidance that stated the digital VAT law must be applied to online gaming and betting platforms. 

On
September 12, 2023, the Supreme Court of Chile issued a ruling requiring one telecommunication company to block 23 iGaming websites.
The ruling related specifically to one local internet service provider ISP ), and a state-owned land-based casino which

23 specific URL addresses mentioned in the legal action. The Local Provider s legal action was based on a protection recourse 
filing and assert that the Local Provider s constitutional right to maintain a legal monopoly over sports betting was infringed
upon. The Supreme Court of Chile s ruling only affected the named parties of the case and did not establish legal precedent. In

 NOTES
TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 

 (in
thousands, except share and per share amounts) 

The
Company does not believe its activities in Chile are illegal based on external legal opinions obtained in previous years and updated
external legal opinions supporting the Company s assertions. The Company had previously not registered for the Chilean VAT on digital
service providers as the Company believed the application of VAT on gross customer deposits, as previously clarified by the SII, prior
to the March 2023 resolution, did not represent a reasonable application of the law to the economic substance of the Company s
services; this previous application would have resulted in a material loss to the Company. The Company believes that Chilean tax laws
and regulations support that only the fees directly charged by the Company s platform, primarily poker fees, should be the taxable
base for the Chilean digital VAT and has obtained an external legal opinion supporting this position, the application of which would
not have a material impact to the Company s financial statements. However, as a result of the SII excluding the Company s
activities from the digital VAT registration, we no longer believe a liability is probable for the past activities as of December 31,
2022 as the Company is now effectively prevented from complying with the digital VAT law. However, there is uncertainty as to the regulated
environment, what amounts may be ultimately due on our previous activities and the ability to operate in this jurisdiction until the
SII resolves the position. Resolution of this matter may result in fines, penalties, additional expenses or require us to exit the market.
Revenues from Chile represented and of total consolidated revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,
respectively, and and of total consolidated revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

Synthetic
Equity 

Pursuant
to the binding term sheet previously entered into with Red Rock Resorts, Inc., the Company entered into the Master Gaming Services Agreement
with Station Casinos LLC Station on March 30, 2023, to launch GameSTACK and GAN Sports RMiG and sportsbook solutions
at its properties through self-service kiosks as well as through on-premises and statewide mobile versions in Nevada, subject to applicable
licensure. As an additional incentive for Station to support the commercial success of the launch in Nevada, the Master Gaming Services
Agreement includes a Synthetic Equity Addendum which would require that the Company make a payment to Station in the event of a change
of control in the Company (the Change of Control Payment ), subject to certain conditions outlined in the Synthetic Equity
Addendum. The Change of Control Payment is payable only in the event that a change of control occurs during the period as specified by
the Synthetic Equity Addendum and that the Company s market capitalization has increased during that time, calculated as proscribed
by the Synthetic Equity Addendum, which the amount of such payment ranging from to of such increase in market capitalization
over approximately per share, depending on whether certain minimum revenue conditions are met over the next five years. The payment
represents an equity-linked financial instrument containing service, performance and market conditions and is measured and classified
in accordance with stock-based compensation guidance. The initial grant-date fair value represents an upfront payment to a customer for
the maximum tranche which will be attributed as contra revenue over the estimated initial contract term as revenue is earned under the
arrangement such that the recognition of the constraints is not probable to result in a material reversal of revenue. The initial grant
date liability will be marked to market at each reporting period through operating income (loss). The Company valued the liability utilizing
a Monte Carlo simulation and determined the value to be approximately million at grant-date and recorded within other assets and
other liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheet. A Monte Carlo simulation includes numerous scenarios, including assumptions
of probability weighted-likelihood of different outcomes. As facts and circumstances become known or knowable at each reporting period,
the probability of certain scenarios will change, which will increase or decrease the value. The classification of the liability will
be reassessed when a change of control event is probable. 

On
November 7, 2023, the Company entered into the Merger Agreement at a share price of . The close of the merger is also predicated
upon receipt of approval of the Merger and change in control of the Company by all relevant gaming authorities and other conditions.
The Company anticipates that securing such regulatory approvals will take some time, and that the closing of the Merger may not occur
until early 2025. Refer to Note 1 Nature of Operations. As the Company entered into, and announced, the Merger Agreement
prior to the revenue conditions being met, and the share price would be less than per share threshold, there would be no liability.
A 75 probability was applied to the sale scenario resulting in value and 25 to the year-end Monte Carlo value which assumes a sale
in the future with potential revenue thresholds being met. As of December 31, 2023, the fair value was determined to be approximately
 million. On September 30, 2024, the fair value was determined to be approximately million. The recurring value is not sensitive
to significant changes in inputs due primarily to the weighting of the sale scenario. Changes to probability could result in increases
or decreases to the valuation of the liability in the future. 

The
underlying revenue arrangement commenced in December 2023, and the asset is probable of recovery.

 Table of Contents 

Revenue 

Revenue
was 37.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 7.3 million from the comparable period in 2023. The
increase was primarily attributable to an increase in the United States resulting from the expansion of our B2B operations in Nevada and
recognition of revenue related to migration services connected to a B2B partner exit in Michigan. Growth in Europe was driven by increased
player activity and higher margins resulting from favorable sporting event outcomes within the B2C operations. These increases were partially
offset by declines in the B2C operations in Latin America driven by reduced player activity and unfavorable exchange rates. 

Cost
of Revenue 

Cost
of revenue was 9.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 0.7 million in the comparable period in 2023.
This increase was due to increased gaming taxes in our B2C operations in Latin America driven by the implementation of regulation. 

Sales
and Marketing 

Sales
and marketing expense was 6.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 0.4 million from the comparable
period in 2023. The decrease was primarily attributable to the Company s deployment of an affiliate marketing strategy in the
Latin America region that reduces the up-front marketing costs required for customer acquisition. 

Product
and Technology 

Product
and technology expense was 8.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 0.7 million from the comparable
period in 2023. This decrease is due primarily to overall reduction of compensation costs and reduced headcount realized as part of ongoing
cost saving initiatives. 

General
and Administrative 

General
and administrative expense was 7.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 0.8 million from the comparable
period in 2023. This decrease is due primarily to overall reduction of compensation costs and reduced headcount realized as part of ongoing
cost saving initiatives. 

Depreciation
and Amortization 

Depreciation
and amortization expense was 2.0 million for three months ended September 30, 2024, a decrease of 2.4 million from the comparable period
in 2023. The decrease was primarily due to the reduction of depreciable assets that were fully amortized compared to the prior periods. 

Income
Tax Benefit 

We
recorded income tax benefit of 1.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, reflecting an effective tax rate of
(114.3) , compared to income tax benefit of 0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023, reflecting an effective tax
rate of 3.2 . Our country of domicile is Bermuda, which effectively has a 0 statutory tax rate as it does not impose taxes on
profits, income, dividends, or capital gains. The difference between this 0 tax rate and the effective income tax rate for three
months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 was due primarily to a mix of earnings in foreign jurisdictions that are subject to current
or deferred tax and loss carryforwards in certain jurisdictions that are not expected to be realized.

to compare our operating performance from period to period, as it removes the effect of items not directly resulting from our core operations,
and (ii) as a means of assessing our core business performance against others in the industry, because it eliminates some of the effects
that are generated by differences in capital structure, depreciation, tax effects and unusual and infrequent events. 

We
define Adjusted EBITDA as net loss before interest expense (income), net, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and amortization,
impairments, share-based compensation expense and related expense, restructuring costs and other items which our Board of Directors considers
to be infrequent or unusual in nature. The presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be used in isolation or as a substitute
for any measure prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and Adjusted EBITDA may exclude financial information that some investors may consider
important in evaluating our performance. Because Adjusted EBITDA is not a U.S. GAAP measure, the way we define Adjusted EBITDA may not
be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies in the industry. 

Below
is a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most comparable U.S. GAAP measure, as presented in the condensed consolidated
statements of operations for the periods specified:

Key
Performance Indicators 

Our
management uses the following key performance indicators KPIs as indicators of trends and results of the business. These
KPIs give our management an indication of the level of engagement between the player and the Company s platforms. No estimation
is necessary in quantifying these KPIs, nor do they represent U.S. GAAP based measurements. These KPIs are subject to various risks such
as customer concentration, competition, licensing and regulation, and macroeconomic conditions. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors 
for further risks associated with our business which would affect these KPIs.

B2B
Gross Operator Revenue 

We
define B2B Gross Operator Revenue as the sum of our B2B corporate customers gross revenue from SIM, gross gaming revenue from
RMiG, and gross sports wins from sportsbook offerings. B2B Gross Operator Revenue, which is not comparable to financial information presented
in conformity with U.S. GAAP, gives management and users of our financial statements an indication of the extent of transactions processed
through our B2B corporate customers platforms and allows management to understand the extent of activity that our platform is
processing. 

The
increase in Gross Operator Revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2023, was driven primarily by organic growth in Pennsylvania, Michigan, New Jersey, Connecticut, and Ontario. 

B2B
Take Rate 

We
define B2B Take Rate as a quotient of B2B segment revenue retained by the Company over the total Gross Operator Revenue generated by
our B2B corporate customers. B2B Take Rate gives management and users of our financial statements an indication of the impact of the
statutory terms and the efficiency of the commercial terms on the business. 

The
increase in B2B Take Rate for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 was due
primarily to increased revenue recognized in the current quarter related to a partner exit in Michigan. The decrease in B2B Take Rate
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the prior year comparable period was primarily due to a decrease in our contractual
revenue rates pursuant to an agreement regarding the expiration of an exclusivity period with a B2B customer in 2023. 

38 

 Table of Contents 

B2C
Active Customers 

We
define B2C Active Customers as a user that places a wager during the period. This metric allows management to monitor the customer segmentation,
growth drivers, and ultimately creates opportunities to identify and add value to the user experience. This metric allows management
and users of the financial statements to measure the platform traffic and track related trends. 

The
decrease in B2C Active Customers for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by reduced customer acquisition
in Latin America. 

B2C
Marketing Spend Ratio 

We
define B2C Marketing Spend Ratio as the total B2C direct marketing expense for the period divided by the total B2C revenues. This metric
allows management to measure the success of marketing costs during a given period. Additionally, this metric allows management to compare
across jurisdictions and other subsets, as an additional indication of return on marketing investment. 

The
decrease in the B2C Marketing Spend Ratio for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was primarily driven by the deployment of affiliate
marketing strategies primarily in Latin America. B2C Marketing Spend Ratio for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was relatively
consistent with the prior year. 

B2C
Sports Margin 

We
define B2C Sports Margin as the ratio of wagers minus winnings to total amount wagered, adjusted for open wagers at period end. Sports
betting involves a user placing a bet on the outcome of a sporting event with the chance to win a pre-determined amount, often referred
to as fixed odds. Our B2C sportsbook revenue is generated by setting odds that are intended to provide a built-in theoretical margin
in each sports bet offered to our users. This metric allows management to measure sportsbook performance against its expected outcome. 

The
fluctuations in the B2C Sports Margin for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, were primarily attributable to the outcomes
of individual sporting events. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Material
Cash Commitments 

Our
primary uses of cash include funding our ongoing working capital needs and developing and maintaining our proprietary software platforms.
Such capital allocations are contemplated while considering other opportunities we may have to deploy our capital. 

The
execution of our growth strategy will require continued significant capital expenditures, and we expect to continue investing in our
products and technologies as we seek to scale our business. 

We
utilized cash in investing activities of 2.3 million and 4.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Of these activities, expenditures related to internally developed capitalized software represented 1.6 million and 2.8 million, respectively,
and property and equipment (including licenses for internal use software) represented 0.4 million and 1.6 million, respectively. 

39 

 Table of Contents 

Sources
of Liquidity 

Since
our inception, we have primarily funded our operations through cash generated from operations, cash generated from financing activities,
including our U.S. initial public offering and term credit facility, and cash on hand. 

In
April 2022, we entered into a 30.0 million term credit facility with net proceeds of 27.6 million (the Credit Facility ).
The Credit Facility contained affirmative and negative covenants, including certain financial covenants associated with our financial
results. The financial covenants test periods began on March 31, 2023. We obtained waivers for all financial covenants as of March 31,
2023, and were in compliance as of September 30, 2024. 

On
April 13, 2023, we executed agreements to amend the Credit Facility (forming the Amended Credit Facility ). The Amended
Credit Facility became effective upon cash settlement of payments completed on April 14, 2023. The Amended Credit Facility contains a
financial covenant, among other covenants, requiring minimum liquidity of 10.0 million. Refer to Note 6 Debt in the accompanying
condensed consolidated financial statements for further detail with respect to the Amended Credit Facility. 

We
believe cash generated from operations and cash on hand will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements
for at least the next twelve months. We are actively addressing internal costs to conserve cash and executing these programs will be
critical to our ability to continue funding our operations for at least the next twelve months. 

To
the extent that our current resources, including our ability to generate operating cash flows, are insufficient to satisfy our cash requirements,
we may seek additional equity or debt financing. Our ability to do so depends on prevailing economic conditions and other factors, many
of which are beyond our control. 

We
do not currently have any such credit facilities or similar debt arrangements in place, outside of the Amended Credit Facility as described
above, and cannot provide any assurance as to the availability or terms of any additional future financing that we may require to support
our operations. If the needed financing is not available, or if the terms of financing are less desirable than we expect, we may be forced
to decrease our level of investment in new products and technologies, discontinue further expansion of our business, or scale back our
existing operations, any of which could have an adverse impact on our business and financial prospects.

Operating
Activities 

Net
cash provided by (used in) operating activities increased by 3.8 million primarily due to an increase in cash generated from working
capital of 9.4 million. The remaining increase in cash provided by operating activities was due to overall decreased costs that contributed
to a decrease in loss from operations. 

Investing
Activities 

Net
cash used in investing activities decreased by 2.5 million primarily due to a reduction of capitalized development of 1.1 million primarily
related to the B2B segment, and a decrease in purchase of property and equipment of 1.3 million related to the Company s new facilities
in Europe incurred in the prior year.

Financing
Activities 

Net
cash provided by financing activities decreased by 1.3 million, which was primarily related to the Company s
amendment of its credit facility in the prior year. 

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

As
a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide the information required by this Item. 

Item
4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Disclosure
controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated
and communicated to management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer (together, the Certifying Officers ),
as appropriate to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

In
designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how
well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance, not absolute assurance, of achieving the desired control objectives,
and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Because
of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements will
not occur or that all control issues, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in
decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes. The design of any system of controls
is based, in part, upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will
succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. 

As
required by SEC Rule 13a-15(b), we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including
the Certifying Officers, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of
the period covered by this report. Based on the foregoing, the Certifying Officers concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures
were not effective at the reasonable assurance level as of September 30, 2024. The Certifying Officers based their conclusion on the
fact that the Company has identified material weaknesses in controls over financial reporting, detailed below. In light of this fact,
our management has performed additional analyses, reconciliations, and other procedures and have concluded that, notwithstanding the
material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, the condensed consolidated financial statements for the periods
covered by and included in this Form 10-Q fairly present, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and
cash flows for the periods presented in conformity with GAAP. 

Material
Weakness in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

As
previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, material weaknesses were identified in the
Company s internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal
control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s interim
or annual condensed consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 

41 

 Table of Contents 

During
the course of management s prior year-end procedures, the Company s management and audit committee of the board of directors
identified deficiencies in the design of the control environment whereby certain finance users were granted super user 
access and security administration rights to the financial reporting systems, the activity of these users with elevated access were not
actively monitored, and no segregation of duties over journal entry preparation and approval within the B2C segment existed and determined
that these deficiencies constituted a material weakness. While the Company has actively begun to implement controls to remediate the
material weakness, this material weakness has not been resolved as of September 30, 2024. 

Remediation
Plans 

We
continue to evaluate measures to remediate the identified material weakness. These measures include implementing appropriate controls
to segregate journal entry preparation and approvals and to actively monitor finance users with elevated rights. 

We
intend to continue to take steps to remediate the material weakness described above and further evolving our accounting processes, controls,
and reviews. The Company plans to continue to assess its internal controls and procedures and intends to take further action as necessary
or appropriate to address any other matters it identifies or are brought to its attention. We will not be able to fully remediate this
material weakness until these steps have been completed and have been operating effectively for a sufficient period of time. 

The
actions that we are taking are subject to ongoing senior management review, as well as audit committee oversight. We will not be able
to conclude whether the steps we are taking will fully remediate the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting
until we have completed our remediation efforts and subsequent evaluation of their effectiveness. We may also conclude that additional
measures may be required to remediate the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, which may necessitate further
action. 

Changes
in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting 

Except
for the remediation efforts described above, there was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during
the quarter covered by this Form 10-Q that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
over financial reporting. 

PART
II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item
1. Legal Proceedings 

We
are subject to legal proceedings that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. We are not
currently a party to any legal proceedings that, in the opinion of our management, are likely to have a material adverse effect on our
business. 

The
outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts
above management s expectations, the Company s financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could
be materially adversely affected. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement
costs, diversion of management resources and other factors. 

Item
1A. Risk Factors 

There
are no material changes from the risk factors as disclosed in Part I, Item 1A under the heading Risk Factors, in our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on March 13, 2024.
