The Company has adopted ASC 740, Accounting for Income Taxes , 
which requires an asset and liability approach to financial accounting and reporting for income taxes. Deferred income tax assets and
liabilities are computed annually from differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities that will result
in taxable or deductible amounts in the future based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences
are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount
expected to be realized.

Current accounting principles that are provided in
ASC 815 - Derivatives and Hedging require derivative financial instruments to be classified in liabilities and carried
at fair value with changes recorded in income. The Company has selected the Monte Carlo Simulation Model, which approximates the Monte
Carlo Simulations, valuation technique to fair value the embedded derivative because it believes that this technique is reflective of
all significant assumption types, and ranges of assumption inputs, that market participants would likely consider in transactions involving
embedded derivatives. Such assumptions include, among other inputs, interest risk assumptions, credit risk assumptions and redemption
behaviors in addition to traditional inputs for option models such as market trading volatility and risk-free rates. The Binomial Lattice
Model technique is a level three valuation technique because it requires the development of significant internal assumptions in addition
to observable market indicators. For instruments in which the time to expiration has expired, the Company has utilized the intrinsic value
as the fair value. The intrinsic value is the difference between the quoted market price on the valuation date and the applicable conversion
price. 

Significant inputs and results arising from the Monte
Carlo Simulation process are as follows for the embedded derivatives that have been bifurcated from the convertible notes and classified
in liabilities:

In connection
with a different consulting agreement dated March 1, 2023, the Company initially agreed to pay shares of common stock, along
with a monthly consulting fee. This common stock was valued at on the date of the agreement and was amortized equally over the six-month
agreement. On July 1, 2023, the Company and consultant decided to amend the agreement so that the consultant would receive warrants
valued at in replacement for the stock and extend the agreement until June 30, 2024. The agreement was amended again on September
15, 2023 resulting in an additional warrants being issued and the agreement extended until September 15, 2024. This resulted in

Oil and Gas Producing Activities 

 The Company uses the successful efforts method
of accounting for oil and gas activities. Under this method, the costs of productive exploratory wells, all development wells, related
asset retirement obligation assets, and productive leases are capitalized and amortized, principally by field, on a units-of-production
basis over the life of the remaining proved reserves. Exploration costs, including personnel costs, geological and geophysical expenses,
and delay rentals for oil and gas leases are charged to expense as incurred. Exploratory drilling costs are initially capitalized, but
charged to expense if and when the well is determined not to have found reserves in commercial quantities. The sale of a partial interest
in a proved property is accounted for as a cost recovery, and no gain or loss is recognized as long as this treatment does not significantly
affect the units-of-production amortization rate. A gain or loss is recognized for all other sales of producing properties. There were
capitalized costs of and at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 

 Unproved oil and gas properties are assessed annually
to determine whether they have been impaired by the drilling of dry holes on or near the related acreage or other circumstances, which
may indicate a decline in value. When impairment occurs, a loss is recognized. When leases for unproved properties expire, the costs thereof,
net of any related allowance for impairment, is removed from the accounts and charged to expense. During the nine months ended September
30, 2024 and 2023, there was impairment to unproved properties. The sale of a partial interest in an unproved property is accounted
for as a recovery of cost when substantial uncertainty exists as to the ultimate recovery of the cost applicable to the interest retained.
A gain on the sale is recognized to the extent that the sales price exceeds the carrying amount of the unproved property. A gain or loss
is recognized for all other sales of unproved properties. For the nine months ending September 30, 2024 and 2023, there was gain or
loss recognized for sales of unproved properties. However, as of November 14, 2024, CETI is in conversations with various parties relating
to the spinoff of the Alvey Oil Field assets. It is uncertain about the value of these assets and any write off will occur at when the
spinoff is finalized. 

Costs associated with development wells that are unevaluated or are waiting
on access to transportation or processing facilities are reclassified into developmental wells-in-progress ("WIP"). These costs
are not put into a depletable field basis until the wells are fully evaluated or access is gained to transportation and processing facilities.
Costs associated with WIP are included in the cash flows from investing as part of investment in oil and gas properties. At September
30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, capitalized developmental costs were included in WIP. 

Depreciation, depletion and amortization of proved
oil and gas properties is calculated using the units-of- production method based on proved reserves and estimated salvage values. During
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded depreciation, depletion
and amortization expense on oil and gas properties. The Company will start using the units-of-production method when the field is continuously
operational and there are material sales. 

The Company reviews its proved oil and natural gas
properties for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that a decline in the recoverability of its carrying value may have
occurred. It estimates the undiscounted future net cash flows of its oil and natural gas properties and compares such undiscounted future
cash flows to the carrying amount of the oil and natural gas properties to determine if the carrying amount is recoverable. If the carrying
amount exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows, the Company will adjust the carrying amount of the oil and natural gas properties
to fair value. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, there was impairment to proved properties. 

(2) Texas Railroad Commission Bond and Estimated Asset Retirement
Obligation 

To cover the estimated future asset retirement obligations
("ARO") related to its oil and gas properties, the Company maintains a bond with the Railroad Commission of Texas RRC ).
With the help of an outside consultant, the Company estimates it would take to cap each of the 32 wells on the property so there
is a liability of to make up the difference. The bond ensures that the Company will cap any wells on the Alvey Oil Field that
it decides are no longer productive. Once the Company decides it is finished working the Alvey Oil Field, it can apply to the RRC to have
the bond repaid. 

Revisions to the liability could occur due to changes
in estimated abandonment costs, changes in well economic lives, or if federal or state regulators enact new requirements regarding the
abandonment of wells

 Net provision for Federal income taxes 

The income tax provision differs from the amount of
income tax determined by applying the U.S. federal income tax rate to pretax income from continuing operations for the periods ended September
30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, due to the following: 

Less: Valuation allowance

 Net deferred tax asset 

At September 30, 2024, the Company had net operating
loss carry forwards of which would result in a deferred tax asset of that may be offset against future taxable income
from the year 2024 to 2040. tax benefit has been reported in the September 2024 and December 2023 financial statements since the potential
tax benefit is offset by a valuation allowance of the same amount. 

Due to the change in ownership provisions of the Tax
Reform Act of 1986, net operating loss carry forwards for Federal Income tax reporting purposes are subject to annual limitations. Should
a change in ownership occur, net operating loss carry forwards may be limited as to use in future years.

New shares issued to investors who had converted debentures to equity from October 1, 2024 to November 15, 2024 were shares of common stock. 

CETI was under contract to purchase a salt water disposal facility in
 Oklahoma. Subsequent to quarter end, CETI decided not to move forward with the purchase with the owner regarding payments due and inventory still on the property. 

In October 2024, CETI entered into an agreement with Warrior Operating Group, LLC (WOG) to provide recycled and water processing services for WOG. The services provided are intended to generate additional revenue from the separation of oil from the wastewater produced and sourced by WOG and treated using CETI s remediation equipment, systems and processes at WOG s Salt Water Disposal site(s).

Gross Sales . These sales are from CETI s
temporary operations at a salt water disposal (SWD) facility in Oklahoma. CETI contracted to buy the SWD and during its due diligence
was allowed to operate on the property. During this time, CETI generated these sales. 

General and administrative Expenses .
General and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 were up by 100 vs 2023 largely due to CETI s
temporary operations on a salt water disposal facility in Oklahoma. These operations were done to determine whether to pursue a purchase
of the facility which was decided against after quarter end. 

Professional fees . These fees are largely
made up of audit and audit-related fees 15,000 and 14,550 as of September 2024 and 2023 respectively). 

Consulting fees . Decreased by 30 due
largely to the decrease in non-cash, stock-based compensation in 2024 of 186,865 vs 370,762 in 2023. 

Other income (expense). Much of this
is relates to the derivative accounting for convertible debt from a one lender. This lender offers the Company the option to payoff debt
or convert it to stock. For the five loans taken out in 2023 and 2024, the Company has elected to payoff three of them and still has two
outstanding. For the interest expense, the 14 increase is largely due to loans payable increase of 150,000 in the third quarter of 2024
vs 2023. 

Net income (loss) from continuing operations.
 The above changes resulted in net loss of 821,609 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a loss of 846,030
for the similar period in 2023. As noted above, there was increase in revenue and the decrease in consulting expense. These changes largely
accounted for the decreased loss in 2024 vs 2023. 

Discontinued operations. The Company
is looking to spin off the Alvey oil field and this represents the non-capitalized expenses related to the Alvey. 

Non-controlling interest. CAX is a 51 controlled subsidiary of CETI and started operations
in the 3 rd quarter of 2024 and, as such, has shown minimal activity so far. The total loss of 7,439 is largely due to consulting
expenses of 7,000. For the loss, 3,794 is attributed to CETI and 3,645 is attributed to CAX.

done to determine whether to pursue a purchase of the facility which was decided against after quarter end. 

Professional fees . These fees are largely
made up of audit and audit-related fees, 80,621 and 71,839 as of September 30, 2024 and 2023 respectively, 

Consulting fees . Are largely made up
from non-cash, stock-based compensation of 746,019 and 995,895 for the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

Other income (expense). Much of this
is relates to the derivative accounting for convertible debt from a one lender. This lender offers the Company the option to payoff debt
or convert it to stock. For the five loans taken out in 2023 and 2024, the Company has elected to payoff three of them and still has two
outstanding. For the interest expense, this is largely due to increase in interest due or payable on loans taken on after September 2023
as well as interest on convertible debentures. For the convertible debentures, the average balance of convertible debentures in the first
nine months of 2024 was about twice that of the same period in 2023. 

Net income (loss) from continuing operations. 
The above changes resulted in net loss of 2,662,024 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to a loss of 2,266,244 for
the similar period in 2023. Most of the difference is attributable to interest expense and increase in general and administrative expenses
as noted above. 

Discontinued operations. The Company
is looking to spin off the Alvey oil field and this represents the non-capitalized expenses related to the Alvey. 

Non-controlling interest. CAX is a
51 controlled subsidiary of CETI and started operations in the 3 rd quarter of 2024 and, as such, has shown minimal activity
so far. The total loss of 7,439 is largely due to consulting expenses of 7,000. For the loss, 3,794 is attributed to CETI and 3,645
is attributed to CAX.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

As of September 30, 2024, the Company had total assets
of 5,766,753 including current assets of 594,925 as well as 3,496,275 from the discontinued operations of the Alvey oil field. We
also have current liabilities of 1,205,067 which consist of accounts payable of 237,517 and short-term note payable of 229,319, net
of discount of 94,331, notes payable of 177,500 and 489,463 from the discontinued operations of the Alvey oil field which is mostly
the payable due on the Alvey Oil Field leasehold improvements. We also have 1,825,417 of long-term liabilities which is largely due to
convertible notes payable of 1,404,000. We believe our ability to achieve commercial success and continued growth will be
dependent upon our continued access to capital either through sale of additional convertible debentures, sale of our equity or cash generated
from operations. We will attempt to obtain additional capital through private investors; however, we have no agreements or understandings
with third parties at this time in regards to investing additional monies. 

The accompanying consolidated financial
statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. However, as noted above, the Company is
dependent upon raising additional capital to meet its business plans which raises substantial doubt about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern. 

S-1 Registration Statement Effective January 2023 

The Company filed an S-1 Registration
statement in 2022 and it became effective in January 2023. This gives the Company the right to sell 10 million shares of common stock
at 0.40 per share and allowed almost seven million shares of stock from debentures converted in 2022 to become free trading shares. As
of November 14, 2024, none of the 10 million shares of common stock have been sold. 

 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
About Market Risk. 

As a "smaller reporting company," as defined
by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, the Company is not required to provide this information. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 

Disclosure controls and procedures are controls
and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act") is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods
specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and
communicated to management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

 As required by paragraph (b) of Rules 13a-15
or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer (our principal executive officer)
and our chief financial officer (our principal financial officer and principal accounting officer) evaluated the effectiveness of our
disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report, being June 30, 2024. 

 Based on this evaluation, these officers concluded
that, as of September 30, 2024 these disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that the information required to
be disclosed by our company in reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities Exchange Commission. The conclusion that our disclosure
controls and procedures were not effective was due to the Company was lacking in pre-planning for expenses and documentation of all transactions.
As of September 30, 2024, some progress has been made in implementing enhanced controls and procedures. 

 Because of the inherent limitations in all
control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, if any, within our company have been
detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur
because of simple error or mistake. 

 A material weakness is a deficiency, or
combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a more than remote possibility that a
misstatement of our company's annual or interim consolidated financial statements could occur. In its assessment of the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024, we determined that there were control
deficiencies that constituted material weaknesses which are indicative of many small companies with small staff, such as: 

(1) 
 
 inadequate segregation of duties and effective risk assessment; and 

(2) 
 
 insufficient written policies and procedures for documenting all transactions with vendors. 

Our management is currently evaluating remediation
plans for the above deficiencies. During the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, we have been able to remediate some
of the weaknesses described above. However, we plan to take steps to enhance and improve the design of our internal control over financial
reporting.
