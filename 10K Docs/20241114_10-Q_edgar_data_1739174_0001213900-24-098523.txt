CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING
INFORMATION 

This Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q, or the Quarterly Report, includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and other securities laws. The statements contained herein that are not purely historical,
are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include statements about our expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, intentions,
assumptions and other statements that are not historical facts. Words or phrases such as anticipate, believe, 
 continue, estimate, expect, intend, may, ongoing, 
 plan, potential, predict, project, will or similar words or phrases,
or the negatives of those words or phrases, may identify forward-looking statements, but the absence of these words does not necessarily
mean that a statement is not forward-looking. For example, we are making forward-looking statements when we discuss our business strategy
and plans, our clinical and pre-clinical development program, including timing, milestones and the design thereof, including acceptance
of regulatory agencies of such design, the potential opportunities for and benefits of the BacteriOphage Lead to Treatment, or BOLT, platform,
the potential of our product candidates and the sufficiency of financial resources and financial needs and ability to continue as a going
concern. However, you should understand that these statements are not guarantees of performance or results, and there are a number of
risks, uncertainties and other important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the
forward-looking statements, including, among others: 

the ability to generate revenues, and raise sufficient financing to meet working capital requirements; 

the integration of the operations of Adaptive Phage Therapeutics LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, or APT, into the Company; 

the unpredictable timing and cost associated with our approach to developing product candidates using phage technology; 

political, economic and military instability in the State of Israel, and in particular, the war in Gaza and Lebanon, additional potential conflicts with other middle eastern countries and the continuation of the proposed judicial and other legislation reform by the Israeli government; 

political and economic instability, including, without limitation, due to natural disasters or other catastrophic events, such as the Russian invasion of Ukraine and world sanctions on Russia, Belarus, and related parties, terrorist attacks, hurricanes, fire, floods, pollution and earthquakes; 

obtaining U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, acceptance of any non-U.S. clinical trials of product candidates; 

our ability to enroll patients in clinical trials and achieve anticipated development milestones when expected; 

the ability to pursue and effectively develop new product opportunities and acquisitions and to obtain value from such product opportunities and acquisitions; 

penalties and market withdrawal associated with any unanticipated problems with product candidates and failure to comply with labeling and other restrictions; 

general economic conditions, our current low stock price and other factors on our operations, the continuity of our business, including our preclinical and clinical trials, and our ability to raise additional capital; 

expenses associated with compliance with ongoing regulatory obligations and successful continuing regulatory review; 

market acceptance of our product candidates and ability to identify or discover additional product candidates; 

ii 

our ability to obtain high titers for specific phage cocktails necessary for preclinical and clinical testing; 

the availability of specialty raw materials and global supply chain challenges; 

the ability of our product candidates to demonstrate requisite, safety and efficacy for drug products, or safety, purity and potency for biologics without causing adverse effects; 

the success of expected future advanced clinical trials of our product candidates; 

our ability to obtain required regulatory approvals; 

our ability to maintain compliance with the continued listing standards of the NYSE American; 

delays in developing manufacturing processes for our product candidates; 

competition from similar technologies, products that are more effective, safer or more affordable than our product candidates or products that obtain marketing approval before our product candidates; 

the impact of unfavorable pricing regulations, third-party reimbursement practices or healthcare reform initiatives on our ability to sell product candidates or therapies profitably; 

protection of our intellectual property rights and compliance with the terms and conditions of current and future licenses with third parties; 

infringement on the intellectual property rights of third parties and claims for remuneration or royalties for assigned service invention rights; 

our ability to acquire, in-license or use proprietary rights held by third parties necessary to our product candidates or future development candidates; 

ethical, legal and social concerns about synthetic biology and genetic engineering that may adversely affect market acceptance of our product candidates; 

reliance on third-party collaborators; 

our ability to attract and retain key employees or to enforce the terms of noncompetition agreements with employees; 

the failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations other than drug manufacturing compliance; and 

potential security breaches, including cybersecurity incidents. 

For a detailed discussion
of these and other risks, uncertainties and factors, see Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the year ended December 31, 2023 and Part II, Item 1A Risk Factors of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter
ended June 30, 2024 and of this Quarterly Report. All forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report speak only as of the
date hereof. Except as required by law, we are under no duty to (and expressly disclaim any such obligation to) update or revise any of
the forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, after the date of this Quarterly Report.
Comparisons of results between current and prior periods are not intended to express any future trends, or indications of future performance,
and should be viewed only as historical data.

B. 
 The war with Hamas and Hezbollah 

On October 7, 2023, an unprecedented
attack was launched against Israel by terrorists from the Hamas terrorist organization that infiltrated Israel s southern border
from the Gaza Strip and in other areas within the state of Israel attacking civilians and military targets while simultaneously launching
extensive rocket attacks on the Israeli population. These attacks resulted in extensive deaths, injuries and kidnapping of civilians and
soldiers. In response, the Security Cabinet of the State of Israel declared war against Hamas and a military campaign against these terrorist
organizations commenced in parallel to their continued rocket and terror attacks. In addition, Hezbollah, an Islamist terrorist group
that controls large portions of southern Lebanon, has attacked military and civilian targets in Northern Israel, to which Israel has responded.
Moreover, Iran recently launched a direct attack on Israel involving hundreds of drones and missiles and has threatened to continue to
attack Israel and is widely believed to be developing nuclear weapons. Iran is also believed to have a strong influence among extremist
groups in the region, such as Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthi movement in Yemen and various rebel militia groups in Syria
and Iraq. Such clashes may escalate in the future into a greater regional conflict. 

To date, the State of Israel continues
to be at war with Hamas and Hezbollah and in an armed conflict with Iran and its rebel militia groups. 

BiomX headquarters are located in Ness
Ziona, Israel; as well as most of its operations. In addition, most of the key employees and officers are residents of Israel. Accordingly,
political, economic and military conditions in Israel and the surrounding region may directly affect its business. 

While a few employees of the Company
were called to reserve duty in the Israel Defense Forces, the ongoing war with Hamas and Hezbollah has not, since its inception, materially
impacted BiomX s business or operations. Furthermore, BiomX does not expect any delays to its programs as a result of the situation.
However, at this time, it is not possible to predict the intensity or duration of Israel s war against Hamas and Hezbollah, nor
predict how this war will ultimately affect BiomX business and operations or Israel s economy in general.

shares of the Company s Common Stock, Redeemable
Convertible Preferred Shares and Warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of shares of the Company Common Stock Merger
Warrants ). Each share of Redeemable Convertible Preferred Shares is convertible into an aggregate of shares, after giving effect
to the Reverse Split of Common Stock. The Merger Warrants will be exercisable at any time after the date of the receipt of BiomX
stockholder approval at an exercise price of per share and will expire on . In the event the Redeemable Convertible
Preferred Shares are not converted by the earlier to occur of (i) the time that meeting of BiomX stockholders is ultimately concluded
or (ii) five months after the initial issuance of the Redeemable Convertible Preferred Shares, the Company may be required to pay to each
holder of the Redeemable Convertible Preferred Shares an amount in cash equal to the fair value of the Redeemable Convertible Preferred
Shares. On July 9, 2024, the Company s stockholders approved the conversion of the Redeemable Convertible Preferred Shares into
shares of Common Stock and the issuance of shares of Common Stock upon the exercise of the Merger Warrants. 

The Redeemable Convertible Preferred
Shares are entitled to receive dividends on shares of the Redeemable Convertible Preferred Shares equal to, on an as-if-converted-to Common-Stock
basis, and in the same form as, dividends actually paid on shares of the Common Stock. Except as otherwise required by law or with respect
to the Redeemable Convertible Preferred Shares protective provisions set forth in the Company s Certificate of Designations, the
Redeemable Convertible Preferred Shares does not have voting rights. 

At the Closing Date, the Redeemable Convertible Preferred Shares were
classified as temporary equity in accordance with the provisions of ASC 480-10-S99, as they included clauses that could constitute redemption
clauses that were subject to the Company s stockholder approval and outside of the Company s control. On June 17, 2024, the
Company filed a definitive Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A with respect to a meeting of stockholders to approve, among other things, the
conversion of the Redeemable Convertible Preferred Shares into shares of Common Stock. In addition, the majority of the Company s
stockholders signed a binding support agreement that contained their commitment to vote in favor or deliver a written consent regarding
any stockholders matter in the stockholders meeting which took place on July 9, 2024. These circumstances led the Company
to determine that the Redeemable Convertible Preferred Shares meet the definition of permanent equity as the Company is able to control
the redemption. Therefore, the Redeemable Convertible Preferred Shares were reclassified as equity. On July 15, 2024, Redeemable
Convertible Preferred Shares that were issued under the Acquisition and the March 2024 PIPE were converted into shares of the
Company s Common Stock according to beneficial ownership limitations set by certain investors.

costs are accounted for as expenses in the period in which the costs are incurred. The Company incurred transaction costs of during

assets and liabilities assumed is based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset, based on the most advantageous
market for the asset (i.e., its highest and best use). 

The Company recognized intangible assets
related to the Acquisition, which consist of IPR D valued at using the Multi-Period Excess Earnings Method valuation method
and of goodwill valued at . The goodwill is primarily attributed to the expected synergies from combining the operations of APT with
the Company s operations and to the assembled workforce of APT. The IPR D is considered indefinite lived until the completion
or abandonment of the associated research and development efforts. Upon successful completion of the project, IPR D assets are reclassified
to developed technology and amortized over their estimated useful lives

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

References in this Quarterly
Report to the Company , BiomX , we , us or our , mean BiomX Inc. and
its consolidated subsidiaries unless otherwise expressly stated or the context indicates otherwise. 

The following discussion and
analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the notes
thereto contained elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. The analysis of the financial condition and results of operations includes Adaptive
Phage Therapeutics LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (formerly Adaptive Phage Therapeutics Inc., a Delaware corporation), or APT,
from the date that we acquired it on March 15, 2024. Certain information contained in the discussion and analysis set forth below includes
forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in any
forward-looking statement because of various factors discussed in this Quarterly Report and in our other filings with the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission, or the SEC. 

General 

We are a clinical stage product
discovery company developing products using both natural and engineered phage technologies designed to target and kill specific harmful
bacteria associated with chronic diseases, such as cystic fibrosis, or CF and diabetic foot osteomyelitis, or DFO. Bacteriophage or phage
are bacterial, species-specific, strain-limited viruses that infect, amplify and kill the target bacteria and are considered inert to
mammalian cells. By utilizing proprietary combinations of naturally occurring phage and by creating novel phage using synthetic biology,
we develop phage-based therapies intended to address both large-market and orphan diseases. 

Based on the urgency of treating
the infection (whether acute or chronic), the susceptibility of the target bacteria to phage (e.g. the ability to identify a phage cocktail
that would target a broad range of bacterial strains) and other considerations, we offer two phage-based product types: 

(1) Fixed
cocktail therapy in this approach a single product containing a fixed number of selected phage is developed to cover a wide range
of bacterial strains, thus allowing treatment of broad patient populations with the same product. Fixed cocktails are developed using
our proprietary BOLT platform, in which high throughput screening, directed evolution, and bioinformatic approaches are leveraged to
produce an optimal phage cocktail. 

(2) 
 Personalized therapy in this approach a large library of phage is developed, of which a single optimal phage is personally matched to treat specific patients. Matching optimal phage with patients is carried out using a proprietary phage susceptibility testing, where multiple considerations are analyzed simultaneously allowing for an efficient screen of the phage library while maintaining short turnaround times. 

In our therapeutic programs,
we focus on using phage therapy to target specific strains of pathogenic bacteria that are associated with diseases. Our phage-based product
candidates are developed utilizing our proprietary research and development platform named BOLT. The BOLT platform is unique, employing
cutting edge methodologies and capabilities across disciplines including computational biology, microbiology, synthetic engineering of
phage and their production bacterial hosts, bioanalytical assay development, manufacturing and formulation, to allow agile and efficient
development of natural or engineered phage combinations, or cocktails. The cocktail contains phage with complementary features and is
optimized for multiple characteristics such as broad target host range, ability to prevent resistance, biofilm penetration, stability
and ease of manufacturing. 

Our goal is to develop multiple
products based on the ability of phage to precisely target harmful bacteria and on our ability to screen, identify and combine different
phage, both naturally occurring and created using synthetic engineering, to develop these treatments.

On March 6, 2024, we entered

interests of APT were exchanged in a merger for an aggregate of 9,164,968 shares of BiomX common stock, 40,470 shares of Series X Preferred
Stock, or Redeemable Convertible Preferred Shares, convertible upon stockholder approval into 4,047,000 shares of BiomX common stock,
and warrants, or the Merger Warrants, exercisable for 216,650 shares of BiomX common stock. Upon the consummation of the Acquisition,
a successor-in-interest of APT became a wholly-owned subsidiary of BiomX. The Merger Warrants are exercisable at any time after July 9,
2024 at an exercise price of 50.00 per share and will expire on January 28, 2027. 

Concurrently with the consummation
of the Acquisition, we entered into a securities purchase agreement, or the March 2024 PIPE, with certain investors, pursuant to which
such investors purchased an aggregate of 216,417 Redeemable Convertible Preferred Shares and warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of
10,820,850 shares of Common Stock, or the Private Placement Warrants, for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately 50 million. 

Immediately following the
Acquisition, and without taking into account the Redeemable Convertible Preferred Shares issued in the March 2024 PIPE, and assuming conversion
of all of the Redeemable Convertible Preferred Shares into Common Stock, our stockholders (including holders of the Pre-Funded Warrants,
as defined below) prior to the Acquisition owned approximately 55 of the share capital of the Company and APT s stockholders prior
to the Acquisition owned approximately 45 of the share capital of the Company. 

On July 9, 2024, the stockholder
approved, among other things, the conversion of 256,887 Redeemable Convertible Preferred Shares into up to 25,688,700 shares of Common
stock. Subsequently, on July 15, 2024, 109,152 Redeemable Convertible Preferred Shares were converted into 10,915,200 shares of Common
Stock according to beneficial ownership limitations set by certain investors. 

On July 9, 2024, the Company s
stockholders approved a reverse stock split at a ratio within a range of 1-for-5 and 1-for-10 at such time as the Board of
Directors shall determine, in its sole discretion, at any time before July 9, 2025. On August 8, 2024, the Board of Directors approved
a 1-for-10 Reverse Stock Split of the Company s shares of Common Stock, or the Reverse Stock Split. On August 20, 2024, the Company
filed the Certificate of Amendment with the Delaware Secretary of State to effect the Reverse Split, which became effective on August
26, 2024, or the Effective Date. The Company s common stock began trading on a Reverse Stock Split-adjusted basis on the NYSE American
at the open of the markets on the Effective Date. Unless otherwise indicated, all issued and outstanding shares amounts in this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q have been adjusted to reflect the Reverse Stock Split for all periods presented. Proportional adjustments
also were made to shares underlying outstanding equity awards, warrants and Redeemable Convertible Preferred Shares, and to the number
of shares issued and issuable under the Company s stock incentive plans and certain existing agreements. 

Clinical and Pre-Clinical Developments 

Ongoing Programs 

Cystic Fibrosis 

BX004 is our therapeutic phage
product candidate under development for chronic pulmonary infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, or P. aeruginosa , a main
contributor to morbidity and mortality in patients with CF. Enhanced resistance to antibiotics develops, particularly in CF patients,
due to extensive drug use consisting of prolonged and repeated broad-spectrum antibiotic courses often beginning in childhood, and leading
to the appearance of multidrug-resistant strains. In preclinical in vitro studies, BX004 was shown to be active against antibiotic resistant
strains of P. aeruginosa and demonstrated the ability to penetrate biofilm, an assemblage of surface-associated microbial cells enclosed
in an extracellular polymeric substance and one of the leading causes for antibiotic resistance. 

The Phase 1b/2a trial in CF
patients with chronic respiratory infections caused by P. aeruginosa . is comprised of two parts. The study design is based on recommendations
from the Cystic Fibrosis Therapeutic Development Network. 

In February 2023, we
announced positive results from Part 1 of the Phase 1b/2a trial evaluating BX004. Part 1 evaluated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics,
and microbiologic activity of BX004 over a 7-day ascending treatment period in nine CF patients (7 on BX004, 2 on placebo) with chronic
 P. aeruginosa pulmonary infection in a single ascending dose and multiple dose design. 

Results from Part 1 of the
Phase 1b/2a trial included the following findings: No safety events related to treatment with BX004 occurred; Mean P. aeruginosa colony
forming units, at Day 15 (compared to baseline): -1.42 log (BX004) vs. -0.28 log (placebo). This reduction was seen on top of standard
of care inhaled antibiotics; Phage were detected in all patients treated with BX004 during the dosing period, including in several patients
up to Day 15 (one week after end of therapy); no phage were detected in patients receiving placebo; there was no evidence of treatment-related
resistance to BX004 during or after treatment, compared to placebo; and as expected due to the short duration of treatment, there was
no detectable effect on predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second, or FEV1. 

In November 2023, we announced
positive topline results from Part 2 of the Phase 1b/2a trial evaluating BX004. The objectives of Part 2 of the Phase 1b/2a trial were
to evaluate the safety and tolerability of BX004 in a larger number of CF patients dosed for a longer treatment duration than Part 1 of
the study. In Part 2, 34 CF patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio with 23 CF patients receiving BX004 and 11 patients receiving placebo
via nebulization twice daily for 10 days. 

3 

Highlights from the Part 2
data of the Phase 1b/2a study included: 

Study
drug was safe and well-tolerated, with no related SAEs (serious adverse events) or related APEs (acute pulmonary exacerbations) to study
drug. 

In the BX004 arm, 3 out of 21 (14.3 patients converted to sputum culture negative for P. aeruginosa after 10 days of treatment (including 2 patients after 4 days) compared to 0 out of 10 (0 in the placebo arm (In patients that had quantitative colony-forming unit levels at study baseline). 

BX004 vs. placebo showed a clinical effect in a predefined subgroup of patients with reduced baseline lung function (FEV1 

In August 2023, the FDA granted
BX004 Fast Track designation for the treatment of chronic respiratory infections caused by P. aeruginosa bacterial strains in patients
with CF. In addition, in December 2023, BX004 received orphan drug designation from the FDA. 

BiomX expects to initiate
a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center Phase 2b study in CF patients with chronic P. aeruginosa pulmonary
infections in the fourth quarter of 2024. The study is designed to enroll approximately 60 patients randomized at a 2:1 ratio to BX004
or placebo. Treatment is expected to be administered via inhalation twice daily for a duration of 8 weeks. The study is designed to monitor
the safety and tolerability of BX004 and is designed to demonstrate improvement in microbiological reduction of P. aeruginosa 
burden and evaluation of effects on clinical parameters such as lung function measured by FEV1 and patient reported outcomes. During the
third quarter of 2024, we experienced manufacturing delays for BX004. As a result of these delays, study results are now expected in the
first half of 2026. 

BX211 Treatment of Diabetic Foot Osteomyelitis,
or DFO 

BX211 is a personalized phage
therapy for the treatment of DFO associated with Staphylococcus aureus, or S. aureus, a bacterium associated with the development and
exacerbation of inflammation in atopic dermatitis. The personalized phage treatment tailors a specific phage selected from a proprietary
phage-bank according to the specific strain of S. aureus biopsied and isolated from each patient. DFO is a bacterial infection of the
bone that usually develops from an infected foot ulcer and is a leading cause of amputation in patients with diabetes. We believe that
scientific literature demonstrating the potential benefit in treating osteomyelitis using phage in animal models as well as numerous successful
compassionate cases using phage therapy to treat DFO patient support our approach of using phage therapy to treat DFO. 

The ongoing randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled, multi-center Phase 2 trial investigating the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of BX211 for subjects with DFO associated
with S. aureus has finished enrollment for a randomized at a 2:1 ratio to BX211 or placebo. BX211 or placebo is designed to be administered
weekly, by topical and IV route at week 1 and by the topical route only at each of weeks 2-12. Over the 12-week treatment period, all
subjects are expected to continue to be treated in accordance with standard of care which will include antibiotic treatment as appropriate.
A first readout of study topline results is expected at week 13 evaluating healing of the wound associated with osteomyelitis, followed
by a second readout at week 52 evaluating amputation rates and resolution of osteomyelitis based on X-ray, clinical assessments, and established
biomarkers (Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate and C-Reactive Protein). These readouts are expected in the first quarter of 2025 and the first
quarter of 2026, respectively. 

Non-CF Bronchiectasis, or NCFB 

Chronic P. aeruginosa infections
in NCFB patients are a main contributor to morbidity and mortality in this disease. Pending positive data of BX004 in our cystic fibrosis
Phase 2B study, we expect to look to initiate studies into NCFB as an additional indication for BX004. 

National Institutes of Health, or NIH, study
in Cystic Fibrosis 

We are supporting a study
conducted by the NIH and The Antibacterial Resistance Leadership Group targeting P. Aeruginosa infections in CF patients under
FDA emergency Investigational New Drug allowance. Phase 1b/2, multi-centered, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial is assessing
the safety and microbiological activity of a single IV dose of bacteriophage therapy in cystic fibrosis subjects colonized with P. aeruginosa. 

4 

Programs on hold 

Prosthetic Joint Infections, or PJI 

Our personalized phage therapy
for treating PJI targets multiple bacterial organisms such as Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecium.
This treatment was granted Orphan-drug designation by the FDA in July 2020. As of the date of this Quarterly Report, we have paused development
efforts of this program due to prioritizing resources towards our CF and DFO programs, and we cannot provide guidance on resuming its
development. 

Discontinued programs 

BX005 Treatment of Atopic Dermatitis,
or AD 

BX005 is our topical phage
product candidate targeting S. aureus. S. aureus is more abundant on the skin of AD patients than on the skin of healthy individuals
and on lesional skin than non-lesional skin. It also increases in abundance, becoming the dominant bacteria, when patients experience
flares. By reducing the load of S. aureus , BX005 is designed to shift the skin microbiome composition to its pre-flare 
state and potentially provide a clinical benefit. In preclinical in vitro studies, BX005 was shown to eradicate over 90 of strains,
including antibiotic resistant strains, from a panel of S. aureus strains (120 strains isolated from skin of subjects from the
U.S. and Europe). On April 8, 2022, the FDA approved the Company s IND application for BX005. 

In 2024, we discontinued
the development of BX005, choosing instead to focus our resources on our Cystic Fibrosis and DFO programs.

R D expenses, net (net
of grants received from the Israel Innovation Authority IIA and the Medical Technology Enterprise Consortium MTEC ),
and consideration from research collaborations) were 7.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 5.6 million
for same period in 2023. The increase of 1.7 million, or 30 , is primarily due to the following factors: 

preparations
for Phase 2b in the clinical trial of our CF product candidate, BX004, 

an increase in expenses relating to the clinical trial of our DFO product candidate, BX211; and 

an increase in rent and related expenses following the APT Acquisition. 

The increase was partly offset
by higher grants received. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded 0.9 million of MTEC grants, compared
to 0.2 million of IIA grants recorded in the same period in 2023. 

General and administrative
expenses were 3.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 2.2 million for the three months ended September
30, 2023. The increase of 1.0 million, or 45 , is primarily attributed to a full quarter consolidation of expenses following the Acquisition,
incorporating the combined workforce, increased professional services, and additional subcontractor expenses. 

Goodwill impairment was
 0.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, following an impairment of the Company s goodwill that resulted from
the Acquisition. The Company s market capitalization as of September 30, 2024, was lower in comparison to its stockholders 
equity and triggered an impairment assessment that concluded that the entire goodwill should be impaired. 

Other income was 0.1 million
for each of the three months ended September 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 and consisted proceeds from a sublease agreement for a portion
of our office space in Ness Ziona, Israel. 

Interest expenses were 5,000
for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 574,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease of 569,000,
or 99 , is due to repayment of the loan under the Loan and Security Agreement, or the Hercules Loan Agreement, with Hercules Capital,
Inc., or Hercules, in March 2024. 

Income from change in fair
value of Private Placement Warrants reflects the revaluation that resulted from the accounting of the Private Placement Warrants issued
under the March 2024 PIPE. 

There was no material change
to Finance income that impacted earnings for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the three months ended September 30,
2023. 

Basic and diluted earnings
per share of Common Stock was 0.31 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to loss per share of 1.30 for the three months
ended September 30, 2023. The increase of 1.61 resulted from the revaluation of the Private Placement Warrants. Such increase was partly
offset due to share issuances as part of the Acquisition and the Redeemable Convertible Preferred Shares conversion into shares
of Common Stock.

R D expenses, net (net
of grants received from IIA and MTEC, and consideration from research collaborations) were 18.3 million for the nine months ended September
30, 2024, compared to 14.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of 4.3 million, or 31 , is primarily due
to the following factors: 

Increased
expenses relating to the clinical trial of our DFO product candidate, BX211; and 

Increased
expenses relating to the combined workforce and rent expenses following the Acquisition 

Such increase was partly offset
by completing the enrollment and follow-up period of patients in the clinical trial of our CF product candidate, BX004. During the nine
months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded 1.8 million of MTEC grants, compared to 1.3 million of IIA grants for the same
period in 2023. 

General and administrative expenses were 8.8 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 6.1 million for the same period in 2023. The increase of 2.7 million, or 44 , is primarily
due to issuance costs and legal services expenses related to the Acquisition and the March 2024 PIPE agreement. as well as due to increased
salaries and related expenses resulting from the combined workforce following the Acquisition. 

Goodwill impairment was 0.8 million for the nine months ended September
30, 2024, following an impairment of the Company s goodwill resulted from the Acquisition. The Company s market capitalization
as of September 30, 2024, was lower in comparison to its stockholders equity and triggered an impairment assessment that concluded
that the entire goodwill should be impaired. 

Other income was 2.2 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 0.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of 1.9
million, or 633 , is primarily due to the reversion of the contract liability associated with the Company s AD program which has
been paused. 

Interest expenses were 0.9
million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 1.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease
of 1.0 million, or 53 , is due to the repayment of the loan under the Loan and Security Agreement in March 2024. 

Income from change in fair
value of Private Placement Warrants reflects the revaluation that resulted from the accounting of the Private Placement Warrants issued
under the March 2024 PIPE. 

7 

Finance expenses, net were
 1.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to Finance income, net of 1.0 million for the nine months ended September
30, 2023. The increase of 2.1 million resulted mainly from the Private Placement Warrants transaction costs. 

Basic loss per share of Common
Stock was 0.27 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 4.29 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease
in loss per share of 4.02, or 94 , is primarily attributable to an increase in outstanding shares resulting from the share issuance as
part of the Acquisition and the Redeemable Convertible Preferred Shares conversion into shares of Common Stock. In addition, the
income resulting from the Private Placement Warrants revaluation has led to a decreased net loss. 

Diluted loss per share of
Common Stock was 2.45 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to diluted loss per share of 4.29 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2023. The decrease of 1.84 resulted from the increased number of potential shares of Common Stock that would have been
issued upon exercises of the Private Placement Warrants from the March 2024 PIPE. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

We believe our cash and cash equivalents and short-term deposits on
hand will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements into the fourth quarter of 2025. We currently
plan to continue to focus primarily on the development of BX004, our product candidate for treating CF and BX211, our product candidate
for treating DFO. Although we recently completed the 2024 March PIPE, in the future we will likely require or desire additional funds
to support our operating expenses and capital requirements. Accordingly, we are implementing cost cutting measures, and exploring and
expect to further explore, raising such additional funds through public or private equity, debt financing, loans, government or other
grants or collaborative agreements or from other sources, as well as under the 2023 ATM Agreement discussed below. If we are unable to
obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, when we require it, our ability to continue to grow or support our
business and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited. If there are increases in operating costs for facilities
expansion, research and development and clinical activity, we will need to use mitigating actions such as to seek additional financing
or postpone expenses that are not based on firm commitments. If certain disruptions due to, for instance, the war with Hamas and Hezbollah,
or Israeli political instability persists and deepens, we could experience an inability to access additional capital, which could in the
future negatively affect our capacity to support our operating expenses and capital requirements. As a result of these factors, management
believes that there is substantial doubt as to the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.

Operating Activities 

Net cash used in operating
activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was 30.7 million, primarily driven by our R D, general and administrative
expenses, as well as changes in our operating assets and liabilities of 4.0 million, offset by non-cash charges of 23.5 million.
Non-cash charges for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 consisted primarily of income from change in fair value of the Private Placement
Warrants of 24.4 million and income from change in contract liability in amount of 2.0 million resulting from pausing the Company s
AD program. Additionally, there were depreciation and amortization expenses of 0.9 million, Private Placement Warrants issuance costs
of 0.7 million and Goodwill impairment of 0.8 million. Net changes in our operating assets and liabilities consisted primarily of a
decrease in trade account payable of 2.7 million, as well as a decrease in other accounts payable of 0.9 million and a decrease in other
current and non-current assets of 0.2 million. 

Net cash used in operating
activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was 15.0 million primarily due to a net loss of 20.7 million, mostly due to
our R D and general and administrative expenses, and due to changes in our operating assets and liabilities of 4.2 million, offset
by non-cash charges of 1.4 million. Non-cash charges for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 consisted primarily of depreciation
and amortization expenses of 0.7 million, stock-based compensation expenses of 0.6 million and amortization of debt issuance costs
of 0.4 million, partly offset by finance income of 0.3 million. Net changes in our operating assets and liabilities consisted primarily
of an increase in other accounts payable of 3.3 million, due to expenses related to conducting the clinical trial of our CF product
candidate, BX004, and an increase in trade account payables of 0.2 million, partially offset by a decrease in other current assets in
the amount of 0.7 million.

Investing Activities 

During the nine months ended
September 30, 2024, net cash provided by investing activities was 0.7 million, mainly consisting of cash and restricted cash acquired
from the Acquisition. 

During the nine months ended
September 30, 2023, net cash provided by investing activities was 2.0 million, mainly consisting of proceeds from short-term deposits
of 2.0 million. 

We have invested, and plan
to continue to invest, our existing cash in short-term investments in accordance with our investment policy. These investments may include
money market funds and investment securities consisting of U.S. Treasury notes, and high quality, marketable debt instruments of corporations
and government sponsored enterprises. We use foreign exchange contracts (mainly options and forward contracts) to hedge balance sheet
items from currency exposure. These foreign exchange contracts are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes. In connection
with these foreign exchange contracts, we record gains or losses that offset the revaluation of the balance sheet items under financial
income, net in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. As of September 30, 2024, we had outstanding foreign exchange
contracts for the exchange of USD to NIS in the amount of approximately 3.4 million with a fair value asset of 15,000. As of September
30, 2023, we had outstanding foreign exchange contracts for the exchange of USD to NIS in the amount of approximately 3.8 million with
a fair value of 33,000. 

Financing Activities 

During the nine months ended
September 30, 2024, net cash provided by financing activities was 39.0 million, mainly consisting of the issuance of Redeemable Convertible
Preferred Shares and the Private Placement Warrants in the March 2024 PIPE in the amount of 20.8 million, net of issuance costs and 28.7
million, respectively. This was partially offset by the prepayment of the long-term debt in the amount of 10.7 million under the Hercules
Loan Agreement. 

During the nine months ended
September 30, 2023, net cash provided by financing activities was 4.2 million, mainly consisting of the issuance of Common Stock under
the Securities Purchase Agreement we entered into in February 2023, of 7.2 million net of issuance costs, partially offset by the repayment
of long-term debt of 2.9 million under the Hercules Loan Agreement. 

Under the Hercules Loan Agreement,
Hercules provided the Company with access to a term loan with an aggregate principal amount of up to 30 million, or the Term Loan Facility,
available in three tranches, subject to certain terms and conditions. The first tranche of 15 million was advanced to us on the date
the Hercules Loan Agreement was executed. The conditions for the second and third tranches were not reached and have expired. We were
required to make interest only payments through March 1, 2023, and started to then repay the principal balance and interest in equal monthly
installments. Interest on the Hercules Loan accrues at a per annum rate equal to the greater of (i) the Prime Rate as reported in The
Wall Street Journal plus 5.70 and (ii) 8.95 . On March 19, 2024, the Company prepaid all the term loan under the Term Loan Facility in
a total of 10,428,000. The prepayment included an end of term charge of 983,000 and accrued interest of 69,000. The Company received
a waiver regarding the prepayment charge that should have been 1 out of the prepaid principal amount, equaling 94,000. 

On December 7, 2023, we filed
a shelf registration statement on Form S-3, which was declared effective by the SEC on January 2, 2024. In addition, on December 7, 2023,
we entered into an At the Market Offering Agreement, or the 2023 ATM Agreement, with H.C. Wainwright Co., LLC, or Wainwright, with
Wainwright as manager, pursuant to which we may issue and sell shares of our Common Stock having an aggregate offering price of up to
 7.5 million from time to time through Wainwright. We are not obligated to make any sales of Common Stock under the 2023 ATM Agreement.
From January 1, 2024 through November 12, 2024, we issued 7,518 shares of Common Stock pursuant to the 2023 ATM Agreement for aggregate
gross proceeds of 19 thousand. 

On March 15, 2024, concurrently
with the consummation of the Acquisition, we consummated the March 2024 PIPE with existing and new investors, resulting in aggregate gross

Outlook 

We have accumulated a deficit
of 166.2 million since our inception. To date, we have not generated revenue from our operations, and we do not expect to generate any
significant revenues from sales of products in the next twelve months. Our cash needs may increase in the foreseeable future. We expect
to generate revenues from the sale of licenses to use our technology or products, but in the short and medium terms any amounts generated
are unlikely to exceed our costs of operations. According to our estimates and based on our current operating plans, our liquidity resources
as of September 30, 2024, which consisted primarily of cash, cash equivalents, short-term deposits and restricted cash of approximately
 24.7 million will be sufficient to fund our operations into the fourth quarter of 2025. 

Consistent with our ongoing
R D activities, we expect to continue to incur additional losses in the foreseeable future. To the extent we require funds above our
existing liquidity resources in the medium and long term, we plan to fund our operations, as well as other development activities relating
to additional product candidates, through future issuances of public or private equity, including under our 2023 ATM Agreement, issuance
of debt securities, loans, and possibly additional grants from the IIA or other government or non-profit institutions. Our ability to
raise additional capital in the equity and debt markets is dependent on a number of factors including, but not limited to, the market
demand for our securities, which itself is subject to a number of development and business risks and uncertainties, as well as the uncertainty
that we would be able to raise such additional capital at a price or on terms that are favorable to us. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
About Market Risk 

As a smaller reporting company,
we are not required to make disclosures under this Item. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

We maintain disclosure controls
and procedures (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by us in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified
in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal
executive officer and principal financial officer or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure. 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our management, with the participation
of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, conducted an evaluation, as of the end of the period covered by this
Quarterly Report, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)
under the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that
our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2024. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting 

There has been no change in
our internal control over financial reporting, as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act, during
the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
over financial reporting.

SEC on August 14, 2024, except as noted below. 

Risks Related to Our Operations in Israel 

Our research and development
and other significant operations are located in Israel, and, therefore, our results may be adversely affected by political, economic and
military instability in Israel, including the recent war with Hamas, Hezbollah and other terrorist organizations in the Middle East. 

Our executive offices and
research and development facilities are located in Israel. In addition, the majority of our key employees and all of our officers are
residents of Israel. Accordingly, political, geopolitical, economic and military conditions in Israel may directly affect our business.
Since the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, several armed conflicts have taken place between Israel and its neighboring Arab
countries, the Hamas (an Islamist terrorist militia and political group that controls the Gaza strip), the Hezbollah (an Islamist terrorist
militia and political group based in Lebanon) and other terrorist organizations active in the region. These conflicts have involved missile
strikes, drone strikes, hostile infiltrations and terrorism against civilian targets in various parts of Israel, which have negatively
affected business conditions in Israel. Any hostilities involving Israel or the interruption or curtailment of trade between Israel and
its trading partners could negatively affect business conditions in Israel in general and our business in particular, and adversely affect
our product development, operations and results of operations. 

In October 2023, Hamas terrorists
infiltrated Israel s southern border from the Gaza Strip and conducted a series of attacks on civilian and military targets. Hamas
also launched extensive rocket attacks on Israeli population and industrial centers located along Israel s border with the Gaza
Strip and in other areas within the State of Israel. These attacks resulted in extensive deaths, injuries and kidnapping of civilians
and soldiers. Following the attack, Israel s security cabinet declared war against Hamas and a military campaign against these terrorist
organizations commenced in parallel to their continued rocket and terror attacks. In addition, since the commencement of these events,
there have been continued hostilities along Israel s northern border with Lebanon (with the Hezbollah terror organization) and southern
border (with the Houthi movement in Yemen, as described below). In April 2024 and September 2024, Israel experienced direct attacks from
Iran, involving hundreds of drones and missiles launched towards various parts of the country, mostly targeting military bases. The Israeli
defense systems, aided by international allies, successfully intercepted most of these attacks, minimizing physical damage and casualties.
Such incidents contribute to regional instability and could potentially escalate into broader conflicts with Iran and its proxies in the
Middle East, affecting Israel s political and trade relations, especially with neighboring countries and global allies. The situation
remains fluid, and the potential for further escalation exists. 

In
connection with the Israeli security cabinet s declaration of war against Hamas and possible hostilities with other organizations,
several hundred thousand Israeli military reservists were drafted to perform immediate military service, including 6 employees, none of
whom are management or key employees, who were called up for reserve service, of which 4 have since returned to work full time and their
pre-war military reserve duty. So long as the war continues,
our personnel may be called up for reserve service, whether for extended periods or periodically for short-term periods. Military service
call ups that result in absences of personnel for extended periods of time may materially and adversely affect our business, prospects,
financial condition and results of operations. 

Since the war broke out on
October 7, 2023, our operations have not been adversely affected by this situation, and we have not experienced disruptions to our business
operations. As such, our product and business development activities remain on track. However, the intensity and duration of Israel s
current war against Hamas is difficult to predict at this stage, as are such war s economic implications on our business and operations
and on Israel s economy in general. If the war extends for a long period of time or expands to other fronts, such as Lebanon, Syria
and the West Bank, our operations may be adversely affected. 

Any armed conflicts, terrorist
activities or political instability in the region could adversely affect business conditions, could harm our results of operations and
the market price of our Common Stock, and could make it more difficult for us to raise capital. 

Our commercial insurance does
not cover losses that may occur as a result of an event associated with the security situation in the Middle East. Although the Israeli
government has in the past covered the reinstatement value of certain damages that were caused by terrorist attacks or acts of war, we
cannot assure you that this government coverage will be maintained or, if maintained, will be sufficient to compensate us fully for damages
incurred. Any losses or damages incurred by us could have a material adverse effect on our business. 

Finally, political conditions
within Israel may affect our operations. Israel has held five general elections between 2019 and 2022, and prior to October 2023, the
Israeli government pursued extensive changes to Israel s judicial system, which sparked extensive political debate and unrest. To
date, these initiatives have been substantially put on hold. Actual or perceived political instability in Israel or any negative changes
in the political environment, may individually or in the aggregate adversely affect the Israeli economy and, in turn, our business, financial
condition, results of operations and growth prospects.

amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, convert such shares into cash at a
per share price equal to the quotient determined by dividing (i) the amount then held in the Trust Fund (as defined below) less any income

distributions, if any), and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to approval of the Corporation s
then stockholders and subject to the requirements of the GCL, including the adoption of a resolution by the Board of Directors pursuant
to Section 275(a) of the GCL finding the dissolution of the Corporation advisable and the provision of such notices as are required by
said Section 275(a) of the GCL, dissolve and liquidate the balance of the Corporation s net assets to its remaining stockholders,

unless the by-laws of the Corporation so provide. 

B. The Board of Directors shall have
the power, without the assent or vote of the stockholders, to make, alter, amend, change, add to or repeal the by-laws of the Corporation
as provided in the by-laws of the Corporation. 

C. The directors in their discretion
may submit any contract or act for approval or ratification at any annual meeting of the stockholders or at any meeting of the stockholders
called for the purpose of considering any such act or contract, and any contract or act that shall be approved or be ratified by the vote
of the holders of a majority of the stock of the Corporation which is represented in person or by proxy at such meeting and entitled to
vote thereat (provided that a lawful quorum of stockholders be there represented in person or by proxy) shall be as valid and binding
upon the Corporation and upon all the stockholders as though it had been approved or ratified by every stockholder of the Corporation,
whether or not the contract or act would otherwise be open to legal attack because of directors interests, or for any other reason. 

D. In addition to the powers and authorities
hereinbefore or by statute expressly conferred upon them, the directors are hereby empowered to exercise all such powers and do all such
acts and things as may be exercised or done by the Corporation; subject, nevertheless, to the provisions of the statutes of Delaware,
of this Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, and to any bylaws from time to time made by the stockholders; provided, however,
that no bylaw so made shall invalidate any prior act of the directors which would have been valid if such bylaws had not been made. 

3 This provision has been revised to reflect changes effectuated
by the Certificate of Amendment filed October 28, 2019. 

3 

E. The Board of Directors shall be divided
into three classes: Class I, Class II and Class III. The number of directors in each class shall be fixed exclusively by the Board of
Directors and shall be as nearly equal as possible. Following the filing of the amendment to the certificate of incorporation including

of Stockholders, the directors in Class I shall be elected for a term expiring at the second Annual Meeting of Stockholders, the directors
in Class II shall be elected for a term expiring at the third Annual Meeting of Stockholders and the directors in Class III shall be elected
for a term expiring at the fourth Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Commencing at the second Annual Meeting of Stockholders following the
filing of the amendment to the certificate of incorporation including this provision, and at each annual meeting thereafter, directors
elected to succeed those directors whose terms expire shall be elected for a term of office to expire at the third succeeding annual meeting
of stockholders after their election. Except as the GCL may otherwise require, in the interim between annual meetings of stockholders
or special meetings of stockholders called for the election of directors and/or the removal of one or more directors and the filling of
any vacancy in that connection, newly created directorships and any vacancies in the Board of Directors, including unfilled vacancies
resulting from the removal of directors for cause, may be filled only by the vote of a majority of the remaining directors then in office,
although less than a quorum (as defined in the Corporation s bylaws), or by the sole remaining director. All directors shall hold
office until the expiration of their respective terms of office and until their successors shall have been elected and qualified. A director
elected to fill a vacancy resulting from the death, resignation or removal of a director shall serve for the remainder of the full term
of the director whose death, resignation or removal shall have created such vacancy and until his successor shall have been elected and
qualified. 

EIGHTH: 

A. A director of the Corporation shall
not be personally liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty as a director, except
for liability (i) for any breach of the director s duty of loyalty to the Corporation or its stockholders, (ii) for acts or omissions
not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, (iii) under Section 174 of the GCL, or (iv) for
any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit. If the GCL is amended to authorize corporate action further
eliminating or limiting the personal liability of directors, then the liability of a director of the Corporation shall be eliminated or
limited to the fullest extent permitted by the GCL, as so amended. Any repeal or modification of this paragraph A by the stockholders
of the Corporation shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director of the Corporation with respect to events occurring
prior to the time of such repeal or modification. 

B. The Corporation, to the full extent
permitted by Section 145 of the GCL, as amended from time to time, shall indemnify all persons whom it may indemnify pursuant thereto.
Expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred by an officer or director in defending any civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative
action, suit or proceeding for which such officer or director may be entitled to indemnification hereunder shall be paid by the Corporation
in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such director
or officer to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he is not entitled to be indemnified by the Corporation as authorized
hereby. 

C. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions
of this Article Eighth, no indemnification nor advancement of expenses will extend to any claims made by the Company s officers
and directors to cover any loss that such individuals may sustain as a result of such individuals agreement to pay debts and obligations
to target businesses or vendors or other entities that are owed money by the Corporation for services rendered or contracted for or products
sold to the Corporation, as described in the Registration Statement. 

NINTH:

this Corporation and its stockholders or any class of them, any court of equitable jurisdiction within the State of Delaware may, on the
application in a summary way of this Corporation or of any creditor or stockholder thereof or on the application of any receiver or receivers
appointed for this Corporation under Section 291 of Title 8 of the Delaware Code or on the application of trustees in dissolution or of
any receiver or receivers appointed for this Corporation under Section 279 of Title 8 of the Delaware Code order a meeting of the creditors
or class of creditors, and/or of the stockholders or class of stockholders of this Corporation, as the case may be, to be summoned in
such manner as the said court directs. If a majority in number representing three fourths in value of the creditors or class of creditors,
and/or of the stockholders or class of stockholders of this Corporation, as the case may be, agree to any compromise or arrangement and
to any reorganization of this Corporation as a consequence of such compromise or arrangement, the said compromise or arrangement and the
said reorganization shall, if sanctioned by the court to which the said application has been made, be binding on all the creditors or
class of creditors, and/or on all the stockholders or class of stockholders, of this Corporation, as the case may be, and also on this
Corporation.

Agreement with respect to this RSU award); 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises
and the mutual covenants and agreements herein contained and for other good and valuable consideration the receipt and adequacy of which
are hereby acknowledged, the Company and the Recipient agree as follows.

entity or successor to the Company following such transaction, may elect to: (i) continue this RSU subject to the terms of this Restricted
Stock Unit Agreement and the Plan and subject to such adjustments, if any, by the Administrator as permitted by Section 3.2 of the Plan;
or (ii) accelerate vesting of this RSU and terminate this RSU in exchange for a cash payment. In the event that the Company or its successor

(c) Administrator

4 below (the Dividend Equivalent ). If a dividend on the Stock is payable wholly or partially in Stock, the Dividend Equivalent
representing that portion shall be in the form of additional RSUs, credited on a one-for-one basis. If a dividend on the Stock is payable
wholly or partially in cash, the Dividend Equivalent representing that portion shall also be in the form of cash and a Recipient shall
be treated as being credited with any cash dividends, without earnings, until settlement pursuant to Section 4 below. If a dividend on
Stock is payable wholly or partially in other than cash or Stock, the Administrator may, in its discretion, provide for such Dividend
Equivalents with respect to that portion as it deems appropriate under the circumstances. Dividend Equivalents shall be subject to the

applicable, be forfeited) as if they had been granted at the same time as the original RSU. Dividend Equivalents representing the cash
portion of a dividend on Stock shall be settled in cash.

the Plan, of such Underlying Shares as of that date (or such later delivery date, if applicable) and (b) the amount (and in the form)
due with respect to any Dividend Equivalents applicable to such Underlying Shares. Whether Underlying Shares, or the cash value thereof,
shall be issued or paid at settlement shall be determined based on the Form of Settlement specified in the Customizing Information. 

2 

To the extent
the vesting of any RSUs occurs during a blackout period wherein certain employees, including the Recipient, are precluded
from selling Stock, the Administrator retains the right, in its sole discretion, to defer the delivery of the Underlying Shares; provided,
however, that the Administrator shall not exercise its right to defer the Recipient s receipt of the Underlying Shares if the Stock
is specifically covered by a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan of the Recipient that causes the Stock to be exempt from any applicable blackout
period then in effect. In the event the receipt of any shares of Stock is deferred hereunder due to the existence of a blackout period,
the shares shall be issued to the Recipient on the first day following the termination of the blackout period; provided, however, that
in no event shall the issuance of the shares be deferred later than the fifteenth day of the third month following the close of the year
in which the Underlying Shares otherwise would have been issued.

purchase price designated as the Purchase Price shown in the Customizing Information per underlying RSU is paid to the Company
by means of payment acceptable to the Company in accordance with the terms of the Plan. If the Recipient fails to pay for or accept delivery
of all of the shares, the right to shares of Stock provided pursuant to this RSU may be terminated by the Company. 

5. Withholding
Taxes . The Recipient hereby agrees, as a condition of this award, to provide to the Company (or a Related Company employing the Recipient,
as applicable) an amount sufficient to satisfy the Company s and/or Related Company s obligation to withhold any and all federal,
state, local or provincial income tax, social security, social insurance, payroll tax, fringe benefits tax, payment on account or other
tax-related items or statutory withholdings related to the Recipient s participation in the Plan (the Withholding Amount ),
if any, by (a) authorizing the Company and/or any Related Company employing the Recipient, as applicable, to withhold the Withholding
Amount from the Recipient s cash compensation, (b) remitting the Withholding Amount to the Company (or a Related Company employing
the Recipient, as applicable) in cash or (c) delivering to the Company stock certificates registered in his or her name representing shares
of Company Stock legally and beneficially owned by him or her, fully vested and free of all liens, claims, and encumbrances of every kind,
duly endorsed or accompanied by stock powers duly endorsed by the record holder of the Company Stock represented by such certificates;
provided, however, that to the extent that the Withholding Amount is not provided by one or a combination of such methods, the Company
may at its election withhold from the Underlying Shares and any Dividend Equivalents that would otherwise be delivered that number of
shares (and/or cash) having a Fair Market Value on the date of vesting sufficient to eliminate any deficiency in the Withholding Amount.

income tax, social security, social insurance, payroll tax, fringe benefits tax, payment on account or other tax-related items or statutory
withholdings related to the Recipient s participation in the Plan, the Recipient acknowledges that he or she, and not the Company

incapacity or to the person appointed by the Recipient in a durable power of attorney acceptable to the Company s counsel.

will receive such shares or other securities for investment and not with a view to their resale or distribution, and will execute an appropriate
investment letter satisfactory to the Company and its counsel. The Recipient further hereby agrees that as a condition to the settlement
of RSUs and any Dividend Equivalents, if requested by the Company, the Recipient will execute an agreement in a form acceptable to the
Company to the effect that the Underlying Shares shall be subject to any underwriter s or similar lock-up agreement in connection
with an offering of any securities of the Company that may from time to time apply to shares held by officers and directors of the Company,
and such agreement or a successor agreement must be in full force and effect.

APPENDIX
A 

BIOMX INC. 
2019 OMNIBUS LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN 
 Restricted Stock Unit Agreement 

FOR
Israeli PARTICIPANTS 

Terms and Conditions 

This Appendix A includes additional terms and conditions that govern
the RSU award to Recipient under the Plan if Recipient is subject to tax, works, and/or resides, in Israel. 

This Appendix A forms part of the Restricted Stock Unit Agreement.
Any capitalized term used in this Appendix A without definition will have the meaning ascribed to it in the Restricted Stock Unit Agreement
or the Plan, as applicable. 

If Recipient is a citizen or resident of a jurisdiction, or is considered
resident of a jurisdiction, other than Israel, or Recipient transfers employment and/or residency from Israel after the Grant Date, the
Company will, in its sole discretion, determine to what extent the additional terms and conditions included herein will apply to Recipient
under these circumstances. 

Notifications 

This Appendix A also includes information relating to securities laws,
exchange control, foreign asset/account reporting requirements, and other issues of which Recipient should be aware with respect to Recipient s
participation in the Plan. The information is based on the securities, exchange control, and other laws in effect in Israel as of July
2024. Such laws are often complex and change frequently. As a result, Recipient should not rely on the information herein as the only
source of information relating to the consequences of Recipient s participation in the Plan because the information may be out of
date at the time that Recipient vests in the RSUs or sells Underlying Shares acquired pursuant to this RSU award. 

In addition, the information is general in nature and may not apply
to Recipient s particular situation, and the Company is not in a position to assure Recipient of any particular result. Accordingly,
Recipient should seek appropriate professional advice as to how the relevant laws in Israel may apply to Recipient s situation. 

Finally, if Recipient is a citizen or resident of a jurisdiction, or
is considered resident of a jurisdiction, other than Israel, or Recipient transfers employment and/or residency from Israel after the
Grant Date, the information contained herein may not apply to Recipient in the same manner. 

Terms and Conditions 

Nature of Award . By accepting this RSU award, Recipient understands
and agrees that the RSUs are offered subject to and in accordance with the Israeli Appendix to the Plan and the RSU is intended to be
a 102 Capital Gain Track Award (as defined in the Israeli Appendix). A copy of the Israeli Appendix is attached hereto as Exhibit
A . Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company does not undertake to maintain the qualified status of this RSU award and Recipient
acknowledges that Recipient will not be entitled to damages of any kind if the RSU award becomes disqualified and no longer qualifies
as a 102 Capital Gain Track Award. In the event of any inconsistencies between the Israeli Appendix, the Restricted Stock Unit Agreement
and/or the Plan, the terms of the Israeli Appendix will govern. 

8 

Further, to the extent requested by the Company or an Affiliate, Recipient
agrees to execute any letter or other agreement in connection with the grant of this RSU award or any future RSUs granted under the Israeli
Appendix. If Recipient fails to comply with such request, the RSU may not qualify as a 102 Capital Gain Track Award. 

Terms of RSUs . Certain specific terms of the RSU granted under
this Agreement are set forth in Exhibit B attached hereto. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, this RSU award shall
not be settled in cash nor shall the Recipient be entitled to Dividend Equivalent Units.

which shall be 24 months from the Grant Date. The Company may, in its sole discretion, replace the Trustee from time to time and instruct

of this Restricted Stock Unit Agreement shall apply to the new Trustee mutatis mutandis . The Company may replace, amend, cancel

she read the provisions of the Trust Agreement and that the terms and conditions thereof are hereby agreed and acknowledged and the Recipient
hereby agrees to be bound by, and comply with, the provisions of the Trust Agreement. The Recipient hereby confirms that he or she is
aware that the Underlying Shares may be held by a global stock plan administrator other than the Trustee, and that funds from the sale
or other disposition of such Underlying Shares will be transferred to an account in the name of the Trustee who shall transfer the funds
to the Recipient only after withholding any applicable Israeli taxes as required by law. 

Restriction on Sale . Recipient acknowledges that any Underlying
Shares may not be sold prior to the expiration of the Required Holding Period in order to qualify for tax treatment under the 102 Capital
Gain Track. Accordingly, Recipient shall not dispose of (or request the Trustee to dispose of) any such Underlying Shares prior to the
expiration of the Required Holding Period, other than as permitted by applicable law. For purposes of Israeli tax provisions, dispose

income tax principles. Moreover, in the event that Recipient disposes of any Underlying Shares prior to the expiration of the Required
Holding Period, Recipient acknowledges and agrees that any additional gains from the sale of such Underlying Shares will not qualify for
tax treatment under the 102 Capital Gain Track and will be subject to taxation in Israel in accordance with ordinary income tax principles,
and any sanctions under Section 102 with respect thereto shall be borne solely by the Recipient. Further, the Recipient acknowledges and
agrees that Recipient will be liable for the Company s or an Affiliates component of payments to the Israeli National Insurance

Company or its Affiliates, as applicable, to satisfy any obligation to withhold tax-related items applicable to the Recipient in connection
with the RSUs granted under the Israeli Appendix.
