Notwithstanding the above, if the Class A ordinary shares are at the time of any exercise of a warrant not listed on a national securities exchange such that they satisfy the definition of a covered security under Section 18(b)(1) of the Securities Act, the Company may, at its option, require holders of Public Warrants who exercise their warrants to do so on a cashless basis and, in the event the Company so elects, the Company will not be required to file or maintain in effect a registration statement, and in the event the Company does not so elect, it will use commercially reasonable efforts to register or qualify the shares under applicable blue sky laws to the extent an exemption is not available.

 The fair value of Class A ordinary shares for the above purpose shall mean the volume weighted average price of Class A ordinary shares during the trading days immediately following the date on which the notice of redemption is sent to the holders of warrants. In no event will the warrants be exercisable on a cashless basis in connection with this redemption feature for more than Class A ordinary shares per warrant (subject to adjustment). In no event will the Company be required to net cash settle any warrant. If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination prior to November 15, 2024 and the Company liquidates the funds held in the Trust Account, holders of warrants will not receive any of such funds with respect to their warrants, nor will they receive any distribution from the Company s assets held outside of the Trust Account with the respect to such warrants. Accordingly, the warrants may expire worthless.

 Transfers to/from Levels 1, 2, and 3 are recognized at the beginning of the reporting period. The estimated fair value of Public Warrants was transferred from a Level 3 measurement to a Level 1 measurement, when the Public Warrants were separately listed and traded in an active market in December 2021. The estimated fair value of the Private Placement Warrants was transferred from a Level 3 measurement to a Level 2 fair value measurement in January 2022, as the transfer of Private Placement Warrants to anyone who is not a permitted transferee would result in the Private Placement Warrants having substantially the same terms as the Public Warrants, the Company determined that the fair value of each Private Placement Warrant is equivalent to that of each Public Warrant. There were no other transfers between levels of the hierarchy for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Level 1 assets include investments in U.S. treasury securities. The Company uses inputs such as actual trade data, quoted market prices from dealers or brokers, and other similar sources to determine the fair value of its investments. The initial estimated fair value as of November 15, 2021, of the Public Warrants, the Private Placement Warrants, and the Forward Purchase Agreement is measured at fair value using a Monte Carlo simulation, determined using Level 3 inputs. The fair value of Public Warrants issued in connection with the Initial Public Offering have subsequently been measured based on the listed market price of such warrants. As of December 31, 2022, the fair value of the Forward Purchase Securities were measured using a Monte Carlo simulation, and the fair value of the Convertible Note was measured using a Black-Scholes model. Inherent in a Monte Carlo simulation and Black-Scholes model are assumptions related to expected stock-price volatility, expected life, risk-free interest rate and dividend yield. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the fair value of Private Placement Warrants and the contingently issuable Private Placement Warrants were determined based on the quoted price of the Public Warrants.

 Class A ordinary shares of the Company, which redemption requests were made in connection with the General Meeting to consider and vote on, among other proposals, a proposal to amend and restate, by way of a special resolution, the Company s 2nd amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, to extend from November 15, 2024 to November 15, 2025, the date by which, if the Company has not consummated a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination involving the Company, with one or more businesses or entities (a De-Spac Transaction ), the Company must (a) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (b) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the Class A ordinary shares sold in the Company s initial public offering; and (c) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the Company s remaining shareholders and the directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case to its obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and in all cases subject to the other requirements of applicable law (the Amendment Proposal ). The Amendment Proposal is described in more detail in the Company s definitive proxy statement filed with the SEC on October 10, 2024, as amended. The Backstop Investors agree to hold, and not redeem, up to an aggregate of shares of the Class A ordinary shares of the Company (the Backstop Investor Shares at the Closing. In consideration for the foregoing, upon consummation of the Company s Initial Business Combination, the Company shall pay or cause to be paid to each Backstop Investor a payment in respect of its respective Backstop Investor Shares in cash released from the Trust Account in an amount equal to the product of (x) the number of Backstop Investor Shares and (y) the price per share for a pro rata portion of the amount on deposit in the Trust Account as of the Closing. The Backstop Investors expect to acquire up to an aggregate of Class A ordinary shares of the Company in the open market at or below the Redemption Price (as defined in the Non- Redemption Agreements) (the Acquired Shares ). The Backstop Investors agree not to redeem the Acquired Shares and will not vote Acquired Shares in favor of the Amendment Proposal. On November 12, 2024, the Company and each Backstop Investor entered into Amendment No.1 to Non-Redemption Agreement (the Amendment pursuant to which the parties agree to allow the Backstop Investors to purchase Acquired Shares (as defined in the Agreements) at any time prior to the General Meeting. On November 12, 2024, the Company received a letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq stating that, pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule IM-5101-2 Rule IM-5101-2 ), the staff of Nasdaq Staff had determined that (i) the Company s securities will be delisted from Nasdaq, (ii) trading of the Company s Class A ordinary shares and units will be suspended at the opening of business on November 19, 2024 and (iii) a Form 25-NSE will be filed with the SEC, which will remove the Company s securities from listing and registration on Nasdaq. Under Rule IM-5101-2, a special purpose acquisition company must complete one or more business combinations within 36 months of the effectiveness of its initial public offering registration statement. Since the Company failed to complete its initial business combination by November 4, 2024, the Staff concluded that the Company did not comply with Rule IM-5101-2 and that the Company s securities are now subject to delisting. Nasdaq suspended that trading of the Company s Class A ordinary shares and units at the opening of business on November 19, 2024. Following the suspension of trading on Nasdaq, the Company s Class A ordinary shares will be eligible to trade on the OTCQB Market operated on The OTC Market systems OTC under the symbol CBRRF. The Company s warrants and units will be eligible for trading on the Pink Open Market operated by OTC under the symbols CBRGF and CBGGF, respectively. There can be no assurance that a broker will continue to make a market in the Company s securities or that trading of the common stock will continue on an over-the-counter market or elsewhere. Nasdaq will complete the delisting by filing a Form 25-NSE with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC ), which will remove the Company s securities from listing and registration on Nasdaq. We do not expect the delisting to impact our ability to consummate the previously disclosed business combination with Phtytanix Bio (the Phytanix Business Combination ). Regardless of where our securities are traded, the surviving Company will apply to list its

Except as expressly required by applicable securities law, the Company disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Liquidity and Going Concern As of September 30, 2024, we had cash of 428,625 and a working capital deficit of 486,351. Our liquidity needs up to December 29, 2023 had been satisfied through the cash receipt of 25,000 from CBG and CB Co-Investment to cover for certain expenses on behalf of the Company in exchange for issuance of founder shares, a loan from the related party of approximately 244,000 under the Note (as defined herein) which was repaid in full on November 17, 2021, the net proceeds from the consummation of the Initial Public Offering, over-allotment, the Private Placement held outside of the trust account and the issuance of the convertible notes. In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor, or certain of the Company s officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, provide the Company Working Capital Loans (as defined in Note 5). In connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Securities Purchase Agreement, CB Co-Investment irrevocably agreed to convert the 1.15 million loan (the Conversion Amount by CB Co-Investment to the Company at a conversion price of 1.00 per warrant, or 1,150,000 warrants. As of September 30, 2024, the fair value of converted loan was 11,500 which is included in contingently issuable private placement warrants on the accompanying condensed balance sheet as of September 30, 2024. The Company has until November 15, 2025 to consummate an initial Business Combination. If the Company has not consummated a Business Combination, the Company must (a) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (b) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem Public Shares; and (c) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the Company s remaining shareholders and the directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in each case to its obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and in all cases subject to the other requirements of applicable law. In connection with our assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with ASU 2014-15, Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, the Company has determined that the liquidity condition and the date for mandatory liquidation and subsequent dissolution raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. No adjustments have been made to the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities should the Company be required to liquidate after November 15, 2025. The condensed interim financial statements do not include any adjustment that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.

 Results of Operations Our entire activity since inception up to September 30, 2024 was in preparation for our Initial Public Offering and since the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the search for a prospective Business Combination. We will not generate any operating revenues until the closing and completion of our initial Business Combination, at the earliest. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, we had a net income of approximately 624,000, which consisted of general and administrative expenses of approximately 422,000 and general and administrative expenses to related party of 30,000, offset by investment income on the Trust Account of approximately 148,000, gain from the change in fair value of derivative liabilities of approximately 882,000 and gain from the change in fair value of contingently issuable private placement warrants of approximately 46,000. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, we had a net loss of approximately 472,000, which consisted of general and administrative expenses of approximately 170,000, general and administrative expenses to related party of 90,000, and loss from the change in fair value of derivative liabilities of approximately 791,000, partially offset by investment income on the Trust Account of approximately 576,000 and gain from the change in fair value of convertible note to related party of approximately 3,600. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had a net loss of approximately 1.1 million, which consisted of loss from the change in fair value of derivative liabilities of approximately 110,000, loss from change in fair value of contingently issuable private placement warrants of approximately 5,600, and general and administrative expenses of approximately 1.5 million and general and administrative expenses to related party of 90,000, offset by investment income on the Trust Account of approximately 637,000. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we had a net income of approximately 4.1 million, which consisted of a gain from the change in fair value of derivative liabilities of approximately 452,000, gain from the change in fair value of convertible note to related party of approximately 67,000 and investment income on the Trust Account of approximately 4.8 million, partially offset by general and administrative expenses of approximately 934,000 and general and administrative expenses to related party of 270,000. Contractual Obligations Registration Rights and Shareholder Rights The holders of Class B ordinary shares, Private Placement Warrants and warrants that may be issued upon conversion of Working Capital Loans (and any shares of ordinary shares issuable upon the exercise of the Private Placement Warrants or warrants issued upon conversion of the Working Capital Loans and upon conversion of the Class B ordinary shares), were entitled to registration rights pursuant to a registration and shareholder rights agreement signed upon the consummation of the Initial Public Offering. These holders will be entitled to certain demand and piggyback registration rights. The Company will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements. Critical Accounting Policies Derivative Financial Instruments We do not use derivative instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow, market or foreign currency risks. We evaluate all of our financial instruments, including issued stock purchase warrants, and forward purchase agreements, to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives, pursuant to ASC Topic 480 and ASC Topic 815. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, will be re-assessed at the end of each reporting period. Derivative warrant liabilities will be classified as non-current liabilities as their liquidation is not reasonably expected to require the use of current assets or require the creation of current liabilities.

 The 22,050,000 warrants that were issued in connection with the Initial Public Offering (including the 11,500,000 warrants included in the Units and the 10,550,000 Private Placement Warrants) and the 4,000,000 Forward Purchase Securities, were recognized as derivative liabilities in accordance with ASC Topic 815. Accordingly, the Company recognized the warrant instruments as liabilities at fair value and adjust the instruments to fair value at each reporting period. The liabilities will be subject to re-measurement at each balance sheet date until exercised. The fair value of the Forward Purchase Securities, Public Warrants and the Private Placement Warrants were initially measured using a Monte Carlo simulation. The fair value of Public Warrants issued in connection with the Initial Public Offering have subsequently been measured based on the listed market price of such Public Warrants. On December 26, 2023, in connection with the Securities Purchase Agreement, the Forward Purchase Securities were terminated and the Convertible Note was converted into contingently issuable private placement warrants. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the fair value of Private Placement Warrants was determined based on the quoted price of the Public Warrants. Class A Ordinary Shares Subject to Possible Redemption We account for our Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption in accordance with the guidance in ASC Topic 480. Class A ordinary shares subject to mandatory redemption (if any) are classified as liability instruments and are measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable Class A ordinary shares (including Class A ordinary shares that features redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within our control) are classified as temporary equity. At all other times, Class A ordinary shares are classified as shareholders equity. Our Class A ordinary shares feature certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of our control and subject to the occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, 1,006,683 and 4,151,134, respectively, Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption are presented at redemption value as temporary equity, outside of the shareholders deficit section of our condensed balance sheets. We recognize changes in redemption value immediately as they occur and adjusts the carrying value of the Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption to equal the redemption value at the end of each reporting period. This method would view the end of the reporting period as if it were also the redemption date for the security. Effective with the closing of the Initial Public Offering (including exercise of the over-allotment option), we recognized the accretion from initial book value to redemption amount, which resulted in charges against additional paid-in capital (to the extent available) and accumulated deficit. Net Income Per Share We comply with accounting and disclosure requirements of ASC Topic 260. We have two classes of shares, which are referred to as Class A ordinary shares and Class B ordinary shares. Income and losses are shared pro rata between the two classes of shares. Net income per ordinary share is calculated by dividing the net income by the weighted average shares of ordinary shares outstanding for the respective period. The calculation of diluted net income does not consider the effect of the warrants underlying the Units sold in the Initial Public Offering (including the consummation of the over-allotment) and the Private Placement Warrants to purchase an aggregate of 22,050,000 Class A ordinary shares in the calculation of diluted income per share, because their inclusion would be anti-dilutive under the treasury stock method. As a result, diluted net income per share is the same as basic net income per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. Accretion associated with the redeemable Class A ordinary shares is excluded from earnings per share as the redemption value approximates fair value. We have considered the effect of Class B ordinary shares that were excluded from weighted average number as they were contingent on the exercise of over-allotment option by the underwriters. Since the contingency was satisfied, we have included these shares in the weighted average number as of the beginning of the period to determine the dilutive impact of these shares.

 Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-03, ASC Topic 820 Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions . The ASU amends ASC Topic 820 to clarify that a contractual sales restriction is not considered in measuring an equity security at fair value and to introduce new disclosure requirements for equity securities subject to contractual sale restrictions that are measured at fair value. The ASU applies to both holders and issuers of equity and equity-linked securities measured at fair value. The amendments in this ASU are effective for the Company in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for both interim and annual financial statements that have not yet been issued or made available for issuance. The adoption of ASU 2023-09 did not have a material impact on the Company s condensed interim financial statements and disclosures. In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (ASU 2023-09), which requires disclosure of incremental income tax information within the rate reconciliation and expanded disclosures of income taxes paid, among other disclosure requirements. ASU 2023-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2025. Early adoption is permitted. The Company s management does not believe the adoption of ASU 2023-09 will have a material impact on its condensed interim financial statements and disclosures. Management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards if currently adopted would have a material effect on the accompanying condensed interim financial statements. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K. JOBS Act The JOBS Act contains provisions that, among other things, relax certain reporting requirements for qualifying public companies. We qualify as an emerging growth company and under the JOBS Act are allowed to comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements based on the effective date for private (not publicly traded) companies. We are electing to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards, and as a result, we may not comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non- emerging growth companies. As a result, the financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates. Additionally, we are in the process of evaluating the benefits of relying on the other reduced reporting requirements provided by the JOBS Act. Subject to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, if, as an emerging growth company, we choose to rely on such exemptions we may not be required to, among other things, (i) provide an auditor s attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404, (ii) provide all of the compensation disclosure that may be required of non-emerging growth public companies under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, (iii) comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the PCAOB regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (auditor discussion and analysis) and (iv) disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the CEO s compensation to median employee compensation. These exemptions will apply for a period of five years following the completion of our Initial Public Offering or until we are no longer an emerging growth company, whichever is earlier . Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Not required for smaller reporting companies.

 Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2024, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. Internal Control over Financial Reporting Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. Management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024 based on the framework in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on its assessment, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2024. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
