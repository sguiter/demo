 The timing of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections results in billed accounts receivable, and customer advances and deposits (contract liabilities) on the consolidated balance sheets. Certain fees for transactions, annual licenses, and other revenue arrangements are billed upfront before revenue is recognized, which results in the recognition of contract liabilities. These liabilities are recognized on the consolidated balance sheets on a contract-by-contract basis upon commencement of services under the customer contract. These upfront customer payments are recognized as revenue over time as the obligations under the contracts are satisfied. Changes in the contract liability balances during the third quarter of 2024 were not materially impacted by any other factors. The balance of contract liabilities was million and million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.

 billion within the cash account at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. The cash deposit at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago is included within performance bonds and guaranty fund contributions on the consolidated balance sheets. Cash performance bonds and guaranty fund contributions are included as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents on the consolidated statements of cash flows. 
 In the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, earnings from cash performance bond and guaranty fund contributions were million and million, compared with million and million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively. In the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, expenses related to the distribution of interest earned on collateral reinvestments were million and million, compared with million and million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2023, respectively. The earnings from cash performance bonds and guaranty fund contributions are included in investment income and the expense related to the distribution of interest earned is included in other non-operating income (expense) on the consolidated statements of income.

billion a day through its clearing systems for settlement from clearing firms whose positions had lost value to clearing firms whose positions had gained value. The clearing house reduces its guarantee exposure through initial and maintenance performance bond requirements and mandatory guaranty fund contributions. Management has assessed the fair value of the company s settlement guarantee liability by taking the following factors into consideration: the design and operations of the clearing risk management process, the financial safeguard packages in place, historical evidence of default by a clearing member and the estimated probability of potential payouts by the clearing house. Based on the assessment performed, management estimates the guarantee liability to be nominal and therefore has not recorded any liability at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The company does not have a history of significant losses recognized on performance bond collateral as posted by our clearing members, and management currently does not anticipate any future credit losses on its performance bond assets. Accordingly, the company has not provided an allowance for credit losses on these performance bond deposits, nor has it recorded any liabilities to reflect an allowance for credit losses related to our off-balance sheet credit exposures and guarantees.

 Intellectual Property Indemnifications . Certain agreements with customers and other third parties related to accessing the CME Group platforms, utilizing market data services and licensing SPAN and SPAN 2 software may contain indemnifications from intellectual property claims that may be made against them as a result of their use of the applicable products and/or services. The potential future claims relating to these indemnifications cannot be estimated and therefore no liability has been recorded.

 years, some of which include options to extend or renew the leases for up to an additional years, and some of which include options to early terminate the leases in less than months. Management evaluates whether these options are exercisable at least quarterly in order to determine whether the contract term must be reassessed. For a small number of the leases, primarily the international locations, management s approach is to enter into short-term leases for a lease term of months or less in order to provide for greater flexibility in the local environment. For certain office spaces, the company has entered into arrangements to sublease excess space to third parties, while the original lease contract remains in effect with the landlord. 
 The company also has one finance lease, which is related to the sale of our data center in March 2016. In connection with the sale, the company leased back a portion of the property. The transaction was recognized under the financing method and not as a sale leaseback arrangement. 
 The right-of-use lease asset is recorded within other assets, and the present value of the lease liability is recorded within other liabilities (segregated between short term and long term) on the consolidated balance sheets. The discount rate applied to the lease payments represents the company s incremental borrowing rate.

 -year period after April 2025 unless either party provides advance notice of their intent to terminate. CME can maintain collateral in the form of irrevocable, standby letters of credit. At September 30, 2024, CME was contingently liable to SGX on letters of credit totaling million . CME also maintains a million line of credit to meet its obligations under this agreement. Regardless of the collateral, CME guarantees all cleared transactions submitted through SGX and would initiate procedures designed to satisfy these financial obligations in the event of a default, such as the use of performance bonds and guaranty fund contributions of the defaulting clearing firm. Management has assessed the fair value of the company s guarantee liability under this mutual offset agreement by taking the following factors into consideration: the design and operations of the clearing risk management process, the financial safeguard packages in place, historical evidence of default by a clearing member and the estimated probability of potential payouts by the clearing house. Based on the assessment performed, management estimates the guarantee liability to be nominal and therefore has not recorded any liability at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 Family Farmer and Rancher Protection Fund. In 2012, the company established the Family Farmer and Rancher Protection Fund (the Fund). The Fund is designed to provide payments, up to certain maximum levels, to family farmers, ranchers and other agricultural industry participants who use the company s agricultural commodity products and who suffer losses to their segregated account balances due to their CME clearing member becoming insolvent. Under the terms of the Fund, farmers and ranchers are eligible for up to per participant. Farming and ranching cooperatives are eligible for up to per cooperative. The Fund was established with a maximum of million available for distribution to participants. Since its establishment, the Fund has made payments of approximately million, which leaves million available for future claims. If, at any time, payments due to participants were to exceed the amount remaining in the Fund, payments would be pro-rated.

 Clearing and Transaction Fees 
 Futures and Options Contracts 
 The following table summarizes our total contract volume, revenue and average rate per contract for futures and options. Total contract volume includes contracts that are traded on our exchange and cleared through our clearing house and certain cleared-only contracts. Volume is measured in round turns, which is considered a completed transaction that involves a purchase and an offsetting sale of a contract. Average rate per contract is determined by dividing total clearing and transaction fees by total contract volume. Contract volume and average rate per contract disclosures exclude trading volume for the cash markets business and interest rate swaps volume.

 We estimate the following net changes in clearing and transaction fees based on the changes in total contract volumes and the changes in average rate per contract for futures and options during the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 when compared with the same periods in 2023. 
 (in millions) Quarter Ended Nine Months Ended Increases due to a changes in total contract volume 267.9 386.8 Decreases due to a changes in average rate per contract (57.4) (33.1) Net increases in clearing and transaction fees 210.5 353.7 
 Average rate per contract is impacted by our rate structure, including volume-based incentives; product mix; trading venue; and the percentage of volume executed by customers who are members compared with non-member customers. Due to the relationship between average rate per contract and contract volume, the change in clearing and transaction fees attributable to changes in each is only an approximation. 
 Contract Volume 
 The following table summarizes average daily contract volume. Contract volume can be influenced by many factors, including political and economic conditions, the regulatory environment and market competition.

 Market uncertainty remained high through the first nine months of 2024. Interest rate, equity and foreign exchange markets experienced significant uncertainty surrounding the United States' Federal Reserve s (Federal Reserve) interest rate policy . The Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC) had initially signaled the potential for several future rate cuts throughout 2024, but has since only cut interest rates once as a result of continued inflation. Energy, metals and agricultural commodities markets were more uncertain in the first nine months of 2024 mainly as a result of geopolitical events as well as uncertain weather conditions, which led to higher volumes within those markets. We believe these factors contributed to the increase in total volumes in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 when compared with the same periods in 2023.

 In the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, overall interest rate contract volumes increased when compared with the same periods in 2023. Volumes increased in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 due to volatility as a result of mixed inflation results that occurred during 2024 as well as continued market uncertainty regarding the Federal Reserve's interest rate policy. 
 Equity Index Products 
 The following table summarizes average daily contract volume for our key equity index products.

 Equity index contract volumes increased in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 when compared with the same periods in 2023 due to periods of higher equity market volatility. We believe the higher volatility was a result of continued uncertainty surrounding the Federal Reserve's interest rate policy decision. 
 Foreign Exchange Products 
 The following table summarizes average daily contract volume for our key foreign exchange products. 
 Quarter Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, (amounts in thousands) 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change Euro 257 245 5 257 251 2 Japanese Yen 227 184 23 201 180 12 British Pound 126 114 11 123 112 10 Australian dollar 125 108 16 119 102 16 In the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, overall foreign exchange volumes increased when compared with the same periods in 2023. Despite a broad decline in foreign exchange market volatility, there was an increase in price volatility with the Japanese yen due to uncertainty surrounding the Japanese monetary policy and rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. The overall increases in volumes were also due to growing client adoption of our foreign currency products.

 Agricultural Commodity Products 
 The following table summarizes average daily contract volume for our key agricultural commodity products. 
 Quarter Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, (amounts in thousands) 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change Corn 481 427 13 509 468 9 Soybean 329 286 15 352 312 13 Wheat 196 203 (4) 234 211 11 
 Overall commodity contract volumes increased in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 when compared with the same periods in 2023. We believe these increases were due to higher overall market volatility as a result of a change in market expectations regarding grain supplies as well as uncertain weather conditions in 2024. In addition, the first nine months of 2023 saw lower overall volatility within the commodities markets due to risk aversion by market participants following price increases and global trade uncertainty resulting from the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. We believe these factors contributed to higher overall commodity volumes in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 compared with the same periods in 2023. 
 Energy Products 
 The following table summarizes average daily contract volume for our key energy products.

 Energy contract volumes increased in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 when compared with the same periods in 2023, which we believe were due to higher overall market volatility. Natural gas volatility was higher as a result of uncertain weather conditions in the United States, which impacted prices throughout the quarter. In addition, crude oil volatility was slightly higher as a result of ongoing geopolitical issues in the Middle East as well economic uncertainty between the United States and China. 
 Metal Products 
 The following table summarizes average daily volume for our key metal products. 
 Quarter Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, (amounts in thousands) 2024 2023 Change 2024 2023 Change Gold 447 300 49 436 354 23 Copper 113 104 8 145 115 27 Silver 119 88 35 127 93 36 
 In the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, overall metal contract volumes increased when compared with the same periods in 2023. We believe gold and silver volumes increased as a result of continued uncertainty surrounding the Federal Reserve's monetary policy decision, which resulted in higher overall volatility. 
 Average Rate per Contract 
 The average rate per contract decreased in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 when compared with the same periods in 2023. The decreases in the average rate per contract were primarily due to higher member trading as a percentage of total volume as well as our tiered volume pricing structure. The overall decrease was partially offset by an increase in our fee structure, which went into effect on February 1, 2024. 
 The decrease in the third quarter of 2024 when compared with the same period in 2023 is also do to a change in product mix. In the third quarter of 2024, interest rate contract volume increased by 4 percentage points as a percent of total volume, while all other products collectively decreased by 4 percentage points. In general, interest rate products have a lower rate per contract compared with the remaining contracts.

 Cash Markets Business 
 Total clearing and transaction fees revenues in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 include 68.5 million and 207.9 million of transaction fees attributable to the cash markets business, compared with 69.5 million and 214.3 million , respectively, in the third quarter and first nine months of 2023. This revenue includes BrokerTec Americas LLC's fixed income volume and EBS's foreign exchange volume.

 Overall average daily notional values for the cash markets business were slightly lower in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 when compared with the same periods in 2023. 
 Concentration of Revenue 
 We bill a substantial portion of our clearing and transaction fees directly to our clearing firms. The majority of clearing and transaction fees received from clearing firms represent charges for trades executed and cleared on behalf of their customers . One individual firm represented at least approximately 10 of o ur clearing and transaction fees in the first nine months of 2024. Should a clearing firm withdraw, we believe that the customer portion of the firm s trading activity would likely transfer to another clearing firm of the exchange. Therefore, we do not believe we are exposed to significant risk from the ongoing loss of revenue received from or through a particular clearing firm. 
 Other Sources of Revenue 
 Market data and information services . During the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, overall market data and information services revenues increased when compared with the same periods in 2023, largely due to price increases for certain products. 
 The two largest resellers of our market data represented approximately 30 of our market data and information services revenue in the first nine months of 2024. Despite this concentration, we consider exposure to significant risk of revenue loss to be minimal. In the event that one of these vendors no longer subscribes to our market data, we believe the majority of that vendor s customers would likely subscribe to our market data through another reseller. Additionally, several of our largest institutional customers that utilize services from our two largest resellers report usage and remit payment of their fees directly to us. 
 Other revenues. In the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, the increases in other revenues when compared with the same periods in 2023 were largely attributable to higher custody fees due to an increase in non-cash collateral as well as a fee increase. Other revenues also increased mainly due to higher co-location fees.

 Amount of Change Change as a Percentage of Total Expenses Amount of Change Change as a Percentage of Total Expenses (dollars in millions) Technology support services 11.1 2 29.7 2 License fees 18.1 4 29.0 2 Salaries, benefits and employer taxes 12.6 2 16.5 1 Depreciation and amortization (3.0) (1) (8.3) Occupancy and building operations (3.9) (1) (9.2) (1) Professional fees and outside services (1.2) (9.5) (1) Other expenses, net 8.9 2 5.1 Total increase 42.6 8 53.3 3 
 Increases in operating expenses in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 when compared with the same periods in 2023 were as follows: 
 The increases in expenses related to technology support services were primarily driven by higher software license fees and third party services to support the ongoing Google Cloud transformation project. 
 License fees were higher primarily due to increases in volume for certain equity products and improved revenue performance related to certain arrangements. 
 Salaries, benefits and employer taxes were higher due to increases in headcount during the year, which were primarily attributable to additional headcount in the company's international locations, as well as an increase in compensation expenses due to a law change for vacation carryover. 
 Decreases in operating expenses in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 when compared with the same periods in 2023 were as follows: 
 Depreciation and amortization expense decreased as a result of a decline in fixed asset purchases over the last few years and certain assets becoming fully depreciated. 
 Occupancy and building operations expenses decreased due to lower rent expenses and real estate taxes. 
 The decreases in professional fees and outside services are largely due to decreases in consulting costs associated with the Google Cloud Migration, which began in late 2021, as well as lower legal fees during the periods.

 Investment income. Earnings from cash performance bond and guaranty fund contributions that are reinvested decreased in the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 when compared with the same periods in 2023 due to lower average reinvestment balances. In the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, earnings from cash performance bond and guaranty fund contributions were 991.3 million and 3,035.6 million, co mpared with 1,246.5 million and 4,042.9 million, respectively, in the third quarter and first nine months of 2023. We also recognized lower net realized and unrealized gains on investments in the first nine months of 2024. 
 Equity in net earnings (losses) of unconsolidated subsidiaries. Higher income generated from our S P/Dow Jones Indices LLC (S P/DJI) business venture contributed to an increase in equity in net earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries in the third quarter and first nine months of quarter of 2024 when compared with the same periods in 2023. 
 Other non-operating income (expense) . We recognized lower expenses related to the distribution of interest earned on performance bond collateral reinvestments to the clearing firms in conjunction with lower interest income earned on our reinvestment during the third quarter and first nine months of 2024 when compared with the same periods in 2023. In the third quarter and first nine months of 2024, expenses related to the distribution of interest earned on collateral reinvestments we re 922.6 million and 2,829.4 million, compared with 1,160.5 million and 3,756.8 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2023.

Cash used in investing activities increased in the first nine months of 2024 when compared with the same period in 2023 due to a decrease in proceeds from sales of investments. Cash provided by financing activities was higher during the first nine months of 2024 when compared with the same period in 2023 due to an increase in cash performance bonds and guaranty fund contributions.

 (2) We maintained a forward-starting interest rate swap agreement that modified the interest obligation associated with these notes so that the interest payable effectively became fixed at a rate of 4.73 . 
 We maintain a 2.3 billion multi-currency revolving senior credit facility with various financial institutions, which matures in November 2026. The proceeds from this facility can be used for general corporate purposes, which includes providing liquidity for our clearing house in certain circumstances at CME Group's discretion and, if necessary, for maturities of commercial paper. As long as we are not in default under this facility, we have the option to increase it up to 3.3 billion with the consent of the agent and lenders providing the additional funds. This facility is voluntarily pre-payable from time to time without premium or penalty. Under this facility, we are required to remain in compliance with a consolidated net worth test, which is defined as our consolidated shareholders' equity at September 30, 2021, giving effect to share repurchases made and special dividends paid during the term of the agreements (and in no event greater than 2.0 billion in aggregate), multiplied by 0.65. We currently do not have any borrowings outstanding under this facility, but any commercial paper balance if or when outstanding can be backstopped against this facility. 
 We maintain a 364-day multi-currency revolving secured credit facility with a consortium of domestic and international banks to be used in certain situations by the clearing house. The facility provides for borrowings of up to 7.0 billion. We may use the proceeds to provide temporary liquidity in the unlikely event a clearing firm fails to promptly discharge an obligation to the clearing house operated by CME, in the event of a liquidity constraint or default by a depositary (custodian for our collateral), in the event of a temporary disruption with the domestic payments system that would delay payment of settlement variation between us and our clearing firms, or in other cases as provided by the CME rulebook. Clearing firm guaranty fund contributions received in the form of cash or U.S. Treasury securities as well as the performance bond assets (pursuant to the CME rulebook) can be used to collateralize the facility. At September 30, 2024, guaranty fund contributions available to collateralize the facility totaled 10.0 billion. We have the option to request an increase in the line from 7.0 billion to 10.0 billion. Our 364-day facility contains a requirement that CME remain in compliance with a consolidated tangible net worth test, defined as CME's consolidated shareholder's equity less intangible assets (as defined in the agreement), of not less than 800.0 million. We currently do not have any borrowings outstanding under this facility. 
 The indentures governing our fixed rate notes, our 2.3 billion multi-currency revolving senior credit facility and our 364-day multi-currency revolving secured credit facility for 7.0 billion do not contain specific covenants that restrict the ability to pay dividends. These documents, however, do contain other customary financial and operating covenants that place restrictions on the operations of the company that could indirectly affect the ability to pay dividends. 
 At September 30, 2024, we have excess borrowing capacity for general corporate purposes of approximately 2.3 billion under our multi-currency revolving senior credit facility. 
 At September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with the various covenant requirements of all our debt facilities. 
 CME Group, as a holding company, has no operations of its own. Instead, it relies on dividends declared and paid to it by its subsidiaries in order to provide the funds which it uses to pay dividends to its shareholders. 
 To satisfy our performance bond obligation with Singapore Exchange Limited, we may pledge irrevocable standby letters of credit. At September 30, 2024, the letters of credit totaled 400.0 million. We also maintain a 350.0 million line of credit to meet our obligations under this agreement.

 The following table summarizes our credit ratings at September 30, 2024: 
 Short-Term Long-Term Rating Agency Debt Rating Debt Rating Outlook Standard Poor s Global Ratings A1+ AA- Stable Moody s Investors Service, Inc. P1 Aa3 Stable 
 Given our cash flow generation, our ability to pay down debt levels and our ability to refinance existing debt facilities if necessary, we expect to maintain an investment grade rating. If our ratings are downgraded below investment grade within certain specified time periods due to a change of control, we are required to make an offer to repurchase our fixed rate notes at a price equal to 101 of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. No report of any rating agency is incorporated by reference herein. 
 Liquidity and Cash Management . Cash and cash equivalents totaled 2.3 billion and 2.9 billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The balance retained in cash and cash equivalents is a function of anticipated or possible short-term cash needs, prevailing interest rates, our corporate investment policy and alternative investment choices. A majority of our cash and cash equivalents balance is invested in money market mutual funds that invest only in U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. government agency securities and U.S. Treasury security reverse repurchase agreements and short-term bank deposits. Our exposure to credit and liquidity risk is minimal given the nature of the investments. Cash that is not available for general corporate purposes because of regulatory requirements or other restrictions is classified as restricted cash and is included in cash performance bonds and guaranty fund contributions, other current assets or other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. 
 On November 7, 2024, the company declared a regular quarterly dividend of 1.15 per share for all outstanding common and preferred shares. The dividend will be payable on December 27, 2024 to shareholders of record on December 9, 2024. Assuming no changes in the number of shares outstanding, the fourth quarter dividend payment will total approximately 420 million. 
 Regulatory Requirements . CME is regulated by the CFTC as a Derivatives Clearing Organization (DCO). DCOs are required to maintain capital, as defined by the CFTC, in an amount at least equal to one year of projected operating expenses as well as cash, liquid securities, or a line of credit at least equal to six months of projected operating expenses. CME was designated by the Financial Stability Oversight Council as a systemically important financial market utility under Title VIII of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. As a result, CME must comply with CFTC regulations applicable to a systemically important DCO for financial resources and liquidity resources. CME is in compliance with all DCO financial requirements. 
 CME, CBOT, NYMEX and COMEX are regulated by the CFTC as Designated Contract Markets (DCM). DCMs are required to maintain capital, as defined by the CFTC, in an amount at least equal to one year of projected operating expenses as well as cash, liquid securities or a line of credit at least equal to six months of projected operating expenses. Our DCMs are in compliance with all DCM financial requirements. 
 BrokerTec Americas LLC is required to maintain sufficient net capital under Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act), Rule 15c3-1 (the Net Capital Rule). The Net Capital Rule focuses on liquidity and is designed to protect securities customers, counterparties, and creditors by requiring that broker-dealers have sufficient liquid resources on hand at all times to satisfy claims promptly. Rule 15c3-3, or the customer protection rule, which complements Rule 15c3-1, is designed to ensure that customer property (securities and funds) in the custody of broker-dealers is adequately safeguarded. By law, both of these rules apply to the activities of registered broker-dealers, but not to unregistered affiliates. The firm began operating as a (k)(2)(i) broker dealer in November 2017 following notification to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and the SEC. A company operating under the (k)(2)(i) exemption is not required to lock up customer funds as would otherwise be required under Exchange Act Rule 15c3-3.
