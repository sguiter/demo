 Liability for Future Policy Benefits Financial Solutions Business 
 The Company reviews actual and anticipated experience compared to the assumptions used to establish policy benefits on a quarterly basis and will update those assumptions if evidence suggests that they should be revised. The Company expects to complete its annual review and any necessary updates of cash flow assumptions used to calculate the liability for future policy benefits during the third quarter of each year. Updates may occur in other quarters if information becomes available during the quarter that indicates an assumption update is necessary. 
 Significant assumptions used to compute the liability for future policy benefits for the Financial Solutions business include mortality, morbidity, lapse rates and discount rates (both accretion and current). During the third quarter of 2024 and 2023, the Company completed its annual assumption review resulting in a million increase and million decrease in the Company s liability for future policy benefits for its Financial Solutions business during 2024 and 2023, respectively.

The Company also updated the underlying market data used to determine the current discount rate resulting in changes to the discount rate assumption used to measure the net liability for future policy benefits.

 Fair Value Measurement 
 See Note 12 Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities for information about fair value measurement of assets and liabilities, except for market risk benefits. 
 Market risk benefits are classified within Level 3 on the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of market risk benefits is monitored through the use of attribution reports to quantify the effect of underlying sources of fair value change, including capital market inputs based on policyholder account values, interest rates and short-term and long-term implied volatility from period to period. 
 D uring the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, there were no material changes made to the inputs in the market risk benefits calculations, and nonfinancial assumptions were unchanged.

 million to million on January 1, 2025, and began notifying the Company s retrocessionaires of the increased per life retention limit and the Company s intention to recapture risk ceded to the Company s retrocessionaires in the future. The increased retention limit and updated recapture assumption resulted in a future policy benefits remeasurement loss of million recognized in the third quarter of 2024. 
 Retrocession reinsurance treaties do not relieve the Company from its obligations to direct writing companies. Failure of retrocessionaires to honor their obligations could result in losses to the Company. Consequently, allowances would be established for amounts deemed uncollectible. The Company regularly evaluates the financial condition of the insurance companies from which it assumes and to which it cedes reinsurance. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, no allowances were deemed necessary. 
 Retrocessions are arranged through the Company s retrocession pools for amounts in excess of the Company s retention limit. As of September 30, 2024, all rated retrocession pool participants followed by the A.M. Best Company were rated or better. The Company verifies retrocession pool participants ratings on a quarterly basis. For a majority of the retrocessionaires that were not rated, security in the form of letters of credit or trust assets have been posted. In addition, the Company performs annual financial reviews of its retrocessionaires to evaluate financial stability and performance. 
 Ruby Reinsurance Company (Ruby Re), a Missouri-domiciled life reinsurance company to reinsure U.S. asset-intensive business was launched in 2023 with the Company as a sponsor. The Company, which is not an investor in Ruby Re, does not consolidate the entity. During the third quarter of 2024, the Company completed a coinsurance funds withheld transaction under which it retroceded million of asset-intensive business to Ruby Re. As of September 30, 2024, the Company has a ceded reinsurance recoverable from Ruby Re of approximately billion. 
 Two reinsurance companies, including Ruby Re, account for approximately of reinsurance ceded receivables and other as of September 30, 2024. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, million and million of claims recoverable were in excess of 90 days past due, respectively. Also included in reinsurance ceded receivables and other is a deposit asset on reinsurance of billion and billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. 
 Funds Withheld 
 Certain of the Company s retrocession agreements, including those with Ruby Re, are on a modco or funds withheld basis. While the economic benefits of the funds withheld assets are passed on to the assuming company, the Company retains legal ownership of the assets within the funds withheld account and established a funds withheld liability. Net investment income related to the funds withheld assets are reported in other reinsurance expense, and net realized gains (losses) related to the assets

 Unrealized Losses for Fixed Maturity Securities Available-for-Sale 
 The Company s determination of whether a decline in value necessitates the recording of an allowance for credit losses includes an analysis of whether the issuer is current on its contractual payments, evaluating whether it is probable that the Company will be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the security and analyzing the overall ability of the Company to recover the amortized cost of the investment. 
 The following tables present the estimated fair value and gross unrealized losses for the and fixed maturity securities for which both the estimated fair value had declined and remained below amortized cost and an allowance for credit loss has not been recorded as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (dollars in millions). These investments are presented by class and grade of security, as well as the length of time the related fair value has continuously remained below amortized cost.

However, unforeseen facts and circumstances may cause the Company to sell fixed maturity securities in the ordinary course of managing its portfolio to meet certain diversification, credit quality and liquidity guidelines. Changes in unrealized losses are primarily driven by changes in risk-free interest rates and credit spreads.

billion of the funds withheld at interest balance is primarily associated with two clients. For reinsurance agreements written on a modco basis and certain agreements written on a coinsurance funds withheld basis, assets equal to the net statutory reserves are withheld and legally owned and managed by the ceding company and are reflected as funds withheld at interest. In the event of a ceding company s insolvency, the Company would need to assert a claim on the assets supporting its reserve liabilities. However, the risk of loss to the Company is mitigated by its ability to offset amounts it owes the ceding company for claims or allowances against amounts owed to the Company from the ceding company.

As of September 30, 2024, the Company had credit exposure of million. 
 Derivatives may be exchange-traded or they may be privately negotiated contracts, which are referred to as over-the-counter OTC derivatives. Certain of the Company s OTC derivatives are cleared and settled through central clearing counterparties OTC cleared and others are bilateral contracts between two counterparties. Additionally, the Company is required to pledge initial margin for certain OTC-bilateral derivative transactions. The Company manages its credit risk related to OTC derivatives by entering into transactions with creditworthy counterparties, maintaining collateral arrangements and through the use of master netting agreements that provide for a single net payment to be made by one counterparty to another at each due date and upon termination. The Company is only exposed to the default of the central clearing counterparties for OTC cleared derivatives, and these transactions require initial and daily variation margin collateral postings.

 Contingencies 
 Litigation 
 The Company is subject to litigation and regulatory investigations or actions from time to time. Based on current knowledge, management does not believe that loss contingencies arising from pending legal, regulatory and governmental matters will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations or cash flows of the Company. However, in light of the inherent uncertainties involved in future or pending legal, regulatory and governmental matters, some of which are beyond the Company s control, and indeterminate or potentially substantial amount of damages sought in any such matters, an adverse outcome could be material to the Company s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows for any particular reporting period. A legal reserve is established when the Company is notified of an arbitration demand, litigation or regulatory action or is notified that an arbitration demand, litigation or regulatory action is imminent, it is probable that the Company will incur a loss as a result and the amount of the probable loss is reasonably capable of being estimated. 
 Other Contingencies 
 The Company indemnifies its directors and officers as provided in its charters and by-laws. Since this indemnity generally is not subject to limitation with respect to duration or amount, the Company does not believe that it is possible to determine the maximum potential amount due under this indemnity in the future. 
 Guarantees 
 Statutory Reserve Support 
 Certain RGA subsidiaries have committed to provide statutory reserve support to third parties, in exchange for a fee, by funding loans if certain defined events occur. Such statutory reserves are required under the U.S. Valuation of Life Policies Model Regulation (commonly referred to as Regulation XXX for term life insurance policies and Regulation A-XXX for universal life secondary guarantees). In addition, certain subsidiaries have also committed to provide capital support to a third party, in exchange for a fee, by agreeing to assume real estate leases in the event of a severe and prolonged decline in the commercial lease market. Upon assumption of a lease, the Company would recognize a right of use asset and lease obligation. As of September 30, 2024, the Company does not believe that it will be required to provide any funding under these commitments as the occurrence of the defined events is considered remote.

Overview 
 The Company is among the leading global providers of life reinsurance and financial solutions, with 4.0 trillion of life reinsurance in force and assets of 120.3 billion as of September 30, 2024. Traditional reinsurance includes individual and group life and health, disability, and critical illness reinsurance. Financial Solutions includes longevity reinsurance, asset-intensive reinsurance, capital solutions, including financial reinsurance and stable value products. The Company derives revenues primarily from renewal premiums from existing reinsurance treaties, new business premiums from existing or new reinsurance treaties, fee income from Financial Solutions business and income earned on invested assets. 
 The Company s Traditional business involves reinsuring life insurance policies that are often in force for the remaining lifetime of the underlying individuals insured, with premiums earned typically over a period of 10 to 30 years. To a lesser extent, the Company also reinsures health business typically reinsured for one to three years. Each year, however, a portion of the business under existing treaties terminates due to, among other things, lapses or voluntary surrenders of underlying policies, deaths of insureds, and the exercise of recapture options by ceding companies. The Company s Financial Solutions business includes significant asset-intensive and longevity risk transactions, which allow its clients to take advantage of growth opportunities and manage their capital, longevity and investment risk. The Company also works with partners to provide pension plan sponsors solutions that enable them to diversify and protect the benefits provided to the annuitants. 
 For its traditional business, the Company s profitability largely depends on the volume and amount of death- and health-related claims incurred and the ability to adequately price the risks it assumes. While death claims are reasonably predictable over a period of many years, claims become less predictable over shorter periods and are subject to significant fluctuation from quarter to quarter and year to year. For longevity business, the Company s profitability depends on the lifespan of the underlying contract holders and the investment performance for certain contracts. Additionally, the Company generates profits on investment spreads associated with the reinsurance of investment type contracts and generates fees from financial reinsurance transactions, which are typically shorter duration than its traditional life reinsurance business. The Company believes its sources of liquidity are sufficient to cover potential claims payments on both a short-term and long-term basis. 
 As is customary in the reinsurance business, clients continually update, refine, and revise reinsurance information provided to the Company. Such revised information is used by the Company in preparation of its condensed consolidated financial statements and the financial effects resulting from the incorporation of revised data are reflected in the current period. 
 Segment Presentation 
 The Company has geographic-based and business-based operational segments. Geographic-based operations are further segmented into Traditional and Financial Solutions businesses. The Company allocates capital to its segments based on an internally developed economic capital model, the purpose of which is to measure the risk in the business and to provide a consistent basis upon which capital is deployed. The economic capital model considers the unique and specific nature of the risks inherent in RGA s businesses. 
 As a result of the economic capital allocation process, a portion of investment income is credited to the segments based on the level of allocated capital. In addition, the segments are charged for excess capital utilized above the allocated economic capital basis. This charge is included in policy acquisition costs and other insurance expenses. Segment investment performance varies with the composition of investments and the relative allocation of capital to the operating segments. 
 Segment revenue levels can be significantly influenced by currency fluctuations, large transactions, mix of business and reporting practices of ceding companies, and therefore may fluctuate from period to period. Although reasonably predictable over a period of years, segment claims experience can be volatile over shorter periods. See Results of Operations by Segment below for further information about the Company s segments.

 Three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to three months ended September 30, 2023 
 The decrease in income for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily the result of: 
 During the third quarter of 2024, the Company completed its annual assumptions review resulting in a loss of 58 million, primarily driven by updated lapse assumptions in India, partially offset by favorable mortality updates in the U.S. and Canada. The 2023 annual assumptions update resulted in a gain of 3 million in the third quarter of 2023. See Note 4 Future Policy Benefits for additional information. 
 During the third quarter of 2024, the Company made a decision to increase its per life retention limit from 8 million to 30 million. The current per life retention limit has been effective since 2008. Since then, the Company has grown significantly and further diversified its business, thus increasing the ability to absorb earnings volatility related to claims. Additionally, the recently adopted LDTI accounting standard further reduces earnings volatility related to claims. These factors led to the decision to increase the per life retention limit effective effective January 1, 2025. As a result, the Company expects to recapture business previously retroceded starting in 2025. The increased retention limit and updated recapture assumption resulted in a future policy benefits remeasurement loss of 136 million recognized in the third quarter of 2024. The higher per life retention limit is expected to increase profits in the future. See Note 9 Reinsurance for additional information. 
 An increase in policy acquisition costs due to varying increased allowance levels within coinsurance type arrangements and other insurance expenses related to an increase in retrocessions on a funds withheld basis. 
 A remeasurement loss of 31 million in the current period related to changes in the fair value of market risk benefits compared to a remeasurement gain of 21 million in the prior year. 
 The losses due to changes in assumptions and remeasurement of market risk benefits were partially offset by an increase in net investment income attributable to an increase in average asset base and higher interest rates on new investments. 
 Nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to nine months ended September 30, 2023 
 The decrease in income for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily the result of: 
 54 

Table of Contents 

Unfavorable results in the U.S. Financial Solutions business as a result of a non-economic loss recognized at the inception of a single premium pension risk transfer PRT transaction completed in first quarter of 2024. The non-economic loss at inception is the difference between the single premium received and the valuation of the initial reserve based on interest rates prescribed by U.S. GAAP. 
 An increase in investment related losses resulting from portfolio repositioning. 
 The increases in claims and other policy benefits and investment related losses were partially offset by an increase in net investment income attributable to an increase in average asset base and higher interest rates on new investments, favorable impacts of in force management actions and higher surrender charges and market value adjustments related to higher lapses on a single premium annuity block of business. 
 Foreign currency fluctuations can result in variances in the financial statement line items. Foreign currency exchange fluctuations decreased income before income taxes by 2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to the weakening of the Canadian Dollar and Japanese Yen compared to the U.S. dollar. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations increased income before income taxes by 9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily due to the weakening of the Japanese Yen compared to the U.S. dollar. Unless otherwise stated, all amounts discussed below are net of foreign currency fluctuations. 
 Premiums and business growth 
 The increase in premiums for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily due to single premium pension risk transfer PRT transactions. The PRT single premiums received were offset by an increase in reserves. The remaining increase in premiums for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, was attributable to organic growth on existing treaties and new business production, measured by the face amount of life reinsurance in force, of 403.1 billion and 265.5 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Consolidated assumed life reinsurance in force increased to 3,966.5 billion as of September 30, 2024, from 3,499.4 billion as of September 30, 2023, primarily due to new business production. 
 Net investment income and investment related gains (losses), net 
 The increase in net investment income was primarily attributable to an increase in the average invested asset base and interest rates earned on new investments, partially offset by a decrease in variable investment income associated with joint venture and limited partnership investments: 
 The average invested assets at amortized cost, excluding spread related business, totaled 38.2 billion and 35.9 billion in 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 The average yield earned on investments, excluding spread related business, was 5.08 and 4.72 for the three month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 4.81 and 4.62 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase in yield for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to the prior year was attributable to higher new money rates. 
 The average yield will vary from period to period depending on several variables, including the prevailing risk-free interest rate and credit spread environment, prepayment fees and make-whole premiums, changes in the mix of the underlying investments and cash and cash equivalents balances. Variable investment income from joint ventures and limited partnerships will also vary from period to period and is highly dependent on the timing of dividends and distributions on certain investments. Investment income is allocated to the operating segments based upon average assets and related capital levels deemed appropriate to support segment operations. 
 The decrease and increase in investment related losses, net for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, was primarily attributable to the following: 
 During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repositioned its portfolio generating net capital losses of 41 million and 305 million, respectively, compared to net capital losses of 49 million and 119 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 The Company uses various derivative instruments such as interest rate swaps, credit default swaps and foreign exchange forwards for risk management purposes that either do not qualify or have not been elected for hedge accounting treatment. Changes in the fair value of these instruments are included in investment related gains (losses), net. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the fair value of these instruments increased by 87 million and decreased by 131 million respectively, compared to decreases of 98 million and 222 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. See Note 11 Derivative Instruments for additional information.

Table of Contents 

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company incurred 9 million and 45 million of impairments and change in allowance for credit losses on fixed maturity securities compared to (7) million and 31 million during the three and nine months of 2023. 
 The decrease in investment related losses were partially offset by the following: 
 Changes in the fair value of embedded derivatives associated with modco/funds withheld treaties increased investment related losses by 112 million and 9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to investment related gains of 1 million and 18 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 The effective tax rate was 26.7 and 24.2 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, compared to 24.2 and 24.9 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. See Note 13 Income Tax for additional information on the Company s consolidated effective tax rate. 
 Impact of certain derivatives, market risk benefits and non-economic changes in insurance liabilities on income before taxes 
 The Company recognizes in consolidated income any changes in the fair value of embedded derivatives on modco or funds withheld treaties and non-economic changes in insurance liabilities, such as the initial loss on PRT transactions, and changes in the fair value of embedded derivatives associated with equity index annuities EIAs ). In addition, the Company recognizes the changes in fair value of market risk benefits associated with guaranteed minimum benefit riders in market risk benefits remeasurement gains (losses). The Company utilizes freestanding derivatives to minimize the income statement volatility due to changes in the fair value of market risk benefits associated with guaranteed minimum benefit riders. The following table presents the effect of embedded derivatives, market risk benefits, related freestanding derivatives and non-economic changes in insurance liabilities on income before income taxes for the periods indicated (dollars in millions):

Results of Operations by Segment 
 U.S. and Latin America Operations 
 The U.S. and Latin America operations consist of two major segments: Traditional and Financial Solutions. The Traditional segment primarily specializes in the reinsurance of individual mortality-risk, health and long-term care, universal life products and to a lesser extent, group reinsurance. The Financial Solutions segment consists of asset-intensive and capital solutions. Asset-intensive includes coinsurance of annuities, corporate-owned life insurance policies, pension risk transfer PRT group annuity contracts and, to a lesser extent, fee-based synthetic guaranteed investment contracts, which include investment-only, stable value contracts. Capital solutions includes assisting ceding companies in meeting applicable regulatory requirements by enhancing the ceding companies financial strength and regulatory surplus position through relatively low risk reinsurance and other transactions. Typically, these transactions do not qualify as reinsurance under GAAP due to the low-risk nature of the transactions; therefore, only the related net fees are reflected in other revenues on the condensed consolidated statements of income. 
 Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, (dollars in millions) 2024 2023 2024 vs 2023 2024 2023 2024 vs 2023 Revenues Net premiums 2,521 2,566 (45) 8,284 6,111 2,173 Net investment income 561 494 67 1,592 1,426 166 Investment related gains (losses), net (106) (61) (45) (100) (111) 11 Other revenues 78 65 13 209 175 34 Total revenues 3,054 3,064 (10) 9,985 7,601 2,384 Benefits and expenses Claims and other policy benefits 2,364 2,462 (98) 8,056 5,745 2,311 Future policy benefits remeasurement (gains) losses 58 (45) 103 (30) (19) (11) Market risk benefits remeasurement (gains) losses 31 (21) 52 (12) (38) 26 Interest credited 187 156 31 493 454 39 Policy acquisition costs and other insurance expenses 328 231 97 856 690 166 Other operating expenses 75 68 7 221 191 30 Total benefits and expenses 3,043 2,851 192 9,584 7,023 2,561 Income before income taxes 11 213 (202) 401 578 (177) 
 The decreases in income before income taxes for the third quarter and the first nine months of the year were primarily due to increases in investment related losses and unfavorable impacts of the change in per life retention from 8 million to 30 million in the Traditional segment, partially offset by increases in net investment income, favorable other assumption updates and the net impact of market risk benefits and related derivatives. 
 The decrease in income before income taxes for the first nine months of the year was primarily due to non-economic changes in insurance liabilities in the Financial Solutions segment and unfavorable impacts of the change in per life retention limit in the Traditional segment, partially offset by increases in net investment income, other assumption updates, management in-force actions and the net impact of market risk benefits and related derivatives. The non-economic change in insurance liabilities was primarily related to the initial loss recognized at the inception of a single premium PRT transaction completed in the first quarter of 2024. The non-economic loss at inception is the difference between the single premium received and the valuation of the initial reserve based on interest rates prescribed by U.S. GAAP.

 The decrease in income before income taxes for the third quarter of 2024 was primarily the result of unfavorable impacts of the change in per life retention from 8 million to 30 million and investment related losses due to portfolio repositioning, partially offset by net favorable assumption updates and management in-force actions. The increase in income before income taxes for the first nine months of 2024 was primarily the result of favorable claims experience period over period primarily within the U.S. Individual Life business, management in-force actions and assumption updates, partially offset by unfavorable impacts of the change in retention and investment related losses due to portfolio repositioning. 
 Revenues 
 The increase in net premiums was primarily due to organic growth and new business, as well as the recapture of a large retrocession treaty, effective April 1, 2023. The segment added new life business, measured by face amount of life reinsurance in force, of 226.9 billion and 106.4 billion during the first nine months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 The increase in other revenues was due to transaction and other fees related to a large in-force transaction completed during the quarter. 
 The increases in net investment income during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, were primarily due to a higher invested asset base in 2024 due to new business growth and higher yields. 
 Benefits and expenses 
 The change in future policy benefits remeasurement (gains) losses for during the third quarter of 2024 was primarily the result of unfavorable impacts of the change in the Company s per life retention limit which resulted in a loss of 83 million, partially offset by net favorable assumption updates totaling 30 million and a management in-force transaction within the U.S. Individual Life business. The change in future policy benefits remeasurement (gains) losses for the first nine months of 2024 was attributable to favorable claims experience period over period, primarily within the U.S. Individual Life business, favorable impacts of in-force management actions and net favorable mortality assumption updates, partially offset by unfavorable impacts of the change in the retention limit.

 The decreases in income before income taxes for the U.S. and Latin America Financial Solutions segment for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, were driven by the decline in the invested asset base, increases in other insurance expenses due to increases in retrocessions to Ruby Re, and non-economic changes in insurance liabilities, partially offset by increases in net investment income and the net impact of market risk benefits and related derivatives. 
 The invested asset base supporting asset-intensive transactions decreased to 22.1 billion as of September 30, 2024, from 23.0 billion as of September 30, 2023. 
 The decrease in the asset base was primarily due to 1.8 billion in net run off of existing in-force transactions and 2.8 billion associated with an in-force retrocession transaction, partially offset by 3.9 billion from new transactions. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, 3.4 billion and 3.8 billion, respectively, of the invested assets were funds withheld at interest, of which greater than 90 was associated with two clients. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and 2023, the amount of reinsurance assumed in capital solutions transactions, as measured by pre-tax statutory surplus, risk based capital and other financial structures was 29.5 billion and 25.9 billion, respectively. 
 Impact of certain derivatives, market risk benefits and non-economic changes in insurance liabilities 
 Income from the Financial Solutions business tends to be volatile due to the impact of certain items such as changes in the fair value of certain derivatives, including embedded derivatives associated with reinsurance treaties structured on a modco or funds withheld basis, non-economic changes in insurance liabilities, which include the initial loss on PRT transactions and changes in the fair value of embedded derivatives associated with the Company s reinsurance of EIAs, and changes in the fair value of market risk benefits associated with guaranteed minimum benefit riders. Fluctuations occur period to period primarily due to changing investment conditions including, but not limited to, interest rate movements (including risk-free rates and credit spreads), implied volatility and equity market performance, all of which are factors in the calculations of the fair value of the assets and liabilities. 
 The following table summarizes the U.S. and Latin America Financial Solutions results and quantifies the impact of these embedded derivatives, market risk benefits and non-economic changes in insurance liabilities for the periods presented. Revenues before the impact of certain items should not be viewed as substitutes for GAAP revenues, GAAP benefits and expenses and GAAP income before income taxes.

 Embedded Derivatives Modco/Funds Withheld Treaties Represents the change in the fair value of embedded derivatives on funds withheld at interest associated with treaties written on a modco or funds withheld basis. The Company s utilization of a credit valuation adjustment did not have a material effect on the change in fair value of these embedded derivatives for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. 
 The change in fair value of the embedded derivatives related to modco/funds withheld treaties increased (decreased) income before income taxes by (90) million and (1) million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and increased income before income taxes by 18 million for each of the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in income for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was due to the impact of declining interest rates on funds withheld liabilities. 
 Non-Economic Changes in Insurance Liabilities Non-economic changes in insurance liabilities include the initial loss on PRT transactions, net of amortization, and changes in the fair value of embedded derivatives associated with the Company s reinsurance of EIAs. The initial loss at inception of a PRT transaction is the difference between the single premium received and the valuation of the initial reserve based on interest rates prescribed by U.S. GAAP. 
 Market Risk Benefits Represents the impact related to market risk benefits, which consist of guaranteed minimum benefits associated with the Company s reinsurance of variable and equity-indexed annuities. The fair value changes of market risk benefits along with the changes in fair value of the freestanding derivatives (interest rate swaps, financial futures and equity options) purchased by the Company to substantially hedge the liability are reflected in revenues. The change in fair value of market risk benefits for guaranteed minimum benefits, after allowing for changes in the associated freestanding derivatives, decreased income before income taxes for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, by 8 million and 16 million, respectively. The changes in fair value of the market risk benefits decreased income before income taxes by 23 million and 48 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. 
 Discussion and analysis before certain derivatives, market risk benefits and non-economic changes in insurance liabilities 
 The impact of certain derivatives, market risk benefits and non-economic changes in insurance liabilities discussed above are considered unrealized and non-economic by management and do not affect current cash flows, crediting rates or performance on the underlying treaties. Fluctuations occur period to period primarily due to changing investment conditions including, but not limited to, interest rate movements (including benchmark rates and credit spreads), implied volatility and equity market performance, all of which are factors in the calculations of fair value. Therefore, management believes it is helpful to distinguish between the effects of these items and the primary factors that drive profitability of the underlying treaties, which are investment income, fee income (included in other revenues) and interest credited. 
 Income before income taxes and certain items decreased by 65 million and 122 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same periods in 2023, primarily due to increases in realized investment related losses and the decline in the invested asset base.

Revenue before certain items decreased by 176 million and increased by 1,924 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same periods in 2023. The decrease in the quarter ended September 30, 2024, was primarily due to less premiums recognized from PRT transactions compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily due to premiums recognized on PRT transactions, which was offset by a corresponding increase in reserves. 
 Benefits and expenses before certain items decreased by 111 million and increased by 2,046 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the same periods in 2023. The decrease in the third quarter of 2024 was primarily due to less liabilities for future policy benefits established on associated PRT transactions.

 The decreases in income before income taxes for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, were primarily the result of higher losses from future policy benefits remeasurement and increased claims and other policy benefits, partially offset by higher net premiums. 
 Revenues 
 The increase in net premiums was primarily due to continued business growth in the segment. 
 The segment added new life business production, measured by face amount of life reinsurance in force, of 42.2 billion and 25.7 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 Benefits and expenses 
 The increases in the loss ratio for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, were primarily due to unfavorable impact of annual assumption review of 82 million primarily attributable to updated lapse assumption in India and the unfavorable impacts of the change in the Company s retention limit which resulted in a loss of 13 million, partially offset by favorable underlying underwriting experience.

 The increases in income (loss) before income taxes for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, were driven by investment related gains (losses) and surrender charges and market value adjustments from higher lapses on a single premium annuity block of business. 
 The invested asset base supporting asset-intensive transactions increased to 23.2 billion as of September 30, 2024, from 14.4 billion as of September 30, 2023. The increase in the asset base compared to September 30, 2023, was primarily due to approximately 7.3 billion from recently executed transactions and net organic growth of 1.5 billion from existing in force blocks. The amount of reinsurance assumed from client companies, as measured by pre-tax statutory surplus, risk based capital and other financial reinsurance structures was 1.9 billion and 1.1 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Fees earned from this business can vary significantly depending on the size, complexity, and timing of the transactions and, therefore, can fluctuate from period to period. 
 Revenues 
 The increase in net investment income was the result of a growing asset base. 
 The increase in investment related gains (losses), net for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was attributable to an increase in the fair value of derivatives of 141 million, largely driven by the strengthening of the Japanese Yen, partially offset by net losses from investment activity of 57 million, primarily due to higher lapses and portfolio repositioning on recently executed transactions. The decrease in investment related gains (losses), net for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was related to net losses from investment activity of 98 million, largely attributable to higher lapses and portfolio repositioning, partially offset by an increase in the fair value of derivatives of 42 million, primarily driven by the strengthening of the Japanese Yen. Investment losses associated with higher lapses were offset by surrender charges and market value adjustments. 
 The increases in other revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, were due to surrender charges and market value adjustments from higher lapses on a single premium annuity block of business. 
 Benefits and expenses 
 The increase in claims and other policy benefits, interest credited, policy acquisition costs and other insurance expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, were the result of new asset-intensive transactions.

Corporate and Other 
 Corporate and Other revenues primarily include investment income from unallocated invested assets, investment related gains and losses and service fees. Corporate and Other expenses consist of the offset to capital charges allocated to the operating segments within the policy acquisition costs and other insurance income line item, unallocated overhead and executive costs, interest expense related to debt and service business expenses. Additionally, Corporate and Other includes results from the Company s Funding Agreement Backed Notes FABN program and certain wholly-owned subsidiaries that, among other activities, develop and market technology and provide consulting and outsourcing solutions for the insurance and reinsurance industries. The Company invests in this area in an effort to both support its clients and accelerate the development of innovative solutions and services to increase consumer engagement within the life insurance industry and hence generate new future revenue streams.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Overview 
 The Company believes that cash flows from the source of funds available to it will provide sufficient cash flows for the next twelve months to satisfy the current liquidity requirements of the Company under various scenarios that include the potential risk of early recapture of reinsurance treaties, market events and higher than expected claims. The Company performs periodic liquidity stress testing to ensure its asset portfolio includes sufficient high quality liquid assets that could be utilized to bolster its liquidity position under stress scenarios. These assets could be utilized as collateral for secured borrowing transactions with various third parties or by selling the securities in the open market if needed. The Company s liquidity requirements have been and will continue to be funded through net cash flows from operations. However, in the event of significant unanticipated cash requirements beyond normal liquidity needs, the Company has multiple liquidity alternatives available based on market conditions and the amount and timing of the liquidity need. These alternatives include the sale of invested assets subject to market conditions, borrowings under committed credit facilities, secured borrowings, and if necessary, issuing long-term debt, preferred securities or common equity. 
 Current Market Environment 
 The Company s average investment yield, excluding spread related business, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was 5.08 , 36 basis points above the same period in 2023, primarily attributable to higher new money rates. The average yield will vary from year to year depending on several variables, including the prevailing risk-fee interest rate and credit spread environment, prepayment fees and make-whole premiums, changes in the mix of the underlying investments and cash and cash equivalents balances. Variable investment income from joint ventures and limited partnerships will also vary from year to year and is highly dependent on the timing of dividends and distributions on certain investments. Gross unrealized gains on fixed maturity securities available-for-sale increased from 1.1 billion at December 31, 2023, to 1.8 billion at September 30, 2024, and gross unrealized losses decreased from 5.6 billion at December 31, 2023, to 5.1 billion at September 30, 2024. 
 The Company continues to be in a position to hold any investment security showing an unrealized loss until recovery, provided it remains comfortable with the credit of the issuer. The Company does not rely on short-term funding or commercial paper and to date it has experienced no liquidity pressure, nor does it anticipate such pressure in the foreseeable future. 
 The Company projects its reserves to be sufficient and it would not expect to be required to take any actions to augment capital, even if interest rates remain at current levels for the next five years, assuming all other factors remain constant. To mitigate disintermediation risk, the Company purchased swaptions to protect it against a material increase in interest rates. While the Company has felt the pressures of sustained low interest rates, followed by the recent significant increase in risk-free rates, and volatile equity markets, its business and results of operations are not overly sensitive to these risks. Mortality and morbidity risks continue to be the most significant risk for the Company. Although management believes the Company s current capital base is adequate to support its business at current operating levels, it continues to monitor new business opportunities and any associated new capital needs that could arise from the changing financial landscape. 
 The Holding Company 
 RGA is an insurance holding company whose primary uses of liquidity include, but are not limited to, the immediate capital needs of its operating companies, dividends paid to its shareholders, repurchase of common stock and interest payments on its indebtedness. The primary sources of RGA s liquidity include proceeds from its capital-raising efforts, interest income on undeployed corporate investments, interest income received on surplus notes with RGA Reinsurance Company RGA Reinsurance ), RGA Life and Annuity Insurance Company RGA Life and Annuity and Rockwood Reinsurance Company Rockwood Re and dividends from operating subsidiaries. As the Company continues its growth efforts, RGA will continue to be dependent upon these sources of liquidity. The following tables provide comparative information for RGA (dollars in millions):

See Item 15, Schedule II Condensed Financial Information of the Registrant in the 2023 Annual Report for additional financial information related to RGA. 
 The undistributed earnings of substantially all of the Company s foreign subsidiaries have been reinvested indefinitely in those non-U.S. operations, as described in Note 14 Income Tax in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2023 Annual Report. As U.S. Tax Reform generally eliminates U.S. federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries, the Company does not expect to incur material income taxes if these funds are repatriated. 
 RGA endeavors to maintain a capital structure that provides financial and operational flexibility to its subsidiaries, credit ratings that support its competitive position in the financial services marketplace, and shareholder returns. As part of the Company s capital deployment strategy, it has in recent years repurchased shares of RGA common stock and paid dividends to RGA shareholders, as authorized by the board of directors. 
 On January 23, 2024, RGA s board of directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to 500 million of RGA s outstanding common stock. The authorization was effective immediately and does not have an expiration date. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, RGA did not repurchase any shares under this program. 
 The pace of repurchase activity depends on various factors such as the level of available cash, an evaluation of the costs and benefits associated with alternative uses of excess capital, such as acquisitions and in force reinsurance transactions, and RGA s stock price. 
 Details underlying dividend and share repurchase program activity were as follows (in millions, except share data):

 1,069,113 Average price per share 140.30 
 (1) Excludes shares utilized to execute and settle certain equity based compensation awards. 
 In October 2024, RGA s board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of 0.89 per share. All future payments of dividends are at the discretion of RGA s board of directors and will depend on the Company s earnings, capital requirements, insurance regulatory conditions, operating conditions, and other such factors as the board of directors may deem relevant. The amount of dividends that RGA can pay will depend in part on the operations of its reinsurance subsidiaries. See Note 3 Equity in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the Company s share repurchase program. 
 Debt 
 Certain of the Company s debt agreements contain financial covenant restrictions related to, among others, liens, the issuance and disposition of stock of restricted subsidiaries, minimum requirements of consolidated net worth, maximum ratios of debt to capitalization and change of control provisions. The Company renewed its syndicated credit facility in the first quarter of 2023. Under the terms of the facility the Company is required to maintain a minimum consolidated net worth, as defined in the debt agreements, of 6.3 billion. Subsequent to the adoption of ASU 2018-12, the minimum consolidated net worth, as defined in the debt agreements, was reduced to 5.8 billion effective with the June 30, 2023, covenant calculations. Also, consolidated indebtedness, calculated as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, cannot exceed 35 of the sum of the Company s consolidated indebtedness plus adjusted RGA Inc. s shareholders equity. A material ongoing covenant default could require immediate payment of the amount due, including principal, under the various agreements. Additionally, the Company s debt agreements contain cross-acceleration covenants, which would make outstanding borrowings immediately payable in the event of a material uncured covenant default under any of the agreements, including, but not limited to, non-payment of indebtedness when due for an amount in excess of the amounts set forth in those agreements, bankruptcy proceedings, or any other event that results in the acceleration of the maturity of indebtedness. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had 5.1 billion and 4.5 billion, respectively, in outstanding borrowings under its debt agreements and was in compliance with all covenants under those agreements. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the average interest rate on long-term debt outstanding was 5.17 and 5.09 , respectively. The ability of the Company to make debt principal and interest payments depends on the earnings and surplus of subsidiaries, investment earnings on undeployed capital proceeds, available liquidity at the holding company, and the Company s ability to raise additional funds.

Table of Contents 

The Company enters into derivative agreements with counterparties that reference either the Company s debt rating or its financial strength rating. If either rating is downgraded in the future, it could trigger certain terms in the Company s derivative agreements, which could negatively affect overall liquidity. For the majority of the Company s derivative agreements, there is a termination event should the long-term senior debt ratings drop below either BBB+ (S P) or Baa1 (Moody s) or the financial strength ratings drop below either A- (S P) or A3 (Moody s). 
 The Company may borrow up to 850 million in cash and obtain letters of credit in multiple currencies on its revolving credit facility that matures in March 2028. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had no cash borrowings outstanding and no issued letters of credit under this facility. 
 On May 13, 2024, the Company issued 5.75 fixed rate Senior Notes due 2034 with a face amount of 650 million and will be used for general corporate purposes. Capitalized issuance costs were 6 million. 
 Based on the historic cash flows and the current financial results of the Company, management believes RGA s cash flows will be sufficient to enable RGA to meet its obligations for at least the next 12 months. 
 Credit and Committed Facilities 
 The Company has obtained bank letters of credit in favor of various affiliated and unaffiliated insurance companies from which the Company assumes business. These letters of credit represent guarantees of performance under the reinsurance agreements and allow ceding companies to take statutory reserve credits. Certain of these letters of credit contain financial covenant restrictions similar to those described in the Debt discussion above. At September 30, 2024, there were approximately 54 million of outstanding bank letters of credit in favor of third parties. Additionally, in accordance with applicable regulations, the Company utilizes letters of credit to secure statutory reserve credits when it retrocedes business to its affiliated subsidiaries. The Company cedes business to its affiliates to help reduce the amount of regulatory capital required in certain jurisdictions, such as the U.S., Canada and UK. The Company believes the capital required to support the business in the affiliates reflects more realistic expectations than the original jurisdiction of the business, where capital requirements are often considered to be quite conservative. As of September 30, 2024, 1.0 billion in letters of credit from various banks were outstanding, but undrawn, backing reinsurance between the various subsidiaries of the Company. 
 On March 13, 2023, the Company entered into a syndicated revolving credit facility with a five year term and an overall capacity of 850 million. See Note 18 Financing Activities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2023 Annual Report for further information. 
 Cash Flows 
 The Company s principal cash inflows from its reinsurance operations include premiums and deposit funds received from ceding companies. The primary liquidity concerns with respect to these cash flows are early recapture of the reinsurance contract by the ceding company and lapses of annuity products reinsured by the Company. The Company s principal cash inflows from its invested assets result from investment income and the maturity and sales of invested assets. The primary liquidity concerns with respect to these cash inflows relates to the risk of default by debtors and interest rate volatility. The Company manages these risks very closely. See Investments below. 
 Additional sources of liquidity to meet unexpected cash outflows in excess of operating cash inflows and current cash and equivalents on hand also includes drawing funds under a revolving credit facility, under which the Company had availability of 850 million as of September 30, 2024. The Company also has 624 million of funds available through collateralized borrowings from the FHLB as of September 30, 2024. As of September 30, 2024, the Company could have borrowed these additional amounts without violating any of its existing debt covenants. 
 The Company s principal cash outflows relate to the payment of claims liabilities, interest credited, operating expenses, income taxes, dividends to shareholders, purchases of treasury stock, and principal and interest under debt and other financing obligations. The Company seeks to limit its exposure to loss on any single insured and to recover a portion of benefits paid by ceding reinsurance to other insurance enterprises or reinsurers under excess coverage and coinsurance contracts. See Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies and Pronouncements in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2023 Annual Report. The Company performs annual financial reviews of its retrocessionaires to evaluate financial stability and performance. The Company has never experienced a material default in connection with retrocession arrangements, nor has it experienced any difficulty in collecting claims recoverable from retrocessionaires; however, no assurance can be given as to the future performance of such retrocessionaires nor to the recoverability of future claims. The Company s management believes its cash and cash equivalents as well as its current sources of liquidity are adequate to meet its cash requirements for the next 12 months. 
 Summary of Primary Sources and Uses of Liquidity and Capital 
 The Company s primary sources and uses of liquidity and capital are summarized as follows (dollars in millions): 
 72 

Table of Contents 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 Sources: Net cash provided by operating activities 7,770 2,818 Proceeds from long-term debt issuance, net 640 890 Change in cash collateral for derivative positions and other arrangements 375 300 Change in deposit asset on reinsurance 221 41 Net deposits to investment-type policies and contracts 1,828 Total sources 10,834 4,049 Uses: Net cash used in investing activities 8,383 2,592 Dividends to shareholders 171 163 Principal payments of long-term debt 3 402 Purchase of treasury stock 26 169 Net withdrawals from investment-type policies and contracts 768 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 26 62 Total uses 8,609 4,156 Net change in cash and cash equivalents 2,225 (107) 
 Cash Flows from Operations The principal cash inflows from the Company s reinsurance activities come from premiums, investment and fee income, annuity considerations and deposit funds. The principal cash outflows relate to the liabilities associated with various life and health insurance, annuity and disability products, operating expenses, income tax payments and interest on outstanding debt obligations. The primary liquidity concern with respect to these cash flows is the risk of shortfalls in premiums and investment income, particularly in periods with abnormally high claims levels. 
 Cash Flows from Investments The principal cash inflows from the Company s investment activities come from repayments of principal on invested assets, proceeds from maturities of invested assets, sales of invested assets and settlements of freestanding derivatives. The principal cash outflows relate to purchases of investments, issuances of policy loans and settlements of freestanding derivatives. The Company typically has a net cash outflow from investing activities because cash inflows from insurance operations are reinvested in accordance with its asset/liability management discipline to fund insurance liabilities. The Company closely monitors and manages these risks through its credit risk management process. The primary liquidity concerns with respect to these cash flows are the risk of default by debtors and market disruption, which could make it difficult for the Company to sell investments. 
 Financing Cash Flows The principal cash inflows from the Company s financing activities come from issuances of RGA debt and equity securities, and deposit funds associated with universal life and other investment type policies and contracts. The principal cash outflows come from repayments of debt, payments of dividends to shareholders, purchases of treasury stock and withdrawals associated with universal life and other investment type policies and contracts. A primary liquidity concern with respect to these cash flows is the risk of early contractholder and policyholder withdrawal. 
 Contractual Obligations 
 There were no material changes in the Company s contractual obligations from those reported in the 2023 Annual Report, except for the following: 
 The Company s contractual obligations associated with future policy benefits increased 10.6 billion at September 30, 2024, due to new transactions executed during the year. 
 The Company s contractual obligations associated with other investment commitments increased 0.7 billion at September 30, 2024, primarily due to an increase in payables for securities sold or loaned under agreements to repurchase, see Note 10 Investments for further details. 
 Asset / Liability Management 
 The Company actively manages its cash and invested assets using an approach that is intended to balance quality, diversification, asset/liability matching, liquidity and investment return. The goals of the investment process are to optimize after-tax, risk-adjusted investment income and after-tax, risk-adjusted total return while managing the assets and liabilities on a cash flow and duration basis. 
 The Company has established target asset portfolios for its operating segments, which represent the investment strategies intended to profitably fund its liabilities within acceptable risk parameters. These strategies include objectives and limits for effective duration, yield curve sensitivity and convexity, liquidity, asset sector concentration and credit quality.

Table of Contents 

The Company s asset-intensive products are primarily supported by investments in fixed maturity securities reflected on the Company s balance sheet and under funds withheld arrangements with the ceding company. Investment guidelines are established to structure the investment portfolio based upon the type, duration and behavior of products in the liability portfolio so as to achieve targeted levels of profitability. The Company manages the asset-intensive business to provide a targeted spread between the interest rate earned on investments and the interest rate credited to the underlying interest-sensitive contract liabilities. The Company periodically reviews models projecting different interest rate scenarios and their effect on profitability. Certain of these asset-intensive agreements, primarily in the U.S. and Latin America Financial Solutions operating segment, are generally funded by fixed maturity securities that are withheld by the ceding company. 
 The Company s liquidity position (cash and cash equivalents and short term investments) was 5.6 billion and 3.2 billion at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Liquidity needs are determined from valuation analyses conducted by operational units and are driven by product portfolios. Periodic evaluations of demand liabilities and short-term liquid assets are designed to adjust specific portfolios, as well as their durations and maturities, in response to anticipated liquidity needs. 
 See Securities Borrowing, Lending and Repurchase/Reverse Repurchase Agreements in Note 10 Investments in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for information related to the Company s securities borrowing, lending and repurchase/reverse repurchase programs. In addition to its security agreements with third parties, certain RGA subsidiaries have entered into intercompany securities lending agreements to more efficiently source securities for lending to third parties and to provide for more efficient regulatory capital management. 
 The Company is a member of the FHLB and holds 72 million of FHLB common stock, which is included in other invested assets on the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company has entered into funding agreements with the FHLB under guaranteed investment contracts whereby the Company has issued the funding agreements in exchange for cash and for which the FHLB has been granted a blanket lien on the Company s commercial and residential mortgage-backed securities and commercial mortgage loans used to collateralize the Company s obligations under the funding agreements. The Company maintains control over these pledged assets, and may use, commingle, encumber or dispose of any portion of the collateral as long as there is no event of default and the remaining qualified collateral is sufficient to satisfy the collateral maintenance level. The funding agreements and the related security agreements represented by this blanket lien provide that upon any event of default by the Company, the FHLB s recovery is limited to the amount of the Company s liability under the outstanding funding agreements. The amount of the Company s liability for the funding agreements with the FHLB was 1.4 billion at September 30, 2024 and 1.1 billion at December 31, 2023, which is included in interest-sensitive contract liabilities on the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheets. The advances on these agreements are collateralized primarily by commercial and residential mortgage-backed securities, commercial mortgage loans, and U.S. Treasury and government agency securities. The amount of collateral exceeds the liability and is dependent on the type of assets collateralizing the guaranteed investment contracts. 
 
 Investments 
 Management of Investments 
 The Company s investment and derivative strategies involve matching the characteristics of its reinsurance products and other obligations. The Company seeks to closely approximate the interest rate sensitivity of the assets with estimated interest rate sensitivity of the reinsurance liabilities. The Company achieves its income objectives through strategic and tactical asset allocations, applying security and derivative strategies within asset/liability and disciplined risk management frameworks. Derivative strategies are employed within the Company s risk management framework to help manage duration, currency, and other risks in assets and/or liabilities and to replicate the credit characteristics of certain assets. 
 The Company s portfolio management groups work with the Enterprise Risk Management function to develop the investment policies for the assets of the Company s domestic and international investment portfolios. All investments held by the Company, directly or in a funds withheld at interest reinsurance arrangement, are monitored for conformance with the Company s stated investment policy limits as well as any limits prescribed by the applicable jurisdiction s insurance laws and regulations. See Note 10 Investments in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Company s investments.

Portfolio Composition 
 The Company had total cash and invested assets of 103.4 billion and 81.9 billion as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, as illustrated below (dollars in millions): 
 September 30, 2024 of Total December 31, 2023 of Total Fixed maturity securities available-for-sale 78,149 75.6 60,467 73.9 Equity securities 155 0.1 139 0.2 Mortgage loans 8,388 8.1 7,377 9.0 Policy loans 1,285 1.2 1,206 1.5 Funds withheld at interest 5,545 5.4 5,683 6.9 Limited partnerships and real estate joint ventures 2,972 2.9 2,635 3.2 Short-term investments 381 0.4 222 0.3 Other invested assets 1,361 1.3 1,171 1.4 Cash and cash equivalents 5,195 5.0 2,970 3.6 Total cash and invested assets 103,431 100.0 81,870 100.0 
 Investment Yield 
 The following table presents consolidated average invested assets at amortized cost, net investment income, investment yield, variable investment income VII and investment yield excluding VII, which can vary significantly from period to period (dollars in millions). The table excludes spread related business. Spread related business is primarily associated with contracts on which the Company earns an interest rate spread between assets and liabilities. To varying degrees, fluctuations in the yield on other spread related business is generally subject to corresponding adjustments to the interest credited on the liabilities. 
 Three months ended September 30, Nine months ended September 30, 2024 2023 Increase / (Decrease) 2024 2023 Increase / (Decrease) Average invested assets at amortized cost 39,469 37,051 2,418 38,250 35,934 2,316 Net investment income 492 430 62 1,372 1,238 134 Annualized investment yield (ratio of net investment income to average invested assets at amortized cost) 5.08 4.72 36 bps 4.81 4.62 19 bps VII (included in net investment income) 36 39 (3) 64 95 (31) Annualized investment yield excluding VII (ratio of net investment income, excluding VII, to average invested assets, excluding assets with only VII, at amortized cost) 4.95 4.51 44 bps 4.82 4.46 36 bps 
 Investment yield increased for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and the nine months ended September 30, 2024, in comparison to the same periods in the prior year, primarily due to higher new money rates. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, this was partially offset by decreased variable income from real estate joint ventures. 
 Fixed Maturity Securities Available-for-Sale 
 See Fixed Maturity Securities Available-for-Sale in Note 10 Investments in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for tables that provide the amortized cost, allowance for credit losses, unrealized gains and losses and estimated fair value of these securities by type as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 Important factors in the selection of investments include diversification, quality, yield, call protection and total rate of return potential. The relative importance of these factors is determined by market conditions and the underlying reinsurance liability and existing portfolio characteristics. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, approximately 94.9 and 94.3 , respectively, of the Company s consolidated investment portfolio of fixed maturity securities were investment grade. 
 The Company owns floating rate securities that represent approximately 7.5 and 7.7 of the total fixed maturity securities as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. These investments have a higher degree of income variability than the other fixed income holdings in the portfolio due to fluctuations in interest payments. The Company holds floating rate investments to enhance asset management strategies and match certain interest-sensitive contract liabilities. 
 The largest asset class in which fixed maturity securities were invested was corporate securities, which represented approximately 65.4 and 64.1 of total fixed maturity securities as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. See Corporate Fixed Maturity Securities in Note 10 Investments in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for tables showing the major sector types, which comprise the corporate fixed maturity holdings as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

Table of Contents 

As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company s investments in Canadian government securities represented 6.4 and 6.5 , respectively, of the fair value of total fixed maturity securities. These assets are primarily high quality, long duration provincial strip bonds, the valuation of which is closely linked to the interest rate curve. These assets are longer in duration and held primarily for asset/liability management to meet Canadian regulatory requirements. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company s investments in Japanese government securities represented 6.7 and 5.2 , respectively, of the fair value of total fixed maturity securities. These assets are primarily long duration government bonds matching the liability profile of the Company s Japanese business. 
 The Company references rating agency designations in some of its investments disclosures. These designations are based on the ratings from nationally recognized statistical rating organizations, primarily Moody s, S P and Fitch. Structured securities held by the Company s insurance subsidiaries that maintain the NAIC statutory basis of accounting utilize the NAIC rating methodology. The NAIC assigns designations to publicly traded as well as privately placed securities. The designations assigned by the NAIC range from class 1 to class 6, with designations in classes 1 and 2 generally considered investment grade (BBB or higher rating agency designation). NAIC designations in classes 3 through 6 are generally considered below investment grade (BB or lower rating agency designation). If no rating is available from a rating agency or the NAIC, then an internally developed rating is used. 
 The quality of the Company s available-for-sale fixed maturity securities portfolio, as measured at fair value and by the percentage of fixed maturity securities invested in various ratings categories, relative to the entire available-for-sale fixed maturity securities portfolio, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was as follows (dollars in millions): 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 NAIC Designation Rating Agency Designation Amortized Cost Estimated Fair Value of Total Amortized Cost Estimated Fair Value of Total 1 AAA/AA/A 53,371 51,053 65.3 41,469 38,739 64.1 2 BBB 24,076 23,130 29.6 19,793 18,261 30.2 3 BB 3,284 3,233 4.2 3,068 2,956 4.9 4 B 662 576 0.7 479 396 0.7 5 CCC and lower 168 131 0.2 116 92 0.1 6 In or near default 45 26 52 23 Total 81,606 78,149 100.0 64,977 60,467 100.0 
 The Company s fixed maturity portfolio includes structured securities. The following table shows the types of structured securities the Company held as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (dollars in millions): 
 September 30, 2024 December 31, 2023 Amortized Cost Estimated Fair Value of Total Amortized Cost Estimated Fair Value of Total ABS: Collateralized loan obligations CLOs 2,659 2,650 29.7 2,086 2,048 28.1 ABS, excluding CLOs 2,862 2,723 30.5 2,575 2,381 32.7 Total ABS 5,521 5,373 60.2 4,661 4,429 60.8 CMBS 2,327 2,238 25.1 1,969 1,773 24.3 RMBS: Agency 401 365 4.0 444 398 5.5 Non-agency 973 953 10.7 729 681 9.4 Total RMBS 1,374 1,318 14.7 1,173 1,079 14.9 Total 9,222 8,929 100.0 7,803 7,281 100.0 
 The Company s ABS portfolio primarily consists of CLOs, aircraft and NAV loans. The principal risks in holding ABS are structural, credit, capital market and interest rate risks. Structural risks include the securities cash flow priority in the capital structure and the inherent prepayment sensitivity of the underlying collateral. Credit risks include the adequacy and ability to realize proceeds from the collateral. Credit risks are mitigated by credit enhancements that include excess spread, over-collateralization and subordination. Capital market risks include general level of interest rates and the liquidity for these securities in the marketplace. 
 The Company s CMBS portfolio primarily consists of large pool securitizations that are diverse by property type, borrower and geographic dispersion. The principal risks in holding CMBS are structural and credit risks. Structural risks include the securities cash flow priority in the capital structure and the inherent prepayment sensitivity of the underlying collateral. Credit risks include the adequacy and ability to realize proceeds from the collateral. The Company focuses on investment grade rated tranches that provide additional credit support beyond the equity protection in the underlying loans. These assets are viewed as an attractive alternative to other fixed income asset classes.

Table of Contents 

The Company s RMBS portfolio includes agency-issued pass-through securities and collateralized mortgage obligations. Agency-issued pass-through securities are guaranteed or otherwise supported by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, Federal National Mortgage Association, or the Government National Mortgage Association. The principal risks inherent in holding RMBS are prepayment and extension risks, which will affect the timing of when cash will be received and are dependent on the level of mortgage interest rates. Prepayment risk is the unexpected increase in principal payments from the expected, primarily as a result of owner refinancing. Extension risk relates to the unexpected slowdown in principal payments from the expected. In addition, non-agency RMBS face credit risk should the borrower be unable to pay the contractual interest or principal on their obligation. The Company monitors its mortgage-backed securities to mitigate exposure to the cash flow uncertainties associated with these risks. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had 5.1 billion and 5.6 billion, respectively, of gross unrealized losses related to its fixed maturity securities. The Company monitors its fixed maturity securities to determine impairments in value and evaluates factors such as financial condition of the issuer, payment performance, compliance with covenants, general market and industry sector conditions, current intent and ability to hold securities, and various other subjective factors. Based on management s judgment, an allowance for credit losses in the amount that fair value is less than the amortized cost is recorded for securities determined to have expected credit losses. 
 Mortgage Loans 
 The Company s mortgage loan portfolio consists of U.S., Canada and UK based investments primarily in retail locations, light industrial properties, and commercial offices. The mortgage loan portfolio is diversified by geographic region and property type as discussed further under Mortgage Loans in Note 10 Investments in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Mortgage loans in the Company s portfolio range in size up to 45 million, with the average mortgage loan investment as of September 30, 2024, of 10 million. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company s recorded investment in mortgage loans, gross of unamortized deferred loan origination fees and expenses and allowance for credit losses, were distributed geographically as follows (dollars in millions):

 See Allowance for Credit Losses and Impairments in Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies and Pronouncements of the Company s 2023 Annual Report and Mortgage Loans in Note 10 Investments in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the Company s policy for allowance for credit losses on mortgage loans. 
 Allowance for Credit Losses and Impairments 
 The table below summarizes investment related gains (losses), net related to allowances for credit losses and impairments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 (dollars in millions):

Table of Contents 

The Company s determination of whether a decline in value necessitates the recording of an allowance for credit losses includes an analysis of whether the issuer is current on its contractual payments, evaluating whether it is probable that the Company will be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the security and analyzing the overall ability of the Company to recover the amortized cost of the investment. See Allowance for Credit Losses and Impairments in Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies and Pronouncements of the Company s 2023 Annual Report for additional information. 
 See Unrealized Losses for Fixed Maturity Securities Available-for-Sale in Note 10 Investments in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for tables that present the estimated fair value and gross unrealized losses for securities that have estimated fair values below amortized cost by class and grade, as well as the length of time the related estimated fair value has remained below amortized cost as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company classified approximately 9.9 and 10.6 , respectively, of its fixed maturity securities in the Level 3 category. Refer to Note 12 Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. These securities primarily consist of private placement corporate and asset-backed securities. 
 See Securities Lending and Repurchase/Reverse Repurchase Agreements in Note 10 Investments in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for information related to the Company s securities lending and repurchase/reverse repurchase agreements. 
 Funds Withheld at Interest 
 For reinsurance agreements written on a modified coinsurance basis and certain agreements written on a coinsurance basis, assets equal to the net statutory reserves are withheld and legally owned and managed by the ceding company and are reflected as funds withheld at interest on the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheets. In the event of a ceding company s insolvency, the Company would need to assert a claim on the assets supporting its reserve liabilities. However, the risk of loss to the Company is mitigated by its ability to offset amounts it owes the ceding company for claims or allowances against amounts owed by the ceding company. Interest accrues to the total funds withheld at rates defined by the treaty terms. The Company is subject to the investment performance on the withheld assets, although it does not directly control them. These assets are primarily fixed maturity investment securities and pose risks similar to the fixed maturity securities the Company owns. To mitigate this risk, the Company helps set the investment guidelines followed by the ceding company and monitors compliance. Ceding companies with funds withheld at interest had an average financial strength rating of A as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Certain ceding companies maintain segregated portfolios for the benefit of the Company. 
 Other Invested Assets 
 Other invested assets primarily include lifetime mortgages, derivative contracts, FHLB common stock and real estate held for investment. See Other Invested Assets in Note 10 Investments in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a table that presents the carrying value of the Company s other invested assets by type as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 The Company utilizes derivative financial instruments to protect the Company against possible changes in the fair value of its investment portfolio as a result of interest rate changes, to hedge against risk of changes in the purchase price of securities, to hedge liabilities associated with the reinsurance of variable annuities with guaranteed living benefits and to manage the portfolio s effective yield, maturity and duration. In addition, the Company utilizes derivative financial instruments to reduce the risk associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company uses exchange-traded, centrally cleared, and customized over-the-counter derivative financial instruments. 
 See Note 11 Derivative Instruments in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a table that presents the notional amounts and fair value of investment related derivative instruments held as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 
 The Company may be exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties to derivative financial instruments. Generally, the credit exposure of the Company s derivative contracts is limited to the fair value and accrued interest of non-collateralized derivative contracts in an asset position at the reporting date. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had credit exposure of 16 million. 
 The Company manages its credit risk related to over-the-counter derivatives by entering into transactions with creditworthy counterparties, maintaining collateral arrangements and through the use of master agreements that provide for a single net payment to be made by one counterparty to another at each due date and upon termination. As exchange-traded futures are affected through regulated exchanges, and positions are marked to market on a daily basis, the Company has minimal exposure to credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties. See Note 12 Derivative Instruments in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding the Company s derivative instruments.

The Company holds 1,026 million and 944 million of beneficial interest in lifetime mortgages in the UK, net of allowance for credit losses, as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Investment income includes 12 million and 11 million in interest income earned on lifetime mortgages for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 33 million and 29 million in interest income earned on lifetime mortgages for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Lifetime mortgages represent loans provided to individuals 55 years of age and older secured by the borrower s residence. Lifetime mortgages are comparable to a home equity loan by allowing the borrower to utilize the equity in their home as collateral. The amount of the loan is dependent on the appraised value of the home at the time of origination, the borrower's age and interest rate. Unlike a home equity loan, no payment of principal or interest is required until the death of the borrower or sale of the home. Lifetime mortgages may also be either fully funded at origination, or the borrower can request periodic funding similar to a line of credit. Lifetime mortgages are subject to risks, including market, credit, interest rate, liquidity, operational, reputational and legal risks. 
 
 New Accounting Standards 
 Changes to the general accounting principles are established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB in the form of accounting standards updates to the FASB Accounting Standards Codification TM . 
 See Note 18 New Accounting Standards in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for information on new accounting pronouncements and their impact, if any, on the Company s results of operations and financial position. 
 
 ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
 Market risk is the risk of fluctuations in the value of financial instruments as a result of absolute or relative changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, equity prices or commodity prices. To varying degrees, the Company products and services, and the investment activities supporting them, generate exposure to market risk. The market risk incurred, and the Company s strategies for managing this risk, vary by product. As of September 30, 2024, there have been no material changes in the Company s economic exposure to market risk or the Company s Enterprise Risk Management function from December 31, 2023, a description of which may be found in its Annual Report on Form 10-K, for the year ended December 31, 2023, Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
 
 ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures 
 The Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer have evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
 There was no change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f) during the quarter ended September 30, 2024, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 ITEM 1. Legal Proceedings 
 The Company is subject to litigation and regulatory investigations or actions from time to time. Based on current knowledge, management does not believe that loss contingencies arising from pending legal, regulatory and governmental matters will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations or cash flows of the Company. However, in light of the inherent uncertainties involved in future or pending legal, regulatory and governmental matters, some of which are beyond the Company s control, and indeterminate or potentially substantial amount of damages sought in any such matters, an adverse outcome could be material to the Company s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows for any particular reporting period. A legal reserve is established when the Company is notified of an arbitration demand, litigation or regulatory action or is notified that an arbitration demand, litigation or regulatory action is imminent, it is probable that the Company will incur a loss as a result and the amount of the probable loss is reasonably capable of being estimated. 
 
 ITEM 1A. Risk Factors 
 There have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in the Company s 2023 Annual Report. 
 
 ITEM 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
 Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

 (1) The Company did not repurchase any shares of common stock under its share repurchase program in July, August and September 2024. The Company net settled issuing 59,586, 5,997, and 3,793 shares from treasury and repurchasing from recipients 26,338, 2,335, and 1,592 shares in July, August and September 2024, respectively, in settlement of income tax withholding requirements incurred by the recipients of equity incentive awards. 
 On January 23, 2024, the Company s board of directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to 500 million of its outstanding common stock. The authorization was effective immediately and does not have an expiration date. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company did not repurchase any shares of common stock under this program. 
 The pace of repurchase activity depends on various factors such as the level of available cash, an evaluation of the costs and benefits associated with alternative uses of excess capital, such as acquisitions and in force reinsurance transactions, and the Company s stock price. 
 
 ITEM 5. Other Information 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, of the Company s directors or executive officers adopted or terminated any contract, instruction or written plan for the purchase or sale of Company securities intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c) or any non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement.
