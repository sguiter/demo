 NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CO NSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
 equity interest in Razor Genomics, Inc. Razor ), a privately held company, that had developed and licensed to Oncocyte the lung cancer treatment stratification laboratory test that Oncocyte was commercializing as DetermaRx. On February 24, 2021, Oncocyte completed the purchase of all the remaining issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Razor. As a result of the purchase of the Razor common stock, Oncocyte became the sole shareholder of Razor. On December 15, 2022, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the Razor Stock Purchase Agreement with Dragon Scientific, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company Dragon ), and Razor. Pursuant to the Razor Stock Purchase Agreement, Oncocyte agreed to sell to Dragon, shares of common stock of Razor, which constituted approximately of the issued and outstanding equity interests of Razor on a fully-diluted basis, and transfer to Razor all of the assets and liabilities related to DetermaRx (the Razor Sale Transaction ). On February 16, 2023, Oncocyte completed the Razor Sale Transaction (the Razor Closing ). In connection with the Razor Closing, Oncocyte transferred to Razor all of the assets and liabilities related to DetermaRx. While no monetary consideration was received for the sale of of the equity interests of Razor, the transaction allowed the Company to eliminate all development and commercialization costs with respect to DetermaRx. Following the Razor Closing, Oncocyte continues to own shares of common stock of Razor, which constitutes approximately of the issued and outstanding equity interests of Razor on a fully-diluted basis. As a result of the divestiture of Razor, the Company has reflected the 2023 operations of Razor as a discontinued operation. See Note 11, Discontinued Operations of Razor for additional information. Going Concern Oncocyte has incurred operating losses and negative cash flows since inception and had an accumulated deficit of million as of September 30, 2024. Oncocyte expects to continue to incur operating losses and negative cash flows for the foreseeable future. Since its formation, Oncocyte has financed its operations primarily through the sale of shares of its common stock, convertible preferred stock and warrants to acquire common stock. As of September 30, 2024, Oncocyte had million of cash and cash equivalents. On October 4, 2024, we raised additional capital as discussed below. As of September 30, 2024, Oncocyte is completing clinical development and planning commercialization of DetermaIO, although DetermaIO is currently available for biopharma diagnostic development and RUO as a companion test in immunotherapy drug development to select patients for clinical trials. Oncocyte received a positive coverage decision from MolDx for VitaGraft Kidney in August of 2023, and it became commercially available for ordering in January 2024 through Oncocyte s Clinical Laboratory Improvements Amendment CLIA Laboratory in Nashville, Tennessee. VitaGraft Kidney is now broadly available to transplant professionals upon request. In July 2024, Oncocyte began to commercialize the technology underlying VitaGraft Kidney by distributing its sister product, GraftAssure, which is intended to be sold and used for research purposes and is labeled as RUO. Oncocyte expects to distribute its RUO production through a mix of direct sales, partnering and distribution agreements, and licensing. On April 5, 2024, the Company entered into an agreement with Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc. Bio-Rad ), our global strategic partner, to collaborate in the development and the commercialization of RUO and in vitro diagnostic IVD kitted transplant products. See Note 10, Collaborative Arrangements for additional information. On November 8, 2024, the Company and Bio-Rad entered into a memorandum of understanding with respect to such agreement to establish additional activities to be performed by each party pursuant to such agreement (see Note 10 for additional information).

ONCOCYTE CORPORATION NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 million, after deducting offering expenses of and deducting million for the redemption of all remaining shares of the Company's Series A Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock. These net proceeds are inclusive of an investment from Bio-Rad (see Note 9), our aforementioned global strategic partner. See Note 7, Common Stock April 2024 Offering for additional information. On August 1, 2024, the Company filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3, pursuant to which it registered for sale up to million of any combination of its common stock, preferred stock, warrants and/or units from time to time and at prices and on terms that it may determine (the Primary Shelf Registration Statement ). On August 9, 2024, the Company entered into a sales agreement with a sales agent, pursuant to which the Company may offer and sell from time to time up to an aggregate of million of shares of the Company s common stock, registered on the Primary Shelf Registration Statement, through the sales agent through an at-the-market facility (the August 2024 Offering ). As of September 30, 2024, net proceeds to the Company from the sale of such shares were approximately . See Note 7, Common Stock August 2024 Offering for additional information. On October 4, 2024, the Company consummated a private placement of its securities to certain accredited investors (the October 2024 Offering ). The gross proceeds from the October 2024 Offering were approximately million. After deducting placement agent fees and expenses and offering expenses payable by the Company of , the resulting net proceeds were approximately million. These net proceeds are inclusive of an investment from Bio-Rad (see Note 9), our aforementioned global strategic partner. See Note 12, Subsequent Events for additional information. In addition to general economic and capital market trends and conditions, Oncocyte s ability to raise sufficient additional capital to finance its operations from time to time will depend on a number of factors specific to Oncocyte s operations such as operating revenues and expenses, progress in our collaborative arrangement for the development and the commercialization of RUO and IVD kitted transplant products, progress in obtaining regulatory approval to distribute our products for clinical use, and progress in the development of, or in obtaining reimbursement coverage from Medicare for DetermaIO and other future laboratory tests that Oncocyte may develop or acquire. The unavailability or inadequacy of financing or revenues to meet future capital needs could force Oncocyte to modify, curtail, delay, or suspend some or all aspects of planned operations. Sales of additional equity securities could result in the dilution of the interests of Oncocyte's current stockholders. Oncocyte cannot assure that adequate long-term financing will be available on favorable terms, if at all. In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ASC 205-40, Going Concern , we evaluated whether there are conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the consolidated financial statements included in this Report are issued. This evaluation initially does not take into consideration the potential mitigating effect of our plans that have not been fully implemented as of the date the consolidated financial statements included in this Report are issued. When substantial doubt exists under this methodology, we evaluate whether the mitigating effect of our plans sufficiently alleviates substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The mitigating effect of our plans, however, is only considered if both (1) it is probable that the plans will be effectively implemented within one year after the date that such financial statements are issued, and (2) it is probable that the plans, when implemented, will mitigate the relevant conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that such financial statements are issued. In performing this analysis, we excluded certain elements of our operating plan that cannot be considered probable. Our expectation to generate operating losses and negative operating cash flows in the future and the need for additional funding to support our planned operations raise substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year after the date that the consolidated financial statements are issued. Management intends to complete additional equity financings while maintaining reduced spending levels. However, due to several factors, including those outside management s control, there can be no assurance that we will be able to complete additional equity financings. If we are unable to complete additional financings, management s plans include further reducing or delaying operating expenses. We have concluded the likelihood that our plan to successfully obtain sufficient funding from one or more of these sources or adequately reduce expenditures, while reasonably possible, is less than probable. Accordingly, we have concluded that substantial doubt exists about our ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least one year from the date of issuance of these consolidated financial statements.

For equipment purchased under financing leases, Oncocyte depreciates the equipment based on the shorter of the useful life of the equipment or the term of the lease, ranging from to years, depending on the nature and classification of the financing lease. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred whereas significant renewals and betterments are capitalized. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective accounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in Oncocyte s results of operations. Construction in progress, comprised primarily of leasehold improvements under construction, is not depreciated until the underlying asset is placed into service.

 and , respectively. Allowance for Credit Losses Oncocyte establishes an allowance for credit losses based on the evaluation of the collectability of its Pharma Services accounts receivables after considering a variety of factors, including the length of time receivables are past due, significant events that may impair the customer s ability to pay, such as a bankruptcy filing or deterioration in the customer s operating results or financial position, reasonable and supportable forecast that affect the collectability of the reported amount, and historical experience. If circumstances related to customers change, estimates of the recoverability of receivables would be further adjusted. Oncocyte continuously monitors collections and payments from customers and maintains a provision for estimated credit losses and uncollectible accounts, if any, based upon its historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that have been identified. Amounts determined to be uncollectible are written off against the credit loss reserve accounts. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, Oncocyte had an allowance for credit losses of and , respectively, related to Pharma Services. Laboratory Developed Test Services Prior to the Razor Sale Transaction, Oncocyte generated revenue from performing DetermaRx tests on clinical samples through orders received from physicians, hospitals, and other healthcare providers. In determining whether all the revenue recognition criteria in (i) through (v) above are met with respect to DetermaRx tests, each test result is considered a single performance obligation and is generally considered complete when the test result is delivered or made available to the prescribing physician electronically, and, as such, there are no shipping or handling fees incurred by Oncocyte or billed to customers. Although Oncocyte has billed a list price for all tests ordered and completed for all payer types, Oncocyte considers constraints on the variable consideration when recognizing revenue for DetermaRx. Because DetermaRx is a novel test and there are no current reimbursement arrangements with third-party payers other than Medicare, the transaction price represents variable consideration. Application of the constraint for variable consideration is an area that requires significant judgment. For all payers other than Medicare, Oncocyte must consider the novelty of the test, the uncertainty of receiving payment, or being subject to claims for a refund, from payers with whom it does not have a sufficient payment collection history or contractual reimbursement agreements. Accordingly, for those payers, Oncocyte has recognized revenue upon payment because it has had insufficient history to reliably estimate payment patterns.

Licensing Revenue Revenues that may be recognized include licensing revenue derived from agreements with customers for exclusive rights to market Oncocyte s proprietary testing technology. Under the agreements, Oncocyte grants exclusive rights to certain trademarks and technology of Oncocyte for the purpose of marketing Oncocyte s tests within a defined geographic territory. A license agreement may specify milestone deliverables or performance obligations, for which Oncocyte recognizes revenue when its licensee confirms the completion of Oncocyte s performance obligation. A licensing agreement may also include ongoing sales support from Oncocyte and typically includes non-refundable licensing fees and per-test Pharma Services revenues discussed above, for which Oncocyte treats the licensing of the technology, trademarks, and ongoing support as a single performance obligation satisfied by the passage of time over the term of the agreement.

vesting period. For stock-based awards that vest only upon the attainment of one or more performance goals set by Oncocyte at the time of the grant (sometimes referred to as milestone vesting), compensation cost is recognized if and when Oncocyte determines that it is probable that the performance condition or conditions will be, or have been, achieved. Oncocyte uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model for estimating the fair value of time-based options granted under Oncocyte s equity plan. The fair value of each restricted stock unit RSU or award is determined by the product of the number of units or shares granted and the grant date market price of the underlying common stock. Oncocyte has elected to treat stock-based payment awards with graded vesting schedules and time-based service conditions as a single award and recognizes stock-based compensation ratably on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. Options have a maximum contractual term of . Forfeitures are accounted for as they occur. Refer to Note 8 for additional information. The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires Oncocyte to make certain assumptions including the expected option term, the expected volatility, the risk-free interest rate and the dividend yield. The expected term of employee stock options represents the weighted average period that the stock options are expected to remain outstanding. Oncocyte estimates the expected term of options granted based on its own experience. Oncocyte estimates the expected volatility using its own stock price volatility for a period equal to the expected term of the options. The risk-free interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates on the United States government securities appropriate for the expected term of Oncocyte s stock options. The dividend yield assumption is based on Oncocyte s history and expectation of dividend payouts. Oncocyte has never declared or paid any cash dividends on its common stock, and Oncocyte does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. All excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies from stock-based compensation awards accounted for under ASC 718 are recognized as income tax benefit or expense, respectively, in the statements of operations. An excess income tax benefit arises when the tax deduction of a share-based award for income tax purposes exceeds the compensation cost recognized for financial reporting purposes and, a tax deficiency arises when the compensation cost exceeds the tax deduction. Because Oncocyte has a full valuation allowance for all periods presented (see Income Taxes below), there was no impact to Oncocyte statements of operations for any excess tax benefits or deficiencies, as any excess benefit or deficiency would be offset by the change in the valuation allowance.

The accompanying balance sheets separately present the Insight and Chronix total contingent consideration liabilities as current and noncurrent. Contingent consideration is not deductible for tax purposes, even if paid; therefore, no deferred tax assets related to the contingent consideration were recorded. Acquisition of Chronix Biomedical, Inc. On April 15, 2021 (the Chronix Merger Date ), Oncocyte completed its acquisition of Chronix pursuant to the Chronix Merger Agreement. As additional consideration for holders of certain classes and series of Chronix capital stock, the Chronix Merger Agreement required Oncocyte to pay certain contingent consideration. On February 8, 2023, the Company and the equity holder representative named in the Chronix Merger Agreement entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Chronix Merger Agreement, pursuant to which the parties agreed that (i) Chronix s equity holders will be paid earnout consideration of of net collections for sales of specified tests and products, until the expiration of intellectual property related to such tests and products, (ii) Chronix s equity holders will be paid of the gross proceeds received from any sale of all or substantially all of the rights, titles, and interests in and to Chronix s patents for use in transplantation medicine to such third-party, and (iii) all of the previous payment obligations were eliminated. The fair value of the Chronix contingent consideration after the Chronix Merger Date is reassessed by Oncocyte as changes in circumstances and conditions occur, with the subsequent change in fair value recorded in Oncocyte s consolidated statements of operations.

During the third quarter of 2023, in connection with a new sublease arrangement (see Note 7), the Company identified circumstances that indicated a potential impairment of certain leasehold improvements and after a valuation was performed, management concluded that such leasehold improvements were impaired. Accordingly, the Company recorded an impairment of approximately million. The Company used a discounted cash flow valuation method to determine the Level 3 fair value of the leasehold improvements. The significant unobservable inputs used, effective as of September 30, 2023, included: (i) a discount period of 50 months based on the required sublease payments, and (ii) a discount rate of .

If the Irvine Lease is terminated based on the occurrence of an event of default, Oncocyte will be obligated to pay the abated rent to the lessor. If Oncocyte exercises its option to extend the Term, the initial base monthly rent during the Extended Term will be the greater of the base monthly rent in effect during the last year of the Term or the prevailing market rate. The prevailing market rate will be determined based on annual rental rates per square foot for comparable space in the area where the Premises are located. If Oncocyte does not agree with the prevailing market rate proposed by the lessor, the rate may be determined through an appraisal process. The base monthly rent during the Extended Term shall be subject to the same annual rent adjustment as applicable for base monthly rent during the Term. In addition to base monthly rent, Oncocyte agreed to pay in monthly installments (a) all costs and expenses, other than certain excluded expenses, incurred by the lessor in each calendar year in connection with operating, maintaining, repairing (including replacements if repairs are not feasible or would not be effective) and managing the Premises and the building in which the Premises are located Expenses ), and (b) all real estate taxes and assessments on the Premises and the building in which the Premises are located, all personal property taxes for property that is owned by lessor and used in connection with the operation, maintenance and repair of the Premises, and costs and fees incurred in connection with seeking reductions in such tax liabilities Taxes ).

Litigation General Oncocyte may be subject to various claims and contingencies in the ordinary course of its business, including those related to litigation, business transactions, employee-related matters, and other matters. When Oncocyte is aware of a claim or potential claim, it assesses the likelihood of any loss or exposure. If it is probable that a loss will result and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated, Oncocyte will record a liability for the loss. If the loss is not probable or the amount of the loss cannot be reasonably estimated, Oncocyte discloses the claim if the likelihood of a potential loss is reasonably possible and the amount involved could be material. Tax Filings Oncocyte tax filings are subject to audit by taxing authorities in jurisdictions where it conducts business. These audits may result in assessments of additional taxes that are subsequently resolved with the authorities or potentially through the courts. Management believes Oncocyte has adequately provided for any ultimate amounts that are likely to result from these audits; however, final assessments, if any, could be significantly different than the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements. Employment Contracts Oncocyte has entered into employment and severance benefit contracts with certain executive officers. Under the provisions of the contracts, Oncocyte may be required to incur severance obligations for matters relating to changes in control, as defined in the respective contracts, and certain terminations of executives. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, Oncocyte has accrued approximately million and million, respectively, in severance obligations for certain executive officers, in accordance with the severance benefit provisions of their respective employment and severance benefit agreements, primarily related to Oncocyte s acquisition of Chronix in 2021. For the periods presented, management has classified million of the accrued severance obligations related to the Chronix acquisition as current based on our expectations of the timing of product commercialization and subsequent revenues that trigger the payouts.

 stock option grants with market-based and time-based vesting conditions to certain executives. The fair value of such awards was estimated using the Monte Carlo simulation model. Assumptions and estimates utilized in the model include the risk-free interest rate, dividend yield, expected stock volatility and the estimated period to achievement of the performance and market conditions, which are subject to the achievement of the market-based goals established by the Company and the continued employment of the executives through December 31, 2025. These awards vest only to the extent that the market-based conditions are satisfied as specified in the vesting conditions.

Assumptions utilized in connection with the Monte Carlo valuation technique included: estimated risk-free interest rate of percent; term of years; expected volatility of percent; and expected dividend yield of percent. The risk-free interest rate was determined based on the yields available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues. The expected stock price volatility was determined using historical volatility. The expected dividend yield was based on expectations regarding dividend payments. Based on the market-based conditions, the grant date fair values of these awards ranged from to , amounting to a total fair value of approximately .

Item 2. Management s Disc ussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 The following Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is intended to provide information necessary to understand our consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 included elsewhere in this Report, and highlight certain other information which, in the opinion of management, will enhance a reader s understanding of our financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of operations. These historical consolidated financial statements may not be indicative of our future performance. This Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains a number of forward-looking statements, all of which are based on our current expectations and could be affected by the uncertainties and risks described throughout this filing, particularly under Risk Factors in this Report and those Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 as filed with the SEC. For additional information, refer to the section above entitled Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements. 
 Overview 
 We are a diagnostics technology company. Our tests are designed to help provide clarity and confidence to physicians and their patients. VitaGraft is a clinical blood-based solid organ transplantation monitoring test, GraftAssure is a RUO blood-based donor-derived cell-free DNA test, DetermaIO is a gene expression test that assesses the tumor microenvironment to predict response to immunotherapies, and the pipeline test DetermaCNI is a blood-based monitoring tool for monitoring therapeutic efficacy in cancer patients. 
 Our mission is to democratize access to novel molecular diagnostic testing to improve patient outcomes. 
 We do this primarily by developing molecular diagnostic test kits that empower our customers to run their own tests to participate in the patient care value chain, which is counter-positioned with the central laboratory model. Our decentralized approach also puts testing in the hands of researchers to enable more studies, which inspires innovation, which can improve standards of care while also creating demand for more testing. We develop tests that measure both established biomarkers as well as pioneer the adoption of new and more effective biomarkers. 
 We believe that combining innovative science with a simple, but disruptive, business model can create enormous value. This model is designed to empower doctors to reduce uncertainty to make better decisions to save lives as well as enable researchers to measure biomarkers to inspire innovation. 
 Our customer institutions are hospitals, transplant centers, and labs. The decision to deploy our tests on behalf of patients or research studies comes from front line doctors, including surgeons, nephrologists and oncologists, as well as researchers, pathologists, lab directors, medical directors, department heads, lab managers, and chief medical officers. 
 Our operating premise is that democratizing access to testing to foster scientific innovation and better treatments ultimately reduces the cost of care, while expanding access and improving outcomes. 
 At the heart, we are a science-driven organization that champions scientific integrity and inquiry. We employ world-renowned scientists who generate intellectual property in our strategic target markets. We have built and acquired an intellectual property portfolio that we believe will enable us to gain share in well-established clinical and research markets. 
 Our primary near-term strategic market is organ transplant. Oncocyte s molecular diagnostic tests are designed to help the industry to better address one of the leading challenges in the transplantation market which is the body s potential to reject the donor organ. We do this by detecting early evidence of graft organ damage in the blood through assessing a known biomarker known as donor-derived cell-free DNA. VitaGraft Kidney, for example, can find donor kidney damage up to 10 months sooner than other protocols. VitaGraft is analytically and clinically validated in three major solid organ transplant types (kidney, liver and heart) by peer reviewed international publications. We received a positive coverage decision from MolDx for VitaGraft Kidney in August of 2023, and it became commercially available for ordering in January 2024 through our CLIA Laboratory in Nashville, Tennessee. VitaGraft Kidney is now broadly available to transplant professionals upon request. 
 In July 2024, we began to commercialize the technology underlying VitaGraft Kidney by distributing its sister product, GraftAssure, which is intended to be sold and used for research purposes and is labeled as RUO. We expect to distribute our RUO production through a mix of direct sales, partnering and distribution agreements, and licensing. We have entered into an agreement with Bio-Rad, our global strategic partner, to collaborate in the development and the commercialization of RUO and IVD kitted transplant products (see Note 10, Collaborative Arrangements, to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report for additional information). 
 44 

Under strict regulatory rules, our tests may not be used in a clinical treatment setting until they have attained IVD approval from the Food and Drug Administration FDA in the U.S. and In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices Regulation approval in the European Union. As such, we are working with these regulatory bodies to attain such approval, supporting future distribution and higher sales of our products for clinical use. 
 We also have a laboratory and pharma services lab, certified under the CLIA and accredited by the Collage of American Pathologists, in Nashville, Tennessee, and a research and development lab in G ttingen, Germany. Our innovation centers in Nashville and Germany employ world-renowned research scientists who are leaders in their field. 
 Our secondary strategic market is in the field of oncology namely through diagnostic tests that can measure and predict which patients will best respond to certain types of therapies, as well as provide efficacy monitoring for therapies. For example, we are continuing to develop DetermaIO, a test with promising data supporting its potential to help identify patients likely to respond to checkpoint inhibitor drugs. This new class of drugs modulate the immune response and show activity in multiple solid tumor types including non-small cell lung cancer, and triple negative breast cancer. DetermaIO is currently available as part of an early access program with leaders in the immuno-oncology field. A kitted research product format of the underlying technology began proof-of-concept development in 2023. The application of immunotherapy is a global problem, so we expect partnering opportunities for each of our products as they reach clinical maturity. We also expect to begin commercializing our oncology product line, which includes DetermaIO, over the next 18 months. 
 We also perform other assay development and clinical testing services for pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies through our Pharma Services operations. 
 The inherent uncertainties of developing and commercializing new diagnostic tests for medical use make it impossible to predict the amount of time and expense that will be required to complete the development and commercialization of those tests. There is no assurance that we will be successful in developing new technology or diagnostic tests, nor that any technology or diagnostic tests that we may develop will be proven safe and effective in diagnosis of cancer in humans or will be successfully commercialized. We expect that our operating expenses will continue to increase if we successfully complete the development of DetermaIO and commercialize this test. 
 Recent Developments

Results of Operations Three Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared with the Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Revenues decreased to 115,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 429,000 in the prior period. Decreased revenues in Pharma Services are the result of our shift in strategic focus on commercializing our transplant kitted tests, and deploying our sales personnel toward signing new hospital research laboratory customers. 
 Loss from continuing operations was 13.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 6.5 million for the comparable prior period. The loss from continuing operations expanded by 7.0 million mainly due to the change in fair value of contingent consideration, and the changes in Pharma Services revenue, operating expenses and other income and expenses from continuing operations as follows: 
 Pharma Services revenue decreased by 308,000 due to a decreased number of contracts performed during the period. See below for additional information. 

Cost of revenues decreased by 116,000, primarily related to labor and allocated overhead associated with performing our Pharma Services. See below for additional information. 

Cost of revenues - amortization of acquired intangibles was unchanged, and relates to noncash amortization of acquired intangible assets such as our customer relationship intangible assets acquired as part of the Insight merger. 

Research and development expenses increased by 632,000, as we continue development of VitaGraft, DetermaIO and DetermaCNI. The main drivers of the increase were laboratory costs, facilities costs and personnel-related expenses, partially offset by depreciation and amortization, and stock-based compensation (see below for additional details). 

Sales and marketing expenses increased by 330,000, primarily attributable to continued ramp in sales, marketing and advertising activities related to the transplant business, as well as supporting the commercialization efforts within oncology. The main drivers of the increase were personnel-related expenses and other sales and marketing related expenses, partially offset by stock-based compensation (see below for additional details). 

General and administrative expenses increased by 78,000, primarily due to an increase in personnel-related expenses, partially offset by facilities costs and stock-based compensation. See below for additional details. 

Change in fair value of contingent consideration was a loss of 7.1 million in 2024 compared to a gain of 435,000 in 2023. This change was due to changes in the fair value model inputs and revised estimates on if and when future payouts will occur. The change is also driven by the Chronix Merger Agreement amendment during the first quarter of 2023, which provided superseding earnout consideration (see Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report). See below for additional information. 

46 

The prior year impairment loss related to an asset impairment charge to leasehold improvements of 1.8 million (see Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report). 

Total other income, net decreased by 2,000, primarily due to reduced interest income and miscellaneous income in 2024 compared to 2023. See below for additional information. 

Results of Operations Nine Months Ended September 30, 2024 Compared with the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2023 
 Revenues decreased to 395,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to 1.2 million in the prior period. Decreased revenues in Pharma Services are the result of our shift in strategic focus on commercializing our transplant kitted tests, and deploying our sales personnel toward signing new hospital research laboratory customers. 
 Loss from continuing operations was 27.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, compared to 8.9 million for the comparable prior period. The loss from continuing operations expanded by 18.3 million mainly due to the change in fair value of contingent consideration, and the changes in Pharma Services revenue, operating expenses and other income and expenses from continuing operations as follows: 
 Pharma Services revenue decreased by 787,000 due to a decreased number of contracts performed during the period. See below for additional information. 

Cost of revenues decreased by 409,000, primarily related to labor and allocated overhead associated with performing our Pharma Services. See below for additional information. 

Cost of revenues - amortization of acquired intangibles was unchanged, and relates to noncash amortization of acquired intangible assets such as our customer relationship intangible assets acquired as part of the Insight merger. 

Research and development expenses increased by 835,000, as we continue development of VitaGraft, DetermaIO and DetermaCNI. The main drivers of the increase were personnel-related expenses, laboratory costs, facilities costs and professional fees, partially offset by depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation and severance costs (see below for additional details). 

Sales and marketing expenses increased by 529,000, primarily attributable to continued ramp in sales, marketing and advertising activities related to the transplant business, as well as supporting the commercialization efforts within oncology. The main drivers of the increase were personnel-related expenses and other sales and marketing related expenses, partially offset by facilities costs and stock-based compensation (see below for additional details). 

General and administrative expenses decreased by 1.8 million, primarily due to decreases in stock-based compensation, severance costs, facilities costs and professional fees, partially offset by personnel-related expenses. See below for additional details. 

Change in fair value of contingent consideration was a loss of 9.4 million in 2024 compared to a gain of 16.9 million in 2023. This change was due to changes in the fair value model inputs and revised estimates on if and when future payouts will occur. The change is also driven by the Chronix Merger Agreement amendment during the first quarter of 2023, which provided superseding earnout consideration (see Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report). See below for additional information. 

The prior year impairment losses related to two asset impairments, including in-process research and development intangible assets of 5.0 million (see Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report) and leasehold improvements of 1.8 million (see Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report). 

Impairment loss on held for sale assets relates to various agreements to sell laboratory equipment and the subsequent fair value adjustments. See Note 2, Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report for additional information. 

Total other income, net increased by 168,000, primarily due to additional interest income and miscellaneous income in 2024 compared to 2023. See below for additional information.

Pharma Services are generally performed on a time and materials basis. Upon our completion of the service to the customer in accordance with the contract, we have the right to bill the customer for the agreed upon price (either on a per test or per deliverable basis) and recognize the Pharma Services revenue at that time, on an accrual basis. Pharma Services revenues are generated under discrete agreements for particular customer projects that generally expire with the completion or termination of the customer s project. Accordingly, different customers may account for greater or lesser portions of Pharma Services during different accounting periods, and Pharma Services revenues may exhibit a larger variance from accounting period to accounting period than other revenues such as Laboratory Developed Test Services revenue. Refer to Note 2, Revenue Recognition Pharma Services Revenue and Disaggregation of Revenues and Concentrations of Credit Risk, to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report for additional information. 
 Laboratory Developed Test Services generally relate to payments received from sales prior to the Razor Sale Transaction. We generated revenue from performing DetermaRx tests on clinical samples through orders received from physicians, hospitals, and other healthcare providers. For all payers other than Medicare, we must consider the novelty of the test, the uncertainty of receiving payment, or being subject to claims for a refund, from payers with whom it does not have a sufficient payment collection history or contractual reimbursement agreements. Accordingly, for those payers, we have recognized revenue upon payment. Refer to Note 2, Revenue Recognition Laboratory Developed Test Services, to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report for additional information. 
 Cost of Revenues 
 Cost of revenues generally consists of cost of materials, direct labor including payroll, payroll taxes, bonus, benefit and stock-based compensation, equipment and infrastructure expenses, clinical sample costs associated with performing Pharma Services, and amortization of acquired intangible assets. Infrastructure expenses include depreciation of laboratory equipment, allocated rent costs and leasehold improvements. Cost of revenues for Pharma Services varies depending on the nature, timing, and scope of customer projects.

We expect to continue to incur a significant amount of research and development expenses during the foreseeable future. We will continue development of VitaGraft, DetermaIO and DetermaCNI. Our future research and development efforts and expenses will also depend on the amount of capital that we are able to raise to finance those activities and whether we acquire rights to any new diagnostic tests. A portion of our costs for leasing and operating our CLIA laboratory in Tennessee, and in Germany with Chronix, will also be included in research and development expenses to the extent allocated to the development of our diagnostic tests. 
 We may commence clinical trials of DetermaIO if we develop that diagnostic test to the point where we determine that its use as a clinical diagnostic appears to be feasible.

We expect to continue to incur sales and marketing expenses during the foreseeable future as we complete product development and begin commercialization efforts for DetermaIO as a clinical test. Sales and marketing expenses will also increase if we successfully develop and begin commercializing VitaGraft and DetermaCNI, or if we acquire and commercialize other diagnostic tests. Our commercialization efforts and expenses will also depend on the amount of capital that we are able to raise to finance commercialization of our tests. Our future expenditures on sales and marketing will also depend on the amount of revenue that those efforts are likely to generate. Because physicians are more likely to prescribe a test for their patients if the cost is covered by Medicare or health insurance, demand for our diagnostic and other tests and our expenditures on sales and marketing are likely to increase if our diagnostic or other tests qualify for reimbursement by Medicare or private health insurance companies.

Change in Fair Value of Contingent Consideration 
 We will pay contingent consideration if various payment milestones are triggered under the merger agreements through which we acquired Insight and Chronix. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report. Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration will be based on our reassessment of the key assumptions underlying the determination of this liability as changes in circumstances and conditions occur from the Insight and Chronix acquisition dates to the reporting periods being presented, with the subsequent changes in fair value recorded as part of our consolidated results from operations for such periods. See above change explanation for additional information. 
 Other Income and Expenses 
 Other income and expenses are primarily comprised of interest income and expense, and unrealized gains/losses from marketable equity securities, which were sold in 2023 (see Note 2, Marketable Equity Securities, to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report). Interest income is earned from money market funds we hold for capital preservation. Interest expense was incurred mainly from our financing lease obligations (see Note 6) and insurance financing activity. 
 Income Taxes 
 We did not record any provision or benefit for income taxes for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, as we had a full valuation allowance for the periods presented (see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report). 
 A valuation allowance is provided when it is more-likely-than-not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We established a full valuation allowance for all periods presented due to the uncertainty of realizing future tax benefits from our net operating loss carry-forwards and other deferred tax assets. 
 Inflation 
 Although historically not significant to our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, we may experience inflationary pressures, primarily in personnel costs and with certain laboratory supplies. The extent of any future impacts from inflation on our business and our results of operations will be dependent upon how long elevated inflation levels persist and the extent to which the rate of inflation were to increase, if at all, neither of which we are able to predict. If elevated levels of inflation were to persist or if the rate of inflation were to accelerate, the purchasing power of our cash and cash equivalents may be diminished, our expenses could increase faster than anticipated and we may utilize our capital resources sooner than expected. Further, given the complexities of the reimbursement landscape in which we operate, our payors may be unwilling or unable to increase reimbursement rates to compensate for inflationary impacts. As such, the effects of inflation may adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Our foreseeable material cash requirements as of September 30, 2024, are recognized as liabilities or generally are otherwise described in Note 6, Commitments and Contingencies, to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report. Cash requirements are generally derived from our operating and investing activities including expenditures for working capital, human capital, business development, investments in intellectual property, and business combinations. Our office lease obligations, net of sublease payments, and contingent consideration obligations are further described in Note 6 and Note 3, respectively. Historically, we have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had unrecognized tax benefits totaling 2.3 million (see Note 2, Income Taxes ). 
 Since formation, we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of our common stock, preferred stock and warrants. We have incurred operating losses and negative cash flows since inception and had an accumulated deficit of 317.0 million as of September 30, 2024. At September 30, 2024, we had 3.4 million of cash and cash equivalents. On October 4, 2024, we raised additional capital as discussed below. We expect to continue to incur operating losses and negative cash flows for the near future. Our expectation to generate operating losses and negative operating cash flows in the future and the need for additional funding to support our planned operations raise substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (see Note 1). 
 50 

On April 3, 2023, we entered into an agreement with certain members of our Board of Directors, and several institutional and accredited investors, including Broadwood, our largest shareholder, relating to their purchase of an aggregate of up to 2,278,121 shares of our common stock at an offering price of 7.08 per share to board members and 6.03 per share to the other investors participating in the offering (see Note 7). The offering was intended to be priced at-the-market for purposes of complying with applicable Nasdaq Listing Rules. The aggregate gross proceeds from the offering were approximately 13.9 million before deducting offering expenses payable by us. We used approximately 1.1 million of the net proceeds to immediately redeem an aggregate of 1,064 shares of our Series A Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock. 
 On April 15, 2024, we consummated the April 2024 Offering. The resulting net proceeds were approximately 9.9 million, after deducting offering expenses of 538,000 and deducting 5.4 million for the redemption of all remaining shares of our Series A Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock. These net proceeds are inclusive of an investment from Bio-Rad (see Note 9), our global strategic partner. See Note 7, Common Stock April 2024 Offering, to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report for additional information. 
 On August 1, 2024, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3, pursuant to which we registered for sale up to 100.0 million of any combination of our common stock, preferred stock, warrants and/or units from time to time and at prices and on terms that we may determine (the Primary Shelf Registration Statement ). On August 9, 2024, we entered into a sales agreement with a sales agent, pursuant to which we may offer and sell from time to time up to an aggregate of 7.5 million of shares of our common stock, registered on the Primary Shelf Registration Statement, pursuant to the August 2024 Offering. As of September 30, 2024, we received net proceeds from the sale of such shares of approximately 17,000. See Note 7, Common Stock August 2024 Offering, to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report for additional information. 
 On October 4, 2024, we consummated the October 2024 Offering. The gross proceeds from the October 2024 Offering were approximately 10.2 million. After deducting placement agent fees and expenses and offering expenses payable by the Company of 795,000, the resulting net proceeds were approximately 9.4 million. See Note 12, Subsequent Events, to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report for additional information. 
 We expect that our general operating expenses will be commensurate with the market opportunity as we continue to manage our available cash. Although we intend to market our diagnostic tests in the United States through our own sales force, we are also beginning to make marketing arrangements with distributors in other countries. We may also explore a range of other commercialization options in order to enter overseas markets and to reduce our capital needs and expenditures, and the risks associated with the timelines and uncertainty for attaining the Medicare reimbursement approvals that will be essential for the successful commercialization of additional cancer diagnostic tests. Those alternative arrangements could include marketing arrangements with other diagnostic companies through which we might receive a licensing fee and royalty on sales, or through which we might form a joint venture to market one or more tests and share in net revenues, in the United States or abroad. 
 On April 5, 2024, we entered into an agreement with Bio-Rad, our global strategic partner, to collaborate in the development and the commercialization of RUO and IVD kitted transplant products. On November 8, 2024, Oncocyte and Bio-Rad entered into a memorandum of understanding with respect to such agreement to establish additional activities to be performed by each party pursuant to such agreement. See Note 10, Collaborative Arrangements, to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report for additional information. 
 In addition to sales and marketing expenses, we will incur expenses from leasing and improving our offices and laboratory facilities in Nashville, Tennessee. During the third quarter of 2023, we entered into a sublease arrangement for our main office in Irvine, California. In January 2024, we expanded our Nashville facility by adding one new office lease and renewing and extending our existing leases. During the second and third quarters of 2024, we added five financing leases for certain laboratory equipment to be used in our Nashville facility. See Note 6, Commitments and Contingencies, to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report for additional leasing information. 
 We may need to meet significant cash payment or stock obligations to former Insight and Chronix shareholders in connection with our acquisition of those companies, as disclosed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report. To meet the future cash payment obligations, we may have to utilize cash on hand that would otherwise be available to us for other business and operational purposes, which could cause us to delay or reduce activities in the development and commercialization of our cancer tests. 
 51 

We will need to continue to raise additional capital to finance our operations, including the development and commercialization of our diagnostic tests, and making payments that may become due under our obligations to former Chronix shareholders and former Insight shareholders, until such time as we are able to generate sufficient revenues to cover our operating expenses. Delays in our collaborative arrangement for the development and the commercialization of RUO and IVD kitted transplant products, or delays in obtaining regulatory approval to distribute our products for clinical use, or delays in the development of, or in obtaining reimbursement coverage from Medicare for DetermaIO and other future laboratory tests that we may develop or acquire, could prevent us from raising sufficient additional capital to finance the completion of development and commercial launch of those tests. Investors may be reluctant to provide us with capital until our tests are approved for reimbursement by Medicare or reimbursement by private healthcare insurers or healthcare providers, or until we begin generating significant amounts of revenue from performing those tests. 
 The unavailability or inadequacy of financing or revenues to meet future capital needs could force us to modify, curtail, delay, or suspend some or all aspects of our planned operations. Sales of additional equity securities could result in the dilution of the interests of our shareholders. We cannot assure that adequate long-term financing will be available on favorable terms, if at all. 
 See Note 1 and Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report for additional information about our going concern discussion and equity offerings, respectively.

Critical Accounting Estimates 
 Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with GAAP. In preparing these financial statements, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. We base our assumptions, judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. On a regular basis, we evaluate our assumptions, judgments and estimates and make changes accordingly. 
 We believe that of the significant accounting policies discussed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report, the following accounting policies involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and require our most difficult, subjective or complex assumptions, judgments and estimates: 
 Going Concern Assessment; 

Contingent Consideration Liabilities; 

Intangible Assets; 

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets; 

Revenue Recognition and Allowance for Credit Losses; 

Stock-Based Compensation; and 

Income Taxes. 

Going Concern Assessment 
 We assess going concern uncertainty in our consolidated financial statements to determine if we have sufficient cash and cash equivalents on hand and working capital, including available loans or lines of credit, if any, to operate for a period of at least one year from the date our consolidated financial statements are issued (the look-forward period ). As part of this assessment, based on conditions that are known and reasonably knowable to us, we consider various scenarios, forecasts, projections and estimates, and we make certain key assumptions, including the timing and nature of projected cash expenditures or programs, and our ability to delay or curtail those expenditures or programs, if necessary, among other factors. Based on this assessment, as necessary or applicable, we make certain assumptions around implementing curtailments or delays in the nature and timing of programs and expenditures to the extent we deem probable those implementations can be achieved and we have the proper authority to execute them within the look-forward period. For additional information, refer to Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report. 
 Contingent Consideration Liabilities 
 Contingent consideration is estimated and recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date as part of the total consideration transferred. Contingent consideration is an obligation of the acquirer to transfer additional assets or equity interests to the selling shareholders in the future if certain future events occur or conditions are met, such as the attainment of product development milestones. Contingent consideration also includes additional future payments to selling shareholders based on achievement of components of earnings, such as earn-out provisions or percentage of future revenues, including royalties paid to the selling shareholders based on a percentage of certain revenues generated. 
 The fair value of milestone-based contingent consideration was determined using a scenario analysis valuation method which incorporates our assumptions with respect to the likelihood of achievement of the milestones, as defined in the merger agreements, credit risk, timing of the contingent consideration payments and a risk-adjusted discount rate to estimate the present value of the expected payments, all of which require significant management judgment and assumptions. Since the contingent consideration payments are based on nonfinancial, binary events, management believes the use of the scenario analysis method is appropriate. 
 The fair value of royalty or revenue share-based contingent consideration was determined using a single scenario analysis method to value those payments. The single scenario method incorporates our assumptions with respect to specified future revenues generated over their respective useful lives, credit risk, and a risk-adjusted discount rate to estimate the present value of the expected royalty payments, all of which require significant management judgment and assumptions. Since the royalty-based contingent consideration payments are based on future revenues and linear payouts, management believes the use of the single scenario method is appropriate. 
 53 

The fair value of contingent consideration after the acquisition date is reassessed by us as changes in circumstances and conditions occur, with the subsequent change in fair value recorded in our consolidated statements of operations. Changes in key assumptions can materially affect the estimated fair value of contingent consideration liabilities and, accordingly, the resulting gain or loss that we record in our consolidated financial statements. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recorded a loss of 9.4 million and a gain of 16.9 million, respectively, related to the fair value of contingent consideration. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, contingent consideration liabilities were 49.3 million and 39.9 million, respectively. For additional information, refer to Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report. 
 Intangible Assets 
 We consider various factors and risks for potential impairment of IPR D intangible assets, including the current legal and regulatory environment and the competitive landscape. Adverse clinical trial results, significant delays or inability to obtain LCD from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for Medicare reimbursement for a diagnostic test, the inability to bring a diagnostic test to market and the introduction or advancement of competitors diagnostic tests could result in partial or full impairment of the related intangible assets. Consequently, the eventual realized value of the IPR D project may vary from its fair value at the date of acquisition, and IPR D impairment charges may occur in future periods. During the period between completion or abandonment, the IPR D assets will not be amortized but will be tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if we become aware of any events occurring or changes in circumstances that would indicate a reduction in the fair value of the IPR D projects below their respective carrying amounts. 
 During the first quarter of 2023, due to changes in management and our economic condition, management shifted our business strategy to direct efforts on fewer studies and to transition from tests that are laboratory developed tests LDTs to RUO sales. Due to the change in strategy, our long range plan forecasts were updated and anticipated future benefits derived from our assets. The change in strategy represent a significant indicator for change in value of our long-lived assets. The original IPR D balances were reassessed based on the updated long range plan, using the multi-period excess earnings method approach, the results of the valuation noted that the carrying value of certain IPR D intangible assets was greater than the fair market value. Accordingly, we recorded an impairment of approximately 5.0 million as of March 31, 2023. We have not recorded any additional impairment adjustments as of September 30, 2024. For additional information, refer to Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report. 
 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 
 We assess the impairment of long-lived assets, which consists primarily of long-lived intangible assets, right-of-use assets, and machinery and equipment, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such assets might be impaired and the carrying value may not be recoverable. When such events or changes in circumstances are present, we estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset (or asset group) and its eventual disposition. If the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount, we recognize an impairment based on the fair value of such assets. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized impairment losses on held for sales assets of 169,000 and 1.3 million, respectively. For additional information, refer to Note 2, Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report. 
 Revenue Recognition and Allowance for Credit Losses 
 Pharma Services revenue 
 Pharma Services are generally performed under individual scope of work SOW arrangements or license agreements (together with SOW the Pharma Services Agreements with specific deliverables defined by the customer. Pharma Services are performed on a (i) time and materials basis or (ii) per test completed basis. Upon completion of the service to the customer in accordance with a Pharma Services Agreement, we have the right to bill the customer for the agreed upon price (either on a per test or per deliverable basis) and recognizes Pharma Service revenue at that time. Insight identifies each sale of its Pharma Service offering as a single performance obligation. Chronix identifies the processing of test samples as a separate performance obligation (considered a series) within license agreements with customers. Completion of the service and satisfaction of the performance obligation is typically evidenced by access to the report or test made available to the customer or any other form or applicable manner of delivery defined in the Pharma Services Agreements. However, for certain SOWs under which work is performed pursuant to the customer s highly customized specifications, we have the enforceable right to bill the customer for work completed, rather than upon completion of the SOW. For those SOWs, we recognize revenue over a period during which the work is performed using a formula that accounts for expended efforts, generally measured in labor hours, as a percentage of total estimated efforts for the completion of the SOW. As performance obligations are satisfied under the Pharma Services Agreements, any amounts earned as revenue and billed to the customer are included in accounts receivable. 
 54 

We establish an allowance for credit losses based on the evaluation of the collectability of its Pharma Services accounts receivables after considering a variety of factors, including the length of time receivables are past due, significant events that may impair the customer s ability to pay, such as a bankruptcy filing or deterioration in the customer s operating results or financial position, reasonable and supportable forecast that affect the collectability of the reported amount, and historical experience. We continuously monitor collections and payments from customers and maintains a provision for estimated credit losses and uncollectible accounts, if any, based upon its historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that have been identified. Amounts determined to be uncollectible are written off against the credit loss reserve accounts. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had an allowance for credit losses of 2,000 and 5,000, respectively, related to Pharma Services. 
 Laboratory Developed Test Services 
 Although we have billed a list price for all tests ordered and completed for all payer types, we consider constraints on the variable consideration when recognizing revenue for DetermaRx. Because DetermaRx is a novel test and there are no current reimbursement arrangements with third-party payers other than Medicare, the transaction price represents variable consideration. Application of the constraint for variable consideration is an area that requires significant judgment. For all payers other than Medicare, we must consider the novelty of the test, the uncertainty of receiving payment, or being subject to claims for a refund, from payers with whom it does not have a sufficient payment collection history or contractual reimbursement agreements. Accordingly, for those payers, we have recognized revenue upon payment because it has had insufficient history to reliably estimate payment patterns. 
 We maintained an allowance for credit losses related to Laboratory Developed Test Services at an amount we estimated to be sufficient to provide adequate protection against losses resulting from extending credit to our customers. We based this allowance, in the aggregate, on historical collection experience, age of receivables and general economic conditions, as well as specific identification of uncollectible accounts. We initially established an allowance in 2022 in connection with remaining Medicare and Medicare Advantage account balances and continued to add to the allowance as appropriate. In the first quarter of 2023, in connection with the adoption of the new current expected credit loss model, the Company determined that the Medicare and Medicare Advantage accounts receivable net balance of approximately 1.4 million was uncollectible and should therefore be written-off as of the adoption date, January 1, 2023. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had no receivables nor allowance for credit losses related to Laboratory Developed Test Services. 
 Stock-Based Compensation 
 We recognize compensation expense related to share-based payment awards made to employees, board directors and other non-employees based on estimated fair values. We estimate the fair value of stock-based payment awards on the grant date and recognize the resulting fair value over the requisite service period on a straight-line basis. For stock-based awards that vest only upon the attainment of one or more performance goals, compensation cost is recognized if and when we determine that it is probable that the performance condition or conditions will be, or have been, achieved. For grants with market-based and time-based vesting conditions, the fair value is estimated using the Monte Carlo simulation model, which includes the estimated period to achievement of the performance and market conditions, which are subject to the achievement of the market-based goals established by us and continued employment. We utilize the Black-Scholes option pricing model for determining the fair value of standard time-based stock options. Our determination of fair value of share-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors. We estimate the expected volatility using our own stock price volatility for a period equal to the expected term of the options. The expected term of options granted is based on our own experience. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury rates in effect during the corresponding period of grant. Key inputs and assumptions may change as we continue to develop our own company estimates, experience and key inputs including our expected term, and stock price volatility based on the trading history of our stock in the public market. Changes in these subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimated value of equity grants and the stock-based compensation that we record in our consolidated financial statements. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we recognized total stock-based compensation of 1.3 million and 2.3 million, respectively. For additional information, refer to Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report. 
 55 

Income Taxes 
 We account for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes , which prescribes the use of the asset and liability method, whereby deferred tax asset or liability account balances are calculated at the balance sheet date using current tax laws and rates in effect. The provision for income taxes for interim periods is determined using an estimated annual effective tax rate in accordance with ASC 740-270, Income Taxes, Interim Reporting . Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more-likely-than-not that a portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Our judgments regarding future taxable income may change over time due to changes in market conditions, changes in tax laws, tax planning strategies or other factors. If our assumptions and consequently our estimates change in the future, the valuation allowance may be increased or decreased, which may have a material impact on our statements of operations. 
 The guidance also prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more-likely-than-not sustainable upon examination by taxing authorities. We will recognize accrued interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. No amounts were accrued for the payment of interest and penalties as of the financial statement periods presented herein. We account for uncertain tax positions by assessing all material positions taken in any assessment or challenge by relevant taxing authorities. We are currently unaware of any tax issues under review. Refer to Note 2, Income Taxes, to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report. 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qu alitative Disclosures about Market Risk. 
 Under SEC rules and regulations, as a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide the information required by this item. 
 Item 4. Contr ols and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 It is management s responsibility to establish and maintain adequate internal control over all financial reporting pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ). Our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, have reviewed and evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Report. Following this review and evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer determined that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act (i) is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer, and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 Changes in Internal Controls 
 There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarterly period covered by this Report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 56 

PART II - OTHER IN FORMATION 
 Item 1. Legal Pr oceedings. 
 From time to time, we may be involved in routine litigation incidental to the conduct of our business. We are not presently involved in any material pending litigation or proceedings. See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report for additional information regarding commitments and contingencies. 
 Item 1A. Ris k Factors. 
 Our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects are subject to various risks, including those described in Item 1A Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on April 16, 2024, which we encourage you to review. Other than as noted below, there have been no material changes from the risk factors disclosed in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 If the FDA takes the position that any of our tests are not within the scope of its policy on enforcement discretion for laboratory-developed tests, or otherwise determines that it will seek to actively regulate one or more of our diagnostic tests, responding to such a regulatory position could lead to delays in commercialization, or (if encountered after commercialization) requirements to halt the commercial provision of our tests until FDA marketing authorization is obtained. 
 In May 2024, the FDA published a final rule that phases out its enforcement discretion for LDTs, unless exempt, and amends the FDA s regulations to make explicit that IVDs are medical devices under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act ("FDCA"), including when the manufacturer of the diagnostic product is a laboratory. The American Clinical Laboratory Association and a private laboratory have filed lawsuits against the FDA to challenge its authority to regulate LDTs under this final rule. The full impact of this final rule and the existing (and any future) challenges against currently remains to be seen. 
 If the FDA were to ultimately regulate our tests as traditional IVDs, some or all of our tests may become subject to certain FDA medical device regulations, including, in some cases, pre-market review. If required, the regulatory marketing authorization process may involve, among other things, successfully completing additional clinical trials and submitting a pre-market clearance (510(k)) submission or filing a de novo or pre-market approval application with the FDA. If pre-market review and approval is required by the FDA for any of our tests, we may need to incur additional expenses or require additional time to seek it, or we may be unable to satisfy FDA standards, and our applicable tests may not be cleared or approved on a timely basis, if at all, and the labeling claims permitted by the FDA may not be consistent with our currently planned claims or adequate to support adoption of and reimbursement for our tests. Ongoing compliance with any applicable FDA medical device regulations to which we could become subject in connection with any of our tests that FDA may regulate as traditional IVDs would increase the cost of conducting our business, and subject us to inspection by, and potential enforcement of certain regulatory requirements, of the FDA, for example registration and listing, adherence to good manufacturing practices under the Quality System Regulation ("QSR"), and medical device reporting. Enforcement action for noncompliance with these requirements could range from warning or untitled letters to civil and criminal penalties, injunctions, product seizure or recall, import bans, restrictions on the conduct of our operations and total or partial suspension of production. Our laboratories are operating under CLIA and are not currently operating as registered device manufacturing facilities or in compliance with FDA s QSR. Because these standards differ, we may face challenges establishing FDA-compliant quality systems or be unable to do so. If after commercialization under the LDT framework, our tests are allowed to remain on the market but there is uncertainty about the regulatory status of our tests, which is likely, given the current state of industry challenges to FDA s final rule, including questions that may be raised if competitors object to our regulatory positioning as an LDT, we may encounter ongoing regulatory and legal challenges and related costs. Such challenges or related developments (for example if the labeling claims the FDA allows us to make are more limited than the claims we currently plan to make) may impact our commercialization efforts as orders or reimbursement may be less than anticipated. Any of these regulatory developments may cause our business to suffer. 
 If the FDA is successful in overcoming challenges to the final rule and ultimately regulates certain LDTs as intended under the final rule, our tests may be subject to certain additional regulatory requirements, the scope of which may vary from one test to another based on various considerations. Complying with the FDA s requirements can be expensive, time-consuming, and subject us to significant or unanticipated delays. To the extent we are required to obtain premarket clearance or approval to perform or continue performing any of our tests, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain such authorization. Even if we obtain regulatory clearance or approval where required, such authorization may not be for the intended uses that we believe are commercially attractive or are critical to the commercial success of our tests. Based on these and other considerations, the implementation of the FDA s final rule on LDTs could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 57 

We currently market certain IVDs that have not been cleared by the FDA in reliance on the regulatory exemption for IVDs intended for RUO, but if the FDA determines that our RUO tests do not meet the applicable requirements for exemption or have intended uses that are inconsistent with RUO tests, we may be required to suspend commercialization of such products until we can obtain the requisite FDA clearance and/or subject to FDA warning or untitled letters, seizure, injunction, fines, or other enforcement action. 
 Some of our tests are marketed for RUO, which allows us to sell such products without the premarket clearance that FDA requires for the marketing of traditional devices. An RUO product may not be marketed for clinical diagnostic use and must be labeled For Research Use Only. Not for use in diagnostic procedures. Products that are intended for research use only and are properly labeled as RUO are exempt from compliance with the FDA s pre- and post-market requirements to which traditional devices are subject, including the requirement that the product be cleared or approved before commercialization and QSR requirements. However, merely including the required RUO labeling will not necessarily exempt the device from the FDA's 510(k) clearance, premarket approval, or other requirements if the circumstances surrounding the distribution of the product indicate an objective intent to market the product for clinical diagnostic use. 
 According to the FDA guidance, circumstances indicating manufacturer intent to market an in vitro device for diagnostic use may include written or verbal marketing claims regarding a product's clinical efficacy or performance in clinical applications, instructions for clinical interpretation, clinical information, product names, or descriptors that claim or suggest that the IVD product may be used for any clinical diagnostic use, including a clinical investigation that is not exempt from the FDA s investigational device exemption regulations. Other indications include a manufacturer's provision of technical support for clinical validation or clinical applications or solicitation of business from clinical laboratories that do not conduct research activities, all of which could be considered evidence of intended uses that conflict with RUO labeling. 
 In general, if (i) evidence shows that one or more of our IVDs are inappropriately labeled RUO (but marketed for clinical diagnostic use), such test(s) will not qualify for an IDE exemption and will be deemed misbranded under the FDCA. Device manufacturers found in violation of the FDCA may be subject to a wide range of enforcement action, including warning letters, seizure, injunction, criminal prosecution, monetary penalties, and others. 
 We believe that our promotional activities for our RUO products fall within the scope of the applicable premarket exemptions for RUO tests and the FDA s enforcement discretion, as described in its relevant guidance. However, the FDA could disagree and require us to (i) stop promoting our RUO devices unless/until we obtain FDA clearance or approval (among other possible outcomes). Any adverse determination in relation to our marketing of current or future products for RUO will likely have a material adverse impact on our business.
