. Unless otherwise noted, all per share
and share amounts presented herein have been retroactively adjusted for the effect of the reverse stock split for all periods presented. 

Upon
the Merger, membership interests in Prairie LLC were converted into the right to receive each member s pro rata share of 
shares of common stock, par value per share, of the Company Common Stock ). The Merger was accounted for as a reverse asset acquisition
under existing accounting principles generally accepted in the United States GAAP ). For accounting purposes, Prairie
LLC was treated as acquiring Merger Sub in the Merger. Refer to Note 4 Acquisitions and Merger for a further
discussion. 

Accordingly,
for accounting purposes, the financial statements of the Company represent a continuation of the financial statements of Prairie LLC
with the acquisition being treated as the equivalent of Prairie LLC issuing stock for the net assets of the Company. At the date of the
Merger, the assets and liabilities of the Company were recorded based upon relative fair values, with no goodwill or other intangible
assets recorded. 

Basis
of Presentation and Consolidation 

The
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report present the Company s financial position,
results of operations, and cash flows for the periods presented in accordance with GAAP and the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company owns of Prairie
LLC, which is considered a variable interest entity for which the Company is the primary beneficiary, as the Company is the sole managing
member of Prairie LLC and has the power to direct the activities most significant to Prairie LLC s economic performance, as well
as the obligation to absorb losses and receive benefits that are potentially significant. 

The
condensed consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2024 and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023
are unaudited. The condensed consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2023 were derived from the audited consolidated financial
statements included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10 K/A for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 

Certain
disclosures have been condensed or omitted from these condensed financial statements; however, management believes the disclosures are
adequate to make the information not misleading. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read
in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related note disclosures included in the Company s Annual Report
on Form 10-K/A for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. 

Liquidity
Analysis 

During
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the Company had a net loss of million and million, respectively. The Company
cannot predict if or when it will be profitable and may continue to incur losses for an indeterminate period of time. Additionally, the
Company may be unable to achieve or sustain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis and extended periods of losses and negative
cash flow may prevent it from successfully operating and expanding its business. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had cash and cash
equivalents of million, working capital of million, and an accumulated deficit of million. 

On
September 30, 2024, the Company entered into the SEPA (as defined herein), a Subordinated Note (as defined herein), and a Senior
Convertible Note (as defined herein). The Company closed the NRO Acquisition on October 1, 2024, using cash on hand, the proceeds
from the issuance of Common Stock, and a portion of the proceeds from the issuance of the Senior Convertible Note. The Company expects to use the remainder of the Senior Convertible Note proceeds, the Subordinated Note proceeds, as well as any future
proceeds from the SEPA to fund its drilling program and other working capital requirements. Refer to Note 8 Debt for
a discussion of the Senior Convertible Note and Subordinated Note issuances and to Note 12 Common Stock for a
discussion of the issuance of Common Stock and the SEPA. 

The
assessment of liquidity requires management to make estimates of future activity and judgments about whether the Company can meet
its obligations and has adequate liquidity to operate. Significant assumptions used in the Company s forecasted model of
liquidity in the next 12 months include its current cash position and ability to manage spending. Based on an assessment of these
factors, management expects that the Company s cash balance and expected revenues from its existing producing wells will not
be sufficient to meet its obligations over the next twelve months. Management plans to obtain additional financing through public or
private capital markets, including potentially through reserve-based lending arrangements, and views its plans as probable of being
successfully implemented based on the value of its proved developed reserves acquired in the NRO Acquisition, the value of its
outstanding Common Stock warrants, and its ability to issue additional Common Stock in public or private transactions, including the SEPA, as discussed above. Based on
these plans, substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern does not exist. 

Use
of Estimates 

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from these estimates. 

These
estimates and assumptions include estimates for reserves of credit losses, accruals for potential liabilities, estimates and
assumptions made in valuing assets and debt instruments issued in the Merger, the valuation of the Senior Convertible
Note, the Subordinated Note, and warrants issued in the third quarter of 2024, discussed further
in Note 8 Debt , and the realization of deferred tax assets. 

Segments 

The
Company currently operates in one industry segment, which is the acquisition and development of crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs. All
of the Company s operations are conducted in the continental United States.

million (the Purchase Price ), subject to certain closing price adjustments
and other customary closing conditions (the NRO Acquisition ). The Purchase Price consisted of million in cash and
 million in deferred cash payments. The Company deposited million of the Purchase Price into an escrow account on January 11,
2024 (the Deposit ). 

On
August 15, 2024, the Company and NRO agreed to amend certain terms of the NRO Agreement, pursuant to which the total consideration
of the NRO Acquisition was reduced to 
million cash, subject to certain closing price adjustments and other customary closing conditions, and the parties agreed to remove
the deferred cash payments. Additionally on August 15, 2024, 
million of the Deposit was released to NRO and the remaining 
million was returned to the Company. 

On
October 1, 2024, the Company closed the NRO Acquisition and paid 
million to the sellers in cash, using cash on hand, the proceeds from the issuance of Common Stock, and a portion of the proceeds
from the issuance of the Senior Convertible Note. Refer to Note 8 Debt for a discussion of the Senior Convertible
Note and to Note 12 Common Stock for a discussion of the issuance of Common Stock. 

The NRO Acquisition is expected to be
accounted for as an asset acquisition in accordance with ASC Topic 805 -
Accounting for Business Combinations. The estimated fair value of the consideration paid by the Company and the allocation of that
amount to the underlying assets acquired, on a relative fair value basis, is expected to be recorded on the Company s books as of
October 1, 2024, the closing date of the NRO Acquisition. Additionally, costs directly related to the NRO Acquisition are expected to be
capitalized as a component of the Purchase Price.

purchase price was calculated based on the fair value of Common Stock that the Company s stockholders, immediately prior to
the Merger, owned after the Merger, and the fair value of the Series D Preferred Stock issued to the holders of the AR Debentures. Since
there was no active trading market for the membership interests of Prairie LLC, the fair value of the Company s Common Stock represented
a more reliable measure of the fair value of consideration transferred in the Merger. The Company s Common Stock was based upon
a quoted price in an active market, which is considered a Level 1 fair value input. The fair value of the shares of Series D Preferred
Stock was determined using a valuation model with unobservable inputs, which are considered Level 3 inputs on the fair value hierarchy.

The
purchase price for the Merger was allocated to the net assets acquired on the basis of their relative fair values. The fair values of
the current assets acquired and current liabilities (excluding the convertible debentures) assumed in the Merger were determined to approximate
carrying value due to their short term nature. The fair value of the mining equipment was determined using estimated replacement
values of the same or similar equipment and, as such, are considered Level 3 inputs in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of the
secured convertible debentures was calculated as described above. The fair value of the share issuance liability was calculated based
on the quoted price of the Company s Common Stock and, as such, is considered a Level 1 measurement on the fair value hierarchy.

commitment period commencing on September 30, 2024 (the SEPA Effective Date and terminating on September 30,
2026. 

The
Company has determined that the SEPA represents a derivative instrument pursuant to ASC 815, which should be recorded at fair value at inception and remeasured at fair value each reporting period with changes in the
fair value recognized in earnings. The Company s right to sell shares to Yorkville under the SEPA is contingent upon the
Company having an effective registration statement, which had not been filed or deemed effective as of September 30, 2024.
Therefore, the Company has concluded that the fair value of the SEPA is zero as of September 30, 2024, because Yorkville does not have the
right to exercise its put option under the SEPA. Refer to Note 12 Common Stock for a further discussion of the
SEPA. 

Senior
Convertible Note. Additionally, on September 30, 2024, Yorkville advanced an initial million (the Pre-Paid Advance to the Company and the Company issued a convertible promissory note (the Senior Convertible Note ), with an interest rate of 
and a maturity date of . 

The
Company has determined that certain features of the Senior Convertible Note require bifurcation and separate accounting as embedded
derivatives. As such, the Company has elected the fair value option to account for the Senior Convertible Note; therefore, in
accordance with ASC 815, the Company recorded the Senior Convertible Note at fair value and will remeasure the fair value each
reporting period with changes in fair value recognized in earnings. Due to the short-term nature of the Senior Convertible Note, the
Company has determined that its fair value as of September 30, 2024 is million,
which is equal to the face value of million
less the 
original issuance discount. Since the Senior Convertible Note is not traded on an active market, the
inputs are considered Level 2 inputs within the fair value hierarchy. Refer to Note 8 Debt for a further discussion of the
Senior Convertible Note. 

Subordinated
Promissory Note. On September 30, 2024, the Company entered into a subordinated promissory note (the Subordinated Note with First Idea Ventures LLC and The Hideaway Entertainment LLC (together, the Noteholders ), in a principal amount of 
million, with a maturity of . The Subordinated Note has an interest rate of and the Noteholders are entitled
to a minimum return on capital of up to 2.0x upon the repayment, prepayment or acceleration of the obligations, or the occurrence of
certain other triggering events under the Subordinated Note. 

The
Company has determined that certain features of the Subordinated Note require bifurcation and separate accounting as embedded
derivatives. As such, the Company has elected the fair value option to account for the Subordinated Note; therefore, in accordance
with ASC 815, the Company recorded the Subordinated Note at fair value and will remeasure the fair value each reporting period with
changes in fair value recognized in earnings. 

As of September 30, 2024, the fair value
of the Subordinated Note is million, which was determined by a third-party using a credit default valuation model. . These are considered unobservable inputs which
are corroborated by market data and are therefore considered Level 2 inputs within the fair value hierarchy. Refer to Note 8 
Debt for a further discussion of the Subordinated Note. 

Subordinated
Note Warrants. As discussed in Note 8 Debt below, pursuant to the terms of the Subordinated Note, the Company issued
to the Noteholders warrants (the Subordinated Note Warrants to purchase up to 
 shares of Common Stock, vesting in tranches based
on the date of repayment of the Subordinated Note. 

The
Company has determined that the Subordinated Note Warrants should be accounted for as a liability pursuant to ASC Topic 480, Distinguishing
Liabilities from Equity ASC 480 ). In accordance with ASC 815, the Company recorded the Subordinated Note Warrants
at fair value and will remeasure the fair value each reporting period with changes in fair value recognized in earnings. As of
September 30, 2024, the fair value of the Subordinated Note Warrants is 
million, which was determined by a third-party using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The Monte Carlo simulation model considered a
beginning stock price of ,
risk-free rate of ,
and a weighted average equity volatility rate of .
These significant inputs are based on sensitive unobservable market data and are therefore considered Level 3 inputs within the fair
value hierarchy. Refer to Note 13 Common Stock Options and Warrants for a further discussion of the Subordinated Note
Warrants. 

As
of September 30, 2023, the Company had the following liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis: 

AR
Debentures. Through September 2023, the fair value of the Company s AR Debentures (discussed further in Note 8 Debt was based on a widely accepted valuation methodology that utilizes (i) the Company s Common Stock price, (ii) value of the debt
component, and (iii) the value of the equity component. The key unobservable inputs in the valuation model are the volatility that is
appropriate to use in the Company stock price and the yield that is appropriate for the Company. These inputs could change significantly
and result in significantly higher or lower fair values at different measurement dates; therefore, they are considered Level 3 inputs
within the fair value hierarchy. The AR Debentures were converted in October 2023; therefore, the Company stopped remeasuring the change
in fair value at that time. The fair value at conversion was determined using the Company s Common Stock price. 

As
of September 30, 2023, the fair value of the AR Debentures was million, compared to million at the date of the Merger. The
Company recognized the million and million changes in fair value as Loss on adjustment to fair value AR Debentures
on its condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, and condensed
consolidated statement of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Refer to Note 8 Debt for a further discussion of the AR Debentures. 

Common
Stock Obligation Shares. As discussed in Note 12 Common Stock, as a result of the Merger and related transactions,
the Company had the obligation to issue shares of Common Stock (the Obligation Shares ). The fair value of the Obligation
Shares was based on the quoted price of the Company s Common Stock and, as such, was considered a Level 1 input within the fair
value hierarchy. The underlying shares were fully issued on September 7, 2023, therefore, the Company stopped remeasuring the change
in the fair value of the obligation at that time. 

On
September 7, 2023, the date that the underlying shares were fully issued, the fair value of the Obligation Shares was 
million. The Company recognized the 
million and 
million change in fair value as Loss on adjustment to fair value Obligation Shares on its condensed consolidated statements
of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively, and condensed consolidated statement of cash
flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. Refer to Note 12 Common Stock for a further discussion of the
Obligation Shares. 

Warrant
Liabilities . In September 2023, pursuant to ASC 815, the Company adopted a sequencing policy to determine how to allocate
authorized and unissued shares among commitments to deliver shares. The sequence was based upon reclassifying securities with the
latest maturity date first. Refer to Note 12 Common Stock for a discussion of the share sequencing. This sequencing
and the lack of sufficient authorized shares required the Company to reclassify a portion of the Series D A Warrants and all of the
Series E A Warrants and Exok Warrants to liabilities at their fair value of million
during the three months ended September 30, 2023. Upon the effectiveness of the reverse stock split in October 2023, the Company had
sufficient authorized shares for all of its securities and reclassified the warrant liabilities into permanent equity effective in
October 2023. 

As
of September 30, 2023, the fair value of these liabilities was million. The Company recognized the million change in fair
value as Loss on adjustment to fair value Warrant Liabilities on its condensed consolidated statements of operations for the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and on its condensed consolidated statement of cash flows for the nine months ended September
30, 2023. Refer to Note 12 Common Stock and Note 13 Common Stock Options and Warrants for a further discussion
of the warrant liabilities. 

The
Company did not have any assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2024 and December 31,
2023. 

Assets
and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Non Recurring Basis 

Acquisition
and merger related assets and liabilities . The fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in an acquisition or
merger are measured on a non recurring basis on the acquisition or merger date. If the assets acquired and liabilities assumed
are current and short term in nature, the Company uses their approximate carrying values as their fair values, which is considered
a Level 1 input in the fair value hierarchy. If the assets acquired are not short term in nature, then the fair value is determined
using the estimated replacement values of the same or similar assets and, as such, are considered Level 3 inputs in the fair value hierarchy.

Pursuant
to the terms of the Subordinated Note, the Company issued the Subordinated Note Warrants to purchase up to 
shares of Common Stock to the Noteholders, vesting in tranches based on the date of repayment of the Subordinated Note. Refer to Note 13

Pursuant to the Subordinated Note, the Company entered into a registration rights agreement (the SPA Registration Rights Agreement with the Noteholders pursuant to which the Company agreed to file a registration statement registering the resale of the Common Stock
underlying the Subordinated Note Warrants. 

The

On September 30, 2024, the Company entered into the SEPA with Yorkville, whereby, subject to certain conditions,
the Company has the right, not the obligation, to sell to Yorkville up to million shares of Common Stock, at any time and in an the amount
as specified in the applicable Advance Notice, during the commitment
period commencing on the SEPA Effective Date and terminating on September 30, 2026. Each issuance and sale by the Company under the SEPA (an
 Advance is subject to a maximum limit equal to 100 of the aggregate volume traded of the Company s Common Stock
on the Nasdaq Stock Market during the five trading days immediately prior to the date of the Advance Notice. The shares will be issued
and sold to Yorkville at a per share price equal to 97 of the lowest daily volume weighted average price of Common Stock for three consecutive

2024, pursuant to the SEPA, the Company paid Yorkville a structuring fee of and a
commitment fee of shares of Common Stock the Commitment Fee . 

Pursuant to the SEPA, the Company may issue up to a total of 4,198,343 shares

Additionally, the Commitment Fees and any issuance costs associated with the SEPA have been expensed to general and administrative expenses. 

The Company s right to sell shares to Yorkville under the SEPA is contingent upon the Company having an effective
registration statement, which had not been filed or deemed effective as of September 30, 2024. Therefore, the Company has concluded that
the fair value of the SEPA is zero as of September 30, 2024, because Yorkville does not have the right to exercise its put option under
the SEPA. 

2023
Share Sequencing and Reclassifications 

As
of September 30, 2023, the Company had 
common shares authorized and 
common shares issued and outstanding as adjusted for the reverse stock split, as discussed in Note 1 Organization, Description of Business,
and Basis of Presentation . On September 30, 2023, and without consideration of the reverse stock split, there were insufficient
authorized and unissued shares for the Company to satisfy all of its commitments to deliver shares. The Company adopted a sequencing
policy to determine how to allocate authorized and unissued shares among commitments to deliver shares pursuant to ASC 815-40. The
sequence is based upon reclassifying securities with the latest maturity date first. 

The
Company s sequencing policy resulted in the allocation of authorized and unissued shares in the following order at September
30, 2023 (i) AR Debentures, (ii) Legacy Warrants (as defined herein) (March 2024 expiration), (iii) Series D B Warrants, (iv)
restricted stock units issued to directors and an advisor (refer to Note 14 Long Term Incentive Compensation ),
(v) Series E B Warrants, (vi) restricted stock units issued to employees (refer to Note 14 Long Term Incentive
Compensation and Legacy Warrants (September 2024 January 2027 expiration) (vii) Series D A Warrants, (viii) Series E A
Warrants, (ix) Exok Warrants, (x) Series D Preferred Stock, (xi) Series E Preferred Stock and (xii) Merger Options.
This sequencing and the lack of sufficient authorized shares required the Company to reclassify a portion of the Series D A Warrants
and all of the Series E A Warrants and Exok Warrants to liabilities at fair value during the three months ended September 30, 2023.
These liabilities were remeasured to fair value at September 30, 2023 with the change in fair value reflected in the statement of
operations. Refer to Note 5 Fair Value Measurements for a discussion of the warrant liabilities fair
value. 

Additionally,
and due to the lack of sufficient authorized shares, the Company s Series D Preferred Stock and Series E Preferred Stock were
reclassified to mezzanine equity at their maximum redemption value during the three months ended September 30, 2023. Upon the
effectiveness of the reverse stock split in October 2023 (refer to Note 1 Organization, Description of Business, and
Basis of Presentation ), the Company had sufficient authorized shares of Common Stock issuable upon the conversion or exercise of
all of its issued and outstanding securities and therefore, reclassified the warrant liabilities and mezzanine equity into permanent
equity effective in October 2023.

shares of the Company s Common Stock are reserved for issuance pursuant to
awards under the LTIP. 

Stock Based
Compensation 

The
Company s stock based compensation awards are classified as either equity awards or liability awards in accordance with GAAP.
The fair value of an equity classified award is determined at the grant date and is amortized to general and administrative expense
on a graded attribution basis over the vesting period of the award. The Company accounts for forfeitures of stock based compensation
awards as they occur. There were no forfeitures during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The fair value of a liability classified
award is determined on a quarterly basis beginning at the grant date until final vesting. Changes in the fair value of liability classified
awards are recorded to general and administrative expense over the vesting period of the award. 

RSUs
and PSUs granted under the LTIP can immediately vest (A) upon a termination due to (i) death, (ii) disability, or (iii) retirement, in
the case of employee awards, or (B) in connection with a change in control; provided that for employee RSU or PSU awards, such accelerated
vesting upon a change in control only applies to the extent no provision is made in connection with a change in control for the assumption
of awards previously granted or there is no substitution of such awards for new awards. To the extent an employee s RSU or PSU
award is assumed or substituted in connection with the change in control, if a participant is terminated by the Company without cause 
or the employee terminates for good reason (each as defined in the applicable award agreement), then each RSU or PSU award
will become fully vested. 

Equity Classified
Restricted Stock Units 

The
Company has granted RSUs to employees which primarily vest ratably over a three-year period, subject to the employees continued service
through each applicable vesting date. The Company has also granted RSUs to directors and advisors which primarily vest one year following
the grant date, subject to the director s or advisor s continued service through the vesting date. The fair values of these RSU awards are
based on the price of the Company s Common Stock as of each relevant grant date.

performance goals based on the Company s relative total shareholder return as compared to the performance peer group during the
performance period, in each case, at the end of a three-year performance period, and generally subject to the employees continued service
throughout the performance period. Per the PSU agreements, these awards can be settled in either stock or cash, as determined by the
Compensation Committee of the Board (the Committee however, unless the Committee determines otherwise, these PSUs will
be settled in stock; therefore, the Company classified these PSUs as equity awards. The number of shares of Common Stock that a holder
of the PSUs earns at the end of the performance period may range from 0 to 200 of the target number of PSUs granted, as determined
by the Company s total shareholder return relative to a group of peers over the performance period, which represents a market condition
per ASC Topic 718, Compensation Stock Compensation . The fair value of these PSUs awards is determined by a third party using
a Monte Carlo simulation model as of the grant date.

Overview 

We

We currently hold attractive acreage in the DJ Basin of Colorado that our experienced
management team intends to develop, deploying next generation technology and techniques in an environmentally efficient manner.
In addition to growing production through our drilling operations, we also seek to grow our business through accretive acquisitions,
focusing on assets with the following criteria: (i) producing reserves, with opportunities to add accretive, undeveloped bolt on
acreage; (ii) ample, high rate of return inventory of drilling locations that can be developed with cash flow reinvestment;
(iii) strong well level economics; (iv) liquids rich assets; and (v) accretive valuation. 

As

for total consideration of 94.5 million, subject to certain closing price adjustments and other customary closing conditions. The Purchase
Price consisted of 83.0 million in cash and 11.5 million in deferred cash payments. Pursuant to the NRO Agreement, we deposited 9.0

Consent
and Agreement 

On
August 15, 2024, we entered into the Consent and Agreement with the O Neill Trust, pursuant to which the O Neill Trust
(a) consented to, and waived any and all negative covenants with respect to, any and all transactions the we may consummate in connection
with the funding of the NRO Acquisition and our ongoing operations; (b) released its mortgage on certain of our property, which was established
in favor of the O Neill Trust securing our obligations under the Series E Certificate; and (c) agreed to (i) amend Section 6(d)
of the Series E Certificate to increase the Beneficial Ownership Limitation Ceiling from 9.99 to 49.9 , (ii) increase the Beneficial Ownership Limitation from 9.99 to 49.9 
and (iii) amend Section 2(e) of each of the O Neill Trust s Series D A Warrant and Series E A Warrant and Section 2(d) of
the O Neill Trust s Series E B Warrant to increase the Beneficial Ownership Limitation Ceiling from 25 to 49.9 . 

In
connection with the increase to the Beneficial Ownership Limitation Ceiling, the O Neill Trust agreed pursuant to the Consent and
Agreement that (i) until its remaining Series D Preferred Stock, Series D PIPE Warrants, and Series E PIPE Warrants are exercised or
converted, as applicable, it will not acquire any other shares of our Common Stock, and (ii) for a period of ten years following the
date of the Consent and Agreement, it will not, directly or indirectly, acquire by means of public equity trading markets, any Common Stock or other securities with underlying Common Stock, to the extent the O Neill Trust would beneficially own the voting, investment
or economic control over 49.9 of our Common Stock. 

The
O Neill Trust further agreed that if at any time it beneficially owns, or exercises control over, shares of Common Stock with voting
rights that exceed the Voting Threshold, we shall exercise the voting rights with respect to such shares of Common Stock beneficially
owned in excess of the Voting Threshold in the same proportion as the outstanding Common Stock (excluding Common Stock beneficially owned,
directly or indirectly, by the O Neill Trust or any Affiliate of the O Neill
Trust, but including any of our securities eligible to vote with the Common Stock on an as-converted basis) voted on all matters submitted
to a vote of the holders of our Common Stock. 

Standby
Equity Purchase Agreement 

On
September 30, 2024, we entered into the SEPA with Yorkville, whereby, subject to certain conditions, we have the right, not the obligation,
to sell to Yorkville up to 40.0 million shares of Common Stock, at any time and in the amount
as set forth in the applicable Advance Notice, during the commitment period commencing on the SEPA Effective Date and terminating on September
30, 2026. Each Advance by us under the SEPA is subject to a maximum limit equal to 100 of the aggregate volume traded of
our Common Stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market during the five trading days immediately prior to the date of the Advance Notice. The shares
will be issued and sold to Yorkville at a per share price equal to 97 of the lowest daily volume weighted average price of Common Stock
for three consecutive trading days commencing on the trading day immediately following the Yorkville s receipt of an Advance Notice.
On September 30, 2024, pursuant to the SEPA, we paid Yorkville a structuring fee of 25,000 and a Commitment Fee by issuing Yorkville
100,000 shares of Common Stock. 

Any
purchases under an Advance will be subject to certain limitations, including that Yorkville cannot acquire (i) any shares that would
result in the Yorkville, including its affiliates, beneficially owning more than 4.99 of our outstanding Common Stock at the time of
an Advance or (ii) more than the Exchange Cap, subject to limited exceptions. 

We have determined that the
SEPA represents a derivative instrument pursuant to ASC 815, which should be recorded at fair value at inception and remeasured at fair
value each reporting period with changes in the fair value recognized in earnings. Additionally, the Commitment Fees and any issuance
costs associated with the SEPA have been expensed to general and administrative expenses. 

Our right to sell shares to Yorkville under the SEPA is contingent upon
us having an effective registration statement, which had not been filed or deemed effective as of September 30, 2024. Therefore, we have
concluded that the fair value of the SEPA is zero as of September 30, 2024, because Yorkville does not have the right to exercise its
put option under the SEPA. 

Senior
Convertible Note 

On
September 30, 2024, Yorkville advanced the Pre-Paid Advance of 15.0 million to us and we issued the Senior Convertible Note, with an
interest rate of 8.00 and a maturity date of September 30, 2025. Our obligations with respect to the Pre-Paid Advance and under the
Senior Convertible Note are guaranteed by Prairie LLC, a subsidiary of the Company, and Prairie Holdco, a subsidiary of the Company,
pursuant to a global guaranty agreement entered into by Prairie LLC and Prairie Holdco in favor of Yorkville on September 30, 2024. Yorkville
may convert the Pre-Paid Advance into shares of Common Stock at any time at the Conversion Price. We may, at
any time, redeem all or a portion or the amounts outstanding under the Senior Convertible Note at 105 of the principal amount thereof,
plus accrued and unpaid interest. 

We
did not receive the proceeds from the Senior Convertible Note until October 1, 2024; therefore, we have recorded a 14.3 million short-term
financing receivable related to the Senior Convertible Note as of September 30, 2024. 

We
have determined that certain features of the Senior Convertible Note require bifurcation and separate accounting as embedded derivatives.
As such, we have elected the fair value option to account for the Senior Convertible Note; therefore, in accordance with ASC 815, we
have recorded the Senior Convertible Note at fair value and will remeasure the fair value each reporting period with changes in fair
value recognized in earnings. Due to the short-term nature of the Senior Convertible Note, we have determined that its fair value as
of September 30, 2024 is 14.3 million, which is equal to the face value of 15.0 million less the 5 original issuance discount. 

In
connection with the SEPA, we entered into the SEPA Registration Rights Agreement with Yorkville pursuant to which we agreed to file a
registration statement registering the resale of the Common Stock underlying the SEPA, the Pre-Paid Advance, and the Commitment Fee. 

Subordinated
Promissory Note and Subordinated Note Warrants 

On
September 30, 2024, we entered into the Subordinated Note with the Noteholders, First Idea Ventures LLC and The Hideaway Entertainment

issued the Subordinated Note Warrants to purchase up to 1,141,552 shares of Common Stock to the Noteholders, vesting in tranches based
on the date of repayment of the Subordinated Note. 

29 

We
did not receive a portion of the proceeds from the Subordinated Note until October 1, 2024; therefore, we have recorded a 2.0 million
short-term financing receivable related to the Subordinated Note as of September 30, 2024. 

We
have determined that certain features of the Subordinated Note require bifurcation and separate accounting as embedded derivatives. As
such, we have elected the fair value option to account for the Subordinated Note; therefore, in accordance with ASC 815, we have recorded
the Subordinated Note at fair value and will remeasure the fair value each reporting period with changes in fair value recognized in
earnings. As of September 30, 2024, the fair value of the Subordinated Note is 5.3 million. Additionally, we have determined that the
Subordinated Note Warrants should be accounted for as a liability pursuant to ASC 480. In accordance with ASC 815, we have recorded the
Subordinated Note Warrants at fair value and will remeasure the fair value each reporting period with changes in fair value recognized
in earnings. As of September 30, 2024, the fair value of the Subordinated Note Warrants is 2.8 million and was determined using a Monte
Carlo simulation model. The total fair value of the Subordinated Note and the Subordinated Note Warrants exceeded the proceeds of 5.0
million, as a result, we have recognized a loss on debt issuance of 3.0 million on our condensed consolidated statements of operations
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Pursuant
to the Subordinated Note, we entered into the SPA Registration Rights Agreement with the Noteholders pursuant to which we have agreed
to file a registration statement registering the resale of the Common Stock underlying the Subordinated Note Warrants. 

Factors
Affecting the Comparability of Financial Results 

Crypto
Sale 

As
discussed in Note 4 Acquisitions and Merger , we acquired our cryptocurrency mining operations in May 2023, concurrent
with the Merger. On January 23, 2024, we sold all of our Mining Equipment for consideration consisting of (i) 1.0 million in cash and
(ii) 1.0 million in deferred cash payments, to be paid out of (a) 20 of the monthly net revenues received by the buyer associated with
or otherwise attributable to the Mining Equipment until the aggregate amount of such payments equals 250,000 and (b) thereafter, 50 
of the monthly net revenues received by the buyer associated with or otherwise attributable to the Mining Equipment until the aggregate
amount of such payments equals the Deferred Purchase Price, plus accrued interest. As of September 30, 2024, we have received 0.2 million
of the Deferred Purchase Price.

Loss
from operations 

For
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, loss from operations increased 2.5 million and 16.2 million, respectively, compared
to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. These increases were entirely related to incremental operating costs and expenses
recognized during the current periods, as discussed below. 

The
cryptocurrency mining revenue earned and cryptocurrency mining operating costs and expenses incurred during the nine months ended September
30, 2024 and prior to the Crypto Sale have been classified as discontinued operations.

For
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, operating costs and expenses increased 2.5 million and 16.2 million, respectively,
compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. 

The
operating costs and expenses incurred and related to the cryptocurrency mining assets during the nine months ended September 30, 2024
and prior to the Crypto Sale have been classified as discontinued operations. 

Depreciation,
depletion, and amortization . For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, DD A increased 711 compared to the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2023. This increase was driven by depreciation recognized for office furniture purchased in the third
quarter of 2024, which was not recognized during the same periods of 2023. 

General
and administrative expenses. For the three months ended September 30, 2024, general and administrative expenses increased 2.5 million
compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. The increase was primarily driven by incremental stock based compensation
of 1.5 million, legal and accounting costs of 1.6 million, and financing commitment fees of 0.6 million, partially offset by a decrease
in investor relations costs of 1.6 million. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, general and administrative expenses increased 15.7 million compared to the nine months ended
September 30, 2023. This increase was driven by incremental stock based compensation of 5.1 million, employee and benefit expenses
of 4.9 million, legal and accounting costs of 2.4 million, investor relations costs of 1.3 million, financing commitment fees of 0.6
million, and other professional services of 0.5 million.

Exploration
expenses . For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, exploration expenses increased less than 0.1 million and 0.5 million, respectively,
compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. These increases were driven by delay rental costs incurred on oil and
gas leases during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, which were not incurred during the same periods of 2023.

Interest
income. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, interest income increased 0.3 million and 0.4 million, respectively,
compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023. These increases were largely due to higher average cash balances in the
current periods. 

Interest
expense. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, interest expense reflected our accrued interest on the AR Debentures
and SBA Loan, both connected with the Merger, and certain financing costs incurred in the periods. We did not have any debt outstanding
during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and therefore did not incur any interest expense during the current periods.
Refer to Note 8 Debt for a discussion of the AR Debentures and SBA Loan. 

Loss
on debt issuance. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, the loss on debt issuance of 3.0 million reflects the
loss recognized for the issuance of the Subordinated Note and the Subordinated Note Warrants. As discussed above, we have elected
the fair value option to account for both the Subordinated Note and the Subordinated Note Warrants and engaged a third-party to
determine the fair value of both instruments at issuance. As of September 30, 2024, the total fair value of the Subordinated Note
and the Subordinated Note Warrants exceeded the proceeds of 5.0 million, as a result, we have recognized a loss on debt issuance of
 3.0 million on our condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Refer to Note 5 Fair Value Measurements , Note 8 
Debt, and Note 13 Common Stock Options and Warrants for a further discussion of the Subordinated Note and the Subordinated
Note Warrants. 

Loss
on adjustment to fair value Warrant Liabilities. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the loss on the
adjustment to fair value Warrant Liabilities of 24.9 million reflected the change in fair value of the portion of the
Series D A Warrants, all of the Series E A Warrants, and all of the Exok Warrants which were classified as liabilities as of
September 30, 2023. The warrant liabilities were reclassified to equity in October 2023; therefore, we did not record a loss on the
adjustment to fair value for the warrant liabilities during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Refer to Note 5 Fair Value Measurements and Note 13 
Common Stock Options and Warrants for a further discussion of the Series D A Warrants, the Series E A Warrants, and the Exok Warrants. 

Loss
on adjustment to fair value AR Debentures. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the loss on the
adjustment to fair value AR Debentures of 2.1 million and 2.9 million, respectively, reflected the change in fair value of
the AR Debentures since the Merger until September 30, 2023. The AR Debentures were converted into Common Stock in October 2023;
therefore, we did not record a loss on the adjustment to fair value for the AR Debentures during the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2024. Refer to Note 5 Fair Value Measurements and Note 8 
Debt for a further discussion of the AR Debentures. 

Loss
on adjustment to fair value Obligation Shares. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, the loss on the
adjustment to fair value for the obligation shares of 0.8 million and 1.5 million respectively, reflected the change in fair value
of the Obligation Shares liability since the Merger until September 7, 2023. The underlying shares were fully issued on September 7,
2023; therefore, we did not record a loss on the adjustment to fair value for the obligation during the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2024. Refer to Note 5 Fair Value Measurements and Note 12 
Common Stock for a further discussion of the Obligation Shares. 

Liquidated
damages. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized liquidated damages expense of 0.2 million due to
the registration statement registering the resale of certain shares of our Common Stock and the shares of Common Stock underlying
the Series D Preferred Stock and Series D PIPE Warrants not being declared effective within the timeframe required under the related
registration rights agreement. We did not recognize any liquidated damage expense during the three and nine months ended September
30, 2024. Refer to Note 15 Related Party Transactions for a further discussion.

During
the three months ended September 30, 2024, we did not have any cryptocurrency mining revenue or related expenses, as a result of the
Crypto Sale completed in January 2024, and therefore we did not have a net loss from discontinued operations. For the three months ended
September 30, 2023, the net loss from discontinued operations reflects the cryptocurrency mining revenue and related expenses for the
period. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the net loss from discontinued operations decreased 16.0 million compared to the nine months
ended September 30, 2023. As discussed above, we completed the Crypto Sale in January 2024; therefore, we did not have any cryptocurrency
mining revenue or related expenses during the majority of the nine months ended September 30, 2024. However, we did recognize a 1.1
million loss on the sale of cryptocurrency mining equipment. Additionally, during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we recognized
 16.8 million of impairment of cryptocurrency mining equipment to write off the excess of the allocated purchase price to the cryptocurrency
assets which were over the fair value of the acquired net assets and to subsequently write off shipping and customs fees incurred on
miners after the Merger. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Overview 

Our
E P activities will require us to make significant operating and capital expenditures. In 2023, our primary sources of liquidity
were the proceeds from the Series D PIPE and the Series E PIPE, which funded the purchase of the initial Genesis Assets and working
capital, as well as proceeds from the exercise of warrants, which funded, among other things, working capital and the deposit for
the NRO Acquisition in 2024. We commenced drilling wells on our Genesis Assets in the third quarter of 2024 and expect those wells to
start producing by the end of the year. 

Additionally,
during the third quarter of 2024, we raised approximately 35.0 million in cash by issuing Common Stock, the Senior Convertible
Note, and the Subordinated Note. On October 1, 2024, we used cash on hand, the proceeds from the issuance of Common Stock, and a
portion of the proceeds from the issuance of the Senior Convertible Note to fund the closing of the NRO Acquisition. We expect to
use the remainder of the Senior Convertible Note proceeds and the Subordinated Note proceeds to fund our drilling program and other
working capital requirements. We expect the producing assets acquired from NRO to provide cash flow going forward, however, we
expect that our cash balance and expected revenues from our existing producing wells will not be sufficient to fund our development
program and operations. We plan to obtain additional financing through public or private capital markets, including potentially
through reserve-based lending arrangements and/or issuing additional Common Stock in public or private transactions, to supplement
proceeds resulting from the exercise of our outstanding Common Stock warrants and issuances of Common Stock in connection with the
SEPA. 

Our
development program is dependent upon our ability to obtain additional financial through public and private capital markets. The availability
of such additional capital is subject to numerous factors outside of our control including prices of oil and natural gas and the overall
health of the U.S. and global economic environments. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such additional capital.
The amount and allocation of future capital expenditures will depend upon a number of factors, including the amount and timing of cash
flows from operations, investing and financing activities, and the timing and cost of additional capital sources. 

We
currently plan to be the operator of all of our acreage. As a result, we anticipate that the timing and level of our capital spending
will largely be discretionary and within our control. We could choose to defer a portion of our planned capital expenditures depending
on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the receipt and timing of required regulatory permits and approvals, seasonal
conditions, drilling and acquisition costs, the level of participation by other working interest owners, the success of our drilling
activities, prevailing and anticipated prices for oil, natural gas, and NGLs, the availability of necessary equipment, infrastructure
and capital. 

Working
Capital 

We
define working capital as current assets less current liabilities. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had working
capital of 12.1 million and 8.1 million, respectively, and cash and cash
equivalents of 40.1 million and 13.0 million, respectively. Our cash and cash equivalents, and corresponding working capital, as
of September 30, 2024, will decrease, as we paid 49.6 million to close the NRO Acquisition on October 1, 2024. Refer to Note 4
 Acquisitions and Mergers for further discussion of the NRO Acquisition. Even though we will begin to recognize revenues
from the producing wells acquired in the NRO Acquisition, we expect our cash balance and working capital will decrease in the
future as we continue to incur expenses in connection with our business unless we are able to obtain additional financing through public or private capital markets.

Operating
activities. Net cash used in operating activities totaled 5.7 million and 7.9 million during the nine months ended September
30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The 2.3 million change in our net cash used in operating activities is largely due to an increase
in operating costs during the current period. 

Investing
activities. Net cash used in investing activities totaled 13.9 million and 21.6 million during the nine months ended September
30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The 7.7 million decrease in our net cash used in investing activities was largely driven by the
 21.1 million spent in connection with the Exok Option Purchase during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and the 1.0 million
cash proceeds and 0.2 million note receivable from the Crypto Sale in January 2024, which is reflected as discontinued operations.
These decreases were partially offset by the 9.0 million deposit made in connection with the NRO Acquisition, 3.0 million of which
was returned to us during the three months ended September 30, 2024, and an 8.6 million increase in capital investments in oil and
natural gas properties during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Financing
activities. Net cash provided by financing activities totaled 46.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, driven
by proceeds of 33.5 million from the exercise of Series D B and Series E B warrants, 15.0 million of proceeds from the issuance of
Common Stock, partially offset by the related issuance costs of 4.9 million, and 3.0 million of proceeds from the issuance of the Subordinated
Note. Net cash provided by financing activities totaled 36.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, which was comprised
of proceeds from the issuance of the Series D PIPE of 17.4 million, partially offset by the related financing costs of 0.4 million,
and the issuance of the Series E PIPE of 20.0 million, partially offset by the related financing costs of 0.2 million. 

Liquidity
Analysis 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we had a net loss of 29.0 million. We cannot predict if or when we will be profitable,
and we may continue to incur losses for an indeterminate period of time. Additionally, we may be unable to achieve or sustain profitability
on a quarterly or annual basis and extended periods of losses and negative cash flow may prevent us from successfully operating and expanding
our business. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of 40.1 million, working capital of 12.1 million, and an accumulated
deficit of 107.8 million. 

Our cash balance as of September 30, 2024 has decreased, as we paid 49.6 million to close the NRO Acquisition on
October 1, 2024. Refer to Note 4 Acquisitions and Mergers for
further discussion of the NRO Acquisition. Even though we will begin to recognize revenues from the producing wells acquired in the NRO
Acquisition, we expect our cash balance and working capital will decrease in the future as we continue to incur expenses in connection
with our business unless we are able to obtain additional financing through public or private capital markets. 

The
assessment of liquidity requires management to make estimates of future activity and judgments about whether we can meet our
obligations and have adequate liquidity to operate. Significant assumptions used in our forecasted model of liquidity in the next 12
months include our current cash position and our ability to manage spending. Based on an assessment of these factors, management
expects that our cash balance and expected revenues from our existing producing wells will not be sufficient to meet our obligations
over the next twelve months. We plan to obtain additional financing through public or private capital markets, including potentially
through reserve-based lending arrangements, and view our plans as probable of being successfully implemented based on the value of
our proved developed reserves acquired in the NRO Acquisition, the value of our outstanding Common Stock warrants, and our ability
to issue additional Common Stock in public or private transactions, including the SEPA, as discussed above. Based on these plans, substantial doubt about our ability to
continue as a going concern does not exist. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon the accompanying condensed consolidated financial
statements. These financial statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the amounts reports for assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.
Management believes its estimates and assumptions to be reasonable under these circumstances. Certain estimates and assumptions are inherently
unpredictable and actual results could differ from those estimates. We have provided a full discussion of our significant accounting
policies, estimates, and judgments in Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10 K/A
for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. We have not changed any of our significant accounting policies, estimates, or judgements
during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, however, we did apply the discontinued operations guidance to account for the Crypto
Sale in January 2024. Refer to Note 3 Discontinued Operations for a full discussion of the discontinued operations and
the subsequent accounting.

4. Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our
management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure
controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10 Q. For purposes of this section,
the term disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act ), means controls and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without
limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it
files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management, including its principal executive
and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure. 

Based
upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of September 30, 2024 our disclosure
controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level. 

Inherent
Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls 

Management
does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all
errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance
that the objectives of the control systems are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource
constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost effective
control system, no evaluation of internal control over financial reporting can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error
or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been or will be detected. 

These
inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because
of a simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people,
or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood
of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future
conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2024 that materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
