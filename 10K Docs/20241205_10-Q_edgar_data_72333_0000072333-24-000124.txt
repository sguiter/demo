 of the shares of Nordstrom Canada, as of March 2, 2023, we no longer have a controlling interest under GAAP and have deconsolidated Nordstrom Canada. We hold a variable interest in the Nordstrom Canada entities, which are considered variable interest entities, but are not consolidated, as we are no longer the primary beneficiary. In December 2023, Nordstrom Canada delivered a proposed plan of arrangement to its creditors, which was subsequently approved by creditors on March 1, 2024, sanctioned by the Ontario Superior Court of Justice on March 20, 2024 and implemented by Nordstrom Canada on April 25, 2024. Initial distributions pursuant to the plan of arrangement occurred in May 2024. As of November 2, 2024, we recorded within accounts receivable, net on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet to reflect the remaining amount we estimate we will receive as part of the plan of arrangement. For more information on the wind-down of our Canada operations, see our 2023 Annual Report. 
 Non-cash charges associated with the wind-down of operations in Canada in 2023 are included in Canada wind-down costs on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The decrease in cash due to the deconsolidation of Nordstrom Canada is included in investing activities on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows and all other impacts are included in operating cash flows. 
 Prior to deconsolidation, Nordstrom made loans to the Canadian subsidiaries and incurred liabilities related to certain intercompany charges. These were considered intercompany transactions and were eliminated in consolidation of Nordstrom. Subsequent to deconsolidation, these liabilities and receivables were no longer eliminated through consolidation, are considered related-party transactions and are recorded in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at estimated fair value. Nordstrom had outstanding liability to Nordstrom Canada as of November 2, 2024. 
 Leases 
 We incurred operating lease liabilities arising from lease agreements of for the nine months ended November 2, 2024 and for the nine months ended October 28, 2023. 
 Land, Property and Equipment 
 Our net non-cash investing activities related to capital expenditure accruals, primarily for our Nordstrom and Rack stores, which resulted in an increase to accounts payable of as of November 2, 2024. 
 Supply Chain Asset Impairments 
 During the second quarter of 2024, we decommissioned certain supply chain assets and incurred a non-cash impairment charge of as a result of a change in our supply chain optimization strategy. This included on long-lived tangible assets and on ROU assets to adjust the carrying values to their estimated fair values. These charges are included in our Corporate/Other SG A expense on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings and asset impairment on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. 
 Going-Private Transaction 
 In April 2024, we announced that our Board of Directors had established a special committee of independent and disinterested directors (the Special Committee in response to interest expressed by Erik B. Nordstrom, our Chief Executive Officer, and Peter E. Nordstrom, our President and Chief Brand Officer, in pursuing a potential transaction in which Nordstrom would become a private company in conjunction with the Board s exploration of possible avenues to enhance shareholder value. On September 4, 2024, the Special Committee confirmed receipt of a proposal from Erik and Pete Nordstrom, other members of the Nordstrom family, and El Puerto de Liverpool, S.A.B. de C.V. (collectively, the Bid Group to acquire all of the outstanding shares of the Company, other than shares held by members of the Bid Group, for per share in cash. 
 The Special Committee and the other independent directors are carefully reviewing the proposal in consultation with independent financial and legal advisors to determine the course of action that is in the best interests of Nordstrom and all shareholders. There can be no assurance that the Company will pursue this transaction or other strategic outcome, or that a proposed transaction will be approved or consummated. We do not intend to disclose further developments regarding this matter unless and until further disclosure is determined to be appropriate or necessary. 
 In September 2024, we entered into a Second Amendment to the Shareholder Rights Agreement, which provides that the Bid Group shall be an Exempt Person under the Shareholder Rights Agreement until the earlier of (i) April 17, 2025 and (ii) the date that the Bid Group increases its aggregate beneficial ownership of shares of the Company s common stock to an amount greater than its beneficial ownership on the date of the Amendment plus of the then-outstanding shares of common stock (subject to specified exclusions). For more information on the Shareholders Rights Agreement, see our 2023 Annual Report .

 Credit Facilities 
 As of November 2, 2024 and October 28, 2023 we had outstanding borrowings under the Revolver that expires in May 2027. As of November 2, 2024, we have an outstanding standby letter of credit of resulting in available short-term borrowing capacity of . This letter of credit is not reflected in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.

 Any outstanding borrowings under the Revolver are secured by substantially all our personal and intellectual property assets and are guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries. Under the Revolver, our obligation to secure any outstanding borrowings will be eliminated if no default exists and we either have an unsecured investment-grade debt rating from of specified ratings agencies, or we have investment-grade rating and achieve consecutive fiscal quarters with a Leverage Ratio of less than times. 
 Under the Revolver, we have financial covenant tests that need to be met on a quarterly basis: a Leverage Ratio that is less than or equal to times and a fixed charge coverage ratio that is greater than or equal to times. As of November 2, 2024, we were in compliance with all covenants. 
 The Revolver contains customary representations, warranties, covenants and terms, including paying a variable rate of interest and a facility fee based on our debt rating, and is available for working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes. The Revolver allows us to issue dividends and repurchase shares provided we are not in default and no default would arise as a result of such payments. If the pro-forma Leverage Ratio after such payments is less than times, then such payments are unlimited. If the pro-forma Leverage Ratio is greater than or equal to times but less than times, then we are limited to per fiscal quarter and if the pro-forma Leverage Ratio is greater than or equal to times, then the limit is per fiscal quarter.

Under the terms of the commercial paper agreement, we pay a rate of interest based on, among other factors, the maturity of the issuance and market conditions. The issuance of commercial paper has the effect of reducing available liquidity under the Revolver by an amount equal to the principal amount of commercial paper outstanding. Conversely, borrowings under our Revolver have the effect of reducing the available capacity of our commercial paper program by an amount equal to the amount outstanding. As of November 2, 2024 and October 28, 2023, we had issuances outstanding under our commercial paper program. 

Fair value of long-term debt 
 We measure certain items at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, primarily goodwill and long-lived tangible and ROU assets, in connection with periodic evaluations for potential impairment. For more information regarding long-lived tangible asset impairment charges for the nine months ended November 2, 2024, see Note 1: Basis of Presentation. We estimate the fair value of these assets using primarily unobservable inputs and, as such, these are considered Level 3 fair value measurements. In the first quarter of 2023, we measured our investment in Nordstrom Canada, our related-party receivables and related lease guarantees at fair value. See our 2023 Annual Report for more detailed information on charges associated with the wind-down of our Canada operations. 
 Investments Measured at NAV 
 From time to time, we invest in financial interests of private companies and venture capital funds that align with our business and omni-channel strategies, which are classified in other assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and proceeds from the sale of assets and other, net within investing activities on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. These investments are measured at fair value using the NAV per share, or its equivalent, as a practical expedient. This class of investments consists of partnership interests that mainly invest in venture capital strategies with a focus on privately held consumer and technology companies. The NAV is based on the fair value of the underlying net assets owned by the fund and the relative interest of each participating investor in the fair value of the underlying assets. Our interest in these partnerships is generally not redeemable and is subject to significant restrictions regarding transfers. Distributions from each fund will be received as the underlying assets of the funds are liquidated. Liquidation is triggered by clauses within the partnership agreements or at the funds stated end date. The contractual terms of the partnership interests range from six to ten years. 
 As of November 2, 2024, February 3, 2024 and October 28, 2023, we held , and of investments measured at NAV.

 OVERVIEW 
 Third quarter results reflected continued progress on our 2024 key priorities of driving Nordstrom banner growth, optimizing our operations and building upon the momentum at the Rack. We reported net earnings of , or per diluted share, and EBIT of in 2024, compared with net earnings of 67, or per diluted share, and EBIT of 102 in 2023. In the third quarter of 2024, Adjusted EBIT 1 was 97 and Adjusted EPS 1 was 0.33, which excluded a 14 million charge related to accelerated technology depreciation. Adjusted EBIT 1 of 77 and Adjusted EPS 1 of 0.25 in the third quarter of 2023 excluded a favorable 25 million true-up related to the wind-down of Canadian operations. 
 Total Company net sales increased 4.6 versus the same period in fiscal 2023, and total Company comparable sales increased 4.0 . The timing shift of the Anniversary Sale, with one week shifting from the third quarter to the second quarter, had a negative impact on net sales of approximately 100 basis points compared with the third quarter of 2023. In the third quarter, women s apparel and active had double-digit growth, and shoes, men s apparel and kids apparel were up mid to high single-digits, versus 2023. 
 We are committed to improving the customer experience while delivering profitable growth and are encouraged by the progress we made against our key priorities during the third quarter of 2024. 
 Nordstrom We continued to make progress during the third quarter in driving Nordstrom banner growth, by offering a curated selection of merchandise with greater depth in our customers favorite brands across our fleet, and not just in our largest stores. As an omni-channel retailer, we serve customers when, where, and how they want to shop, and service is always our number one priority. For our customers that prefer to shop online, we aim to make the experience seamless and engaging through technology. Nordstrom.com net sales growth was supported by enhancements to the search and discovery functionality on our site and in our app, as well as improvements in our assortment, especially of items under 100 in price. We also continued to scale our Marketplace business, which now has over 300 sellers offering a wide selection to our customers. 
 Operational Optimization We made progress on optimizing our operations, including in our supply chain, to drive improvements in customer experience through faster delivery and moving product efficiently through our network to provide relevance and freshness. In the third quarter, faster fulfillment and delivery of items drove an over 40 percent improvement in the speed of customer returns. Returns that come in faster mean that we can process, inspect and get the items back into our inventory in a sellable condition in less time, increasing the product s overall full price exposure. 
 Nordstrom Rack In our Rack banner, our strategy of offering great brands at great prices helped drive double-digit topline growth in the third quarter. We continued to expand our reach and convenience for customers by opening 12 new Rack stores in the third quarter of 2024 bringing our year to date total to 23 new Rack stores. We believe that Rack stores are a great use of capital, delivering a solid return on investment, while attracting new customers. Rack digital sales growth was driven by an expanded online merchandise offering as well as focused efforts to maintain high in-stock rates in our fastest selling items. Towards the end of the third quarter, we launched store fulfillment for Rack digital orders and buy online pick-up in stores in over 100 of our Rack stores around the country. 
 Our strategy and focus on the brands that matter most continued to resonate with customers and deliver results, driving positive total company net sales growth for the fourth consecutive quarter. We believe continued execution on our key priorities will help us navigate through the near-term uncertain external environment and position us well to better serve our customers, drive profitable growth and increase shareholder value. Looking ahead, we feel set up for a successful holiday season and are excited to fulfill our brand purpose to help our customers feel good and look their best.

 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
 In our ongoing effort to enhance the customer experience, we are focused on providing a seamless retail experience across our Company. We invested early in integrating our operations, merchandising and technology across our stores and online in both our Nordstrom and Nordstrom Rack banners. By connecting our digital and physical assets across Nordstrom and Nordstrom Rack, we are able to better serve customers when, where and how they want to shop. We have one Retail reportable segment and analyze our results on a total Company basis, using customer, market share, operational and net sales metrics. 
 Our Anniversary Sale, historically the largest event of the year, typically falls in the second quarter. One week of our Anniversary Sale shifted to the second quarter in 2024 from the third quarter in 2023. 
 We monitor a number of key operating metrics to evaluate our performance. In addition to net sales, net earnings and other results under GAAP, three other key operating metrics we use are GMV, comparable sales and inventory turnover rate. 
 GMV: calculated as the total dollar value of owned and unowned inventory sold through our digital platforms and stores, including the impact of estimated future customer returns and deferred revenue from Nordy Club points and Notes. We use GMV as an indicator of the scale and growth of our operations and the impact of our unowned inventory models. 
 Comparable Sales: calculated as the total dollar value of owned and unowned inventory sold through our digital platforms and stores, which are added to the comparable sales base after they have been open for 13 full months or more, and removed in the month of their closure. Comparable sales are net of actual returns. Due to the 53rd week in 2023, we calculate our 2024 comparable sales growth using a realigned 2023 52-week period. We use comparable sales to evaluate the performance of our business without the impact of recently opened or closed stores. 
 Inventory Turnover Rate: calculated as the trailing four-quarter merchandise cost of sales divided by the trailing 13-month average inventory. Inventory turnover rate is an indicator of our success in optimizing inventory volumes in accordance with customer demand. Merchandise inventories prior to February 4, 2024 were calculated under the retail inventory method. Effective February 4, 2024, we changed our accounting method to the weighted average cost method, and recorded the cumulative effect of this change in accounting principle in beginning accumulated deficit on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of February 4, 2024 (see Note 1: Basis of Presentation in Item 1).

For the nine months ended November 2, 2024, gross profit increased 155, compared with the same period in 2023, primarily due to higher sales, partially offset by higher buying and occupancy costs. For the nine months ended November 2, 2024, gross profit as a percent of net sales was approximately flat, compared with the same period in 2023. 
 Ending inventory as of November 2, 2024 increased 5.9 , compared with the same period in 2023, versus a 4.6 increase in sales for the third quarter of 2024.

 Interest expense, net increased 2 for the third quarter of 2024 and increased 1 for the nine months ended November 2, 2024, compared with the same periods in 2023, primarily due to decreased capitalized interest. In addition, interest on long-term debt decreased due to the retirement of our 2.30 senior notes in April 2024.

 Income tax expense (benefit) is summarized in the following table: Quarter Ended Nine Months Ended November 2, 2024 October 28, 2023 November 2, 2024 October 28, 2023 Income tax expense (benefit) 11 11 45 43) Effective tax rate 18.9 14.2 25.7 99.7 
 The effective tax rate increased in the third quarter of 2024, compared with the same period in 2023, primarily due to a decrease in tax benefits related to the wind-down of Canadian operations. The effective tax rate decreased for the nine months ended November 2, 2024, compared with the same period in 2023, primarily due to the favorable resolution of certain tax matters and net tax benefits of 95 related to the wind-down of Canadian operations, both recognized in the nine months ended October 28, 2023.

 EPS is as follows: 
 Quarter Ended Nine Months Ended November 2, 2024 October 28, 2023 November 2, 2024 October 28, 2023 Basic 0.28 0.41 0.78 Diluted 0.27 0.41 0.76 
 Diluted EPS decreased 0.14 for the third quarter of 2024, compared with the same period in 2023, primarily due to higher labor costs and an accelerated technology depreciation charge that had a net unfavorable impact of 0.06 per diluted share, partially offset by higher sales volume. The third quarter of 2023 included an adjustment from the wind-down of Canadian operations that increased diluted EPS by 0.16 per diluted share. 
 For the nine months ended November 2, 2024, diluted EPS increased 0.76 compared with the same period in 2023, primarily due to higher sales volume, partially offset by charges related to a supply chain asset impairment and accelerated technology depreciation, which had a net unfavorable impact of 0.30 per diluted share.

 Adjusted EBIT, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBIT Margin and Adjusted EPS (Non-GAAP Financial Measures) 
 The following are key financial metrics and, when used in conjunction with GAAP measures, we believe they provide useful information for evaluating our core business performance, enable comparison of financial results across periods and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management for financial and operational decision-making. Adjusted EBIT, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBIT margin and Adjusted EPS exclude certain items that we do not consider representative of our core operating performance. The financial measure calculated under GAAP which is most directly comparable to Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA is net earnings. The financial measure calculated under GAAP which is most directly comparable to Adjusted EBIT margin is net earnings as a percent of net sales. The financial measure calculated under GAAP which is most directly comparable to Adjusted EPS is diluted EPS. 
 Adjusted EBIT, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBIT margin and Adjusted EPS are not measures of financial performance under GAAP and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, net earnings, net earnings as a percent of net sales, operating cash flows, earnings per share, earnings per diluted share or other financial measures performed in accordance with GAAP. Our method of determining non-GAAP financial measures may differ from other companies financial measures and therefore may not be comparable to methods used by other companies. 
 The following is a reconciliation of net earnings to Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA and net earnings as a percent of net sales to Adjusted EBIT margin: Quarter Ended Nine Months Ended November 2, 2024 October 28, 2023 November 2, 2024 October 28, 2023 Net earnings 46 67 128 Income tax expense (benefit) 11 11 45 (43) Interest expense, net 26 24 79 78 Earnings before interest and income taxes 83 102 252 35 Accelerated technology depreciation 1

 1 As a result of a strategic decision, we recognized a charge related to incremental accelerated depreciation for a technology asset, which we will deprecate in the fourth quarter of 2024. The charge is included in our Corporate/Other SG A expense on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings and depreciation and amortization expenses on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. 
 
 The following is a reconciliation of diluted EPS to Adjusted EPS: Quarter Ended Nine Months Ended November 2, 2024 October 28, 2023 November 2, 2024 October 28, 2023 Diluted EPS 0.27 0.41 0.76 Accelerated technology depreciation 0.08 0.08 Supply chain asset impairment and other 0.32 Canada wind-down costs (0.15) 1.74 Income tax impact on adjustments 1

 Adjusted ROIC (Non-GAAP financial measure) 
 We believe that Adjusted ROIC is a useful financial measure for investors in evaluating the efficiency and effectiveness of the capital we have invested in our business to generate returns over time. Our Adjusted ROIC calculation excludes certain items that we do not consider representative of our core operating performance. 
 Adjusted ROIC is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, return on assets, net earnings, total assets or other GAAP financial measures. Our method of calculating a non-GAAP financial measure may differ from other companies methods and therefore may not be comparable to those used by other companies. The financial measure calculated under GAAP which is most directly comparable to Adjusted ROIC is return on assets. The following shows the components to reconcile the return on assets calculation to Adjusted ROIC: Four Quarters Ended November 2, 2024 October 28, 2023 Net earnings 263 119 Income tax expense (benefit) 99 (2) Interest expense 137 136 Earnings before interest and income tax expense 499 253 Operating lease interest 1 
 90 86 Non-operating related adjustments 2 
 99 284 Adjusted net operating profit 688 623 Adjusted estimated income tax expense 3 
 (187) (144) Adjusted net operating profit after tax 501 479 Average total assets 8,779 8,956 Average noncurrent deferred property incentives in excess of ROU assets 4 
 (128) (167) Average non-interest bearing current liabilities (2,992) (3,134) Non-operating related adjustments 2 
 44 294 Adjusted average invested capital 5,703 5,949 Return on assets 3.0 1.3 Adjusted ROIC 8.8 8.1 
 1 Operating lease interest is a component of operating lease cost recorded in occupancy costs. We add back operating lease interest for purposes of calculating adjusted net operating profit for consistency with the treatment of interest expense on our debt. 
 2 Non-operating related adjustments primarily included supply chain impairment charges and accelerated technology depreciation for the four quarters ended November 2, 2024 and the wind-down of our Canadian operations for the four quarters ended October 28, 2023. See the Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA section, as well as our 2023 Annual Report, for detailed information on certain non-operating related adjustments. 
 3 Adjusted estimated income tax expense is calculated by multiplying the adjusted net operating profit by the adjusted effective tax rate (which removes the impact of non-operating related adjustments) for the trailing twelve-month periods ended November 2, 2024 and October 28, 2023. The adjusted effective tax rate is calculated by dividing adjusted income tax expense by adjusted earnings before income taxes for the same trailing twelve-month periods. 
 4 For leases with property incentives that exceed the ROU assets, we reclassify the amount from assets to other current liabilities and other liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The current and noncurrent amounts are used to reduce average total assets above, as this better reflects how we manage our business.

 LIQUIDITY 
 We strive to maintain a level of liquidity sufficient to allow us to cover our seasonal cash needs and appropriate levels of short-term borrowing capacity. In the short term, our ongoing working capital and capital expenditure requirements, and any dividend payments or share repurchases, are generally funded through cash flows generated from operations. In addition, we have access to the commercial paper market and can draw on our Revolver for working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes. Over the long term, we manage our cash and capital structure to maximize shareholder return, maintain our financial position, manage refinancing risk and allow flexibility for strategic initiatives. We regularly assess our debt and leverage levels, capital expenditure requirements, debt service payments, dividend payouts, share repurchases and other future investments. 
 We ended the third quarter of 2024 with 397 in cash and cash equivalents and 772 of additional liquidity available on our Revolver. Cash and cash equivalents as of November 2, 2024 increased 22 from 375 as of October 28, 2023, driven primarily by cash flows from earnings, partially offset by payments for capital expenditures and principal payments on long-term debt. 
 During the first quarter of 2024, we retired our 2.30 senior notes that were due in April 2024 using cash on hand. We believe that our cash flows from operations are sufficient to meet our cash requirements for the next 12 months and beyond. Our cash requirements are subject to change as business conditions warrant and opportunities arise, and we may elect to raise additional funds in the future through the issuance of either debt or equity. 
 The following is a summary of our cash flows by activity: 
 Nine Months Ended November 2, 2024 October 28, 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 371 107 Net cash used in investing activities (294) (376) Net cash used in financing activities (308) (43) 
 Operating Activities 
 Net cash provided by operating activities increased 264 for t he nine months ended November 2, 2024, compared with the same period in 2023, primarily due to changes in working capital driven by payroll timing and the tax benefits a ssociated with the Canada wind-down in 2023 . 
 Investing Activities 
 Net cash used in investing activities decreased 82 for the nine months ended November 2, 2024, compared with the same period in 2023, primarily due to decreased capital expenditures related to technology and cost efficiencies for Nordstrom Rack store openings, as well as the decrease in cash and cash equivalents resulting from the deconsolidation of Canada in 2023 (see Note 1: Basis of Presentation in Item 1). 
 Capital Expenditures 
 Our capital expenditures, net are summarized as follows: 
 Nine Months Ended November 2, 2024 October 28, 2023 Capital expenditures 321 375 Deferred property incentives 1 
 (7) (25) Capital expenditures, net 314 350 Capital expenditures as a of net sales 3.1 3.8 
 1 Deferred property incentives are included in our net cash provided by operating activities in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in Item 1. We operationally view the property incentives we receive from our developers and vendors as an offset to our capital expenditures. 
 Financing Activities 
 Net cash used in financing activities increased 265 for the nine months ended November 2, 2024, compared with the same period in 2023, primarily due to the retirement of our 2.30 senior notes due April 2024 using cash on hand (s ee Note 3: Debt and Credit Facilities in Item 1). 
 Dividends 
 We paid dividends of 93 and 92 for the nine months ended November 2, 2024 and October 28, 2023, or 0.57 per share for each year-to-date period.

 Free Cash Flow (Non-GAAP Financial Measure) 
 Free Cash Flow is one of our key liquidity measures and, when used in conjunction with GAAP measures, we believe it provides investors with a meaningful analysis of our ability to generate cash from our business. 
 Free Cash Flow is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, operating cash flows or other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our method of calculating a non-GAAP financial measure may differ from other companies methods and therefore may not be comparable to those used by other companies. The financial measure calculated under GAAP which is most directly comparable to Free Cash Flow is net cash provided by operating activities. The following is a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to Free Cash Flow: 
 Nine Months Ended November 2, 2024 October 28, 2023 Net cash provided by operating activities 371 107 Capital expenditures (321) (375) Change in cash book overdrafts 28 37 Free Cash Flow 78 231) 
 
 CAPITAL RESOURCES 
 Borrowing Capacity and Activity 
 As of November 2, 2024, we had no outstanding borrowings under the Revolver and a 28 outstanding standby letter of credit resulting in available short-term borrowing capacity of 772. As of November 2, 2024, we had no issuances outstanding under our commercial paper program. For more information about our credit facilities, see Note 3: Debt and Credit Facilities in Item 1. 
 Impact of Credit Ratings and Revolver Covenants 
 Changes in our credit ratings may impact our costs to borrow and whether our personal property secures our Revolver. 
 For our Revolver, the interest rate applicable to any borrowings we may enter into depends upon the type of borrowing incurred plus an applicable margin, which is determined based on our credit ratings. At the time of this report, our credit ratings and outlook were as follows: 
 Credit Ratings Outlook Moody s Ba2 Stable S P Global Ratings BB+ Negative Fitch Ratings BB Stable 
 Should the ratings assigned to our long-term debt improve, the applicable margin associated with any borrowings under the Revolver may decrease, resulting in a lower borrowing cost under this facility. Conversely, should the ratings assigned to our long-term debt worsen, the applicable margin associated with any borrowings under the Revolver may increase, resulting in a higher borrowing cost under this facility. 
 As of November 2, 2024 , we were in compliance with all covenants. We have certain limitations with respect to the payment of dividends and share repurchases under our Revolver agreement. For more information about our Revolver covenants, see Note 3: Debt and Credit Facilities in Item 1.

 Adjusted Debt to EBITDAR (Non-GAAP Financial Measure) 
 Adjusted debt to EBITDAR is one of our key financial metrics and we believe that our debt levels are best analyzed using this measure, as it provides a reflection of our creditworthiness, which could impact our credit ratings and borrowing costs. This metric is calculated in accordance with our Revolver covenant and is a key component in assessing whether our revolving credit facility is secured or unsecured, as well as our ability to make dividend payments and share repurchases. For more information regarding our Revolver, see Note 3: Debt and Credit Facilities in Item 1. 
 Adjusted debt to EBITDAR is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, debt to net earnings, net earnings, debt or other GAAP financial measures. Our method of calculating a non-GAAP financial measure may differ from other companies methods and therefore may not be comparable to those used by other companies. The financial measure calculated under GAAP which is most directly comparable to Adjusted debt to EBITDAR is debt to net earnings. The following shows the components to reconcile the debt to net earnings calculation to Adjusted debt to EBITDAR: 
 November 2, 2024 Debt 2,617 Operating lease liabilities 1,694 Adjusted debt 4,311 Four Quarters Ended November 2, 2024 Net earnings 263 Income tax expense 99 Interest expense, net 105 Earnings before interest and income taxes 467 Depreciation and amortization expenses 607 Operating Lease Cost 292 Amortization of developer reimbursements 1 
 62 Other Revolver covenant adjustments 2 
 138 Adjusted EBITDAR 1,566 Debt to Net Earnings 10.0 Adjusted debt to EBITDAR 2.8 
 1 Amortization of developer reimbursements is a non-cash reduction of Operating Lease Cost and is therefore added back to Operating Lease Cost for purposes of our Revolver covenant calculation. 
 2 Other adjusting items to reconcile net earnings to Adjusted EBITDAR as defined by our Revolver covenant include interest income, certain non-cash charges and other gains and losses where relevant. For the four quarters ended November 2, 2024, other Revolver covenant adjustments primarily included supply chain impairment charges, interest income and accelerated technology depreciation. See the Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBITDA section, as well as our 2023 Annual Report, for detailed information on certain non-operating related adjustments.

 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
 The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires that we make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. 
 We base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. We believe that the estimates, assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies referred to in our 2023 Annual Report have the greatest potential effect on our financial statements, so we consider those to be our critical accounting policies and estimates. Our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Finance Committee of our Board of Directors. There have been no material changes to our significant accounting policies or critical accounting estimates as described in our 2023 Annual Report, except as noted below. 
 Merchandise Inventories 
 Merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the weighted average cost method. Under this method, the weighted average purchase price is calculated and applied to owned inventory units. We record reserves for excess and obsolete inventory based on specific identification of units with a current retail value below cost, plus an estimate of future markdowns below cost, which considers the age of inventory and historical trends. 
 We take physical inventory counts at our stores and Supply Chain Network locations and adjust for differences between recorded and counted amounts. Following each physical inventory cycle and using the most recent physical inventory count and historical results, we record an estimate for shrink as a percentage of weighted average cost until the next physical inventory count. 
 
 RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 
 In March 2024, the SEC adopted the final rule under SEC Release No. 33-11275, The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures for Investors, which requires new disclosures regarding information about a registrant s climate-related risks that have materially impacted, or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on, its business strategy, results of operations or financial condition. In addition, certain disclosures related to severe weather events and other natural conditions will also be required in a registrant s audited financial statements. In April 2024, the SEC voluntarily stayed the final rules as a result of pending legal challenges. Annual disclosure requirements will be effective for us in the fourth quarter of 2025, pending resolution of the stay. We are evaluating the impact of this final rule on our disclosures. 
 
 Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 We discussed our interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange risk in our 2023 Annual Report . There have been no material changes to these risks since that time.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 For the purposes of the Exchange Act, our Chief Executive Officer, Erik B. Nordstrom, serves as our principal executive officer and our Chief Financial Officer, Catherine R. Smith, is our principal financial officer and principal accounting officer. 
 Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we have performed an evaluation of the design and effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the last day of the period covered by this report. 
 Based upon that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. Disclosure controls and procedures are defined by Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act as controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified within the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
 CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
 
 PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
 We are subject from time to time to various claims and lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of business, including lawsuits alleging violations of state and/or federal wage and hour and other employment laws, privacy and other consumer-based claims. Some of these lawsuits may include certified classes of litigants, or purport or may be determined to be class or collective actions and seek substantial damages or injunctive relief, or both, and some may remain unresolved for several years. We believe the recorded accruals in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are adequate in light of the probable and estimable liabilities. 
 On March 2, 2023, Nordstrom Canada commenced a wind-down of its business operations pursuant to a CCAA proceeding overseen by the Ontario Superior Court of Justice. See Note 1: Basis of Presentation in Part I for more information. 
 As of the date of this report, we do not believe any other currently identified claim, proceeding or litigation, either alone or in the aggregate, will have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Since these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties, our view of them may change in the future. 
 
 Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 There have been no material changes to the Risk Factors described in our 2023 Annual Report , as supplemented by our Quarterly Report on F orm 10-Q filed with the SEC on September 5, 2024.

Additionally, prior to the Conversion Date, Bank may assume the performance of certain of the features, functionality and technology set forth in Schedule B , and where so assumed by Bank, such assumed Functions shall be Bank s responsibility under the Agreement as to the Accounts for which Bank has so assumed performance. 
 (b) Company and Bank shall cooperate to develop a system for securely transmitting data and reports to each other in connection with preparing for and executing the Conversion and for supporting the Program thereafter, in each case, in accordance with the requirements of Applicable Law, provided that where possible, the parties shall exchange data through an application programming interface, webhooks or similar interfaces that are mutually agreed and where the parties agree that such interfaces are not practical, the parties shall exchange batch data. The party hosting the data shall make the application programming interface or other interface available to the other party and shall be responsible for the costs thereof, and the other party shall be responsible for costs to connect to such application programming interface or other interface. 
 (c) The Conversion Committee will oversee the development of a Conversion contingency playbook that will summarize issues that could be expected to arise as a result of the Conversion, preliminary plans for addressing such issues, and roles and responsibilities of each party in implementing such plans. Such playbook shall include the processes and procedures through which Bank may request, and Company will provide, access to any Account Documentation (and similar documentation with respect to Debit Accounts) and other Program-related data that was not transferred to Bank in connection with the Conversion. 
 (d) Prior to the Conversion Date, Bank shall provide to Company a response to Company s information security questionnaire regarding the technology control structure of Bank to the extent related to the Program. 
 (e) As part of the Conversion related efforts contemplated by this Conversion Amendment, the parties shall develop a Schedule to be attached to the A&R Agreement that will set forth those reports to be generated by each party for delivery to the other party, in accordance with the requirements set forth with respect to such Schedule in the A&R Agreement.
