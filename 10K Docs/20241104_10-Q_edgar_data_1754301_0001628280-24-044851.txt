 The Company utilizes both the market and income approach valuation techniques for its Level 3 fair value measures. Inputs to such measures could include observable market data obtained from independent sources such as broker quotes and recent market transactions for similar assets. It is the Company s policy to maximize the use of observable inputs in the measurement of its Level 3 fair value measurements. To the extent observable inputs are not available, the Company utilizes unobservable inputs based upon the assumptions market participants would use in valuing the redeemable noncontrolling interests. Examples of utilized unobservable inputs are future cash flows and long-term growth rates.

 billion and billion, respectively. The increase from June 30, 2024 was primarily due to sports programming rights. 
 Contingencies 
 The Company establishes an accrued liability for legal claims and indemnification claims when the Company determines that a loss is both probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Once established, accruals are adjusted from time to time, as appropriate, in light of additional information. The amount of any loss ultimately incurred in relation to matters for which an accrual has been established may be higher or lower than the amounts accrued for such matters. Any fees, expenses, fines, penalties, judgments or settlements which might be incurred by the Company in connection with the various proceedings could affect the Company s results of operations and financial condition. For the contingencies disclosed below for which there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred, other than the accrual provided, the Company was unable to estimate the amount of loss or range of loss. 
 FOX News 
 The Company s FOX News business and certain of its current and former employees have been subject to allegations of sexual harassment and discrimination on the basis of sex and race. The Company has resolved many of these claims and is contesting other claims in litigation. The Company has also received regulatory and investigative inquiries relating to these matters. To date, none of the amounts paid in settlements or reserved for pending or future claims is material, individually or in the aggregate, to the Company. The amount of additional liability, if any, that may result from these or related matters cannot be estimated at this time. However, the Company does not currently anticipate that the ultimate resolution of any such pending matters will have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
 U.K. Newspaper Matters Indemnity 
 In connection with the separation of 21CF and News Corporation in June 2013 (the 21CF News Corporation Separation ), 21CF agreed to indemnify News Corporation, on an after-tax basis, for payments made after the 21CF News Corporation Separation arising out of civil claims and investigations relating to phone hacking, illegal data access and inappropriate payments to public officials that occurred at subsidiaries of News Corporation before the 21CF News Corporation Separation, as well as legal and professional fees and expenses paid in connection with the related criminal matters, other than fees, expenses and costs relating to employees who are not (i) directors, officers or certain designated employees or (ii) with respect to civil matters, co-defendants with News Corporation (the U.K. Newspaper Matters Indemnity ). In accordance with the Separation Agreement (as defined in Note 1 Description of Business and Basis of Presentation in the 2024 Form 10-K under the heading The Transaction ), the Company assumed certain costs and liabilities related to the U.K. Newspaper Matters Indemnity. The liability recorded in the Balance Sheets related to the indemnity was approximately million as of June 30, 2024 and approximately million as of September 30, 2024. 
 Defamation and Disparagement Claims 
 From time to time, the Company and its news businesses, including FOX News Media and the FOX Television Stations, and their employees are subject to lawsuits alleging defamation or disparagement. These include lawsuits filed by Smartmatic USA Corp. and certain of its affiliates (collectively, Smartmatic in February 2021 seeking billion in damages and Dominion Voting Systems, Inc. and certain of its affiliates (collectively, Dominion in March 2021 seeking billion in damages. On March 31, 2023, the court in the Dominion case issued its rulings on summary judgment motions that were unfavorable to the Company. Following these rulings, on April 18, 2023, the Company and its subsidiary, Fox News Network, LLC, entered 
 11 

FOX CORPORATION 
 NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

 million to settle this and a related lawsuit in April 2023. 
 The Company continues to believe the Smartmatic and other pending lawsuits alleging defamation or disparagement are without merit and intends to defend against them vigorously, including through any appeals. The Smartmatic case has been stayed by operation of New York law due to the death of Lou Dobbs. At this time, a trial in the Smartmatic lawsuit is not expected to commence until 2025. The Company is unable to predict the final outcome of these matters and has determined that a loss in the Smartmatic case is neither probable nor reasonably estimable. There can be no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these pending matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
 On April 11, 2023 and April 20, 2023, stockholders of the Company filed derivative lawsuits in the Delaware Court of Chancery (the Chancery Court against certain directors of the Company, which the Chancery Court subsequently consolidated into one matter captioned In re Fox Corporation Deriv. Litig., C.A. No. 2023-0418 (Del.Ch.) . additional derivative lawsuits were subsequently filed by the Company s stockholders in the Chancery Court on September 12, 2023 against certain directors and officers of the Company and are part of the consolidated lawsuit. Each of the lawsuits names the Company as a nominal defendant. On April 26, 2024, the lead plaintiffs filed an amended complaint that alleges that certain directors and officers, as applicable, breached their fiduciary duties by allowing the Company s news channel to air allegations regarding election fraud in connection with the 2020 U.S. Presidential election, which resulted in significant defamation litigation. The amended complaint seeks orders awarding damages in favor of the Company; directing the Company to reform and improve its policies and procedures; and awarding the plaintiffs attorneys' fees and costs. On June 25, 2024, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint, and a hearing on the motion is scheduled for November 2024. The Company intends to vigorously contest the lawsuit. 
 Actions and Claims Arising from Alleged Misuse of Personal Information 
 The Company and its subsidiaries, including Tubi, Inc. Tubi ), are from time to time parties to actions and arbitration claims arising from their alleged misuse of personal information. In June 2023, a putative class action lawsuit titled Campos v. Tubi was filed with the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division (the District Court ), alleging that Tubi shared viewer information with third parties in violation of the privacy protection provisions of the federal Video Privacy Protection Act. In February 2024, the District Court denied Tubi s motion to compel arbitration and motion to dismiss, and Tubi appealed those rulings to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. Following a determination that Campos lacked standing to sue Tubi, plaintiff s counsel filed a new putative class action titled Gregory v. Tubi with the 17th Judicial Circuit Court in Winnebago County, Illinois (the Illinois State Court ). On July 26, 2024 the parties entered into a Settlement and Release Agreement to resolve all claims, which includes the dismissal of the Campos lawsuit and settlement of the Gregory lawsuit. The Company is unable to predict the final outcome of this matter until the Illinois State Court has approved the Settlement and Release Agreement, but has established an accrued liability for the settlement amount. If approved, the settlement will not have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. The Company intends to vigorously defend against any other actions and arbitration claims arising from the alleged misuse of personal information that have not been settled or resolved by the Gregory settlement. The Company is unable to predict the final outcome of these other actions and arbitration claims and has determined that a loss in these matters is neither probable nor reasonably estimable. There can be no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
 Other 
 The Company s operations are subject to tax primarily in various domestic jurisdictions and as a matter of course, the Company is regularly audited by federal and state tax authorities. The Company believes it has appropriately accrued for the expected outcome of all pending tax matters and does not currently anticipate that

 Cable Network Programming , which produces and licenses news and sports content distributed through traditional cable television systems, direct broadcast satellite operators and telecommunication companies, virtual multi-channel video programming distributors and other digital platforms, primarily in the U.S. 
 Television , which produces, acquires, markets and distributes programming through the FOX broadcast network, advertising supported video-on-demand service Tubi, full power broadcast television stations, including duopolies, and other digital platforms, primarily in the U.S. of the broadcast television stations are affiliated with the FOX Network, are affiliated with MyNetworkTV and is an independent station. The segment also includes various production companies that produce content for the Company and third parties. 
 The Credible and the FOX Studio Lot operating segments do not meet the criteria under GAAP to be separately reported as a reportable segment or aggregated with other operating segments, and as such are presented as part of Corporate and Other, which is not a reportable segment. Corporate and Other principally consists of Credible, the FOX Studio Lot and corporate overhead costs. Credible is a U.S. consumer finance marketplace. The FOX Studio Lot, located in Los Angeles, California, provides television and film production services along with office space, studio operation services and includes all operations of the facility. 
 The Company s operating segments have been determined in accordance with the Company s internal management structure, which is organized based on operating activities. The Company evaluates performance based upon several factors, of which the primary financial measure is segment operating income before depreciation and amortization, or Segment EBITDA. Due to the integrated nature of these operating segments, estimates and judgments are made in allocating certain assets, revenues and expenses. 
 Segment EBITDA is defined as Revenues less Operating expenses and Selling, general and administrative expenses. Segment EBITDA does not include: Amortization of cable distribution investments, Depreciation and amortization, Restructuring, impairment and other corporate matters, Equity earnings (losses) of affiliates, Interest expense, net, Non-operating other, net and Income tax expense.

 OVERVIEW OF THE COMPANY S BUSINESS 
 The Company is a news, sports and entertainment company, which manages and reports its businesses in four operating segments: Cable Network Programming, Television, Credible and the FOX Studio Lot with the following two reportable segments: 
 Cable Network Programming , which produces and licenses news and sports content distributed through traditional cable television systems, direct broadcast satellite operators and telecommunication companies traditional MVPDs ), virtual multi-channel video programming distributors virtual MVPDs and other digital platforms, primarily in the U.S. 
 Television , which produces, acquires, markets and distributes programming through the FOX broadcast network, advertising-supported video-on-demand AVOD service Tubi, 29 full power broadcast television stations, including 11 duopolies, and other digital platforms, primarily in the U.S. Eighteen of the broadcast television stations are affiliated with the FOX Network, 10 are affiliated with MyNetworkTV and one is an independent station. The segment also includes various production companies that produce content for the Company and third parties. 
 The Credible and the FOX Studio Lot operating segments do not meet the criteria under GAAP to be separately reported as a reportable segment or aggregated with other operating segments, and as such are presented as part of Corporate and Other, which is not a reportable segment. Corporate and Other principally consists of Credible, the FOX Studio Lot and corporate overhead costs. Credible is a U.S. consumer finance 
 19 

marketplace. The FOX Studio Lot, located in Los Angeles, California, provides television and film production services along with office space, studio operation services and includes all operations of the facility. 
 We use the term "MVPDs" to refer collectively to traditional MVPDs and virtual MVPDs.

 Overview 
 The Company s revenues increased 357 million or 11 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2024, due to higher affiliate fee, advertising and other revenues. The increase of 103 million or 6 in affiliate fee revenue was primarily due to the impact of higher average rates per subscriber and higher fees received from television stations that are affiliated with the FOX Network of approximately 210 million, partially offset by the approximately 110 million impact of a lower average number of subscribers across almost all networks. The increase of 129 million or 11 in advertising revenue was primarily due to the approximately 120 million impact of higher political advertising revenue due to the 2024 presidential and congressional elections at the FOX Television Stations and continued growth at Tubi. The increase of 125 million or 47 in other revenues was primarily due to higher sports sublicensing revenue at the national sports networks. 
 Operating expenses increased 156 million or 8 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2024, primarily due to the approximately 100 million impact of higher sports programming rights amortization driven by higher college football costs at the national sports networks, higher National Football League NFL costs, led by the timing of NFL games, and the mix of fiscal 
 20 

2024 and 2025 broadcasts of soccer tournaments. The remaining increase of 56 million was principally due to continued growth at Tubi and higher newsgathering costs due to the 2024 presidential election. 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 22 million or 5 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2024, primarily due to higher legal costs at FOX News Media and higher employee costs at Tubi. 
 Restructuring, impairment and other corporate matters See Note 11 Additional Financial Information to the accompanying Financial Statements under the heading Restructuring, Impairment and Other Corporate Matters. 
 Interest expense, net Interest expense, net increased 8 million or 19 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2024, due to higher weighted-average interest rates on senior notes (See Note 9 Borrowings in the 2024 Form 10-K under the headings Public Debt Senior Notes Issued ). 
 Non-operating other, net See Note 11 Additional Financial Information to the accompanying Financial Statements under the heading Non-Operating Other, net. 
 Income tax expense The Company s tax provision and related effective tax rate of 25 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was higher than the statutory rate of 21 primarily due to state taxes. 
 The Company's tax provision and related effective tax rate of 26 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was higher than the statutory rate of 21 primarily due to state taxes and other permanent items . 
 Net income Net income increased 417 million for three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2024, primarily due to an unrealized gain recognized on the change in fair value of the Company s investment in Flutter Entertainment plc and higher Segment EBITDA (as defined below), partially offset by higher provision for income tax. 
 Segment Analysis 
 The Company s operating segments have been determined in accordance with the Company s internal management structure, which is organized based on operating activities. The Company evaluates performance based upon several factors, of which the primary financial measure is segment operating income before depreciation and amortization, or Segment EBITDA. Due to the integrated nature of these operating segments, estimates and judgments are made in allocating certain assets, revenues and expenses. 
 Segment EBITDA is defined as Revenues less Operating expenses and Selling, general and administrative expenses. Segment EBITDA does not include: Amortization of cable distribution investments, Depreciation and amortization, Restructuring, impairment and other corporate matters, Interest expense, net, Non-operating other, net and Income tax expense. Management believes that Segment EBITDA is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operating performance of the Company s business segments because it is the primary measure used by the Company s chief operating decision maker to evaluate the performance of and allocate resources to the Company s businesses.

The following tables set forth the Company s Revenues and Segment EBITDA for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023:

 Revenues at the Cable Network Programming segment increased 210 million or 15 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2024, due to higher affiliate fee, advertising and other revenues. Affiliate fee revenue increased 32 million or 3 as higher average 
 22 

rates per subscriber were partially offset by a decrease in the average number of subscribers. The increase of 31 million or 11 in advertising revenue was primarily due to higher ratings, higher pricing in the direct response marketplace and higher digital advertising revenue partially offset by higher preemptions associated with breaking news coverage at FOX News Media. The increase of 147 million in other revenues was primarily due to higher sports sublicensing revenue at the national sports networks. 
 Cable Network Programming Segment EBITDA increased 141 million or 23 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2024, primarily due to the revenue increases noted above, partially offset by higher expenses. Operating expenses increased 53 million or 8 primarily due to higher sports programming rights amortization driven by higher college football costs partially offset by the absence of the F d ration International de Football Association FIFA Women s World Cup at the national sports networks in the current year. Also contributing to this increase was higher newsgathering costs at FOX News Media due to the 2024 presidential election and breaking news coverage. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 16 million or 12 primarily due to higher legal costs at FOX News Media. 
 Television (55 and 56 of the Company s revenues for the first three months of fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively) 
 For the three months ended September 30, 
 2024 2023 Change Change (in millions, except Better/(Worse) Revenues Advertising 1,008 910 98 11 Affiliate fee 806 735 71 10 Other 139 135 4 3 Total revenues 1,953 1,780 173 10 Operating expenses (1,333) (1,198) (135) (11) Selling, general and administrative (248) (231) (17) (7) Segment EBITDA 372 351 21 6 
 Revenues at the Television segment increased 173 million or 10 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2024, due to higher advertising, affiliate fee and other revenues. The increase of 98 million or 11 in advertising revenue was primarily due to higher political advertising revenue at the FOX Television Stations due to the 2024 presidential and congressional elections and continued growth at Tubi. Also contributing to this increase was timing of NFL games, higher NFL ratings and the broadcasts of the Union of European Football Associations UEFA European Championship and CONMEBOL Copa Am rica, partially offset by the absence of the FIFA Women s World Cup in the current year. The increase of 71 million or 10 in affiliate fee revenue was primarily due to higher average rates per subscriber partially offset by a lower average number of subscribers at the Company s owned and operated television stations and higher fees received from television stations that are affiliated with the FOX Network. The increase of 4 million or 3 in other revenues was primarily due to higher third-party content revenue at FOX Entertainment studios. 
 Television Segment EBITDA increased 21 million or 6 for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2024, due to the revenue increases noted above, partially offset by higher expenses. Operating expenses increased 135 million or 11 primarily due to higher sports programming rights amortization principally due to higher NFL costs, led by the timing of games, and the broadcast of the UEFA European Championship partially offset by the absence of the FIFA Women s World Cup in the current year and continued growth at Tubi.

 Revenues within Corporate and Other for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 include revenues generated by Credible and the operation of the FOX Studio Lot. Operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 include advertising and promotional expenses at Credible. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 primarily relate to employee costs, professional fees and the costs of operating the FOX Studio lot. 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 Adjusted EBITDA is defined as Revenues less Operating expenses and Selling, general and administrative expenses. Adjusted EBITDA does not include: Amortization of cable distribution investments, Depreciation and amortization, Restructuring, impairment and other corporate matters, Interest expense, net, Non-operating other, net and Income tax expense. 
 Management believes that information about Adjusted EBITDA assists all users of the Company s Financial Statements by allowing them to evaluate changes in the operating results of the Company s portfolio of businesses separate from non-operational factors that affect Net income, thus providing insight into both operations and the other factors that affect reported results. Adjusted EBITDA provides management, investors and equity analysts a measure to analyze the operating performance of the Company s business and its enterprise value against historical data and competitors data, although historical results, including Adjusted EBITDA, may not be indicative of future results (as operating performance is highly contingent on many factors, including customer tastes and preferences). 
 Adjusted EBITDA is considered a non-GAAP financial measure and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, net income, cash flow and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles GAAP ). In addition, this measure does not reflect cash available to fund requirements and excludes items, such as depreciation and amortization and impairment charges, which are significant components in assessing the Company s financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

The following table reconciles Net income to Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended September 30, 2024, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023:
