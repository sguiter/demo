behalf. We do not undertake to update any forward-looking statements to reflect actual results, changes in assumptions or changes in
other factors affecting such statements, except as, and to the extent required by, applicable securities laws.

The
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all the information and footnotes required by the U.S. GAAP for
complete financial statements. Certain information and note disclosures normally included in the annual financial statements
prepared in accordance with the U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted in accordance with
SEC rules and regulations . In the opinion of the Company s management, the unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements have been prepared on the same basis as the audited financial statements and include all adjustments, in normal recurring
nature, as necessary for the fair statement of the Company s financial position as of September 30, 2024, and results of
operations and cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet
as of December 31, 2023 has been derived from the audited financial statements at that date but does not include all the information
and footnotes required by the U.S. GAAP. Interim results of operations are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for
the full fiscal year or for any future period. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited
consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, and related notes included in the
Company s audited consolidated financial statements included and filed in registration statements on S-1.

The
Company also re-evaluates the periods of depreciation to determine whether subsequent events and circumstances warrant revised estimates
of useful lives. 

impairment of long-lived assets was recognized. 

Any
lease with a term of 12 months or less is considered short-term. As permitted by ASC 842, short-term leases are excluded from the ROU
assets and lease liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Consistent with all other operating leases, short-term lease expense
is recorded on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 

The
Company determines the present value of minimum future lease payments for operating leases by estimating a rate of interest that it would
have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term, an amount equal to the lease payments and a similar economic environment
(the incremental borrowing rate or IBR ).The Company determines the appropriate IBR by identifying a reference
rate and making adjustments that take into consideration financing options and certain lease-specific circumstances. 

In
addition, the Company defers certain costs to fulfill the Company s contracts with customers to the extent such costs relate directly
to the contracts, are expected to generate resources that will be used to satisfy the Company s performance obligations under the
contracts, and are expected to be recovered through revenue generated under the contracts. Contract fulfillment costs are incurred as
the Company satisfies the related performance obligations. 

Revenue
from golf operations 

There
are two types of service charges maintained by the Company, the players can either (1) subscribe to the entertainment services for
a period of time of one year at a discount (i.e. annual subscription green fees); or (2) purchase the services at the counter by one-time
payment (i.e. one-time green fees). The golf courses are open to public and hence our customers include both local and overseas citizens.
The charges comprise of both the cart fee and fees for playing in the golf course, which is fixed without variable consideration, and
the customers either pay via cash or credit card. The entire service fee from customers is non-refundable and required to be paid in
advance. 

The
Company sells annual green fee subscriptions to local patrons. The performance obligation of the annual subscription is for the Company
to provide a patron with access to the golf course and cart, subject to availability of a tee time for a patron to play a single round
on the 18-hole course; the round of golf is expected to be completed before sunset of the day of the booking of that tee time. The Company
recognizes revenue from these annual subscriptions on a monthly basis over twelve months. The annual subscriptions are non-refundable.
Payments for subscriptions in the form of cash or credit card are received in advance, and are recorded as contract liabilities-deferred
revenue, and recognized to revenue at the end of each month. Management believes that the services provided each month are substantially
similar and result in the transfer of substantially similar services to the customers each month. That is, the benefit consumed by the
customers is substantially similar for each month, even though the exact volume of services may vary. The Company concludes that the
annual green fees subscription satisfies the requirements of ASC 606-10-25-14(b) to be accounted for as a single performance obligation.
The annual subscriptions fees are fixed and there is no variable consideration, significant financing components or noncash consideration.
There is no contract asset related to these annual green fee subscriptions. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company
recorded contract liabilities - deferred revenue of and , respectively. 

One-time
green fees require the Company to provide to a patron access to a designated 18-hole golf course and cart to play a single round of golf
subject to non-hazardous weather conditions that is expected to be completed before sunset of the day of booking of that tee time. Management
believes access to the golf course and the card constitute a single performance obligation as either service is not available to be purchased
separately. Payments for tee times are non-refundable and are received via cash or credit card immediately prior to the initiation of
the patron playing the round of 18-hole golf; therefore, and one-time green fees are not refundable. Typically, in the event that weather
is not expected to permit the patron to play and complete the single round of golf, the Company will not undertake the transaction and
take payment from the patron. The one-time green fees are fixed and there is no variable consideration. 

Sales
of merchandise, food and beverage 

Golf
course patrons regularly buy golf balls, clothing, paraphernalia, and gloves, or will enjoy food and beverage offered at the clubhouses.
Patrons make orders at the counter. The price is fixed without variable consideration. The Company recognizes revenue when the merchandise
or food and beverage are delivered, net of discounts, if any and control of the product has been passed to the customer. If the clothing
or wearables have product defects, they are subject to exchange, but all sales are final and not subject to return. Product delivery
is evidenced by a payment receipt record. Payments are settled via cash or credit card. The respective revenue is recognized at a point
in time. There are no warranties, sales returns and refunds after the orders are delivered to the customers at the counter. 

Ancillary
revenue 

Ancillary
revenue represented the lease of its clubhouse for several hours for events held by associations or individuals such as golf tournaments
and lease of golf club to individuals for one day playing golf in the Company s golf course. The revenue was recognized upon services
were rendered (i.e. on daily basis when the venue or golf club was used that day). Deposit was received in advance for booking of clubhouse
and recognized as contract liabilities deferred income upon receipt and recognized as revenue in the statements of income when
service was rendered or no show after booking. Deposit received is non-refundable. 

In
November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. 
The amendments in this ASU are intended to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements primarily through enhanced disclosures
about significant segment expenses. This ASU requires disclosure of significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief
operating decision mark (CODM), an amount for other segment items by reportable segment and a description of its composition, all annual
disclosures required by FASB ASU Topic 280 in interim periods as well, and the title and position of the CODM and how the CODM uses the
reported measures. Additionally, this ASU requires that at least one of the reported segment profit and loss measures should be the measure
that is most consistent with the measurement principles used in an entity s consolidated financial statements. Lastly, this ASU
requires public business entities with a single reportable segment to provide all disclosures required by these amendments in this ASU
and all existing segment disclosures in Topic 280. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim
periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments should be applied retrospectively.
We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of ASU 2023-06 will have on its unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
and related disclosures. 

In
December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income taxes (Topic 740), Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which provides guidance
on the requirements such as the requirement that public business entities on an annual basis (1) disclose specific categories in the
rate reconciliation and (2) provide additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold. For public business
entities (PBEs), the new requirements will be effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. For entities other than
public business entities (non-PBEs), the requirements will be effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2025. Early adoption
is permitted for annual financial statements that have not yet been issued or made available for issuance. The ASU should be applied
prospectively. Retrospective application is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of ASU 2023-09 will have on
its unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 

Except
as mentioned above, the Company does not believe other recently issued but not yet effective accounting standards, if currently adopted,
would have a material effect on the unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets, statements of income and comprehensive income and
statements of cash flows.

Interest
rate risk 

Interest
rate risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market
interest rates. The Company is not exposed to interest rate risk as its financial liabilities carry interest at fixed rates. 

Liquidity
risk 

Liquidity
risk is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities that
are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The Company s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as
possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions,
without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Company s reputation. 

Typically,
the Company ensures that it has sufficient cash on demand to meet expected operational expenses for a period of twelve months, including
through operations and financial support from our stockholders and financial institutions. We are continuing to focus on improving operational
efficiency and cost reductions and enhancing efficiency, as well as servicing of financial obligations: this excludes the potential impact
of extreme circumstances that cannot reasonably be predicted, such as natural disasters. Our ability to continue as a going concern is
dependent upon obtaining the necessary financing or negotiating the terms of the existing short-term liabilities to meet our current
and future liquidity needs. 

Our commitments for
minimum lease payment under these operating leases as of September 30, 2024 are listed in section Note 8 Leases . 

Litigation 

From
time to time, we are involved in claims and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. Based on currently available
information, we do not believe that the ultimate outcome of any unresolved matters, individually and in the aggregate, is reasonably
possible to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, litigation is subject
to inherent uncertainties and our view of these matters may change in the future. We record a liability when it is both probable that
a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. We review the need for any such liabilities on
a regular basis.

ITEM
 2. 
 MANAGEMENT S
 DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Introductory
Note 

Except
as otherwise indicated by the context, references in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this Form 10-Q to the Company, 
 we, us or our are references to the combined business Aureus Greenway Holdings Inc. and its
subsidiaries. The following Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations MD A summarizes the significant factors affecting our results of operations, liquidity, capital resources and contractual obligations. The
following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
and related notes included elsewhere herein. 

General
Overview of Operations 

We
own and operate two public golf country clubs in Florida that we acquired in 2014. Our golf country clubs include two golf-courses with
over 13,000 yards of combined fairways, clubhouses boasting food and beverage options, aquatic golf ranges, and pro shops to assist any
level of golfers. Our two golf country clubs are situated on over 289 acres of multi-service recreational property. 

Each
of our golf country clubs is organized into four revenue streams: (i) golf operations, (ii) sales of food and beverage; (iii) sales of
merchandise; and (iv) ancillary income. 

Management s
Plans 

Over
the next twelve months, we plan to continue to promote, market, manage and operate our golf country clubs with the intent to (i) attract
and retain customers across a number of demographic groups to further develop customer loyalty and capture a greater share of customers
in the greater Orlando Florida region and (ii) increase revenue from managing and operating our golf country clubs. 

We
believe attracting and retaining customers while increasing customer engagement and loyalty by providing what we believe to be a high
quality golfing experience will drive our revenue. Drivers of our revenue growth will require further steps to maintain and build on
quality experiences at our golf country clubs. To achieve the foregoing, we intend to focus on: 

Renovating
 and modernizing our golf country clubs to promote more enjoyable use of our facilities; 

Retaining
 new regional customers from the growth of the surrounding greater Orlando Florida region through marketing efforts; and 

Expanding
 our portfolio through regional country club acquisitions. 

Key
Factors Affecting our Results of Operations 

a. 
 Seasonality
 and weather 

Our
businesses are subject to seasonality and typically the first quarter of each year is our busiest season of the year. Then, even during
our busy season, our business activities are affected by weather conditions. In 2023, we believe that we experienced very few rainy days
during the first quarter making almost every day of the busiest season a suitable day for playing golf. 

b. 
 Cost
 of maintenance due to inflation 

Our
maintenance contract with our major vendor, SSS Down to Earth, LLC DTE an independently contracted country club consultancy
and golf maintenance company, was only renewed in 2022 and the renewed contractual price did not fully reflect the inflationary environment
that subsequently impacted the labor, fertilizer and chemical markets. In order to maintain our golf courses at a quality level that
is consistent with our price points, after thorough discussions with the management of DTE, we had agreed to increase our contract price
with DTE by a total of 200,000 starting in October 2023. This increase did not fully impact our cost basis in 2023 but will be in 2024.
The maintenance cost and contract with DTE may be subject to further increases in 2024 if the inflationary environment continues to impact
our maintenance needs. 

Basis of Presentation 

The interim financial statements have been prepared
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America U.S. GAAP ). The interim financial
statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. A subsidiary is an entity (including a structured entity),
directly or indirectly, controlled by the Company. The financial statements of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting period
as the Company, using consistent accounting policies. All significant inter-company transactions and balances between members of the Group
are eliminated upon consolidation. 

Critical Accounting Policies, Judgments and
Estimates 

We have identified certain accounting policies that are significant to
the preparation of our Group s financial information. Some of our accounting policies involve subjective assumptions and estimates,
as well as complex judgements relating to accounting items. In each case, the determination of these items requires management judgements
based on information and financial data that may change in future periods. When reviewing our financial statements, you should consider:
(i) our selection of accounting policies; and (ii) the results to changes in conditions and assumptions. We set forth below those accounting
policies that we believe are of critical importance to us or involve the most significant estimates and judgements used in the preparation
of our Group s financial statements.

Comparison
for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 

Our
revenue is mainly comprised of golf operations, sales of food and beverage and sales of merchandise. Overall decrease in revenue period
over period by 313,865 or 11 was mainly due to the decrease in one-time green fees from golf operations and the associated sales of
food and beverage and merchandise. 

Revenue
from golf operations decreased by 273,211 or 12 from 2,247,862 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 1,974,651 for the
nine months ended September 30, 2024, which was mainly driven by the decrease in one-time green fees from golf operations by 322,691
or 16 , slightly net off by the increase in annual membership dues by 49,480 or 27 . 

Revenue
from annual membership dues slightly increased by 49,480 or 27 mainly due to the increase in demand from customers who paid annual
membership dues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

One-time
green fees from golf operations accounted for 66 and 70 of total revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 respectively.
Decrease in one-time greens fees by 16 resulted from the decrease in total number of rounds by approximately 18 from approximately
45,000 rounds during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to approximately 37,000 rounds during the nine months ended September 30,
2024 despite the increase in average price per round by approximately 2 from 46 per round for the nine months ended September 30, 2023
to 47 per round for the nine months ended September 30, 2024. Decrease in number of rounds was mainly due to more rainy days during
the nine months ended September 30, 2024. 

Decrease
in revenue from sales of food and beverage by 30,220 or 6 from 530,012 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 499,792 for
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was contributed by a decrease in quantities sold by 14 from approximately 92,000 pieces of
food and beverage for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to approximately 80,000 pieces of food and beverage for the nine months
ended September 30, 2024 and the average unit price remained stable at 6 per unit for both periods. The decrease in quantities sold
was in line with decrease in golf operations. 

Decrease
in revenue from sales of merchandise by 16,410 or 15 from 107,861 for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 to 91,451 for the
nine months ended September 30, 2024 was contributed by a decrease in sales of golf balls, men s wear and headwear by 16 as a
result of the decrease in customers playing golf during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 which was mainly due to the decrease
in revenue from golf operations as a result of decrease in customers visiting our pro shops. 

Ancillary
revenue mainly represented the equipment and facilities rental, including the lease of our clubhouse and lease of golf club to our customers.
The increase by 5,976 or 9 was mainly due to an increase in demand for rental services for activities and events during the nine months
ended September 30, 2024. 

Comparison
for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 

Our
revenue is mainly comprised of golf operations, sales of food and beverage and sales of merchandise. Overall decrease in revenue period
over period by 2,575 or 1 was mainly due to the decrease in one-time green fees from golf operations and being partially offset by
an increase in annual membership dues by 41,648 or 106 . 

One-time
green fees from golf operations accounted for 49 and 59 of total revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Decrease in one-time green fees by 18 resulted from the decrease in total number of rounds by approximately 12 from approximately 7,000
rounds during the three months ended September 30, 2023 to approximately 6,000 rounds during the three months ended September 30, 2024
and the decrease in average price per round by 7 from approximately 37 per round in average for the three months ended September 30,
2023 to approximately 34 per round in average for the three months ended September 30, 2024 which was in turn attract more customers
to play golf after experiencing more rainy days during the period by offering lower price per round. 

Revenue
from annual membership dues increased by 41,648 or 106 mainly due to the increase in demand from customers who paid annual membership
dues by enjoying a lower price for annual subscriptions for the three months ended September 30, 2024. 

The
revenue from sales of food and beverages remained stable at 107,707 and 108,846 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023,
respectively. 

Decrease
in revenue from sales of merchandise by 4,153 or 21 from 19,780 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 to 15,627 for the three
months ended September 30, 2024 was mainly caused by the decrease in sales of golf balls, men s wear and headwear by 23 as a result
of the decrease in customers playing golf during the three months ended September 30, 2024. 

29 

Ancillary
revenue mainly represented the equipment and facilities rental, including the lease of our clubhouse and lease of golf club to our customers.
The increase by 7,866 or 74 was mainly due to the increase in demand for rental services for activities and events during the three
months ended September 30, 2024.

receivable. 

Vendor
concentration risk 

As
of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company owed 81 , 85 and 84 of accounts payable to a key supplier, respectively. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, one vendor accounted for 32 and 28 of our total operating costs, respectively. No
other vendor accounts for more than 10 of our total operating costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

For
the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, one vendor accounted for 31 and 32 of our total operating costs, respectively. No other
vendor accounts for more than 10 of our total operating costs for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, one vendor accounted for 36 and 28 of our total operating costs, respectively.
No other vendor accounts for more than 10 of our total operating costs for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Interest
rate risk 

Interest
rate risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market
interest rates. The Company is not exposed to interest rate risk as its financial liabilities carry interest at fixed rates. 

Liquidity
risk 

Liquidity
risk is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities that
are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. The Company s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as
possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions,
without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Company s reputation. 

Typically,
the Company ensures that it has sufficient cash on demand to meet expected operational expenses for a period of twelve months, including
through operations and financial support from our stockholders and financial institutions. We are continuing to focus on improving operational
efficiency and cost reductions and enhancing efficiency, as well as servicing of financial obligations: this excludes the potential impact
of extreme circumstances that cannot reasonably be predicted, such as natural disasters. Our ability to continue as a going concern is
dependent upon obtaining the necessary financing or negotiating the terms of the existing short-term liabilities to meet our current
and future liquidity needs. 

Market
Risk 

Market
risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices. Our market risk exposure is generally limited to those
risks that arise in the normal course of business, as we do not engage in speculative, non-operating transactions, nor do we utilize
financial instruments or derivative instruments for trading purposes. 

ITEM
 3. 
 QUANTITATIVE
 AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

As
a smaller reporting company as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act ),
the Company is not required to provide the information required by this item. 

ITEM
 4. 
 CONTROLS
 AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our
management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act at the end of the period covered by this
quarterly report. 

Based
on this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of end of the period covered by this Quarterly
Report, our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in 240.13a-15(e) or 240.15d-15(e) of Regulation S-K) were effective
to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange
Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such
information (i) is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures and (2) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. 

We
recognize that any controls system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving its
objectives, and our management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative
to their costs. 

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the period covered by this Quarterly Report that materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)
under the Exchange Act).

PART
II OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM
 1. 
 LEGAL
 PROCEEDINGS 

The
Company may be involved in various legal proceedings, claims and other disputes arising from the commercial operations, projects, employees
and other matters which, in general, are subject to uncertainties and in which the outcomes are not predictable. The Company determines
whether an estimated loss from a contingency should be accrued by assessing whether a loss is deemed probable and can be reasonably estimated.
Although the outcomes of these legal proceedings cannot be predicted, the Company does not believe these actions, in the aggregate, will
have a material adverse impact on its financial position, results of operations or liquidity. 

As
of the date of this Quarterly Report, we are not currently a party to any pending legal proceedings that we believe will have a material
adverse effect on our business or financial conditions. We may, however, be subject to various claims and legal actions arising in the
ordinary course of business from time to time.
