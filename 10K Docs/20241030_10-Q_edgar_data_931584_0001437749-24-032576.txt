 Weighted average effect of dilutive share-based compensation 
 Diluted weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding 
 
 Net income per common share: 
 Net income per common share - Basic 
 Net income per common share - Diluted 

The weighted average effect of dilutive share-based compensation was determined using the treasury stock method in all periods, and includes shares for the effect of stock options outstanding and shares for the effect of unvested restricted stock outstanding for the three month period ended September 30, 2024 . For the nine month period ended September 30, 2024, the calculation includes shares for the effect of stock options outstanding and shares for the effect of unvested restricted stock outstanding. 
 
 The three month period ended September 30, 2023 included shares for the effect of stock options outstanding and shares for the effect of unvested restricted stock outstanding. The nine month period ended September 30, 2024 included shares for the effect of stock options outstanding and shares for the effect of unvested restricted stock outstanding. 
 
 There were options outstanding to purchase and shares of common stock at a weighted average price of and , respectively, which were excluded from the computation of diluted net income per common share for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. There were options outstanding to purchase shares of common stock at a weighted average price of which were excluded from the computation of diluted net income per common share for the three months ended September 30, 2023. These options were excluded because their exercise prices were greater than the average market price of our common stock during each period. 

million and million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , respectively, and million and million during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 
 
 The timing of revenue recognition, customer billings, and cash collections resulted in contract assets related to services performed and not yet billed of million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively. The Company recorded these contract assets within Accounts Receivable in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at each date. 
 
 We expect to satisfy all performance obligations related to revenue recognized in advance of shipment at September 30, 2024 within the next 12 months. 
 
 The Company has elected the following practical expedients allowed under Accounting Standard Codification ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ("ASC 606" ): 
 
 Shipping of products is not considered a separate performance obligation. 

Performance obligations are satisfied within one year from a given reporting date; consequently, we omit disclosure of the transaction price apportioned to remaining performance obligations on open orders. 

The following summarizes our revenue by melt type:

(A) Premium alloys represent all vacuum induction melted (VIM) products. 

million and million, respectively, and during the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we amortized million and million, respectively. This expense is recorded as a component of cost of products sold in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and included as a part of our total depreciation and amortization on the condensed consolidated statements of cash flow. 
 
 Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value with cost principally determined on a weighted average cost method. Such costs include the acquisition cost for raw materials and supplies, direct labor and applied manufacturing overhead. We assess market based upon actual and estimated transactions at or around the balance sheet date. Typically, we reserve for slow-moving inventory and inventory that is being evaluated under our quality control process. The reserves are based upon management s expected method of disposition. 
 
 Inventory consisted of the following: 

Semi-finished and finished steel products 
 Operating materials 
 
 Gross inventory 
 Inventory reserves 
 
 Total inventory 

months or less, and the leases do not have significant restrictions, covenants, or other nonstandard terms. 
 
 Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recorded at the present value of minimum lease payments. For our operating leases, the assets are included in Other long-term assets on the condensed consolidated balance sheets and are amortized within operating income over the respective lease terms. The long-term component of the lease liability is included in Other long-term liabilities, net, and the current component is included in Other current liabilities. For our finance leases, the assets are included in Property, plant and equipment, net on the condensed consolidated balance sheets and are depreciated as a component of cost of goods sold over the respective lease terms, which range from three to six years. The long-term component of the lease liability is included in Long-term debt and the current component is included in Current portion of long-term debt. 
 
 The Company entered into one new operating lease agreement during the first nine months of 2024 and one new finance lease agreement during the first nine months of 2023. 
 
 As of September 30, 2024 , future minimum lease payments applicable to operating and finance leases were as follows: 

2025 
 2026 
 2027 
 2028 
 Total minimum lease payments 
 Less amounts representing interest 
 Present value of minimum lease payments 
 Less current obligations 
 Total long-term lease obligations, net 
 Weighted-average remaining lease term (in years) 

Right-of-use assets recorded to the condensed consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2024 , net of accumulated amortization, were million for operating leases and million for finance leases. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 , the amortization of finance lease assets was million and million respectively. Right-of-use assets recorded to the condensed consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2023 , net of accumulated amortization, were million for operating leases and million for finance leases. 
 
 The unamortized portion of the million lease component of our VAR expansion financing arrangement is included in the right-of-use asset total, while the sale and leaseback component of that agreement is excluded. The sale and leaseback component is accounted for as a loan secured by the related equipment, as it did not meet the criteria for sale accounting under ASC 842, Leases ("ASC 842" ). This financing agreement was executed in December 2022 and had a million total original principal amount, original term of months, and implicit interest rate of approximately . The weighted average interest rate on all our financing leases is approximately . 
 
 The Company applies the practical expedient allowed under ASC 842 to exclude leases with a term of 12 months or less from the calculation of our lease liabilities and right-of-use assets. 
 
 In determining the lease liability and corresponding right-of-use asset for each lease, the Company calculated the present value of future lease payments using the interest rate implicit in the lease, when available, or the Company s incremental borrowing rate. The incremental borrowing rate was determined with reference to the interest rate applicable under revolving credit facility discussed in Note 6, Long-Term Debt, as this facility is collateralized by a first lien on substantially all of the assets of the Company and its term is similar to the term of our leases.

Credit Facility 
 
 On March 17, 2021, we entered into the Second Amended and Restated Revolving Credit, Term Loan and Security Agreement (the Credit Agreement ), with PNC Bank, National Association, as administrative agent and co-collateral agent (the Agent ), Bank of America, N.A., as co-collateral agent Bank of America ), the Lenders (as defined in the Credit Agreement) party thereto from time to time and PNC Capital Markets LLC, as sole lead arranger and sole bookrunner. The Credit Agreement provides for a senior secured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed million Revolving Credit Facility and a senior secured term loan facility Term Loan in the amount of million (together with the Revolving Credit Facility, the Facilities ). At September 30, 2024, we maintained approximately, million of remaining availability under the Revolving Credit Facility. 
 
 At September 30, 2024 , we had total Credit Agreement related net deferred financing costs of approximately million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , we amortized approximately million of deferred financing costs, and for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we amortized approximately million. 
 
 The Credit Agreement requires the Company to maintain compliance with all the applicable financial covenants throughout the term of the Credit Agreement. As of September 30, 2024 , we are in compliance with all applicable financial covenants. 
 
 The Facilities, which expire on March 17, 2026 the Expiration Date ), are collateralized by a first lien on substantially all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, except that no real property is collateral under the Facilities other than Company s real property in North Jackson, Ohio. 
 
 Availability under the Credit Agreement is based on eligible accounts receivable and inventory. The Company must maintain undrawn availability under the Credit Agreement of at least million until it maintains a fixed charge coverage ratio ("FCCR") of not less than to 1.0 measured on a rolling two -quarter basis, calculated in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement. The Company achieved its second consecutive quarter of its FCCR greater than 1.1 for the period December 31, 2023 and has since maintained the ratio above the required level. 
 
 The Company is required to pay a commitment fee of based on the daily unused portion of the Revolving Credit Facility. 
 
 With respect to the Term Loan, the Company pays quarterly installments of the principal of approximately million, plus accrued and unpaid interest, on the first day of each fiscal quarter beginning after June 30, 2021. To the extent not previously paid, the Term Loan will become due and payable in full on the Expiration Date. 
 
 A mounts outstanding under the Facilities, at the Company s option, bear interest at the current SOFR rate plus a spread, calculated in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement. Interest under the Credit Agreement is payable monthly. We elected to use the SOFR based rate for the majority of the debt outstanding under the Facilities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , which approximated for commitments under our Revolving Credit Facility and for the Term Loan. 

million aggregate principal amount Leverage Loan due in March 2048, to the Investment Fund. Additionally, PNC New Markets Investment Partners, LLC contributed million to the Investment Fund, and as such, PNC New Markets Investment Partners, LLC is entitled to substantially all tax and other benefits derived from the NMTC. The Investment Fund then contributed the proceeds to a community development entity CDE ). The CDE then loaned the funds, on similar terms, as the Leverage Loan to Dunkirk Specialty Steel, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The CDE loan proceeds are restricted for use on the mid-size bar cell capital project. 
 
 The NMTC is subject to percent recapture for a period of seven years as provided in the Internal Revenue Code. The Company is required to comply with various regulations and contractual provisions that apply to the NMTC arrangement. Non-compliance with applicable requirements could result in projected tax benefits not being realized and, therefore, require the Company to indemnify PNC New Markets Investment Partners, LLC for any loss or recapture of NMTCs related to the financing until the Company s obligation to deliver tax benefits is relieved. The Company does not anticipate any credit recaptures will be required in connection with this arrangement. 
 
 Direct costs incurred in structuring this financing transaction totaled million. Those costs were deferred and amortized over the term of the loans. 
 
 As of December 31, 2023 , the Company recorded million within Other long-term liabilities related to this transaction, which represents the funds contributed to the Investment Fund by PNC New Markets Investment Partners, LLC. The transaction included a put provision whereby the Company could be obligated to repurchase PNC New Markets Investment Partners, LLC s interest in the Investment Fund for . PNC New Markets Investment Partners, LLC exercised the put option in September 2024, and as such sold its interest in the Investment Fund to the Company. Therefore the million liability was extinguished, and the Company recorded a corresponding gain through other (income) expense, net on the Consolidated Statement of Operations in the third quarter. The gain was partly offset by the write-off of the unamortized portion of the deferred costs originally incurred to structure the transaction. 
 
 From inception of the NMTC until the exercise of the put option on September 30, 2024, the Company determined that the Investment Fund and CDE are each a VIE, and that it is the primary beneficiary of each VIE. This conclusion was reached based on the following: 
 The ongoing activities of the VIE, collecting and remitting interest and fees, and NMTC compliance were all considered in the initial design and are not expected to significantly affect economic performance throughout the life of the VIE; 
 
 Contractual arrangements obligate the Company to comply with NMTC rules and regulations and provide various other guarantees to the Investment Fund and CDE; 
 
 PNC New Markets Investment Partners, LLC lacks a material interest in the underlying economics of the project; and 
 
 The Company is obligated to absorb losses of the VIE. 

Upon exercise of the put option, the Company gained control of both the Investment Fund and CDE and they ceased to be VIEs. Because the Company was the primary beneficiary of each entity, and as of September 30, 2024 controls each entity, the entities have been included in the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements in all periods and there is no change in consolidated financial statement presentation. 

and , respectively. In each period, the projected annual ETR differs from the federal statutory rate of primarily due to the impact of research and development credits. State taxes are not a significant component of the rate. 
 
 Discrete items during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 were related to share-based compensation items and totaled approximately million of a benefit and million of expense, respectively. The ETR for each period was and , respectively. 
 
 Discrete items during the three months ended September 30, 2024 were approximately million of a benefit and were not significant during the three months ended September 30, 2023, and the ETR for each period was and respectively. 

million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , respectively. 
 
 The Company recorded an unrealized loss in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) of approximately million and million at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 respectively related to the contracts. 
 
 The Company entered into a forward interest rate swap contract during 2020 to fix the interest rate on a portion of its variable-rate debt from January 1, 2021 to June 30, 2023. The interest rate swap was designated as a cash flow hedge. The notional amount of the contract was million during the first half of 2023 until it matured on June 30, 2023.

 Overview 
 
 We manufacture and market semi-finished and finished specialty steel products, including stainless steel, nickel alloys, tool steel and certain other alloyed steels. Our manufacturing process involves melting, remelting, heat treating, hot and cold rolling, forging, machining and cold drawing of semi-finished and finished specialty steels. Our products are sold to service centers, forgers, rerollers, and original equipment manufacturers. Our customers further process our products for use in a variety of industries, including the aerospace, energy, heavy equipment and general industrial markets. We also perform conversion services on material supplied by our customers. 
 
 On October 17, 2024, we announced that we entered into a definitive Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") and Guarantee by Aperam S.A. in favor of Universal (the "Guarantee Agreement"), pursuant to which we will be acquired by Aperam S.A ("Aperam"), a leader in stainless steel, specialty steel solutions and recycling headquartered in Luxembourg. The transaction was unanimously approved by the boards of directors of both companies and is expected to close in the first quarter of 2025, subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including receipt of regulatory approval and adoption of the Merger Agreement by a majority of all outstanding shares of Universal common stock held by Universal stockholders at a Special Meeting to be scheduled in due course. 
 
 Sales in the third quarter of 2024 were 87.3 million, which is the highest total in Company history, surpassing its record 82.8 million reported last quarter, and 22 higher than the third quarter 2023 total of 71.3 million. Our largest end market, aerospace, totaled 71.3 million, or 82 of total sales. Aerospace and defense applications continue to drive high demand for the Company's premium alloys and finished bar products. Total Company backlog at September 30, 2024, before surcharges applied at the time of shipment, was 260.1 million. 
 
 Sales of premium alloy products, which we define as all vacuum induction melt products, reached a record level of 23.7 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared to 20.7 million in the second quarter of 2024. We expect premium alloy sales to continue to grow for the foreseeable future. 
 
 Our gross margin for the third quarter of 2024 was 22.0 million, or 25.2 of net sales, compared with 25.4 in the second quarter of 2024 and 15.2 in the third quarter of 2023. Our gross margin change compared to last quarter is primarily driven by a fluctuation in product mix, while our sustained improvement compared to last year reflects the impact of our cost improvement initiatives, higher base prices, and greater mix of aerospace market sales. Operating income was 13.2 million and net income of 11.2 million for the quarter, or 1.12 per diluted share.

22.4 

Net sales: 
 Net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2024 increased 16.0 million, or 22.4 , compared to the same period in the prior year. This reflects higher base prices and a higher mix of finished bar, premium, and aerospace products. The increase in our base selling prices applies to substantially all our products, but is highest in our aerospace end market and driven by strong demand. 
 
 Gross margin: 
 As a percent of sales, our gross margin for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was 25.2 compared to 15.2 for the same period in the prior year. The increase includes higher base selling prices and cost improvements. The increase includes higher base selling prices, as our average net sales dollars per shipped ton increased 33 compared with the prior period, and cost reductions resulting from improvement projects and productivity gains. 
 
 Selling, general and administrative expenses: 
 Our selling, general and administrative SG A expenses consist primarily of employee-related costs, which include salaries, payroll taxes and benefit related costs, insurance costs and professional services. SG A expenses increased by 2.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 compared to the same period in the prior year due to 0.6 million in nonrecurring transaction costs, higher insurance costs, and higher accounting and audit fees. 
 
 Interest expense and other financing costs: 
 Interest expense totaled approximately 1.8 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared to 2.1 million in the third quarter of 2023 , driven by lower debt levels and lower market interest rates. 
 
 Other (income) expense, net: 
 Other (income) expense, net for the period ended September 30, 2024 includes a net gain of 2.2 million associated with the milestone reached under the Company's NMTC financing transaction. 
 
 Income taxes: 
 Management estimates the annual effective income tax rate quarterly based on forecasted full year results. Items unrelated to current year ordinary income are recognized entirely in the period identified as a discrete item of tax. The quarterly income tax provision includes tax on ordinary income provided at the most recent estimated annual effective tax rate ETR ), increased or decreased for the tax effect of discrete items. 

For the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023
 , our estimated annual effective tax rates applied to ordinary income were 19.9 and 11.9 , respectively. In both periods, the projected annual ETR differs from the federal statutory rate of 21.0 primarily due to the impact of research and development credits. Discrete items 
 were related to share-based compensation items and the ETR for each period was 18.0 and 13.5 , respectively. 

Net income: 
 For the three months ended September 30, 2024 , the Company earned net income of 11.1 million, or 1.11 per diluted share, compared to a net income of 1.9 million, or 0.20 per diluted share, for the three months ended September 30, 2023 .

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 
 Historically, we have financed our operations through cash provided by operating activities and borrowings on our credit facilities. At September 30, 2024 , we maintained approximately 50.3 million of remaining availability under our revolving credit facility. 
 
 We believe that our cash flows from continuing operations, as well as available borrowings under our credit facility are adequate to satisfy our working capital, capital expenditure requirements, and other contractual obligations for the foreseeable future, including at least the next 12 months. 

Net cash provided by operating activities: 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , our operating activities generated 29.4 million of cash. Our net income, after adjustments for non-cash expenses, generated 43.1 million. We used 16.0 million to grow our managed working capital, which we define as net accounts receivable, plus inventory, minus accounts payable, and generated 2.4 million from other assets and liabilities. 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2023 , our operating activities generated 17.8 million of cash. This includes a use of 4.7 million to grow our managed working capital, which we define as net accounts receivable, plus inventory, minus accounts payable, minus other current liabilities. We generated 4.2 million from our other assets and liabilities. 
 
 Net cash used in investing activities: 
 
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , we used 14.4 million of cash for capital expenditures, compared to 9.7 million for the same period in the prior year. 
 
 Net cash used in financing activities: 
 
 We used 15.4 million of cash in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , primarily to make 14.3 million in net payments on our revolving credit facility and 2.8 million in payments on our term loan and finance leases.

Raw materials 
 
 The cost of raw materials represents approximately 40 to 45 of the cost of products sold in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023 . The major raw materials used in our operations include nickel, molybdenum, vanadium, chromium, iron and carbon scrap. We maintain a sales price surcharge within our product pricing to mitigate the risk of substantial raw material cost fluctuations. Over time, our surcharge will effectively offset changes in raw material costs; however, during a period of rising or falling prices the timing will cause variation between reporting periods. 
 
 Leases 
 
 The Company periodically enters into leases in its normal course of business. At September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 , the leases in effect were primarily related to mobile equipment and other production equipment. The term of our leases is generally 72 months or less, and the leases do not have significant restrictions, covenants, or other nonstandard terms. 
 
 Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recorded at the present value of minimum lease payments. For our operating leases, the assets are included in Other long-term assets on the condensed consolidated balance sheets and are amortized within operating income over the respective lease terms. The long-term component of the lease liability is included in Other long-term liabilities, net, and the current component is included in Other current liabilities. For our finance leases, the assets are included in Property, plant and equipment, net on the condensed consolidated balance sheets and are depreciated over the respective lease terms which range from three to six years. The long-term component of the lease liability is included in Long-term debt and the current component is included in Current portion of long-term debt. 
 
 The Company entered into one new operating lease during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.

Credit Facility 
 
 On March 17, 2021, we entered into the Second Amended and Restated Revolving Credit, Term Loan and Security Agreement (the Credit Agreement ), with PNC Bank, National Association, as administrative agent and co-collateral agent (the Agent ), Bank of America, N.A., as co-collateral agent Bank of America ), the Lenders (as defined in the Credit Agreement) party thereto from time to time and PNC Capital Markets LLC, as sole lead arranger and sole bookrunner. The Credit Agreement provides for a senior secured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed 105.0 million Revolving Credit Facility and a senior secured term loan facility Term Loan in the amount of 15.0 million (together with the Revolving Credit Facility, the Facilities ). 
 
 At September 30, 2024 , we had total Credit Agreement related net deferred financing costs of approximately 0.4 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 , we amortized approximately 0.2 million of deferred financing costs, and for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, we amortized approximately 0.1 million. 
 
 The Credit Agreement requires the Company to maintain compliance with all the applicable financial covenants throughout the term of the Credit Agreement. As of September 30, 2024 , we are in compliance with all applicable financial covenants. 
 
 The Facilities, which expire on March 17, 2026 (the Expiration Date ), are collateralized by a first lien on substantially all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, except that no real property is collateral under the Facilities other than Company s real property in North Jackson, Ohio. 
 
 Availability under the Credit Agreement is based on eligible accounts receivable and inventory. The Company must maintain undrawn availability under the Credit Agreement of at least 11.0 million until it maintains a fixed charge coverage ratio ("FCCR") of not less than 1.1 to 1.0 measured on a rolling two-quarter basis, calculated in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement. The Company achieved its second consecutive quarter of its FCCR greater than 1.1 for the period December 31, 2023 and has since maintained the ratio above the required level. 
 
 The Company is required to pay a commitment fee of 0.25 based on the daily unused portion of the Revolving Credit Facility. 
 
 With respect to the Term Loan, the Company pays quarterly installments of the principal of approximately 0.5 million, plus accrued and unpaid interest, on the first day of each fiscal quarter beginning after June 30, 2021. To the extent not previously paid, the Term Loan will become due and payable in full on the Expiration Date. 
 
 Amounts outstanding under the Facilities, at the Company s option, bear interest at the current SOFR rate plus a spread, calculated in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement. Interest under the Credit Agreement is payable monthly. We elected to use the SOFR based rate for the majority of the debt outstanding under the Facilities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 , which approximated 7.0 for commitments under our Revolving Credit Facility and 7.5 for the Term Loan.

Item 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
 
 The Company has reviewed its market risk and believes there are no significant changes from that disclosed in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 , except as provided in this Form 10-Q in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in Part II. Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 
 Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
 
 The Company s management, including the Company s President and Chief Executive Officer and its Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, the Company s President and Chief Executive Officer and its Vice President and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the fiscal period covered by this quarterly report, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are not effective due to material weaknesses discussed in the Form 10-K as of December 31, 2023 filed in March 2024. 
 
 Our management has taken actions to remediate the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting, which include but are not limited to: 
 - Enhancement of its risk assessment and scoping process; 
 - Expansion of the internal audit team and scope of services; 
 - Enhancement of the design and operation of internal control procedures; 
 - Expanded documentation and evidence retention during its financial reviews; 
 - Additional training to ensure a clear understanding of risk assessment, control execution, and monitoring activities throughout the organization; and 
 - Continuing to expand the available resources at the Company with experience designing and implementing control activities. 
 
 We are committed to these enhancements, and believe they will ultimately remediate the material weaknesses; however, material weaknesses are not considered remediated until the new controls have been operational for a period of time, are tested, and management concludes that these controls are operating effectively. This remediation process may require additional resources and will require time to fully implement and execute. 
 
 During the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024 , there were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting which have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, other than the remediation effort discussed above, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

Part II. OTHER INFORMATION 
 
 Item 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 
 There are no material changes from the legal proceedings disclosed in Item 3. of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Item 1A. RISK FACTORS 
 
 In addition to the other information set forth in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 could materially affect our business, financial conditions or future results. Those risk factors are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results. Except as set forth below, we believe that there have been no material changes in our risk factors from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. 
 
 Risks Related to the Pending Merger 
 
 The pendency of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 The pendency of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the merger of the Company and a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of Aperam with the Company surviving as a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of Aperam (the Merger ), could cause disruptions in and create uncertainty surrounding our business, including affecting our relationships with our existing and future customers, suppliers and employees, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition, regardless of whether the proposed Merger is completed. In particular, we could potentially lose additional important personnel as a result of the departure of employees who decide to pursue other opportunities in light of the Merger. We could also potentially lose additional customers or suppliers, and business relationships with new customers or supplier contracts could be delayed or decreased. In addition, we have allocated, and will continue to allocate, significant management resources towards the completion of the Merger, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations. 
 
 We are subject to restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to the consummation of the Merger as provided in the Merger Agreement, including, among other things, certain restrictions on our ability to acquire other businesses, sell or transfer our assets and amend our organizational documents. These restrictions could result in our inability to respond effectively to competitive pressures, industry developments and future opportunities, retain key employees and may otherwise harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
 
 Because of the risks associated with the Merger, we can provide no assurance that the Merger will close on the terms and conditions we currently anticipate. 
 
 Regulatory approvals may not be received, may take longer than expected, or may impose conditions that are not presently anticipated or that could have an adverse effect on the combined company following the Merger. 
 
 Before the Merger may be completed, various consents, approvals, waiver or non-objections must be obtained from certain governmental authorities. Satisfying the requirements of these governmental authorities may delay the date of completion of the Merger, or one or more of these approvals may not be obtained at all. In addition, these governmental authorities may include conditions or restrictions on the completion of the Merger, or require changes to the terms of the Merger. 
 
 The Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are subject to approval by stockholders of the Company. 
 
 The Merger cannot be completed unless, among other conditions, the Merger Agreement is adopted by the Company s stockholders by the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of the Company s common stock entitled to vote thereon (the Requisite Company Vote ). If the Company s stockholders do not adopt the Merger Agreement by the Requisite Company Vote, the Merger cannot be completed. 
 
 Failure to complete the Merger could negatively impact the stock price of the Company and future businesses and financial results of the Company. 
 
 The Merger Agreement is subject to a number of customary closing conditions, including the receipt of regulatory approvals and the Requisite Company Vote. Conditions to the closing of the Merger may not be fulfilled in a timely manner or at all and, accordingly, the Merger may be delayed or may not be completed. In addition, we and/or Aperam may elect to terminate the Merger Agreement under certain conditions. If the Merger is not completed, the ongoing businesses, financial condition and results of operation of the Company may be adversely affected and market prices of the Company s common stock may decline significantly, particularly to the extent that the current market prices reflect a market assumption that the Merger will be consummated. If the consummation of the Merger is delayed, including by the receipt of a competing acquisition proposal, the Company s business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. 
 
 In addition, the Company has incurred and will incur substantial expenses in connection with the negotiation and completion of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, as well as the costs and expenses of filing, printing and mailing a proxy statement and all filing and other fees paid to the SEC and other regulatory agencies in connection with the Merger. If the Merger is not completed, the Company would have to recognize these expenses without realizing the expected benefits of the Merger. Any of the foregoing, or other risks arising in connection with the failure of or delay in consummating the Merger, including the diversion of management s attention from pursuing other opportunities and the constraints in the Merger Agreement on the ability to make significant changes to the Company s ongoing business during the pendency of the Merger, could have a material adverse effect on the Company s businesses, financial conditions and results of operations. 
 
 Additionally, the Company s business may be adversely impacted by the failure to pursue other beneficial opportunities due to the focus of management on the Merger, without realizing any of the anticipated benefits of completing the Merger. If the Merger Agreement is terminated and the Company s board of directors seeks another merger or business combination, the Company s stockholders cannot be certain that the Company will be able to find a party willing to engage in a transaction on more attractive terms than the proposed Merger. 
 
 The Merger Agreement limits the Company s ability to pursue alternatives to the Merger and may discourage other companies from trying to acquire the Company. 
 
 The Merger Agreement contains no shop covenants that restrict the Company s ability to, directly or indirectly, among other things, initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate, inquiries or proposals with respect to, or, subject to certain exceptions generally related to the exercise of fiduciary duties by the Company s board of directors, engage in any negotiations concerning, or provide any confidential or non-public information or data relating to, any acquisition proposal. These provisions, which include a 14.8 million termination fee payable by the Company under certain circumstances, may discourage a potential third-party acquirer that might have an interest in acquiring all or a significant part of the Company from considering or proposing that acquisition. 
 
 Holders of Company common stock will not have any ownership or voting interest in the combined company after the consummation of the Merger and have no influence over management and the policies of the combined company. 
 
 Stockholders of the Company currently have the right to vote in the election of the board of directors and on other matters affecting the Company. Assuming the Merger is completed, the Company will become a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of Aperam, and each share of the Company s common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effectiveness of the Merger will be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the applicable merger consideration, subject to applicable tax withholdings, whereupon such shares will cease to exist and no longer be outstanding. Upon the effectiveness of the Merger, each holder of the Company s common stock immediately prior to the effectiveness of the Merger will cease to have any rights with respect to such shares. Following the effectiveness of the Merger, the Company s common stock will be delisted from the Nasdaq Global Select Market deregistered under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. Accordingly, holders of the Company s common stock prior to the effectiveness of the Merger will have no ownership or voting interest in the combined company or any influence on the management and policies of the combined company. 
 
 Stockholder litigation could prevent or delay the completion of the Merger or otherwise negatively impact the business and operations of the Company. 
 
 Stockholders of Aperam or the Company may file lawsuits against Aperam, the Company and/or the directors and officers of either company in connection with the Merger. One of the conditions to the closing is that no governmental entity of competent jurisdiction shall have issued any order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that has become final and non-appealable and that restrains, enjoins or otherwise prohibits the consummation of the Merger. If any plaintiff were successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting Aperam or the Company from completing the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, then such injunction may delay or prevent the effectiveness of the Merger and could result in significant costs to the Company, including any cost associated with the indemnification of directors and officers the Company. The Company may incur costs in connection with the defense or settlement of any stockholder lawsuits filed in connection with the Merger. Such litigation could have an adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations of the Company and could prevent or delay the completion of the Merger. 
 
 Item 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 
 
 None. 
 
 Item 3. DEFAULTS UPON SENIOR SECURITIES 
 
 None. 
 
 Item 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES
