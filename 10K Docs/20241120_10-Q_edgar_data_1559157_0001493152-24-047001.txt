at September 30, 2024 compared to at December 31, 2023. 

At
each balance sheet date, the Company evaluates its ending inventory quantities on hand and on order and records a provision for excess
quantities and obsolescence. Among other factors, the Company considers historical demand and forecasted demand in relation to the inventory
on hand, competitiveness of product offerings, market conditions and product life cycles when determining obsolescence and net realizable
value. In addition, the Company considers changes in the market value of components in determining the net realizable value of its inventory.
Provisions are made to reduce excess or obsolete inventories to their estimated net realizable values. Once established, write-downs
are considered permanent adjustments to the cost basis of the excess or obsolete inventories. 

INVENTORY
 PRECIOUS METALS 

Inventories
of precious metals and coins held for investment at September 30, 2024 include of gold and silver bullion and bullion coins
and at December 31, 2023 and are acquired and initially recorded at fair market value. The fair market value of the bullion
and bullion coins is comprised of two components: 1) published market values attributable to the costs of the raw precious metal, and
2) a published premium paid at acquisition of the metal. The premium is attributable to the additional value of the product in its finished
goods form and the market value attributable solely to the premium may be readily determined, as it is published by multiple reputable
sources such as Kitco and Apmex. The Company s inventory is subsequently recorded at fair market values on a quarterly basis. The
fair value of the inventory is determined using pricing and data derived from the markets on which the underlying commodities are traded.
Precious metals commodities inventories are classified in Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy as defined later in this section. The Company
has continuously experienced a shortage of cash and has had significantly past due obligations. While the Company s preference
is to hold the silver and gold bullion to achieve long-term gains, the bullion is available to pay current obligations should the Company
not be able to raise cash through issuance of stock or notes payable. Thus, the Company believes that including the gold and silver bullion
in current assets under inventory is appropriate. 

INVENTORY
 PRECIOUS METALS (CONTINUED) 

The
change in fair value of the precious metals was included in the financial statements herein as recorded on the Company s Statements
of Operations as an unrealized gain in precious metal of for the three months ended September 30, 2024, an unrealized loss of
 for the three months ended September 30, 2023, an unrealized gain of for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and
an unrealized loss in precious metals of for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

Any leasehold improvements are amortized at the lesser of the useful life of the asset or the lease term. 

impairment charges were incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. There can be no assurance, however, that
market conditions will not change or demand for the Company s services will continue, which could result in impairment of long-lived
assets in the future. 

accrued for interest and penalties on each of the Company s balance sheets at September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. 

as of September 30, 2024.
The Company s continuation as a going concern is dependent on its ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to
meet its obligations, which it has not been able to accomplish to date, and /or obtain additional financing from its stockholders and/or
other third parties. Therefore, there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

These
unaudited condensed and consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which implies the Company will
continue is dependent upon financial support from its stockholders, the ability of the Company to obtain necessary equity financing to
continue operations, successfully locating and negotiate with a business entity for the combination of that target company with the Company. 

There
is no assurance that the Company will ever be profitable. The unaudited condensed and consolidated financial statements do not include
any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications
of liabilities that may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

The
Company intends to initiate discussions with an undetermined third party in regards to raising funds through a private placement of equity
which, if it occurs, will provide the Company with funds to expand its operations and likely eliminate the going concern issue.

LITIGATION 

On
August 21, 2020, Boustead Securities, LLC Boustead filed suit against Sunstock, Inc. Sunstock in the
County of Orange, California. Boustead is an investment banking firm engaged by Sunstock on September 19, 2019 to raise equity.
Boustead maintained that Sunstock owed it shares of Preferred Stock Warrants and shares of Common Stock Warrants.
Boustead also sought general damages, interest, and costs of the suit. Sunstock believed that Boustead had not fulfilled its
obligations in raising equity and vigorously contested the suit. Sunstock hired an arbitrator but there was no resolution between

INDEMNITIES
AND GUARANTEES 

The
Company has made certain indemnities and guarantees, under which it may be required to make payments to a guaranteed or indemnified party,
in relation to certain actions or transactions. The Company indemnifies its directors, officers, employees and agents, as permitted under
the laws of the State of Delaware. In connection with its facility leases, the Company has agreed to indemnify its lessors for certain
claims arising from the use of the facilities. The duration of the guarantees and indemnities varies, and is generally tied to the life
of the agreement. These guarantees and indemnities do not provide for any limitation of the maximum potential future payments the Company
could be obligated to make. Historically, the Company has not been obligated nor incurred any payments for these obligations and, therefore,
no liabilities have been recorded for these indemnities and guarantees in the accompanying balance sheets.

ITEM
2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

The
following information should be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed and consolidated financial statements and notes thereto
appearing elsewhere in this report. For additional context with which to understand our financial condition and results of operations,
see the discussion and analysis included in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC on April 3, 2024, as well as the unaudited condensed and consolidated
financial statements and related notes contained therein. 

Forward
Looking Statements 

Certain
statements in this report, including information incorporated by reference, are forward-looking statements within the meaning
of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended. Forward-looking statements reflect current views about future events and financial
performance based on certain assumptions. They include opinions, forecasts, intentions, plans, goals, projections, guidance, expectations,
beliefs or other statements that are not statements of historical fact. Words such as may, should, could, 
 would, expects, plans, believes, anticipates, intends, 
 estimates, approximates, predicts, or projects, or the negative or other variation
of such words, and similar expressions may identify a statement as a forward-looking statement. Any statements that refer to projections
of our future financial performance, our anticipated growth and trends in our business, our goals, strategies, focus and plans, and other
characterizations of future events or circumstances, including statements expressing general optimism about future operating results
and the development of our products, are forward-looking statements. 

Although
forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q reflect the good faith judgment of our management, such statements can
only be based on facts and factors currently known by us. Consequently, forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and
uncertainties and actual results and outcomes may differ materially from the results and outcomes discussed in or anticipated by the
forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences in results and outcomes include, without limitation,
those discussed elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Readers are urged not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking
statements, which speak only as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We file reports with the SEC. You can read and copy
any materials we file with the SEC at the SEC s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, DC 20549. You can obtain
additional information about the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. In addition, the SEC maintains

Going
Concern 

The
Company has not posted operating income and has not generated cash from operations since inception. It has an accumulated deficit of
 65,446,307 as of September 30, 2024. The Company did not generate cash flow from operations for the nine months ended September 30,
2024 and the year ended December 31, 2023. Therefore, there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going
concern. The Company s continuation as a going concern is dependent on its ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations
to meet its obligations, which it has not been able to accomplish to date, and /or obtain additional financing from its stockholders
and/or other third parties. 

These
unaudited condensed and consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which implies the Company will
continue to meet its obligations and continue its operations for the next fiscal year. The continuation of the Company as a going concern
is dependent upon financial support from its stockholders, the ability of the Company to obtain necessary equity financing to continue
operations, successfully locating and negotiate with a business entity for the combination of that target company with the Company. 

There
is no assurance that the Company will ever be profitable. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect
the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that
may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

The
Company intends to initiate discussions with an undetermined third party in regards to raising funds through a private placement of equity
which, if it occurs, will provide the Company with funds to expand its operations and likely eliminate the going concern issue. 

Critical
Accounting Policies 

There
have been no material changes from the critical accounting policies as previously discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 2023. 

Results
of Operations 

Discussion
of the Three Months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 

The
Company generated revenues during the three months ended September 30, 2024 of 2,998,619 as compared to 3,003,336 in revenues posted
for the three months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in revenues is due to less sales days in the three months ended September
30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023. 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, cost of sales were 2,845,117 and 2,971,787, respectively, which decrease was driven
by less sales days in the three months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2023 as disclosed
above. Professional fees increased to 19,539 from 15,353 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Lawsuit
judgment expense was 0 and 77,863 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Other operating expenses increased
to 7,454 from 6,907 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. 

Interest
expense was 1,368 and 1,443 for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Interest expense related party increased

During

months ended September 30, 2023. Such change is primarily related to higher gross profit in 2024, a lawsuit judgment in 2023, and an
unrealized gain on investments in precious metals in 2024 as compared to an unrealized loss in 2023. 

Discussion
of the Nine Months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 

The
Company generated revenues during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 of 6,287,496 as compared to 9,501,467 in revenues posted
for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The decrease in revenues is due to the CEO having surgery early in the first quarter 2024
and not returning to work until April 13, 2024. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, cost of sales were 5,936,622 and 9,389,237, respectively, which decrease was driven
by the CEO being unable to work during most of the first quarter 2024 as disclosed above. Professional fees increased to 117,119 from
 97,634 for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Lawsuit judgment expense was 0 and 77,863 for the three
months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Other operating expenses decreased to 19,689 from 23,388 for the nine months

months ended September 30, 2023. Such change is primarily related to higher gross profit in 2024, a lawsuit judgment in 2023, an unrealized
gain on investments in precious metals in 2024 as compared to an unrealized loss in 2023, and a loss on settlement of related party debt
in 2023.

Changes
in the adjustments to reconcile net income (net loss) for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, consist of

3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

Information

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

The
management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Management
must evaluate its internal controls over financial reporting, as required by Sarbanes-Oxley Act, Section 404 (a). The Company s
internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of the Company s Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the
Company s financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles or GAAP. 

As
of September 30, 2024, management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on
the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting established in the 2013 Internal Control Integrated Framework issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and SEC guidance on conducting such assessments. Based on that
evaluation, they concluded that, during the period covered by this report, such internal controls and procedures were not effective to
detect the inappropriate application of GAAP rules as more fully described below. This was due to deficiencies that existed in the design
or operation of the Company s internal controls over financial reporting that adversely affected its internal controls and that
may be considered to be material weaknesses. 

19 

Material
Weaknesses : 

A
material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is
a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented
or detected on a timely basis. 

The
material weaknesses identified are: 

1.the
Company has an inadequate number of personnel that could accurately and timely record and report the Company s consolidated financial
statements in accordance with US GAAP. 

2.
the Company does not perform formal risk assessments over financial reporting and does not evaluate its internal control processes. 

Notwithstanding
the existence of these material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting, we believe that the financial statements in
this Quarterly on Form 10-Q fairly present, in all material respects, our financial condition in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles (GAAP). Further, we do not believe the material weaknesses identified had an impact on prior financial statements. 

Material
Weaknesses : 

Remediation: 

As
part of our ongoing remedial efforts, we have and will continue to, among other things: 

1.
Increase our efforts to educate both our existing and expanded accounting policy and control organization on the application of the internal
control structure; 

2.
Emphasize with management the importance of our internal control structure; 

3.
Seek outside consulting services where our existing accounting policy and control organization believes the complexity of the existing
exceeds our internal capabilities. 

4.
Plan to implement improved accounting systems. 

We
believe that the foregoing actions will improve our internal control over financial reporting, as well as our disclosure controls and
procedures. When funds permit, we intend to perform such procedures and commit such resources as necessary to continue to allow us to
overcome or mitigate these material weaknesses such that we can make timely and accurate quarterly and annual financial filings until
such time as those material weaknesses are fully addressed and remediated. 

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There
have been no changes in the Company s internal controls over financial reporting during its current fiscal quarter that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, its internal control over financial reporting.

PART
II OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM
1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

On
August 21, 2020, Boustead Securities, LLC Boustead filed suit against Sunstock, Inc. Sunstock in the
County of Orange, California. Boustead is an investment banking firm engaged by Sunstock on September 19, 2019 to raise equity.
Boustead maintained that Sunstock owed it 87,179 shares of Preferred Stock Warrants and 9,231 shares of Common Stock Warrants.
Boustead also sought seeking general damages, interest, and costs of the suit. Sunstock believed that Boustead had not fulfilled its
obligations in raising equity and vigorously contested the suit. Sunstock hired an arbitrator but there was no resolution between
Sunstock and Boustead. The matter went to trial in September 2021 and on November 2, 2021 the Court determined that Sunstock owed
Boustead 260,308 for warrants issued that Sunstock did not honor. 260,308 was accrued and is shown as part of accounts payable and
accrued expenses in the balance sheet. See detail in Note 4 above. The warrants are no longer outstanding. All other monetary claims
by Boustead were dismissed by the Court. The 260,308 is to be paid in cash. The Company filed an appeal of the judgment on December
9, 2021. On August 17, 2023, the Court found that Sunstock owed Boustead 338,171 for damages, attorneys fees and costs.
Sunstock accrued an additional 77,863 in the period ended September 30, 2023 

In
December 2020, a former employee of Sunstock filed a claim with the California Labor Commission regarding claimed back pay owed. A preliminary
hearing was held on January 4, 2021 and the Company is currently awaiting the next step.
